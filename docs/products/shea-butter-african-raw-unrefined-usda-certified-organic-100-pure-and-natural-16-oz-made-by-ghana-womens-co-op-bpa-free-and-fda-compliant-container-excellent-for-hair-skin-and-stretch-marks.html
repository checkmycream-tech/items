            <li>I love this shea butter and will continue to use it on my feet.</li>
            <li>Nice, smooth, no scent.</li>
            <li>this Organic unrefined African Shea butter is the best, because it is more concentrated and dense.</li>
            <li>It can be used straight up and it blends very nicely in creams and lotions.  </li>
            <li>Nice and fresh!  </li>
            <li>and it is not greasy and perfect for flat ironing.</li>

            <li>I love how easily I was able to use this in my hair recipes.  </li>
            <li>I love the packaging - love the BPA free container and the screw top lid.  </li>
            <li>However, I did do a fair bit of research on what constitutes quality shea butter, so I&#x27;m an educated first time user.</li>
            <li>My skin feels healthier and hydrated all day long and have found it does an awesome job on my lips!  </li>
            <li>It is sourced from a local women’s co-op in Ghana to ensure fair wages and ethical treatment....which is awesome!  </li>
            <li>it spreads so easily unlike the one we used to order before, and i love the fact that it is organic and sourced from a women&#x27;s group in Africa.</li>
            <li>I get really dry skin in the winter, so I wanted to find a product that would moisturize my skin, and this does the job wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Shea is awesome for dry, cracked and flaky skin.</li>
            <li>and I found it the perfect thickness for what my dry skin was craving!</li>
            <li>It is pure, good quality product.</li>
            <li>Good, pure product at a competitive price.</li>
            <li>Very good product which deeply moisturizes the skin.</li>
            <li>This item is very good especially if you have blemishes and any marks on your body.</li>
            <li>I like this Shea Butter because it leaves my skin looking healthy and feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>This is great for natural African-American hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for natural hair.</li>
            <li>This is all natural and it works great on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that its in a BPA free jar ( will keep and re-use the jar once product ends) and produced by women&#x27;s co-ops.</li>
            <li>It also works great on your feet, makes them feel as soft as a baby.</li>
            <li>cuz they really smell good...</li>
            <li>received this product complimentary for review purposes; all opinions remain my own.</li>
            <li>Ghana ensuring their fair wages and ethical treatments.  </li>
            <li>It is very smooth, creamy, rich and healing.</li>
            <li>The shea butter melts easily in your hands and it is absorbed nicely.</li>
            <li>You can see my full review here on my website!</li>
            <li>It melts easily on the skin</li>
            <li>and it easily absorbs into your skin.  </li>
            <li>if I can do it then it is easy.</li>
            <li>if I can do it then it is easy.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon for giving me access to such great products.</li>
            <li>Melted easily for my recipes for homemade lotions.</li>
            <li>It dissolves easily in the hands.  </li>
            <li>It melts easily in the hands when rub together.</li>
            <li>but it is very mild and doesn&#x27;t follow you everywhere you go.</li>
            <li>The jar is airtight and can be easily stored away to prolong the use.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter does not rub in easily though</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to melt, but does take some time to work in.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly with Amazon prime.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to scoop out of the container.</li>
            <li>Also the Shea butter was easy to get out of container and put in my homemade whipped shea butter mix I make.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel any strong smell of rosemary.</li>
            <li>This is high quality shea butter at a good price.</li>
            <li>Unrefined Shea Butter is a wonderful item to have on hand for any skin care enthusiast--especially if you want to make your own natural bath and personal care products.</li>
            <li>I warm up the product first before applying.</li>
            <li>It whipped up beautifully with coconut oil and my essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Really great quality and the natural smell is wonderful (at least I think so :) ).</li>
            <li>Some people use it as a leave-in conditioner, but that is not an option for my fine hair (it looks greasy and lifeless if I use it as a leave-in).&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>And it was the best solution for all previous skin problems that we had.</li>
            <li>My hands are smooth and my nails are strong and growing longer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those products you get a certain amount and warm it up with your fingers.</li>
            <li>A very wonderful little company.  </li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell of it, but you can put it on and then use a scent on top of it if you need to.  </li>
            <li>Great product, my entire family uses it for our skin and hair.</li>
            <li>I put it in my window as suggested and it went on smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read several reports on Shea Butter being really great for all of these problems.</li>
            <li>This specific brand is just great.</li>
            <li>great for africian american hair.</li>
            <li>Key West&#x27;s brand is a joy to use on my face.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price. :)</li>
            <li>It does wonders for your skin and makes it feel smooth and hydrated -</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with the Key West Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent that is</li>
            <li>We are confident we will use it for many more natural DIY projects.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and, at the cheap price, decided to take a risk.</li>
            <li>my lotion stayed light.  </li>
            <li>The plastic that they use is BPA free, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about chemicals leeching in to my products.</li>
            <li>I got this one because it supports women&#x27;s co-ops in Ghana, and since this is an important West African resource, we want to be sure we&#x27;re getting it fairly.  </li>
            <li>BPA free container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am a regular shea butter user and often boast about how great it is for hair and skin.  </li>
            <li>It came out fantastic</li>
            <li>After doing a bit of research after receiving my product I learned that there are several great ways to use shea butter.</li>
            <li>I also keep it at my bedside to apply to feet for smooth  heels.</li>
            <li>Shea butter from Key West absolutely great</li>
            <li>I going to take some of the product out and warm, then whip and add my own essential oil scent to customize this for myself.</li>
            <li>Excellent product apply it on my leg because I had a big purple, apply it in the morning and at night for about two weeks straight and blow disappeared without a trace.</li>
            <li>Smooth throughout, soft, good quality.</li>
            <li>Best Product to Have for First Aid and Dry or Chapped Skin ...  </li>
            <li>I love creating my own version of butters and lotions and this works amazingly with other oils and butters.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying again :) !!</li>
            <li>Thank you Key West Health &amp; Beauty for you high quality organic products, and EXCELLENT customer service!</li>
            <li>I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN AND AM ALLERGIC TO MOST PRODUCTS, BUT HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>The service from this company was also top notch and their care for their customers was evident.</li>
            <li>I am also impressed that you took the time to personally email me to see if I not only received the product, but you showed sincere concern as to whether or not I like it and offered suggestions for its use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so excited when the Shea arrived.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m not fond of earthy scents but the benefits of using the African Shea Butter weighs more than its scent</li>
            <li>It works great for lip balm, moisturizing my dry and cracked hands.  </li>
            <li>This one is the best, when melted and churened it became so soft like whipped cream, so white.</li>
            <li>There is not much to say about this shea butter, it&#x27;s absolutely the BEST ever!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different unrefined shea butters, and this is some really nice stuff.</li>
            <li>I have tried several types of Shea Butter and this brand is by FAR THE BEST!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to everybody with not just dry skin, it&#x27;s perfect for all skin types.</li>
            <li>I apply it in the shower, after, right before bed, basically this has removed my stacks for strong pharmaceutical creams.</li>
            <li>It works great for dry winter skin!</li>
            <li>Works great on dry skin!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to report that my skin survived the dry weather!</li>
            <li>Great for this dry winter weather!</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin, the smell is not really nice, but I mix it with some coconut oil, and there I have two of the best humectants in the world working together for my skin.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this product, even straight out of the container.  </li>
            <li>Coincidently my mum just recommended using shea butter on my hair and sent me some straight from Africa :-)</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>container is still almost full</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s manufactured responsibly with no additives.  </li>
            <li>I love Shea Butter and actually my whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>It has a nutty smell, not bad, and you get used to it by time.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for offering high quality products and outstanding customer service!  </li>
            <li>But my skin feels very soft and hydrated after using it, so I&#x27;m happy, and plan to try making a hair conditioner in the near</li>
            <li>First of all, it has a strong scent.</li>
            <li>Very effective at softening rough spots.  </li>
            <li>It melts quickly when I dab my fingers in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>Love that this is a completely chemical free product.</li>
            <li>but when you take and place between your two hands and rub quickly the heat from your hands&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mild smell.</li>
            <li>I also like that I am helping a worthy cottage industry.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my lips and a mild bit on my face as well.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant and using this for stretch marks (and my hair).</li>
            <li>Quickly moisturizes area like the elbow quickly.</li>
            <li>The texture is super creamy</li>
            <li>Natural shea butter is an excellent moisturizer for the face and body and is widely used for hair treatments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy some more when I run out, but it&#x27;s going to last me a while :)</li>
            <li>The fact this shea butter is USDA organic and thus safe and high quality</li>
            <li>I initially experienced a delivery problem through Amazon and the Seller contacted me directly and offered to send a tub to me FREE which was received the NEXT day!  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my Organic Unrefined African Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>Pretty darn fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the consistency of the shea butter from Key West.  </li>
            <li>I must admit the smell of the Butter took  me a little getting used to, but the butter is extremely cost effective and does an awesome job moisturizing your skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely continue to purchase this stuff -- I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>My order was delivered quickly which was nice since the initial email said it would be a week.</li>
            <li>Very high quality with a wonderfully smooth texture and earthy aroma.</li>
            <li>I really like that it is a light color, so</li>
            <li>I heeded that advice and paid a few dollars more but felt more comfortable about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The current price is also an amazing deal....</li>
            <li>A big percent of the ingredients was this shea butter, which is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you from my own personal experience that it does help reduce wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>The socks are essential as your feet will be kind of greasy at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll probably end up using this stuff forever until some classy woman from the 1% - that can afford to know better -  directs me otherwise</li>
            <li>I get this natural glow and many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>My husband who has severely dry and cracked hands in the winter was very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I love how pure and high quality this shea butter is.</li>
            <li>This shea butter is keeping my very dry hands pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, you can make endless recipes with this for tons of good face, body, and hair care items.</li>
            <li>That was going to be a deal-breaker right there.</li>
            <li>The price is just right</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>Very smart to add that to the Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>this product is unrefined, it does have an earthy and distinct odor when first applied.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth and soft enough to take out using your fingers with beautiful off white coloring.</li>
            <li>is a first and a tribute to the quality of your merchandise and concern for your customers&#x27; satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;After such a short time using it, my skin is softer and has a beautiful color/glow, no doubt enhanced by consistent use of the Shea</li>
            <li>It comes in a large 14oz (that is almost a pound!)</li>
            <li>This jar is huge and had it since Nov of 2014 and still have a huge amount left.</li>
            <li>When winter comes on I start looking for an effective moisturizer that will eliminate the dry, itchy skin that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, smells good and has only Shea butter and rosemary extract (as a preservative).</li>
            <li>It is much thicker but it melted quickly when I rubbed it on my feet</li>
            <li>Seems very pure, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have used Shea butter from all many different vendors, however, this is likely the best, hands down!</li>
            <li>Also, very fast shipping</li>
            <li>It is easy to work with and blends nicely with essential oils  (using a double boiler).</li>
            <li>It comes in a big plastic tub with a lid that screws off quick n easy.  </li>
            <li>However, it was super easy to use (I took a small chunk, softened it by rubbing it between my hands and applied it) and it did a great job of remedying the dry skin on my feet.</li>
            <li>This was my first time, but it worked well</li>
            <li>Exactly as described</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Will last me years :)</li>
            <li>This is my first time using &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have been making homemade skin care products for years and have purchased shea butter from many different businesses.  </li>
            <li>, this is my first time</li>
            <li>Most companies sell African Butter, and mark it as Shea.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I received my order!</li>
            <li>I believe the handler was too rough with my package even though it was nicely packed in the box.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very enthused!</li>
            <li>Very well done!</li>
            <li>The color is consistent throughout the container.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>My feet and hands are smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m supporting women&#x27;s co-ops by purchasing this</li>
            <li>I received my first shipment of shea butter with a cracked lid.</li>
            <li>They are definitely looking 100% better than they did</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several brands of shea butter before, and this might be my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I need more than just standard lotion.</li>
            <li>It leaves a smooth and soft layer.</li>
            <li>I received a free container of shea butter for in exchange for an open and honest opinion from Key West Health &amp; Beauty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time customer</li>
            <li>Only thing that would make me feel better about purchasing this product would be if it contained the cure for cancer or world hunger under the lid of the jar.</li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed and very hydrating.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I opened the container was the smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product as I believe this is my final go to for my Shea butter product.</li>
            <li>Definitely ordering more.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to use this long term and know it will help tremendously!</li>
            <li>If you are pregnant I highly recommend you to use it.</li>
            <li>There may be others available for less, but the quality of this product is outstanding.</li>
            <li>The Shea butter has a consistent texture throughout, natural light nutty scent and large quantity for the cost.</li>
            <li>I tried, but couldn&#x27;t find a lid to fit the jar, so I ended up using plastic wrap, and fitting the lid on as tight as I could get it.</li>
            <li>3 hours later and my elbow are still super soft and my heels feel much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has a lovely, soft, natural scent....</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re pressed for time, I&#x27;d save this for one of those days when you really need to relax and treat yourself :) but I&#x27;ve found that a good trick to get past this is to mix it with regular lotion in your hands,</li>
            <li>so you have to warm it up a little with your hands, but that&#x27;s a good thing because it doesn&#x27;t get so messy.</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredient list on this is so short and easy to pronounce, especially when putting it on my baby&#x27;s super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly on my chest and arms and noticed a difference in the damage right away.</li>
            <li>I have been mixing the Shea Butter with Lanolin and am pleased with the consistency and how long it stays on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have whipped up a few body butters of my own, I can most definitely recommend this too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my face, body, and it absorbs quickly, with tremendous moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;results and actually soothes my skin.  </li>
            <li>just a mild soft smell that disappears.  </li>
            <li>Does a really much better job at moisturizing my extremely dry skin (face and body) than anything else I have</li>
            <li>And supporting local women co-ops in Ghana is important to me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dry skin, but I bought this shea butter for its benefits to keep the skin healthy.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t have such a strong scent.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is there is plenty of this Shea Butter and it will last us a long time.</li>
            <li>Pure gold.</li>
            <li>You can tell it is pure shea butter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s organic and pure.</li>
            <li>Advertised as pure Shea butter but has rosemary extract added in.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy again .</li>
            <li>It matters to me that it is USDA organic as many products make loose claims about being organic.</li>
            <li>It is definitely much thicker than any lotions or creams I have used previously, however it softens as you rub it in and goes on quite nicely.</li>
            <li>Simply love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;Stretch marks and dry skin !?</li>
            <li>The Shea Butter is of a VERY high quality.</li>
            <li>I warm a little bit in my hands and apply it&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned when ordering because I had never ordered anything from Amazon before but went ahead because I had heard such great things about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to use just a tiny bit on your cheeks (gives a dewy glow), on lips, and you can even rub a little on your polished nails to really make them shine.  </li>
            <li>but it sure don&#x27;t smell like Rosemary, it smells more like the little pudgy girl with the polyester lined faux denim jacket next to the campfire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lotion which work on my arms and legs doesn&#x27;t really work on my knees and elbows.</li>
            <li>I am not that crafty though occasionally I try).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not that crafty though occasionally I try).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for almost 3 weeks and my eczema is clearing up fast and it has been their for a year.</li>
            <li>I have been very faithful with the butter, but have seen no change at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>delivery was fast also.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>I think I really prefer coconut oil, but this does seem to really stay on well and does not stain your clothes.  </li>
            <li>Really protects your stretching skin from itchiness and stretch marks.</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother and softer but not oily - the shea butter keeps my skin hydrated and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>The sellers are another plus, they send two follow-upemails, which is unusual in this day and age.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy my Shea butter at Whole Body</li>
            <li>I was using Shea butter whole my pregnancy</li>
            <li>Being organic was a big concern of mine and this product filled all the requirements for me to buy it.  </li>
            <li>I really research everything before I buy it</li>
            <li>I used it on my hands and it really locks in the moisture.</li>
            <li>I really like that the product is USDA certified organic.</li>
            <li>This product is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Very personable and eager for your feedback.  </li>
            <li>This product really does the job</li>
            <li>Was very displeased with this product.</li>
            <li>so I know how intense it can get.</li>
            <li>It is very comparable to higher-end</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>After that I&#x27;m ready to moisturize.</li>
            <li>;: but then it&#x27;s still much cheaper than something sold at Sephora -e.g., $45 for 1/2 an ounce.</li>
            <li>It has a light nutty sent that dissipates shortly after application.  </li>
            <li>and I think it is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I actually really like it.</li>
            <li>only wished I had bought something else to put me over the $25 level to qualify for free shipping or even bought two of these.</li>
            <li>My complexion has really cleared up and my skin looks radiant.  </li>
            <li>and it has helped sooo much.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but I just use it straight out of the container.</li>
            <li>pat the spots you want to moisturize, and then rub it in (you absolutely don&#x27;t need lotion in addition to this product</li>
            <li>I really like the shea butter</li>
            <li>I received the Shea butter and am very pleased/satisfied with your product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff...</li>
            <li>VERY MOISTURIZING.  </li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>I noticed if I put the shea butter on my feet each day, they improve and are much softer.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hair, which is very curly, and I apply it immediately after washing and rinsing.  </li>
            <li>I recently started using this to make my own deep conditioning treatments, AND sometimes I use it as a hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is a bit over-powering in smell because of its rawness so you need more essential oil to cover up the natural smell of it7</li>
            <li>It mixed nicely with my mango butter, cocoa butter, coconut oil and essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Smells kind of funky, but that is to be expected with a natural product.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure: this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used shea butter, so technically I don&#x27;t have a basis for comparison.</li>
            <li>I had read some reviews about this African Raw Unrefined Shea Butter and the more I read the more I wanted to try this for myself before winter sets in.  </li>
            <li>I live in the mountains in Southern California and there is zero humidity and the UVs are strong.</li>
            <li>I kept hearing about how great raw African shea butter was</li>
            <li>This shea butter was much better than the other companies I have received it from.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to make future purchases with this seller.</li>
            <li>My hair is long, fine, and wavey.</li>
            <li>and so I normally buy my shea butter wholesale and in large quantities</li>
            <li>I can live with a couple of minutes of that smell for an entire day of smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Some people are surprised when they first use Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>I particularly don&#x27;t like these in my beauty and skin products but again,</li>
            <li>I particularly don&#x27;t like these in my beauty and skin products but again,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will last me until next year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It heals any skin cracks and it makes your vibrant wuthout the oily shine.</li>
            <li>These are my two main uses for the Shea butter.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m growing older</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s a decent product.  </li>
            <li>I definitely like this Key West unrefined shea butter a lot more.</li>
            <li>Once I run out, I will be buying my next batch from Key West for sure.</li>
            <li>The main thing I use it for is as a lip balm.</li>
            <li>I will DEFINITELY  be reordering more from Key West Health &amp; Beauty.</li>
            <li>This product has a weird caky texture; it takes forever to get absorbed into skin, you have to rub it and make it warm first.</li>
            <li>Shea Butter is highly moisturizing and contains a lot of vitamins that may benefit the skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Many other products for sensitive skin still agitates my skin.</li>
            <li>This product is organic and 100% pure and natural.</li>
            <li>After useing this, his skin is little better.</li>
            <li>, you really can beat this one as far as quality and price goes.  </li>
            <li>I was very self conscious using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having lots of fun trying out different combinations</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those are just a few examples of the many uses of Shea butter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those are just a few examples of the many uses of Shea butter.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last long with our family, so we need to order more than one.</li>
            <li>I will be using this product year round to keep my skin healthy, hydrated, and radiant.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>If have dry, wavy, frizzy and puffy hair and the using the African Shea Butter once a week on my hair makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong though and you might smell something else entirely, and it does just smell like regular shea butter once you melt it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using Coconut oil but that didn&#x27;t moisturizer enough and my skin seemed to just suck it right up.</li>
            <li>I use on skin and hair and have had no trouble with any allergic reaction ( which I commonly have with many skin products) or with any dryness!  </li>
            <li>The scent is lovely and not strong at all.</li>
            <li>only I used less olive oil (to keep it more solid) and instead of whipping in the processor, I poured the melted mixture into molds and let them cool.</li>
            <li>only I used less olive oil (to keep it more solid) and instead of whipping in the processor, I poured the melted mixture into molds and let them cool.</li>
            <li>After mentioning this to the seller, they immediately shipped me a new lid.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller with pictures and they promptly mailed out a new one for me.</li>
            <li>if you’re new to Amazon, don’t make that one.</li>
            <li>I just cannot longer live without a jar of sea butter.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that the smell I expected was almond and the smell this product had was most certainly not almond.</li>
            <li>Love this for my skin, it does have a earthly smell to it but as it should for raw Shea butter</li>
            <li>It made my lips feel very soft and smooth and it really lasted, much unlike other chap sticks or lip glosses which I find myself applying multiple times a day.</li>
            <li>but that nobody actually knows what this cheap stuff actually is.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin.  </li>
            <li>my skin is super dry</li>
            <li>Feels very soft on hair and skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very fast with no greasy feeling left.</li>
            <li>when I wake up, my feet are baby soft!</li>
            <li>and I put a small amount of shea butter on my palms, and rubbed them together to soften, and was able to cover both elbows and heels.</li>
            <li>After the first usage, I noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is a lot more glowy and seems more hydrated instead of dull and pale</li>
            <li>It has a more natural smell, which makes sense since it is a raw, unrefined product.</li>
            <li>When you first wear it, feeling a little oily, but absorbed soon.</li>
            <li>I also have old hormonal acne scars, and a couple of new wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The feedback actually goes to a live person not just some inbox at a large corporation.</li>
            <li>It really hydrates my skin, especially during the winter months when my hands get super dry.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lay &#x27;heavy&#x27; on my face and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I like that it is certified organic as opposed to simply called &#x27;organic&#x27; like many other sellers do without any type of real certification which is total shystery bulls</li>
            <li>Pure shea butter is completely different.</li>
            <li>I had a mix of organic shea butter and essential oils that I had been using, and when it ran out, I decided to go pure shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Very solid and when you take some out on a thumb nail it is not creamy, more a solid and very dry seems crumbly....</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase this product again and I highly recommend anyone interested in Shea Butter to purchase it from Key West.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more yellow and hard, but this is much smoother and creamier.  </li>
            <li>It was creamy with few lumps; my hair was richly moisturized and felt very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It has an off-white color and has an earthy and natural scent.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re expecting creamy soft consistency, you&#x27;ll have to put this in a blender and whip some air into it.  </li>
            <li>You really have to scrape it out of the container, but as soon as you start rubbing it between your fingers, it instantly softens and liquifies to a butter consistency.</li>
            <li>I will be a frequent buyer of this unrefined organic Shea butter.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft using it.  </li>
            <li>This is a must for your natural hair care routine.</li>
            <li>I bought this one because it&#x27;s organic and a review said it was soft.</li>
            <li>Super concentrated, nice subtle natural scent (green nuts?).</li>
            <li>, my sister says it smells like some natural herbals, but if it works I don&#x27;t care</li>
            <li>I did a ton of research before finally purchasing, and this seller had everything I was looking for, and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase this again and it seems like I won&#x27;t need to for a while since you don&#x27;t have to use much from a container this size.</li>
            <li>I have used it directly and so far</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin soooooo soft and it feels moisturized hours after I apply it.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for an organic and natural moisturizer try this.</li>
            <li>It seems to me that the rosemary oil is added simply as a natural way to counteract this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural plant product and it feels like Crisco.</li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to dyes, chemicals, fragrance, alcohol etc.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;is vital.  </li>
            <li>just this&lt;br /&gt;wonderful natural shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I used it in my homemade hair conditioning concoction and I was pleasantly surprised by the results.  </li>
            <li>I just wish the consumers could buy directly from a vendor in Africa.</li>
            <li>so far, it&#x27;s helping my heels,  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I put it on after i get out of the shower and my skin is so soft</li>
            <li>It is also well known for its natural healing</li>
            <li>The shea butter is 100% natural, certified $A organic and does not have any added dyes or synthetic ingredients.</li>
            <li>The thickness of the product surprised me too.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>My eight year old daughter has eczema and is always scratching her arms, legs and belly.</li>
            <li>It is solid at room temperature (like coconut oil but even more firm), but melts with body heat.</li>
            <li>, i love how thick it is.  </li>
            <li>I have been suffering from extremely dry skin and this is the first product that has ever helped.  </li>
            <li>The african shea butter works great in moisturizing my knees and elbows and instantly hydrates the dry, round patch in the middle of my knees.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin instantly soft, smooth, and shiny and later, your skin still feels softer than with your average lotion or body butter.</li>
            <li>It has a strong cocoa butter scent, which I&#x27;m not partial to and wasn&#x27;t expecting since I&#x27;ve bought another raw shea butter before</li>
            <li>used the Key West Health &amp; Beauty&#x27;s Organic Unrefined African Shea Butter on my knees and elbows first because they&#x27;re always drier than my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>I just bought some of this because I was out of my usual stuff and needed some quick (go Prime!).    </li>
            <li>was using &amp;#34;Strictly Shea&amp;#34;, which is softer, creamier and has no peculiar smell other than the somehwat peculiar smell Shea has, but they went the American Dream retail social parasite way which all hipster citizens are supposed to fall into knee and knuckle crushing prostration over, pay the tax, pay the shipping fee, pay the highest retail markup conceivable and say &amp;#</li>
            <li>It is stiff with a rich, creamy appearance.</li>
            <li>The opinions expressed are my own.(it doesn&#x27;t need to get too hot) and mix in any other oils you want to include, let it cool slightly then whip in a blender or food processor.</li>
            <li>I had read that unrefined raw African Shea butter was great for Roseacea and dry skin amongst other things.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little bit different, but I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells while pregnant.</li>
            <li>I get these dry flaky patches all over no matter how much I exfoliate or moisturize.</li>
            <li>It has a faint natural scent that is nice and doesn&#x27;t seem to linger.</li>
            <li>Basically, you just melt the shea in a double boiler (it doesn&#x27;t need to get too hot) and mix in any other oils you want to include, let it cool slightly then whip in a blender or food processor.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it is super hard to find REAL Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a slight smell to it, but from my reading, it is right in line with how unrefined shea should smell.</li>
            <li>shea butter has a butter like texture, and my 5 year-old son learnt to apply it directly to his itchy skin, he then message gently as it melts due to body&#x27;s heat.</li>
            <li>whole tub of the African Shea Butter by Key West Health &amp; Beauty will last a long time because I don&#x27;t need much to get a moisturized skin and healthy-looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other lotions, including Mustela Stelatopia (which has the highest rating from the National Eczema Association), but so many out there have petrochemicals.  </li>
            <li>Not pleased about that portion of my purchase but the Shea butter working out fine for my moisturizer with the addition of essential oils to help with the smell.</li>
            <li>Great to keep skin soft and supple in the cold temp&#x27;s of Minnesota!  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to different odors and it is not offensive...</li>
            <li>In fact, I find that there is barely a smell.  </li>
            <li>After RayGun and O&#x27;Bama&#x27;s apparent worship and adoration of him, I have my doubts that &amp;</li>
            <li>I was also pleasantly surprised that I received it by the second day after ordering.</li>
            <li>When the Shea butter arrived the lid was open and nearly off the container.</li>
            <li>This is the only moisturizer I use for myself and my two young boys.</li>
            <li>Usually, Shea Butter has a distinct natural smell.</li>
            <li>And I love the co-op concept  behind  this product.</li>
            <li>It’s not a bad smell, it is just a natural smell, which I expected from a product that is completely organic and raw.  </li>
            <li>Also, this container will go SOOOOOO far because if you use it straight, you just need a little bit.</li>
            <li>i live in Wisconsin and in the winter time my skin gets really dry.  </li>
            <li>I feel the texture of raw shea butter is well worth getting use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually take a small spoon to get some out and rub it between my hands to warm it up.</li>
            <li>The texture can feel a little sticky at first.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few days now, and love the texture, the smell and everything about it, my feet are softer, my skin is starting to look a little clearer.</li>
            <li>It warms up quickly in your hand before application and a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my skin first, and I noticed a difference after a few days (5).  </li>
            <li>This review is for Shea Butter - African Raw Unrefined - USDA Certified Organic - 100% Pure &amp; Natural</li>
            <li>just so you know, it&#x27;s super hard, not creamy.</li>
            <li>I put rosehip oil on my face about a half hour before going to bed, then when I&#x27;m ready to get in bed</li>
            <li>The smell of the shea butter followed me around for a day and half - it was a bit intense, so</li>
            <li>The undereye dark circles is looking much lighter after 2 weeks of regular use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the cool weather that comes in October, but I hate what it does to my skin.</li>
            <li>This is super thick.</li>
            <li>The consistency is very grainy so was difficult to rub into skin at first, but I fixed this by putting it in a glass bowl and putting the glass bowl over a pan of water on the stove to melt it.</li>
            <li>Raw shea butter is solid at room temperature (but it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; to the touch pretty easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>The lid was cracked in two places, and a huge chunk had broken off.</li>

            <li> Nice, smooth, no scent.</li>
            <li> this Organic unrefined African Shea butter is the best, because it is more concentrated and dense.</li>

            <li> I love the packaging - love the BPA free container and the screw top lid.  </li>
            <li> However, I did do a fair bit of research on what constitutes quality shea butter, so I&#x27;m an educated first time user.</li>
            <li> My skin feels healthier and hydrated all day long and have found it does an awesome job on my lips!  </li>
            <li> It is sourced from a local women’s co-op in Ghana to ensure fair wages and ethical treatment....which is awesome!  </li>
            <li> it spreads so easily unlike the one we used to order before, and i love the fact that it is organic and sourced from a women&#x27;s group in Africa.</li>
            <li> I get really dry skin in the winter, so I wanted to find a product that would moisturize my skin, and this does the job wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Shea is awesome for dry, cracked and flaky skin.</li>
            <li> and I found it the perfect thickness for what my dry skin was craving!</li>
            <li> It is pure, good quality product.</li>
            <li> Good, pure product at a competitive price.</li>
            <li> Very good product which deeply moisturizes the skin.</li>
            <li> This item is very good especially if you have blemishes and any marks on your body.</li>
            <li> I like this Shea Butter because it leaves my skin looking healthy and feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> This is great for natural African-American hair.  </li>
            <li> Great for natural hair.</li>
            <li> This is all natural and it works great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that its in a BPA free jar ( will keep and re-use the jar once product ends) and produced by women&#x27;s co-ops.</li>
            <li> It also works great on your feet, makes them feel as soft as a baby.</li>
            <li> cuz they really smell good...</li>
            <li> received this product complimentary for review purposes; all opinions remain my own.</li>
            <li> Ghana ensuring their fair wages and ethical treatments.  </li>
            <li> It is very smooth, creamy, rich and healing.</li>
            <li> The shea butter melts easily in your hands and it is absorbed nicely.</li>
            <li> You can see my full review here on my website!</li>
            <li> It melts easily on the skin</li>
            <li> and it easily absorbs into your skin.  </li>
            <li> if I can do it then it is easy.</li>
            <li> if I can do it then it is easy.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon for giving me access to such great products.</li>
            <li> Melted easily for my recipes for homemade lotions.</li>
            <li> It dissolves easily in the hands.  </li>
            <li> It melts easily in the hands when rub together.</li>
            <li> but it is very mild and doesn&#x27;t follow you everywhere you go.</li>
            <li> The jar is airtight and can be easily stored away to prolong the use.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter does not rub in easily though</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to melt, but does take some time to work in.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly with Amazon prime.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to scoop out of the container.</li>
            <li> Also the Shea butter was easy to get out of container and put in my homemade whipped shea butter mix I make.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel any strong smell of rosemary.</li>
            <li> This is high quality shea butter at a good price.</li>
            <li> Unrefined Shea Butter is a wonderful item to have on hand for any skin care enthusiast--especially if you want to make your own natural bath and personal care products.</li>
            <li> I warm up the product first before applying.</li>
            <li> It whipped up beautifully with coconut oil and my essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Really great quality and the natural smell is wonderful (at least I think so :) ).</li>
            <li> Some people use it as a leave-in conditioner, but that is not an option for my fine hair (it looks greasy and lifeless if I use it as a leave-in).&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> And it was the best solution for all previous skin problems that we had.</li>
            <li> My hands are smooth and my nails are strong and growing longer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those products you get a certain amount and warm it up with your fingers.</li>
            <li> A very wonderful little company.  </li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell of it, but you can put it on and then use a scent on top of it if you need to.  </li>
            <li> Great product, my entire family uses it for our skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I put it in my window as suggested and it went on smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several reports on Shea Butter being really great for all of these problems.</li>
            <li> This specific brand is just great.</li>
            <li> great for africian american hair.</li>
            <li> Key West&#x27;s brand is a joy to use on my face.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price. :)</li>
            <li> It does wonders for your skin and makes it feel smooth and hydrated -</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with the Key West Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent that is</li>
            <li> We are confident we will use it for many more natural DIY projects.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and, at the cheap price, decided to take a risk.</li>
            <li> my lotion stayed light.  </li>
            <li> The plastic that they use is BPA free, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about chemicals leeching in to my products.</li>
            <li> I got this one because it supports women&#x27;s co-ops in Ghana, and since this is an important West African resource, we want to be sure we&#x27;re getting it fairly.  </li>
            <li> BPA free container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am a regular shea butter user and often boast about how great it is for hair and skin.  </li>
            <li> It came out fantastic</li>
            <li> After doing a bit of research after receiving my product I learned that there are several great ways to use shea butter.</li>
            <li> I also keep it at my bedside to apply to feet for smooth  heels.</li>
            <li> Shea butter from Key West absolutely great</li>
            <li> I going to take some of the product out and warm, then whip and add my own essential oil scent to customize this for myself.</li>
            <li> Excellent product apply it on my leg because I had a big purple, apply it in the morning and at night for about two weeks straight and blow disappeared without a trace.</li>
            <li> Smooth throughout, soft, good quality.</li>
            <li> Best Product to Have for First Aid and Dry or Chapped Skin ...  </li>
            <li> I love creating my own version of butters and lotions and this works amazingly with other oils and butters.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying again :) !!</li>
            <li> Thank you Key West Health &amp; Beauty for you high quality organic products, and EXCELLENT customer service!</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN AND AM ALLERGIC TO MOST PRODUCTS, BUT HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> The service from this company was also top notch and their care for their customers was evident.</li>
            <li> I am also impressed that you took the time to personally email me to see if I not only received the product, but you showed sincere concern as to whether or not I like it and offered suggestions for its use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so excited when the Shea arrived.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m not fond of earthy scents but the benefits of using the African Shea Butter weighs more than its scent</li>
            <li> It works great for lip balm, moisturizing my dry and cracked hands.  </li>
            <li> This one is the best, when melted and churened it became so soft like whipped cream, so white.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say about this shea butter, it&#x27;s absolutely the BEST ever!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different unrefined shea butters, and this is some really nice stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried several types of Shea Butter and this brand is by FAR THE BEST!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to everybody with not just dry skin, it&#x27;s perfect for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I apply it in the shower, after, right before bed, basically this has removed my stacks for strong pharmaceutical creams.</li>
            <li> It works great for dry winter skin!</li>
            <li> Works great on dry skin!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to report that my skin survived the dry weather!</li>
            <li> Great for this dry winter weather!</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, the smell is not really nice, but I mix it with some coconut oil, and there I have two of the best humectants in the world working together for my skin.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product, even straight out of the container.  </li>
            <li> Coincidently my mum just recommended using shea butter on my hair and sent me some straight from Africa :-)</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> container is still almost full</li>
            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s manufactured responsibly with no additives.  </li>
            <li> I love Shea Butter and actually my whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> It has a nutty smell, not bad, and you get used to it by time.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for offering high quality products and outstanding customer service!  </li>
            <li> But my skin feels very soft and hydrated after using it, so I&#x27;m happy, and plan to try making a hair conditioner in the near</li>
            <li> First of all, it has a strong scent.</li>
            <li> Very effective at softening rough spots.  </li>
            <li> It melts quickly when I dab my fingers in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> Love that this is a completely chemical free product.</li>
            <li> but when you take and place between your two hands and rub quickly the heat from your hands&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mild smell.</li>
            <li> I also like that I am helping a worthy cottage industry.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my lips and a mild bit on my face as well.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and using this for stretch marks (and my hair).</li>
            <li> Quickly moisturizes area like the elbow quickly.</li>
            <li> The texture is super creamy</li>
            <li> Natural shea butter is an excellent moisturizer for the face and body and is widely used for hair treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy some more when I run out, but it&#x27;s going to last me a while :)</li>
            <li> The fact this shea butter is USDA organic and thus safe and high quality</li>
            <li> I initially experienced a delivery problem through Amazon and the Seller contacted me directly and offered to send a tub to me FREE which was received the NEXT day!  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Organic Unrefined African Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> Pretty darn fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the consistency of the shea butter from Key West.  </li>
            <li> I must admit the smell of the Butter took  me a little getting used to, but the butter is extremely cost effective and does an awesome job moisturizing your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely continue to purchase this stuff -- I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> My order was delivered quickly which was nice since the initial email said it would be a week.</li>
            <li> Very high quality with a wonderfully smooth texture and earthy aroma.</li>
            <li> I really like that it is a light color, so</li>
            <li> I heeded that advice and paid a few dollars more but felt more comfortable about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The current price is also an amazing deal....</li>
            <li> A big percent of the ingredients was this shea butter, which is amazing.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you from my own personal experience that it does help reduce wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> The socks are essential as your feet will be kind of greasy at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll probably end up using this stuff forever until some classy woman from the 1% - that can afford to know better -  directs me otherwise</li>
            <li> I get this natural glow and many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> My husband who has severely dry and cracked hands in the winter was very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love how pure and high quality this shea butter is.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is keeping my very dry hands pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, you can make endless recipes with this for tons of good face, body, and hair care items.</li>
            <li> That was going to be a deal-breaker right there.</li>
            <li> The price is just right</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> Very smart to add that to the Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> this product is unrefined, it does have an earthy and distinct odor when first applied.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth and soft enough to take out using your fingers with beautiful off white coloring.</li>
            <li> is a first and a tribute to the quality of your merchandise and concern for your customers&#x27; satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;After such a short time using it, my skin is softer and has a beautiful color/glow, no doubt enhanced by consistent use of the Shea</li>
            <li> It comes in a large 14oz (that is almost a pound!)</li>
            <li> This jar is huge and had it since Nov of 2014 and still have a huge amount left.</li>
            <li> When winter comes on I start looking for an effective moisturizer that will eliminate the dry, itchy skin that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, smells good and has only Shea butter and rosemary extract (as a preservative).</li>
            <li> It is much thicker but it melted quickly when I rubbed it on my feet</li>
            <li> Seems very pure, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have used Shea butter from all many different vendors, however, this is likely the best, hands down!</li>
            <li> Also, very fast shipping</li>
            <li> It is easy to work with and blends nicely with essential oils  (using a double boiler).</li>
            <li> It comes in a big plastic tub with a lid that screws off quick n easy.  </li>
            <li> However, it was super easy to use (I took a small chunk, softened it by rubbing it between my hands and applied it) and it did a great job of remedying the dry skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> This was my first time, but it worked well</li>
            <li> Exactly as described</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Will last me years :)</li>
            <li> This is my first time using &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been making homemade skin care products for years and have purchased shea butter from many different businesses.  </li>
            <li> , this is my first time</li>
            <li> Most companies sell African Butter, and mark it as Shea.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I received my order!</li>
            <li> I believe the handler was too rough with my package even though it was nicely packed in the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very enthused!</li>
            <li> Very well done!</li>
            <li> The color is consistent throughout the container.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> My feet and hands are smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m supporting women&#x27;s co-ops by purchasing this</li>
            <li> I received my first shipment of shea butter with a cracked lid.</li>
            <li> They are definitely looking 100% better than they did</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several brands of shea butter before, and this might be my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I need more than just standard lotion.</li>
            <li> It leaves a smooth and soft layer.</li>
            <li> I received a free container of shea butter for in exchange for an open and honest opinion from Key West Health &amp; Beauty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time customer</li>
            <li> Only thing that would make me feel better about purchasing this product would be if it contained the cure for cancer or world hunger under the lid of the jar.</li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed and very hydrating.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I opened the container was the smell.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product as I believe this is my final go to for my Shea butter product.</li>
            <li> Definitely ordering more.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to use this long term and know it will help tremendously!</li>
            <li> If you are pregnant I highly recommend you to use it.</li>
            <li> There may be others available for less, but the quality of this product is outstanding.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter has a consistent texture throughout, natural light nutty scent and large quantity for the cost.</li>
            <li> I tried, but couldn&#x27;t find a lid to fit the jar, so I ended up using plastic wrap, and fitting the lid on as tight as I could get it.</li>
            <li> 3 hours later and my elbow are still super soft and my heels feel much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a lovely, soft, natural scent....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re pressed for time, I&#x27;d save this for one of those days when you really need to relax and treat yourself :) but I&#x27;ve found that a good trick to get past this is to mix it with regular lotion in your hands,</li>
            <li> so you have to warm it up a little with your hands, but that&#x27;s a good thing because it doesn&#x27;t get so messy.</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredient list on this is so short and easy to pronounce, especially when putting it on my baby&#x27;s super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly on my chest and arms and noticed a difference in the damage right away.</li>
            <li> I have been mixing the Shea Butter with Lanolin and am pleased with the consistency and how long it stays on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Now that I have whipped up a few body butters of my own, I can most definitely recommend this too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my face, body, and it absorbs quickly, with tremendous moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;results and actually soothes my skin.  </li>
            <li> just a mild soft smell that disappears.  </li>
            <li> Does a really much better job at moisturizing my extremely dry skin (face and body) than anything else I have</li>
            <li> And supporting local women co-ops in Ghana is important to me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dry skin, but I bought this shea butter for its benefits to keep the skin healthy.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t have such a strong scent.  </li>
            <li> The good thing is there is plenty of this Shea Butter and it will last us a long time.</li>
            <li> Pure gold.</li>
            <li> You can tell it is pure shea butter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic and pure.</li>
            <li> Advertised as pure Shea butter but has rosemary extract added in.</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy again .</li>
            <li> It matters to me that it is USDA organic as many products make loose claims about being organic.</li>
            <li> It is definitely much thicker than any lotions or creams I have used previously, however it softens as you rub it in and goes on quite nicely.</li>
            <li> Simply love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;Stretch marks and dry skin !?</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is of a VERY high quality.</li>
            <li> I warm a little bit in my hands and apply it&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned when ordering because I had never ordered anything from Amazon before but went ahead because I had heard such great things about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great to use just a tiny bit on your cheeks (gives a dewy glow), on lips, and you can even rub a little on your polished nails to really make them shine.  </li>
            <li> but it sure don&#x27;t smell like Rosemary, it smells more like the little pudgy girl with the polyester lined faux denim jacket next to the campfire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lotion which work on my arms and legs doesn&#x27;t really work on my knees and elbows.</li>
            <li> I am not that crafty though occasionally I try).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not that crafty though occasionally I try).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for almost 3 weeks and my eczema is clearing up fast and it has been their for a year.</li>
            <li> I have been very faithful with the butter, but have seen no change at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> delivery was fast also.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The real deal.</li>
            <li> I think I really prefer coconut oil, but this does seem to really stay on well and does not stain your clothes.  </li>
            <li> Really protects your stretching skin from itchiness and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother and softer but not oily - the shea butter keeps my skin hydrated and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> The sellers are another plus, they send two follow-upemails, which is unusual in this day and age.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy my Shea butter at Whole Body</li>
            <li> I was using Shea butter whole my pregnancy</li>
            <li> Being organic was a big concern of mine and this product filled all the requirements for me to buy it.  </li>
            <li> I really research everything before I buy it</li>
            <li> I used it on my hands and it really locks in the moisture.</li>
            <li> I really like that the product is USDA certified organic.</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Very personable and eager for your feedback.  </li>
            <li> This product really does the job</li>
            <li> Was very displeased with this product.</li>
            <li> so I know how intense it can get.</li>
            <li> It is very comparable to higher-end</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> After that I&#x27;m ready to moisturize.</li>
            <li> ;: but then it&#x27;s still much cheaper than something sold at Sephora -e.g., $45 for 1/2 an ounce.</li>
            <li> It has a light nutty sent that dissipates shortly after application.  </li>
            <li> and I think it is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I actually really like it.</li>
            <li> only wished I had bought something else to put me over the $25 level to qualify for free shipping or even bought two of these.</li>
            <li> My complexion has really cleared up and my skin looks radiant.  </li>
            <li> and it has helped sooo much.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but I just use it straight out of the container.</li>
            <li> pat the spots you want to moisturize, and then rub it in (you absolutely don&#x27;t need lotion in addition to this product</li>
            <li> I really like the shea butter</li>
            <li> I received the Shea butter and am very pleased/satisfied with your product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff...</li>
            <li> VERY MOISTURIZING.  </li>
            <li> The real deal.</li>
            <li> I noticed if I put the shea butter on my feet each day, they improve and are much softer.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair, which is very curly, and I apply it immediately after washing and rinsing.  </li>
            <li> I recently started using this to make my own deep conditioning treatments, AND sometimes I use it as a hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is a bit over-powering in smell because of its rawness so you need more essential oil to cover up the natural smell of it7</li>
            <li> It mixed nicely with my mango butter, cocoa butter, coconut oil and essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Smells kind of funky, but that is to be expected with a natural product.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used shea butter, so technically I don&#x27;t have a basis for comparison.</li>
            <li> I had read some reviews about this African Raw Unrefined Shea Butter and the more I read the more I wanted to try this for myself before winter sets in.  </li>
            <li> I live in the mountains in Southern California and there is zero humidity and the UVs are strong.</li>
            <li> I kept hearing about how great raw African shea butter was</li>
            <li> This shea butter was much better than the other companies I have received it from.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to make future purchases with this seller.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, fine, and wavey.</li>
            <li> and so I normally buy my shea butter wholesale and in large quantities</li>
            <li> I can live with a couple of minutes of that smell for an entire day of smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Some people are surprised when they first use Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I particularly don&#x27;t like these in my beauty and skin products but again,</li>
            <li> I particularly don&#x27;t like these in my beauty and skin products but again,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it will last me until next year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It heals any skin cracks and it makes your vibrant wuthout the oily shine.</li>
            <li> These are my two main uses for the Shea butter.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m growing older</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s a decent product.  </li>
            <li> I definitely like this Key West unrefined shea butter a lot more.</li>
            <li> Once I run out, I will be buying my next batch from Key West for sure.</li>
            <li> The main thing I use it for is as a lip balm.</li>
            <li> I will DEFINITELY  be reordering more from Key West Health &amp; Beauty.</li>
            <li> This product has a weird caky texture; it takes forever to get absorbed into skin, you have to rub it and make it warm first.</li>
            <li> Shea Butter is highly moisturizing and contains a lot of vitamins that may benefit the skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Many other products for sensitive skin still agitates my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is organic and 100% pure and natural.</li>
            <li> After useing this, his skin is little better.</li>
            <li> , you really can beat this one as far as quality and price goes.  </li>
            <li> I was very self conscious using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having lots of fun trying out different combinations</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those are just a few examples of the many uses of Shea butter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those are just a few examples of the many uses of Shea butter.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long with our family, so we need to order more than one.</li>
            <li> I will be using this product year round to keep my skin healthy, hydrated, and radiant.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> If have dry, wavy, frizzy and puffy hair and the using the African Shea Butter once a week on my hair makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong though and you might smell something else entirely, and it does just smell like regular shea butter once you melt it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Coconut oil but that didn&#x27;t moisturizer enough and my skin seemed to just suck it right up.</li>
            <li> I use on skin and hair and have had no trouble with any allergic reaction ( which I commonly have with many skin products) or with any dryness!  </li>
            <li> The scent is lovely and not strong at all.</li>
            <li> only I used less olive oil (to keep it more solid) and instead of whipping in the processor, I poured the melted mixture into molds and let them cool.</li>
            <li> only I used less olive oil (to keep it more solid) and instead of whipping in the processor, I poured the melted mixture into molds and let them cool.</li>
            <li> After mentioning this to the seller, they immediately shipped me a new lid.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller with pictures and they promptly mailed out a new one for me.</li>
            <li> if you’re new to Amazon, don’t make that one.</li>
            <li> I just cannot longer live without a jar of sea butter.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that the smell I expected was almond and the smell this product had was most certainly not almond.</li>
            <li> Love this for my skin, it does have a earthly smell to it but as it should for raw Shea butter</li>
            <li> It made my lips feel very soft and smooth and it really lasted, much unlike other chap sticks or lip glosses which I find myself applying multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> but that nobody actually knows what this cheap stuff actually is.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin.  </li>
            <li> my skin is super dry</li>
            <li> Feels very soft on hair and skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very fast with no greasy feeling left.</li>
            <li> when I wake up, my feet are baby soft!</li>
            <li> and I put a small amount of shea butter on my palms, and rubbed them together to soften, and was able to cover both elbows and heels.</li>
            <li> After the first usage, I noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is a lot more glowy and seems more hydrated instead of dull and pale</li>
            <li> It has a more natural smell, which makes sense since it is a raw, unrefined product.</li>
            <li> When you first wear it, feeling a little oily, but absorbed soon.</li>
            <li> I also have old hormonal acne scars, and a couple of new wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The feedback actually goes to a live person not just some inbox at a large corporation.</li>
            <li> It really hydrates my skin, especially during the winter months when my hands get super dry.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lay &#x27;heavy&#x27; on my face and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I like that it is certified organic as opposed to simply called &#x27;organic&#x27; like many other sellers do without any type of real certification which is total shystery bulls</li>
            <li> Pure shea butter is completely different.</li>
            <li> I had a mix of organic shea butter and essential oils that I had been using, and when it ran out, I decided to go pure shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Very solid and when you take some out on a thumb nail it is not creamy, more a solid and very dry seems crumbly....</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this product again and I highly recommend anyone interested in Shea Butter to purchase it from Key West.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s more yellow and hard, but this is much smoother and creamier.  </li>
            <li> It was creamy with few lumps; my hair was richly moisturized and felt very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It has an off-white color and has an earthy and natural scent.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting creamy soft consistency, you&#x27;ll have to put this in a blender and whip some air into it.  </li>
            <li> You really have to scrape it out of the container, but as soon as you start rubbing it between your fingers, it instantly softens and liquifies to a butter consistency.</li>
            <li> I will be a frequent buyer of this unrefined organic Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft using it.  </li>
            <li> This is a must for your natural hair care routine.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it&#x27;s organic and a review said it was soft.</li>
            <li> Super concentrated, nice subtle natural scent (green nuts?).</li>
            <li> , my sister says it smells like some natural herbals, but if it works I don&#x27;t care</li>
            <li> I did a ton of research before finally purchasing, and this seller had everything I was looking for, and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase this again and it seems like I won&#x27;t need to for a while since you don&#x27;t have to use much from a container this size.</li>
            <li> I have used it directly and so far</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin soooooo soft and it feels moisturized hours after I apply it.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for an organic and natural moisturizer try this.</li>
            <li> It seems to me that the rosemary oil is added simply as a natural way to counteract this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural plant product and it feels like Crisco.</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to dyes, chemicals, fragrance, alcohol etc.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;is vital.  </li>
            <li> just this&lt;br /&gt;wonderful natural shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I used it in my homemade hair conditioning concoction and I was pleasantly surprised by the results.  </li>
            <li> I just wish the consumers could buy directly from a vendor in Africa.</li>
            <li> so far, it&#x27;s helping my heels,  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I put it on after i get out of the shower and my skin is so soft</li>
            <li> It is also well known for its natural healing</li>
            <li> The shea butter is 100% natural, certified $A organic and does not have any added dyes or synthetic ingredients.</li>
            <li> The thickness of the product surprised me too.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> My eight year old daughter has eczema and is always scratching her arms, legs and belly.</li>
            <li> It is solid at room temperature (like coconut oil but even more firm), but melts with body heat.</li>
            <li> , i love how thick it is.  </li>
            <li> I have been suffering from extremely dry skin and this is the first product that has ever helped.  </li>
            <li> The african shea butter works great in moisturizing my knees and elbows and instantly hydrates the dry, round patch in the middle of my knees.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin instantly soft, smooth, and shiny and later, your skin still feels softer than with your average lotion or body butter.</li>
            <li> It has a strong cocoa butter scent, which I&#x27;m not partial to and wasn&#x27;t expecting since I&#x27;ve bought another raw shea butter before</li>
            <li> used the Key West Health &amp; Beauty&#x27;s Organic Unrefined African Shea Butter on my knees and elbows first because they&#x27;re always drier than my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I just bought some of this because I was out of my usual stuff and needed some quick (go Prime!).    </li>
            <li> was using &amp;#34;Strictly Shea&amp;#34;, which is softer, creamier and has no peculiar smell other than the somehwat peculiar smell Shea has, but they went the American Dream retail social parasite way which all hipster citizens are supposed to fall into knee and knuckle crushing prostration over, pay the tax, pay the shipping fee, pay the highest retail markup conceivable and say &amp;#</li>
            <li> It is stiff with a rich, creamy appearance.</li>
            <li> The opinions expressed are my own.(it doesn&#x27;t need to get too hot) and mix in any other oils you want to include, let it cool slightly then whip in a blender or food processor.</li>
            <li> I had read that unrefined raw African Shea butter was great for Roseacea and dry skin amongst other things.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little bit different, but I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells while pregnant.</li>
            <li> I get these dry flaky patches all over no matter how much I exfoliate or moisturize.</li>
            <li> It has a faint natural scent that is nice and doesn&#x27;t seem to linger.</li>
            <li> Basically, you just melt the shea in a double boiler (it doesn&#x27;t need to get too hot) and mix in any other oils you want to include, let it cool slightly then whip in a blender or food processor.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it is super hard to find REAL Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a slight smell to it, but from my reading, it is right in line with how unrefined shea should smell.</li>
            <li> shea butter has a butter like texture, and my 5 year-old son learnt to apply it directly to his itchy skin, he then message gently as it melts due to body&#x27;s heat.</li>
            <li> whole tub of the African Shea Butter by Key West Health &amp; Beauty will last a long time because I don&#x27;t need much to get a moisturized skin and healthy-looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other lotions, including Mustela Stelatopia (which has the highest rating from the National Eczema Association), but so many out there have petrochemicals.  </li>
            <li> Not pleased about that portion of my purchase but the Shea butter working out fine for my moisturizer with the addition of essential oils to help with the smell.</li>
            <li> Great to keep skin soft and supple in the cold temp&#x27;s of Minnesota!  </li>
            <li> I am sensitive to different odors and it is not offensive...</li>
            <li> In fact, I find that there is barely a smell.  </li>
            <li> After RayGun and O&#x27;Bama&#x27;s apparent worship and adoration of him, I have my doubts that &amp;</li>
            <li> I was also pleasantly surprised that I received it by the second day after ordering.</li>
            <li> When the Shea butter arrived the lid was open and nearly off the container.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer I use for myself and my two young boys.</li>
            <li> Usually, Shea Butter has a distinct natural smell.</li>
            <li> And I love the co-op concept  behind  this product.</li>
            <li> It’s not a bad smell, it is just a natural smell, which I expected from a product that is completely organic and raw.  </li>
            <li> Also, this container will go SOOOOOO far because if you use it straight, you just need a little bit.</li>
            <li> i live in Wisconsin and in the winter time my skin gets really dry.  </li>
            <li> I feel the texture of raw shea butter is well worth getting use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually take a small spoon to get some out and rub it between my hands to warm it up.</li>
            <li> The texture can feel a little sticky at first.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few days now, and love the texture, the smell and everything about it, my feet are softer, my skin is starting to look a little clearer.</li>
            <li> It warms up quickly in your hand before application and a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my skin first, and I noticed a difference after a few days (5).  </li>
            <li> This review is for Shea Butter - African Raw Unrefined - USDA Certified Organic - 100% Pure &amp; Natural</li>
            <li> just so you know, it&#x27;s super hard, not creamy.</li>
            <li> I put rosehip oil on my face about a half hour before going to bed, then when I&#x27;m ready to get in bed</li>
            <li> The smell of the shea butter followed me around for a day and half - it was a bit intense, so</li>
            <li> The undereye dark circles is looking much lighter after 2 weeks of regular use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the cool weather that comes in October, but I hate what it does to my skin.</li>
            <li> This is super thick.</li>
            <li> The consistency is very grainy so was difficult to rub into skin at first, but I fixed this by putting it in a glass bowl and putting the glass bowl over a pan of water on the stove to melt it.</li>
            <li> Raw shea butter is solid at room temperature (but it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; to the touch pretty easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> The lid was cracked in two places, and a huge chunk had broken off.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this to do my naturally curly hair, but I punked out since it was so thick and just used it as a remedy for my winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am a little bummed and will not be using it on my hair which is the main reason I purchased it for.</li>
            <li> It is too hard all by itself in room temperature unless I whip it with whipping machine, but that is how a pure shea butter should be!</li>
            <li> Shea is a common ingredient in many high-quality, upscale beauty products, but those products usually contain a mixture of things including ingredients that are only there to improve the texture.</li>
            <li> Use it for my face and put a couple drops of other natural oils with lavender.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty hard to describe but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> So, this container will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> This jar of Shea Butter will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It also has a little bit of rosemary essential oils for natural preservation.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does have a slight natural smell but that outweighs what this product has done for my condition.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of shea butter product reviews, there seemed to be a lot of people that were unhappy with the quality of the lower priced shea butters and several recommendations to make sure you buy one that is certified organic.</li>
            <li> I have dry, crack heels at the back of my feet.</li>
            <li> Then, don&#x27;t touch your hair, let it dry naturally if possible.</li>
            <li> Absorbs so much faster than others, has a very slight scent, and lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Apparently it is, among other things, an antiseptic.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about the smell based upon comments, but the scent is not bad - at least it doesn&#x27;t bother me when it&#x27;s used as a skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I haven&#x27;t smelled anything bad with this product.  </li>
            <li> It smell bad to me, with a tint of mint kind smell.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is firm, but you can apply it directly as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not soft at all.</li>
            <li> #feet too heavy for my natural hair .</li>
            <li> This company seems to be really be passionate about their products and customer</li>
            <li> The shea butter is just what I was looking for to replace all the moisturizers on the market that are a long list of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I’m not sure if that is normal on Amazon</li>
            <li> When I received the product, I did notice right away that the lid was broken.</li>
            <li> This is slightly softer and creamier than the other brand (yellow) I have tried and the white color does not discolor my white clothes.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight nutty scent which I barely notice.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not confident that it&#x27;s truly unrefined as the texture is simply much creamier and richer than other unrefined sheas I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> Key West Shea Butter is extremely moisturizing and it seeps into your skin, so it moisturizes for a long time.</li>
            <li> You can add essential oils or other skin oils like jojoba which I did.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face so moist all day long!</li>
            <li> I use shea butter from other sellers but this one does not feel or smell the same.</li>
            <li> and I still feel like I could ride down a slide at lightening speed (you will grease things you lean on); and it will look different than the picture of the open container if the weather melts it at all; mine looked like it was roughly packed</li>
            <li> In the winter, my husband loves to use it on the dry skin on his knuckles.</li>
            <li> it repairs my dry and damaged skin I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> No itchy dry</li>
            <li> but my dry patchy skin would always return.</li>
            <li> My legs will get ashy dry and this helps with that also.  </li>
            <li> and now I can go get that pedicure I&#x27;ve been putting off while trying to find a product for my dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Goodbye dry skin, goodbye cracked hands, goodbye</li>
            <li> My heels, ankles, knees and elbows all become dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I also like to rub it all over my hands when they feel a bit dry.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is heavy so many folks shy away from using it on the face</li>
            <li> I use it everyday mixed with coconut oil and essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I made a whipped body butter using only their African Shea Butter &amp; a few oils.</li>
            <li> Compared to the actual African Shea butter in AFRICA that they make raw, the smell is way milder.</li>
            <li> I am a Canadian spending the winter in the desert and my skin is suffering from the dry climate!</li>
            <li> My legs get so dry they start to hurt!</li>
            <li> my skin was so dry and rough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had VERY dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin</li>
            <li> but he has very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin so oily doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several Shea butters that end up less than what I expected.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it seems to bother the edges of my lips by making them extremely dry if I try to use as a lip balm, but I have the same problem with lots of lip care products.  </li>
            <li> and it is extremely moisturizing even through the dry winter.</li>
            <li> (I did not want a product that was soft, pliable or, hard).</li>
            <li> Really not what I wanted but works well</li>
            <li> There is no perfume or additives so there is absolutely No Burning or discomfort</li>
            <li> It transforms into an oil, which sinks into my skin when I rub it in, and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> and now I need to be careful about the ingredients in my creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> I always have cracked heels and rough elbows and by putting this on every night, it has done wonders for me.</li>
            <li> My hands get rough and my fingertips crack.  </li>
            <li> I can already see a big difference in my skin just after a few times using it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected</li>
            <li> and it will eventually get used to make chapstick or something, but its not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It does take a little extra effort to get it to absorb into my skin, since I haven&#x27;t yet tried the recipes mixing it with other products, so it&#x27;s not thinned out at all.</li>
            <li> You use such a small amount and it lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> My knees have a round, dark patch in the middle which has very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Usually I put other stuff on and 30 minutes later its soaked into my skin and they start getting dry again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certified organic (the only regulated term in the US), it&#x27;s raw and</li>
            <li> West African Shea Butter is shea butter that is in its raw (or unrefined) state.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair less puffy by weighing it down a bit, but not to the point of having flat, limpless hair.</li>
            <li> &gt; Not much of a fan of the smell but the way the product last on your skin without feeling greasy got me past that.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be dry, especially in winter, so I&#x27;m thrilled to find something what helped me to overcome this nasty dryness.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this butter.</li>
            <li> Some things help a little, but not completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoother and softer than other shea butter I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shea butter</li>
            <li> I will try from other sellers</li>
            <li> For I saw no where it said there were other ingredients in the organic butter.</li>
            <li> I mix with coconut oil and other products to add to my hair as moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> So applying this to my beard makes me feel like I&#x27;m at a camp fire burning &amp;#34;pisswood&amp;#34; and then applying it to my sirloins wondering if it&#x27;s pig fat merged with some other USDA organic gelatinous mass.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> need for me to have any other face cream or body creams;</li>
            <li> I am sold on Shea butter and will toss all those other drug store products I have tried over the years.  </li>
            <li> However the price is extravagant for what you can find from other retailers and wholesalers (not here on Amazon).</li>
            <li> have only tried processed shea butter in the past.</li>
            <li> I used it on my body and it&#x27;s extremely hydrating.</li>
            <li> We have spend tons of money on prescriptions and other products that did not work as well as this product.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and put a little shea butter on my scalp and ends once my hair was dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unrefined, so it does have an odor, but it is less than other brands that I have used.  </li>
            <li> The butter itself is very solid, but not rock hard.  </li>
            <li> By the third time using it, I hardly even noticed those undertones.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> my only complaint is there not being a safety seal under the lid.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of sun damage from those years of being a silly young sun-worshipper and was looking for a product that might not reduce the damage, but at least soften the skin to keep it from looking like an old saddle.</li>
            <li> A small amount of this shea butter goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I only use it at night because it is too thick to wear make-up over.</li>
            <li> I used this shea butter a  base for my body butter adding my favorite oils.  </li>
            <li> It is thick when mixed</li>
            <li> Secondly, the consistency is thick.</li>
            <li> I went searching for a product that was not full of chemicals as I am very careful about what I put into my body.</li>
            <li> Just remember,  a small amount goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A few simple suggestions: get a bamboo or wooden small spatula to scrap it out of the container with,it is hard and not easy to take out of this container without some &#x27;scrapper;&#x27;</li>
            <li> It is in a hard solid form and you just dip your fingers into the jar and a little bit comes off on your fingers.</li>
            <li> There were a few other sellers that claimed to be organic</li>
            <li> I searched all over to ensure I was getting the creamy raw shea butter that I expected.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is less oily in the morning after using this at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, since I&#x27;ve never tried raw shea butter before.</li>
            <li> In other words, I&#x27;m a mess!</li>
            <li> No more rough soles and bottoms of my feet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure whether I am stating the obvious, but I do want to warn it is not suitable for people with nut allergies since it is made from a nut.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to determine if this product is unrefined or raw because I have used Shea Butter from different vendors and there is no one standard to compare Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I received my tub in order to provide a review of it and, as someone who has tried other brands in the past</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that little ingredient, that you&#x27;ve added in and conveniently not mentioned on the selling page</li>
            <li> I also use a small amount in my hair and I no longer need and other hair products.</li>
            <li> Use a little rub between your hands and then apply by squeezing your hair with your butter coated hands.</li>
            <li> Once I received it and opened the container I initially thought it was going to be tough getting it out</li>
            <li> No fragrance unlike other Shea butters!!  </li>
            <li> A lot of these hydrocortisone did the job for a few days or maybe even a few hours</li>
            <li> but I went by for a few weeks and found they were sold out each time.</li>
            <li> A few days after the emails the company then called my home, again to ask me about my satisfaction with the product but also to get me to sign up for what sounded like a membership to their site.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday around my eyes and mouth...</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as firm as I was expecting</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I first tried it out, the smell was something along the lines of hickory/bbq chips if that makes any sense, which is probably the rosemary oil that is added so it doesn&#x27;t go bad.</li>
            <li> I will give it a try in some of products and see if that subtle rosemary  scent can be blended with the other scents.....to be continued...</li>
            <li> but this stuff is raw</li>
            <li> i never had raw shea butter before-</li>
            <li> 100% raw, unrefined shea butter CAN go rancid.  </li>
            <li> used this, along with organic raw cocoa butter and beeswax to make shower lotion bars.  </li>
            <li> I ordered some organic raw shea butter for a blended face cream recipe I discovered.</li>
            <li> A little hard when trying to get it out of tub</li>
            <li> something between burnt and very over powering and just bad ..</li>
            <li> and it is supposed to minimize stretch marks which to me are the same as vertical wrinkles on the neck which I unfortunately have.  </li>
            <li> I get a small amount out place on my hand or leg where I want to apply then rub into skin.</li>
            <li> but I learned that a small bit does not hurt at all.</li>
            <li> They are USDA Certified Organic (not many companies are).</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a cream instead of a hard product like this.  </li>
            <li> It is hard</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait to use it in my homemade soap.</li>
            <li> a lip balm--it is a common ingredient in lip balms</li>
            <li> a lip balm--it is a common ingredient in lip balms</li>
            <li> and I have used it at least a dozen times.</li>
            <li> Her skin is softer and the eczema is slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> I was critical of this because I have bought raw shea before &amp; was seriously disappointed in the quality &amp; even suspected a bit of danger in the product.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> My feet get so dry during winter months because I&#x27;m cold nurtured</li>
            <li> I will say that this is serious stuff.</li>
            <li> It does not have a bad smell, but it is also not like the commercial lotions and creams I am used to using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen others recommend using it as a moisturizer and even diaper cream for babies - with a newborn, I am planning to try it out to help protect my baby&#x27;s delicate skin!</li>
            <li> and now I have all-natural unscented bath melts that moisturize my skin without adding any unnecessary ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base for essential oils.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face as a base for oils such as tea tree oil, and it hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores or had any adverse effects--even though I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is the number one secret of beauty skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Shea Butters and have been disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;m a poor hapless schmuck from the Proletariat</li>
            <li> After browsing sellers and reading some scary reviews I was a bit nervous about ordering shea butter on this site.</li>
            <li> The last unrefined shea butter that I purchased had an awful smell that did not diminish with time.  </li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> And due to this he scratches some nights, the times he does he wakes with horrible scratches that sometimes have made him cry.</li>
            <li> I was a bit unhappy</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my children since the weather is changing (cold weather).</li>
            <li> Plus, while Shea Butter does have a smell, this brand&#x27;s smell is very faint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, I hate to give bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve brought cheaper Shea Butter that doesn&#x27;t have that and one of Shea Butter came to me bad.  </li>
            <li> Once you try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed....</li>
            <li> uh I just hate the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I will not be repurchasing since I hate the smell</li>
            <li> and some are downright awful.  </li>
            <li> oh boy was it the worst purchase.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible</li>
            <li> maybe it won&#x27;t have this awful scent</li>
            <li> , they look awful without some pampering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I received the Key West Health &amp; Beauty Organic Unrefined African Shea Butter in a white plastic jar. It has an off-white color and has an earthy and natural scent. I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m not fond of earthy scents but the benefits of using the African Shea Butter weighs more than its scent so I use it. Since it&#x27;s cooler, and this only my thought, the shea butter has a solid, waxy form. It melts quickly when I dab my fingers in a circular motion. When melted, it has an oily, greasy texture. Again, I&#x27;m not fond of products which has a greasy feel but the benefit I get from using the shea butter outweighs the greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Key West Health &amp; Beauty&#x27;s Organic Unrefined African Shea Butter on my knees and elbows first because they&#x27;re always drier than my arms and legs. My knees have a round, dark patch in the middle which has very dry skin.  The lotion which work on my arms and legs doesn&#x27;t really work on my knees and elbows. The african shea butter works great in moisturizing my knees and elbows and instantly hydrates the dry, round patch in the middle of my knees. The greasy feeling and shiny look fades in about 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the Key West Health &amp; Beauty&#x27;s Organic Unrefined African Shea Butter on my hair. If have dry, wavy, frizzy and puffy hair and the using the African Shea Butter once a week on my hair makes it more manageable. It makes my hair less puffy by weighing it down a bit, but not to the point of having flat, limpless hair. It also makes my hair shiny and softer. I use it as a hair treatment mask. I apply it 20 minutes before I take a bath and then rinse it off with shampoo. I don&#x27;t need conditioner after since the shea butter works like a deep conditioner already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One whole tub of the African Shea Butter by Key West Health &amp; Beauty will last a long time because I don&#x27;t need much to get a moisturized skin and healthy-looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve said, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about the shea butter is the earthy scent and the greasy feel. I particularly don&#x27;t like these in my beauty and skin products but again, as I&#x27;ve said, the benefits I get from the African Shea butter outweighs the scent and the greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a sample in exchange for an honest review.s the earthy scent and the greasy feel.

            <li> So I&#x27;m really happy with this shea butter, the container is great for storage and you get a shitload of it for only 15 bucks!&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried it out, the smell was something along the lines of hickory/bbq chips if that makes any sense, which is probably the rosemary oil that is added so it doesn&#x27;t go bad. It&#x27;s not too strong though and you might smell something else entirely, and it does just smell like regular shea butter once you melt it. The consistency is very grainy so was difficult to rub into skin at first, but I fixed this by putting it in a glass bowl and putting the glass bowl over a pan of water on the stove to melt it. You can add essential oils or other skin oils like jojoba which I did. I&#x27;m having lots of fun trying out different combinations and I&#x27;m sure it will last me until next year.&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy L&#x27;Occitane shea butter for three times the price but this stuff is raw so you get more of the benefits! I&#x27;m switching over!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product, even straight out of the container.  It works great for lip balm, moisturizing my dry and cracked hands.  I&#x27;ve used it in place of diaper cream (cloth diaper safe!).  I love the concept of being able to use shea butter in recipes to make my own moisturizing products... I&#x27;m all for using things with simple ingredients that I can pronounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros?  It&#x27;s certified organic (the only regulated term in the US), it&#x27;s raw and unrefined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons? If you&#x27;re expecting creamy soft consistency, you&#x27;ll have to put this in a blender and whip some air into it.  Raw shea butter is solid at room temperature (but it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; to the touch pretty easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this product gratis in exchange for an honest opinion and review.</li>
            <li> It works great on hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried probably 5-6 different shea butters over the years...some are better than others...and some are downright awful.  Key West Health &amp; Beauty is the best I have tried.  I love the packaging - love the BPA free container and the screw top lid.  The butter itself is very solid, but not rock hard.  It melts easily on the skin and I love slathering it on my feet, putting on socks, and going to sleep...when I wake up, my feet are baby soft! It&#x27;s also great to use just a tiny bit on your cheeks (gives a dewy glow), on lips, and you can even rub a little on your polished nails to really make them shine.  I use shea butter in handmade soaps and this one works wonderfully for that as well.  I received my tub in order to provide a review of it and, as someone who has tried other brands in the past, you really can beat this one as far as quality and price goes.  With their 100% satisfaction guarantee, you lose nothing by trying it!!</li>
            <li> Shea butter is gold. Pure gold. Whenever shea butter is in a cream, lipgloss, hair item, etc, I know I’m in for a treat. It’s incredibly moisturizing, good for your skin, and ORGANIC. Also, this container will go SOOOOOO far because if you use it straight, you just need a little bit. Otherwise, you can make endless recipes with this for tons of good face, body, and hair care items. This is super thick. You really have to scrape it out of the container, but as soon as you start rubbing it between your fingers, it instantly softens and liquifies to a butter consistency. It makes your skin instantly soft, smooth, and shiny and later, your skin still feels softer than with your average lotion or body butter.</li>
            <li> I received one jar of Key West Organic Unrefined African Shea Butter to review!  I&#x27;ve been using shea butter for some time and I can tell you from my own personal experience that it does help reduce wrinkles.  I put rosehip oil on my face about a half hour before going to bed, then when I&#x27;m ready to get in bed I put the Shea butter all over my face and neck.  I&#x27;ve seen great improvements in my skin.  It has reduced my wrinkles, blemishes and given my skin a healthy glow!  The Shea Butter is firm, but you can apply it directly as a moisturizer.  It&#x27;ll melt, once it comes into contact with your skin and it easily absorbs into your skin.  I just put some into my palms and rub them together, until it melts, then apply it.  I would highly recommend Organic Shea Butter, it&#x27;s one of the most awesome moisturizers I have ever used!</li>
            <li> The butter made my hand dryer and my skin so itchy. 😡what&#x27;s the best real Shea butter please help.</li>
            <li> It is pure, good quality product. The shea butter melts easily in your hands and it is absorbed nicely. It heals any skin cracks and it makes your vibrant wuthout the oily shine. It is simply an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, since I&#x27;ve never tried raw shea butter before. However, it was super easy to use (I took a small chunk, softened it by rubbing it between my hands and applied it) and it did a great job of remedying the dry skin on my feet. On top of that - it smells pleasant and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Try it with cocoa butter, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Unrefined Shea Butter is a wonderful item to have on hand for any skin care enthusiast--especially if you want to make your own natural bath and personal care products. Shea Butter is highly moisturizing and contains a lot of vitamins that may benefit the skin.  I like that Key West&#x27;s shea is certified organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure whether I am stating the obvious, but I do want to warn it is not suitable for people with nut allergies since it is made from a nut. Keep that in mind if you decide to use shea butter to make homemade bath products to give as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this shea butter to make home made bath melts. This was my first time, but it worked well and now I have all-natural unscented bath melts that moisturize my skin without adding any unnecessary ingredients. Some people are surprised when they first use Shea Butter. It is solid at room temperature (like coconut oil but even more firm), but melts with body heat. The texture can feel a little sticky at first. Shea is a common ingredient in many high-quality, upscale beauty products, but those products usually contain a mixture of things including ingredients that are only there to improve the texture. I feel the texture of raw shea butter is well worth getting use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My top uses for Shea Butter:&lt;br /&gt;1--As a foot moisturizer: I apply shea to my feet then put on a pair of cotton socks. This is especially effective after a shower and using a pumice stone. The socks are essential as your feet will be kind of greasy at first.&lt;br /&gt;2--As a deep conditioning hair treatment: apply warmed shea to hair and massage into it, wrap hair with a towel or shower cap. Leave for 10-20 minutes then wash and rinse. Some people use it as a leave-in conditioner, but that is not an option for my fine hair (it looks greasy and lifeless if I use it as a leave-in).&lt;br /&gt;3--To make whipped body butter: I posted a tutorial on my blog (link in my profile). Basically, you just melt the shea in a double boiler (it doesn&#x27;t need to get too hot) and mix in any other oils you want to include, let it cool slightly then whip in a blender or food processor. I mixed mine with coconut and olive oils and added a tiny amount of almond extract to give it a scent.&lt;br /&gt;4--As a lip balm--it is a common ingredient in lip balms&lt;br /&gt;5--To make bath melts: I also posted about this. The method is similar to the whipped butter only I used less olive oil (to keep it more solid) and instead of whipping in the processor, I poured the melted mixture into molds and let them cool. This was even easier than the body butter! (I posted a picture collage that shows most of the process in making these, if I can do it then it is easy. I am not that crafty though occasionally I try).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are just a few examples of the many uses of Shea butter. I also think it would be great for soap makers, but I haven&#x27;t made soap yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample from Key West Beauty to test and to review. The opinions expressed are my own.(it doesn&#x27;t need to get too hot) and mix in any other oils you want to include, let it cool slightly then whip in a blender or food processor.

            <li> Not for me.  I didn&#x27;t pay attention before purchasing this item.  I would have preferred a cream instead of a hard product like this.  The smell is not the best either.  My fault for not reading!  Never assume anything.</li>
            <li> I like this Shea Butter because it leaves my skin looking healthy and feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> love the product and the customer service and arrival time of this were great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product . The undereye dark circles is looking much lighter after 2 weeks of regular use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product arrived promptly. I am a Canadian spending the winter in the desert and my skin is suffering from the dry climate! I went searching for a product that was not full of chemicals as I am very careful about what I put into my body. Love that this is a completely chemical free product. It&#x27;s has a lovely, soft, natural scent....just like nuts would smell. But not overpowering like peanut or almond butter. It&#x27;s rich, easy to use and works great! I am very pleased with this product and will continue to order it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff and no smell.  Exactly as described</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter.  It really hydrates my skin, especially during the winter months when my hands get super dry.  It&#x27;s smoother and softer than other shea butter I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is keeping my very dry hands pretty good.  I still can&#x27;t seem to get them to &amp;#34;norm&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;m happy with this shea butter.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> love it love it love it !! it spreads so easily unlike the one we used to order before, and i love the fact that it is organic and sourced from a women&#x27;s group in Africa. will order more.</li>
            <li> Great texture!  Creamier than the last brand I used.  In the winter, my husband loves to use it on the dry skin on his knuckles.</li>
            <li> This product is the best quality shea I have seen and used.</li>
            <li> I will buy again. I&#x27;ve used it for almost 3 weeks and my eczema is clearing up fast and it has been their for a year. And I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is a lot more glowy and seems more hydrated instead of dull and pale</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I started using Shea Butter on my hands because of them being chapped, and on my nails for the weakness and splitting. My hands are smooth and my nails are strong and growing longer.  I talked to my family how I love this product, now my family uses Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Hands-down the best Shea Butter I have used!  This is slightly softer and creamier than the other brand (yellow) I have tried and the white color does not discolor my white clothes.  Just a smidgen of this blended with my daily moisturizer keeps my skin supple and luminous.  I initially experienced a delivery problem through Amazon and the Seller contacted me directly and offered to send a tub to me FREE which was received the NEXT day!  Will definitely continue to purchase this stuff -- I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Excellent!  I have tried several shea butter products and this is the best.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells wonderful and lasts forever.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> best stuff on earth! Love it.</li>
            <li> Not creamy. And smells</li>
            <li> This Shea butter broke my skin out, try at your own risk</li>
            <li> I rubbed in on everywhere....my skin was so dry and rough.  Even my husband has already noticed the difference!  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for me.. I purchased  this product during the winter. I use it all over from my head to my toes.&lt;br /&gt;I like the seal USDA..</li>
            <li> I am Mae Skubiz who ordered it.  I have had it for a while now and it is supposed to minimize stretch marks which to me are the same as vertical wrinkles on the neck which I unfortunately have.  I have been very faithful with the butter, but have seen no change at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mae Skubiz</li>
            <li> Good, pure product at a competitive price.</li>
            <li> Smooth, smooth ,smooth...melts real easy thats a hugh plus .Smells real nice best I have ever used bar none. And I have tried many over the years...</li>
            <li> Love, Love this product!  Very solid and when you take some out on a thumb nail it is not creamy, more a solid and very dry seems crumbly....but when you take and place between your two hands and rub quickly the heat from your hands&lt;br /&gt; dissolves it  into a liquid and can be rubbed on skin. I am sensitive to different odors and it is not offensive...just a mild soft smell that disappears.  I will be a frequent buyer of this unrefined organic Shea butter.  Great to keep skin soft and supple in the cold temp&#x27;s of Minnesota!  Works great on bottom of feet, hands....just very happy with this purchase.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had bought the $5 dollar shea butter tub from the African vendors around my area...boy oh boy was it the worst purchase. After doing my research I found that not only the  $5 &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34;  is the mock butter labeled as shea but that nobody actually knows what this cheap stuff actually is. I went back to researching and decided that buying usda certified would be the best option even if it was costly. Once I ordered the key West butter and my package came You guys I immediately  felt smelt the difference!!! I love this a little goes a long way..delivery was fast also. Definitely recommend and definitely will buy again.!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for a good product! Works well on skin and hair to soften and protect.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it to heal some poison ivy rash and will try it on stretch marks next.&lt;br /&gt;If it repairs my dry and damaged skin I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;sure I will order again.</li>
            <li> Great service and product. Thanks</li>
            <li> When winter comes on I start looking for an effective moisturizer that will eliminate the dry, itchy skin that comes with it.  This product is just what I needed. I have been using it for 3 weeks and have already seen results.  I especially like the fact that it is unrefined and organic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to drier and hurt</li>
            <li> This is a great shea butter and great company! I recieved a call after purchasing to see how I liked it even.  I highly recommend. I use it as a base for essential oils. I make my own face cream and it is extremely moisturizing even through the dry winter. I only use it at night because it is too thick to wear make-up over.</li>
            <li> This is great for natural African-American hair.  I&#x27;ve tried other shea butter that&#x27;s more yellow and hard, but this is much smoother and creamier.  My hair has never felt so soft using it.  This is a must for your natural hair care routine.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this to do my naturally curly hair, but I punked out since it was so thick and just used it as a remedy for my winter dry skin. It works great for dry winter skin! I recently started using this to make my own deep conditioning treatments, AND sometimes I use it as a hair moisturizer. This is great all around!</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it&#x27;s organic and a review said it was soft. It&#x27;s not soft at all. I am using it but it&#x27;s not the constancy i was hoping for. I&#x27;m sorry, I hate to give bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Love this products. Great on my hair and body. Feels very soft on hair and skin. Will buy more.</li>
            <li> The real deal. Super concentrated, nice subtle natural scent (green nuts?). Will last me years :)</li>
            <li> You must try this product! I have been using this organic shea butter for over 3 months and can tell a big difference in my skin. I have been suffering from extremely dry skin and this is the first product that has ever helped.  You use such a small amount and it lasts for a very long time. I am extremely pleased and will continue to purchase this amazing product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> this was the perfect butter we needed to make our own lotion, chap stick and even deodorant.  smells great and good texture.</li>
            <li> Really not what I wanted but works well once I melted &amp; added my favorite oils #elbows #knees #feet too heavy for my natural hair .</li>
            <li> You can tell it is pure shea butter.  Not crazy about the smell of it, but you can put it on and then use a scent on top of it if you need to.  I think I really prefer coconut oil, but this does seem to really stay on well and does not stain your clothes.  I will use it interchangeably with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Great product, my entire family uses it for our skin and hair. It doesn&#x27;t last long with our family, so we need to order more than one. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff - solved all of my issues with pregnancy rashes. Really protects your stretching skin from itchiness and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, the smell is not really nice, but I mix it with some coconut oil, and there I have two of the best humectants in the world working together for my skin. Really great. Will be buying again</li>
            <li> Everything was solid! Shipped on time, the produce was in tact 100% and it did what I wanted it to do (:</li>
            <li> Saved my life this winter!!&lt;br /&gt;No split lips. No itchy dry skin!&lt;br /&gt;This Shea is a miracle!!!&lt;br /&gt;No cracked calluses on feet anymore in my house!</li>
            <li> like it, moister skin well. When you first wear it, feeling a little oily, but absorbed soon. Like it.</li>
            <li> This product met all of my expectations.  I have been using this product to make my own shea butter mixture for my hair. This product provided everything that my hair needed. It arrived on time and as advertised. I did not mind that this product had rosemary in it after researching that rosemary has a lot of benefits for hair. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this product This is my first time using &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; shea butter.  I used it on my skin first, and I noticed a difference after a few days (5).  My skin is much smoother and softer but not oily - the shea butter keeps my skin hydrated and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or greasy residue.  I was a little nervous about the smell based upon comments, but the scent is not bad - at least it doesn&#x27;t bother me when it&#x27;s used as a skin moisturizer.  I washed my hair and put a little shea butter on my scalp and ends once my hair was dry.  The smell of the shea butter followed me around for a day and half - it was a bit intense, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use on my hair anymore.  For whatever reason, I find the shea butter smell innocuous when I use it on my body but it&#x27;s a totally different story on my hair.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product and plan to purchase more from this seller  The sellers are another plus, they send two follow-upemails, which is unusual in this day and age.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Package arrived timely and I like the USDA label certification that lets buyer know the organic claim has validity. I immediately prepared mixture for my hair. It was creamy with few lumps; my hair was richly moisturized and felt very soft and manageable. I will also prepare another mixture to use as body lotion. These are my two main uses for the Shea butter. I will buy again and hopefully, the certification will still be attached to product.</li>
            <li> Best Product to Have for First Aid and Dry or Chapped Skin ...  We use it mostly for Accidental Sunburns and Rash Guard Skin Irritations ...  just melt a spoonful and put it on the area in need...  There is no perfume or additives so there is absolutely No Burning or discomfort what so ever ...  Best Priced Product ...  A little goes a long way so it Lasts Forver !!!</li>
            <li> I have been making homemade skin care products for years and have purchased shea butter from many different businesses.  I can honestly say that his is the best shea butter that I have ever used.  It is very smooth, creamy, rich and healing. It can be used straight up and it blends very nicely in creams and lotions.  Thank you very much for offering high quality products and outstanding customer service!  I appreciate it and will be back soon!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Recieved in timely manner. Thank you for what you do ad for producing excellent American made products for us to use.</li>
            <li> love it very smooth thanx im glad i got two of them  i did not see this one in the stores</li>
            <li> Im using it while pregnant on my belly, it absorbs great on my sking, I&#x27;m 6 months pegnant and no signs of stretch marks at all, provides great hydration.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, this is my first time so I don&#x27;t know how it suppose to smell like, my sister says it smells like some natural herbals, but if it works I don&#x27;t care so i am going to use it anyways, i was just expecting something like the coconut butter and the cocoa butter cuz they really smell good...</li>
            <li> Simply love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;Stretch marks and dry skin !?&lt;br /&gt;Problem solved!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great product good quality good for hair my skin love it</li>
            <li> This shea butter was much better than the other companies I have received it from. It was not greasy at all. The service from this company was also top notch and their care for their customers was evident.</li>
            <li> I have made body butter, lip balm and lotion bars using this great organic shea butter. It is easy to work with and blends nicely with essential oils  (using a double boiler). I will be ordering from your site again.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! I put it in my window as suggested and it went on smooth and creamy. My skin is softer and smoother than ever and it is perfect for my god daughter too!💟</li>
            <li> It is an awesome moisturizer for my son. I I am a little bummed and will not be using it on my hair which is the main reason I purchased it for. It smells terrible uh I just hate the way it smells. I will not be repurchasing since I hate the smell it&#x27;s pretty hard to describe but something between burnt and very over powering and just bad .. I will try from other sellers maybe it won&#x27;t have this awful scent</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m growing older I realized that my skin quality isn&#x27;t the same as when I was 21. I get these dry flaky patches all over no matter how much I exfoliate or moisturize. I have a couple of stretch marks from a recent weight gain and loss. I also have old hormonal acne scars, and a couple of new wrinkles. In other words, I&#x27;m a mess! Lol. I&#x27;ve read several reports on Shea Butter being really great for all of these problems. The only problem is that it is super hard to find REAL Shea Butter. Most companies sell African Butter, and mark it as Shea. It is NOT. I did a ton of research before finally purchasing, and this seller had everything I was looking for, and at a reasonable price. I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I received my order! I got it within 3-4 days of ordering. Two days sooner than stated it would arrive. AMAZING!!!!! When I received the product, I did notice right away that the lid was broken. I believe the handler was too rough with my package even though it was nicely packed in the box. The lid was cracked in two places, and a huge chunk had broken off. I tried, but couldn&#x27;t find a lid to fit the jar, so I ended up using plastic wrap, and fitting the lid on as tight as I could get it. After mentioning this to the seller, they immediately shipped me a new lid. How&#x27;s that for customer service!!! I am so happy with my purchase. The Shea Butter is of a VERY high quality. The best I&#x27;ve come across (after purchasing 5 others). I am so excited to make future purchases with this seller. Thank you Key West Health &amp; Beauty for you high quality organic products, and EXCELLENT customer service!</li>
            <li> I had read that unrefined raw African Shea butter was great for Roseacea and dry skin amongst other things. I have been using it for a few days now, and love the texture, the smell and everything about it, my feet are softer, my skin is starting to look a little clearer. I&#x27;m very enthused! I am so excited to use this long term and know it will help tremendously!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema all my life and I&#x27;ve tried various ointments, lotions, and potions. A lot of these hydrocortisone did the job for a few days or maybe even a few hours but my dry patchy skin would always return. After doing some research I discovered shea butter. This specific brand is just great. If you suffer from eczema, specifically A-topic dermatitis, this is your angel in disguise. Yes, it does have a slight natural smell but that outweighs what this product has done for my condition. I apply it in the shower, after, right before bed, basically this has removed my stacks for strong pharmaceutical creams.</li>
            <li> Love the Shea Butter! Mild smell. Feels great on my face. Will be recommending it to all of my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put this on my baby for about 5 days to help with her eczema and it seems to be doing the trick. I&#x27;ve tried a few other lotions, including Mustela Stelatopia (which has the highest rating from the National Eczema Association), but so many out there have petrochemicals.  I love that the ingredient list on this is so short and easy to pronounce, especially when putting it on my baby&#x27;s super sensitive skin. I also appreciate the company&#x27;s attentiveness and willingness to ensure my happiness with their product. I would definitely purchase this again and it seems like I won&#x27;t need to for a while since you don&#x27;t have to use much from a container this size.</li>
            <li> I used to buy my Shea butter at Whole Body but I went by for a few weeks and found they were sold out each time. I decided to check on amazon and found this. The product is great quality Shea butter and I love the jar it comes in. This company seems to be really be passionate about their products and customer service- I got a hand written note in the mail thanking me for my purchase. They get an A+ from me!</li>
            <li> where in this &amp;#34;sale page&amp;#34; do you share that this is mixed with rosemary oil?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that little ingredient, that you&#x27;ve added in and conveniently not mentioned on the selling page, I think it&#x27;s a decent product.  I have used it directly and so far so good, nothing spectacular though.  I will give it a try in some of products and see if that subtle rosemary  scent can be blended with the other scents.....to be continued...</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is great! Good price for organic. It smells nice and I love that I can reuse the container</li>
            <li> Great product! Seems very pure, which is exactly what I wanted. It is a bit over-powering in smell because of its rawness so you need more essential oil to cover up the natural smell of it7</li>
            <li> I researched Rosemary, since I wasn&#x27;t sure why it is a component of this product.  Apparently it is, among other things, an antiseptic.  Very smart to add that to the Shea Butter.  I love what what the Shea Butter does for my skin and hair.  I suffer from freckles, rosacea, and brillo hair.  This product seems to improve all of the above.  I also like that I am helping a worthy cottage industry.  I love Amazon for giving me access to such great products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for dry skin.  I use this Shea butter for my baby. My boy has atopic skin. He always scrubed his skin. After useing this, his skin is little better.</li>
            <li> Very good product which deeply moisturizes the skin.</li>
            <li> i never had raw shea butter before- just so you know, it&#x27;s super hard, not creamy. it melts nicely over your skin though</li>
            <li> I was using Shea butter whole my pregnancy and I don&#x27;t have any stretch mark on my belly. Good product.</li>
            <li> I like this cream for my skin because it does not cause any irritation.  Many other products for sensitive skin still agitates my skin.</li>
            <li> No fragrance unlike other Shea butters!!  This is a great value, because it&#x27;s a very large tub. It is solid along the line of a beeswax, not creamy like a lotion. I scoop out a tiny bit of the Shea butter about the size of  1/8th of a teaspoon and rub it in my palms and TAH DAH! It transforms into an oil, which sinks into my skin when I rub it in, and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue. I&#x27;ve always had VERY dry skin.  I was just diagnosed with eczema and now I need to be careful about the ingredients in my creams and lotions. I like that this is ONLY shea butter, certified organic from the USDA, and sourced from a Women&#x27;s Co-op.</li>
            <li> Bought this for lotion. Worked great.  I was a bit unhappy it was not &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; Shea butter. For I saw no where it said there were other ingredients in the organic butter.</li>
            <li> Great for natural hair. I mix with coconut oil and other products to add to my hair as moisturizer. I have been using for six months and I will continue.</li>
            <li> Very well done! It feels great on my skin :D Keeps it soft and hydrated. :D</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ve read reviews where people complain about the smell of shea.  I can honestly say that I haven&#x27;t smelled anything bad with this product.  In fact, I find that there is barely a smell.  The color is consistent throughout the container.  It mixed nicely with my mango butter, cocoa butter, coconut oil and essential oils.  This product makes my skin soooooo soft and it feels moisturized hours after I apply it.  Being organic was a big concern of mine and this product filled all the requirements for me to buy it.  I really research everything before I buy it and this is one I will return to the next time I need shea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic and pure. I just need to find out the recipes to use this with. I used it on my hands and it really locks in the moisture. It is too hard all by itself in room temperature unless I whip it with whipping machine, but that is how a pure shea butter should be! It also has a little bit of rosemary essential oils for natural preservation. So it lasts longer and not have to worry about molds.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the shea butter or service!</li>
            <li> I bought this to add to my cosmetics and lotions.  It has a strong cocoa butter scent, which I&#x27;m not partial to and wasn&#x27;t expecting since I&#x27;ve bought another raw shea butter before and it didn&#x27;t have such a strong scent.  It doesn&#x27;t mix well with my flavored lip balms but does an amazing job as a lotion.  Works great on dry skin!</li>
            <li> I used this shea butter a  base for my body butter adding my favorite oils.  I will never  buy them again; it&#x27;s alway  better when  you know what you are putting on your skin.  Loving it.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is just what I was looking for to replace all the moisturizers on the market that are a long list of chemicals. The product arrived on time as promised. Using it is very easy. I get a small amount out place on my hand or leg where I want to apply then rub into skin. It absorbs very fast with no greasy feeling left. It has a slight nutty scent which I barely notice. I going to take some of the product out and warm, then whip and add my own essential oil scent to customize this for myself. I really like that the product is USDA certified organic. If you are looking for an organic and natural moisturizer try this.</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal. I purchased it especially for the winter season and I&#x27;m happy to report that my skin survived the dry weather! I use it on my lips and a mild bit on my face as well. Shea butter is heavy so many folks shy away from using it on the face but I learned that a small bit does not hurt at all. Coincidently my mum just recommended using shea butter on my hair and sent me some straight from Africa :-) When that shipment finishes I&#x27;ll be ordering Key West again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product apply it on my leg because I had a big purple, apply it in the morning and at night for about two weeks straight and blow disappeared without a trace.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. A few simple suggestions: get a bamboo or wooden small spatula to scrap it out of the container with,it is hard and not easy to take out of this container without some &#x27;scrapper;&#x27; beware of the &#x27;grease&#x27; that remains while your skin soaks this up, I rub it in for awhile and I still feel like I could ride down a slide at lightening speed (you will grease things you lean on); and it will look different than the picture of the open container if the weather melts it at all; mine looked like it was roughly packed (but I know it was the temp causing melting). I LOVE (not the effort but the outcome) putting this on at night and then having wonderfully moisturized skin all day the next day. Wonderful product. And I love the co-op concept  behind  this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the product.  I use it everyday mixed with coconut oil and essential oils.  A very wonderful little company.  Very personable and eager for your feedback.  The feedback actually goes to a live person not just some inbox at a large corporation.</li>
            <li> This product really does the job</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Certified organic. Melted easily for my recipes for homemade lotions. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! This jar is huge and had it since Nov of 2014 and still have a huge amount left. I&#x27;ve used it on my hair, face, and body. I love creating my own version of butters and lotions and this works amazingly with other oils and butters.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  Some have questioned the use of rosemary extract in this product.  100% raw, unrefined shea butter CAN go rancid.  It seems to me that the rosemary oil is added simply as a natural way to counteract this.  It does not bother me at all or make me question the integrity of this company or this product.  Furthermore, there is no rosemary scent whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this, along with organic raw cocoa butter and beeswax to make shower lotion bars.  Perfection.  I also like that this comes in a tub as opposed to being in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Was very displeased with this product. Advertised as pure Shea butter but has rosemary extract added in. Came with a cracked lid. Will be returning as soon as possible and purchasing a different product (100% Shea) from a different seller.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Organic Unrefined African Shea Butter.  It absorbs quickly into my skin and I found that the smell get subtler with time.  I am a very satisfied customer.  Thank you Key West Health &amp; Beauty. Priscilla in Ca.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be dry, especially in winter, so I&#x27;m thrilled to find something what helped me to overcome this nasty dryness. I don&#x27;t feel any strong smell of rosemary. I use rosemary essential oil in shower gel sometimes so I know how intense it can get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and using this for stretch marks (and my hair). I wanted a product that is safe and organic. It is very comparable to higher-end she butter products. I warm up the product first before applying. A little bit goes a long way! The smell is a little bit different, but I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells while pregnant. Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely Shea. Absorbs so much faster than others, has a very slight scent, and lasts forever! Highly recommend. The only Shea I will buy from now on. I tried another brand of Shea here on Amazon and it came unsealed and looking moldy. Not the case with this one. Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality! My wife had purchaced different ones previosly and didnt like them a lot. This one is the best, when melted and churened it became so soft like whipped cream, so white.</li>
            <li> Good product. Arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Came as promised, feel nice to the touch and worked well in my shampoo bars!</li>
            <li> This products feel amazing and smells so good.  I am 35 but I look 25.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this product on my skin.. I have been getting compliments galore!  Also, I use it on my hair.. great for africian american hair. I will only use this product from now on.</li>
            <li> This product has a weird caky texture; it takes forever to get absorbed into skin, you have to rub it and make it warm first. Also, the jar didn&#x27;t have any protective seal, just the lid. Other than that, it&#x27;s fine. Good value.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this Shea butter. One of the best I&#x27;ve bought off of Amazon. Quality and packaging is great. AND this is TRULY certified organic. You can tell because they actually include the USDA seal on their packaging which means their facilities have undergone a costly and time consuming process to ensure organic practices are being followed. I use this on my hands and it keeps them nice and moisturized without any added fragrance or chemicals. Thank you Key West.</li>
            <li> Several reviews mention that there is a rosemary extract in the shea butter. I wonder what else has been added or removed from this &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;unrefined&amp;#34; &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; &amp;#34;shea&amp;#34; &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> After reading many blogs about making my own body and hair butter recipes, the most often recommending source for quality shea butter at a fair price was this one. Now that I have whipped up a few body butters of my own, I can most definitely recommend this too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a slight smell to it, but from my reading, it is right in line with how unrefined shea should smell. When I make the body butter, I add quite a bit of essential oils to it, but can still smell a hint of the nutty, earthy scent through it. By the third time using it, I hardly even noticed those undertones.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the Shea butter. Nice and fresh!  USDA certified, excellent quality and great price. Highly recommended to anyone!</li>
            <li> The shea butter more than lived up to my expectations, and the customer service provided by the company in resolving a shipping issue was outstanding!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three months now and I&#x27;ve seen great results on my skin. It&#x27;s simply amazing!</li>
            <li> This product was just what I needed for my essential oils.  It whipped up beautifully with coconut oil and my essential oils.  Will definitely reorder when needed.</li>
            <li> Great product that arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> There is not much to say about this shea butter, it&#x27;s absolutely the BEST ever!!! Highly recommend to everybody with not just dry skin, it&#x27;s perfect for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I use on skin and hair and have had no trouble with any allergic reaction ( which I commonly have with many skin products) or with any dryness!  Use on my grandson&#x27;s excema with great results.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. It&#x27;s soft, smells good and has only Shea butter and rosemary extract (as a preservative).</li>
            <li> This is the BEST moisturizer God ever created. Seriously. It&#x27;s a natural plant product and it feels like Crisco. But it melts and penetrates with no oily residue. Never use anything else. My feet and hands are smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! The only thing is that I feel it should be put on at night because it tends to stay on the skin for a while. The results are amazing. I always have cracked heels and rough elbows and by putting this on every night, it has done wonders for me. I love that it is all natural. The customer service is great too because after ordering I received an email educating me all about shea butter, how to use it, etc. Love it! Will buy more for my family members.</li>
            <li> Shipped it super fast, it smells awesome and is so smoothe! Not even slightly gritty. I will order again when I run out :)</li>
            <li> Smells kind of funky, but that is to be expected with a natural product. Does a really much better job at moisturizing my extremely dry skin (face and body) than anything else I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s organic and I&#x27;m supporting women&#x27;s co-ops by purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difficulty I have is getting it out because it is solid. I usually take a small spoon to get some out and rub it between my hands to warm it up. After that I&#x27;m ready to moisturize.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever purchased Shea Butter from a health food store or elsewhere that wasn&#x27;t this brand, then consider giving this product a try. My face is super-sensitive and I can usually only use Eucerin on it. I&#x27;ve tried other Shea Butters and have been disappointed. Key West&#x27;s brand is a joy to use on my face. Plus, while Shea Butter does have a smell, this brand&#x27;s smell is very faint. It doesn&#x27;t lay &#x27;heavy&#x27; on my face and is easy to apply. I&#x27;m so glad I gave this a try. It keeps my face so moist all day long! Well worth the price. :)</li>
            <li> Great quality and smells good, too! Super fast shipping! I will get this product again. I love family-owned businesses!</li>
            <li> Otherwise it seems ok. After RayGun and O&#x27;Bama&#x27;s apparent worship and adoration of him, I have my doubts that &amp;#34;USDA Organic&amp;#34; actually means anything. Probably Koch Bros Nitrogen Fertilizer is considered &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; and Monsanto &amp;#34;round up&amp;#34;, too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, you can&#x27;t beat the price for Shea bearing this label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using &amp;#34;Strictly Shea&amp;#34;, which is softer, creamier and has no peculiar smell other than the somehwat peculiar smell Shea has, but they went the American Dream retail social parasite way which all hipster citizens are supposed to fall into knee and knuckle crushing prostration over, pay the tax, pay the shipping fee, pay the highest retail markup conceivable and say &amp;#34;Like O wow&amp;#34;: but then it&#x27;s still much cheaper than something sold at Sephora -e.g., $45 for 1/2 an ounce. So applying this to my beard makes me feel like I&#x27;m at a camp fire burning &amp;#34;pisswood&amp;#34; and then applying it to my sirloins wondering if it&#x27;s pig fat merged with some other USDA organic gelatinous mass. The container it comes in says Rosemary is in it but it sure don&#x27;t smell like Rosemary, it smells more like the little pudgy girl with the polyester lined faux denim jacket next to the campfire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;m a poor hapless schmuck from the Proletariat and I&#x27;ll probably end up using this stuff forever until some classy woman from the 1% - that can afford to know better -  directs me otherwise</li>
            <li> This is great!  Just a small amount goes a long way.  It dissolves easily in the hands.  I haven&#x27;t tried making it into a lotion yet, but I intend to.  It has a light nutty sent that dissipates shortly after application.  Definitely not overpowering.  I have super dry skin.  My hands get rough and my fingertips crack.  This has helped a lot.  My legs will get ashy dry and this helps with that also.  I&#x27;ve even used it on my lips.  I am extremely sensitive to dyes, chemicals, fragrance, alcohol etc.  I also have a lot of environmental allergies (grass, pollen, trees, etc).  It&#x27;s nice to find something that works that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or overwhelm me with scent.</li>
            <li> Love this! Very high quality with a wonderfully smooth texture and earthy aroma. I have used it in several body butter recipes and will definitely purchase again. If you are looking for the best: this is it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Shea Butter. It does wonders for your skin and makes it feel smooth and hydrated - never greasy. I appreciate that it is unscented, organic, and very easy to use. I can already see a big difference in my skin just after a few times using it. This Shea Butter is an amazing addition to my skin care routine!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for in terms of product and being organic to use in body product recipes.  Especially love that it helps women&#x27;s co-ops; which for me, makes it an ethically superior product.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used shea butter, so technically I don&#x27;t have a basis for comparison. However, I did do a fair bit of research on what constitutes quality shea butter, so I&#x27;m an educated first time user. And I&#x27;m really impressed with this shea butter! I get really dry skin in the winter, so I wanted to find a product that would moisturize my skin, and this does the job wonderfully. It does take a little extra effort to get it to absorb into my skin, since I haven&#x27;t yet tried the recipes mixing it with other products, so it&#x27;s not thinned out at all. But my skin feels very soft and hydrated after using it, so I&#x27;m happy, and plan to try making a hair conditioner in the near future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary for review purposes; all opinions remain my own.</li>
            <li> and the best part is that you are actually supporting the women in Ghana.</li>
            <li> I have been mixing the Shea Butter with Lanolin and am pleased with the consistency and how long it stays on my skin.  It is thick when mixed but I use it on my hands and feet every day and would order this again.</li>
            <li> No Complaints at all. I am extremely happy with the Key West Shea Butter. I did a lot of research before I pick them. They are USDA Certified Organic (not many companies are). Upon opening the container I immediately noticed it was luxurious. It is stiff with a rich, creamy appearance. It melts easily in the hands when rub together. (I did not want a product that was soft, pliable or, hard). The price is good. I was also pleasantly surprised that I received it by the second day after ordering. I truly have no complaints. I will definitely purchase this product again and I highly recommend anyone interested in Shea Butter to purchase it from Key West. I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Enjoy!!! I am. :)</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! I made a whipped body butter using only their African Shea Butter &amp; a few oils. You can read more &amp; see more on my blog www.beautydelicacy.com</li>
            <li> I received my first shipment of shea butter with a cracked lid. I contacted the seller with pictures and they promptly mailed out a new one for me. The customer service was very courteous and quick. The product itself is amazing. I use it in a diy lotion, but I would also just use this as a lotion by itself! Feels great!</li>
            <li> If your looking for a great shea butter then this is it. I will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> Only problem, one of the jars popped open, was left im the sun . i had one sticky ant infested box and jar .</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased this product and my only complaint is there not being a safety seal under the lid. The Shea butter is great</li>
            <li> This sea butter is excellent. It works great in my recipes and was well sealed and packaged.</li>
            <li> Awesome. It comes with a lot of product. It&#x27;s going to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> If I could rate this product 10 stars I would!  Five stars doesn&#x27;t do it justice.&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable shea butter.  I warm a little bit in my hands and apply it&lt;br /&gt;to my face, body, and it absorbs quickly, with tremendous moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;results and actually soothes my skin.  It has a light scent that is&lt;br /&gt;nice.  The fact this shea butter is USDA organic and thus safe and high quality&lt;br /&gt;is vital.  And personally, I am very happy it is sourced through a women&#x27;s co-op&lt;br /&gt;in Ghana ensuring their fair wages and ethical treatments.  There is now&lt;br /&gt;no need for me to have any other face cream or body creams; just this&lt;br /&gt;wonderful natural shea butter.  Thank you to Key West!!!</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter! I use it every day as a moisturizer, and it&#x27;s great for massages as well!  There may be others available for less, but the quality of this product is outstanding. I just ordered my 3rd batch last night.</li>
            <li> This is all natural and it works great on my skin. A little goes a long way with this butter.</li>
            <li> This is high quality shea butter at a good price. After browsing sellers and reading some scary reviews I was a bit nervous about ordering shea butter on this site. But I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this.  I use this shea butter daily and will definitely order from this seller again. Also, very fast shipping</li>
            <li> Do not recommend! This one has rosemary extract in it that is said on the bottle. It smell bad to me, with a tint of mint kind smell. I use shea butter from other sellers but this one does not feel or smell the same.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several Shea butters that end up less than what I expected. I was very pleased when I got my order. The Shea butter has a consistent texture throughout, natural light nutty scent and large quantity for the cost. I use this Shea butter daily and will be a repeat costumer.</li>
            <li> Came on time, great product</li>
            <li> Superior Shea Butter, love it and so does my skin!</li>
            <li> Excellent pure Shea Butter.  I must admit the smell of the Butter took  me a little getting used to, but the butter is extremely cost effective and does an awesome job moisturizing your skin.  It warms up quickly in your hand before application and a little goes a very long way.  I am sold on Shea butter and will toss all those other drug store products I have tried over the years.  My skin feels healthier and hydrated all day long and have found it does an awesome job on my lips!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Relieves chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Once I figured out you had to scoop it out and let it melt in your hand I really liked this product...always read the directions first.&lt;br /&gt; Not much of a fan of the smell but the way the product last on your skin without feeling greasy got me past that. My husband who has severely dry and cracked hands in the winter was very pleased with it.  This is a product that I would order again. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get nice results.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. My daughters and I used it to make our own lip balm. We are confident we will use it for many more natural DIY projects.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good USDA unrefined organic Shea Butter product and had found a couple. After reading reviews of different companies that sell the product I decided to go with Key West. I&#x27;m glad I did. Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I am in love with the shea butter.  There is virtually no smell which is crucial for me.  The last unrefined shea butter that I purchased had an awful smell that did not diminish with time.  I was very self conscious using it.  The color and consistency of Key West shea is wonderful.  I used it in my homemade hair conditioning concoction and I was pleasantly surprised by the results.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> awesome stuff and no residue.  Quickly moisturizes area like the elbow quickly.</li>
            <li> This review is for Shea Butter - African Raw Unrefined - USDA Certified Organic - 100% Pure &amp; Natural - 16 OZ - Produced By Women&#x27;s Co-Ops In Ghana. It is difficult to determine if this product is unrefined or raw because I have used Shea Butter from different vendors and there is no one standard to compare Shea Butter. Usually, Shea Butter has a distinct natural smell. This product has no smell at all. I just wish the consumers could buy directly from a vendor in Africa. I would recommend that someone shop at an African store and compare it to this product.</li>
            <li> My 5 year-old son had been suffering from eczema for about 2 years. And due to this he scratches some nights, the times he does he wakes with horrible scratches that sometimes have made him cry. I tried medication for eczema that his doctor gave him, but those have side effects, plus itching was not relived immediately. I also had eczema on my hands, especially when it gets cold.&lt;br /&gt;I received shea butter from Key West Health and Beauty for a possible review. I used it for curing the eczema for my son and me, I also applied it on my chapped lips, and cracked heels. And it was the best solution for all previous skin problems that we had. My son now LOVES shea butter because he can sleep well all night. In addition, my lips, hands and feet are sooo soft.&lt;br /&gt;This shea butter has a butter like texture, and my 5 year-old son learnt to apply it directly to his itchy skin, he then message gently as it melts due to body&#x27;s heat. It has a nutty smell, not bad, and you get used to it by time. Even if you don&#x27;t like the smell, the benefits that you will get will sure compensate for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a month now.&lt;br /&gt;My over all experience: I love it, and so does my son. I will repurchase it again and again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different unrefined shea butters, and this is some really nice stuff. The texture is super creamy and best I&#x27;ve come across. However the price is extravagant for what you can find from other retailers and wholesalers (not here on Amazon). I just bought some of this because I was out of my usual stuff and needed some quick (go Prime!).    I like that it is certified organic as opposed to simply called &#x27;organic&#x27; like many other sellers do without any type of real certification which is total shystery bulls***.    However, I&#x27;m not confident that it&#x27;s truly unrefined as the texture is simply much creamier and richer than other unrefined sheas I&#x27;ve bought. It does feel nice though.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s wonderful stuff.  Smells good and I think it is the real deal.  It does come in a</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! I have tried several types of Shea Butter and this brand is by FAR THE BEST! Smooth, spreads nicely, organic, and wonderful smell. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Very effective at softening rough spots.  Can be a bit greasy, though.  Perfect to use on your feet before wearing socks.</li>
            <li> I got hooked on African Shea Butter from some specialty store at a mall. I splurged on the exorbitant price and while I fell in love with the product, I knew there was no way I could continue replenishing it. Then I found this product. I read the reviews and, at the cheap price, decided to take a risk. It is a really good product! I have a lot of sun damage from those years of being a silly young sun-worshipper and was looking for a product that might not reduce the damage, but at least soften the skin to keep it from looking like an old saddle. I use it mainly on my chest and arms and noticed a difference in the damage right away. My chest doesn&#x27;t look so wrinkled and my arms are softer.&lt;br /&gt;Since this product is unrefined, it does have an earthy and distinct odor when first applied. That was going to be a deal-breaker right there. But after a minute or two, the odor went away. I can live with a couple of minutes of that smell for an entire day of smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much. It makes my face look and feel so good. I get this natural glow and many compliments on my skin. Great product. I recommend it to anyone. And yes it has a smell but it is very mild and doesn&#x27;t follow you everywhere you go. Compared to the actual African Shea butter in AFRICA that they make raw, the smell is way milder.</li>
            <li> I was critical of this because I have bought raw shea before &amp; was seriously disappointed in the quality &amp; even suspected a bit of danger in the product. This shea is great! Smells clean &amp; fresh, goes on sooooo smooth, my skin is so happy! Will buy again, only thing is that I wish it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> This item is very good especially if you have blemishes and any marks on your body. also good for your foot bottom, crack heels just apply it will dissapare</li>
            <li> An excellent product, and at a very good price!</li>
            <li> Love this for my skin, it does have a earthly smell to it but as it should for raw Shea butter</li>
            <li> I love this butter. I have ordered it again since. Whips beautifully.</li>
            <li> I had read some reviews about this African Raw Unrefined Shea Butter and the more I read the more I wanted to try this for myself before winter sets in.  My feet get so dry during winter months because I&#x27;m cold nurtured so I wear a couple pairs of socks at times.  When my feed stay covered 24/7, they look awful without some pampering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been rubbing this Shea butter on my heels, knees and elbows twice a day and I out on socks afterwards and so far, it&#x27;s helping my heels,  They are definitely looking 100% better than they did and now I can go get that pedicure I&#x27;ve been putting off while trying to find a product for my dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several brands of shea butter before, and this might be my favorite.  I used it to make lotion yesterday.  I really like that it is a light color, so my lotion stayed light.  It&#x27;s unrefined, so it does have an odor, but it is less than other brands that I have used.  The plastic that they use is BPA free, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about chemicals leeching in to my products.</li>
            <li> Good product, good costumer service.</li>
            <li> I love very good product fast delivery very pleased</li>
            <li> I love how pure and high quality this shea butter is. It makes my skin so soft and silky. This is our familys choice when we need a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very good quality Shea Butter¡ nice nutty smell.</li>
            <li> I kept hearing about how great raw African shea butter was but I had never tried it, only the shea butter creams and lotions I could find in stores like Walmart and CVS. Pure shea butter is completely different. I was a little concerned when ordering because I had never ordered anything from Amazon before but went ahead because I had heard such great things about it. I liked that it was USDA certified organic. There were a few other sellers that claimed to be organic but I couldn’t find any that were certified. After reading a lot of shea butter product reviews, there seemed to be a lot of people that were unhappy with the quality of the lower priced shea butters and several recommendations to make sure you buy one that is certified organic. I heeded that advice and paid a few dollars more but felt more comfortable about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is much thicker but it melted quickly when I rubbed it on my feet and I couldn’t believe how well it moisturized them. I have used a lot of creams and lotions but they all seem to dissolve after an hour or two at best. This stuff lasted all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The smell takes some getting used to if you are like me and used to the lotions and creams you buy from stores that have fragrances added to them. It’s not a bad smell, it is just a natural smell, which I expected from a product that is completely organic and raw.  I actually really like it. I feel like I’m putting something on my skin that is good for it. I always worried about what some companies used to make their stuff smell so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase and the level of customer service I received from the seller. They followed up after the sale to make sure I received it and was happy with it. I’m not sure if that is normal on Amazon but I wasn’t expecting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wished I had bought something else to put me over the $25 level to qualify for free shipping or even bought two of these. I only ordered one and ended up paying $8 for shipping. Oh well, Amazon newbie mistake I guess, so if you’re new to Amazon, don’t make that one.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I had a mix of organic shea butter and essential oils that I had been using, and when it ran out, I decided to go pure shea butter.  I got this one because it supports women&#x27;s co-ops in Ghana, and since this is an important West African resource, we want to be sure we&#x27;re getting it fairly.  It comes in a big plastic tub with a lid that screws off quick n easy.  It does have added rosemary extract added according to the label (and nothing else).  I notice no odor.  I dab some on a wash cloth every morning and evening and scrub it into my face, so it&#x27;s like a combo wash and moisturizer for me.  It does a great job rubbing away any makeup or dirt.  My complexion has really cleared up and my skin looks radiant.  My only complaint is that it seems to bother the edges of my lips by making them extremely dry if I try to use as a lip balm, but I have the same problem with lots of lip care products.  Overall, I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this Shea Butter! i live in Wisconsin and in the winter time my skin gets really dry.  My legs get so dry they start to hurt! so i bought this and it has helped sooo much.  I put it on after i get out of the shower and my skin is so soft, i love how thick it is.  i will be purchasing again once im out.</li>
            <li> Pretty darn fabulous.  You can see my full review here on my website! [...]</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I have VERY dry skin and I put a small amount of shea butter on my palms, and rubbed them together to soften, and was able to cover both elbows and heels. 3 hours later and my elbow are still super soft and my heels feel much better. Usually I put other stuff on and 30 minutes later its soaked into my skin and they start getting dry again. I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Fast shipping! Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> It goes on silky smooth, makes my skin feel amazing, and I love how it smells. I put this stuff everywhere, from my elbows to my feet. I love it! Goodbye dry skin, goodbye cracked hands, goodbye goodbye goodbye. I will be using this product year round to keep my skin healthy, hydrated, and radiant.</li>
            <li> I love the cool weather that comes in October, but I hate what it does to my skin. My heels, ankles, knees and elbows all become dry and cracked. They sometimes even bleed. I need more than just standard lotion. I need something like shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is African Shea Butter? It is extracted from the nut of the African shea tree. Natural shea butter is an excellent moisturizer for the face and body and is widely used for hair treatments. It is also well known for its natural healing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key West African Shea Butter is shea butter that is in its raw (or unrefined) state. It is processed by hand using water extraction and screened for impurities, resulting in the highest quality grade A shea butter. The shea butter is 100% natural, certified $A organic and does not have any added dyes or synthetic ingredients. It is sourced from a local women’s co-op in Ghana to ensure fair wages and ethical treatment....which is awesome!  It comes in a large 14oz (that is almost a pound!) BPA free container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only tried processed shea butter in the past. I definitely like this Key West unrefined shea butter a lot more. It is in a hard solid form and you just dip your fingers into the jar and a little bit comes off on your fingers. A small amount of this shea butter goes a long way. It has a faint natural scent that is nice and doesn&#x27;t seem to linger. Key West Shea Butter is extremely moisturizing and it seeps into your skin, so it moisturizes for a long time. It also warms up if you rub it in between your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My container is still almost full and I have used it at least a dozen times. So, this container will last for a long time. You can also use this shea butter in recipes to make lotions, sugar scrubs, hair conditioner, whipped shea butter, lip balms and more. You can even find recipes on the Key West Youtube page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend Key West African Shea Butter. The current price is also an amazing deal....order some now. Your skin will Thank You!..order some now. Your skin will Thank You!</li>
            <li> Lovely smell and texture. I ordered on Saturday and received Monday evening. It matters to me that it is USDA organic as many products make loose claims about being organic. And supporting local women co-ops in Ghana is important to me.</li>
            <li> First of all, it has a strong scent. It took me awhile to get use to it. Secondly, the consistency is thick. It&#x27;s one of those products you get a certain amount and warm it up with your fingers. Once it gets soften, you apply it onto your skin. I used it on my body and it&#x27;s extremely hydrating. It leaves a smooth and soft layer. It also doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy/oily feel but there is a shine/glowiness to the skin. Lastly, I&#x27;m amazed how hydrating this product is! I have dry, crack heels at the back of my feet. After the first usage, I noticed a big difference. I think it&#x27;ll be great for winter. People can apply it onto the feet, wear socks, and sleep overnight. The results in the morning will be amazing!</li>
            <li> I was given this product free from the company to try,  in exchange for my honest opinion about it.  I am a regular shea butter user and often boast about how great it is for hair and skin.  I love creating hair recipes and so I normally buy my shea butter wholesale and in large quantities and it never comes in a jar.  I am very pleased with the consistency of the shea butter from Key West.  It&#x27;s poured into the jars, so it&#x27;s very easy to scoop out and measure. The jar is airtight and can be easily stored away to prolong the use.  I love how easily I was able to use this in my hair recipes.  The price is just right and I love that it&#x27;s manufactured responsibly with no additives.  Once I run out, I will be buying my next batch from Key West for sure.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Exactly as expected</li>
            <li> I love Shea Butter and actually my whole family uses it. We find any and every reason to use it! I received a free container of shea butter for in exchange for an open and honest opinion from Key West Health &amp; Beauty.The main thing I use it for is as a lip balm. There are many recipes that you can do using shea butter but I just use it straight out of the container. Take a tiny dot and rub it on my lips. I also like to rub it all over my hands when they feel a bit dry. It’s great on my hubs’s feet as well. He works on his feet all day and so it’s nice to give him a nice shea butter foot massage while laying in bed watching t.v. at the end of the day. Shea butter does not rub in easily though so it’s best to not try to walk around after applying it to your feet! This is why I do it at night when I know I won’t be walking around for a while.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dry skin, but I bought this shea butter for its benefits to keep the skin healthy. It&#x27;s easy to melt, but does take some time to work in. That&#x27;s not the fault of the product; that&#x27;s just the way shea butter is. If you&#x27;re pressed for time, I&#x27;d save this for one of those days when you really need to relax and treat yourself :) but I&#x27;ve found that a good trick to get past this is to mix it with regular lotion in your hands, pat the spots you want to moisturize, and then rub it in (you absolutely don&#x27;t need lotion in addition to this product; that&#x27;s just to help it glide over your skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The company also followed up to make sure I was happy with the product. I use it on my face as a base for oils such as tea tree oil, and it hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores or had any adverse effects--even though I have oily skin. In fact, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is less oily in the morning after using this at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;d definitely recommend this brand if you&#x27;re looking for shea butter. I&#x27;m a first time customer but it&#x27;s a really good quality &amp; great service, so there&#x27;s no need for me to search around. I&#x27;m going to buy some more when I run out, but it&#x27;s going to last me a while :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my children since the weather is changing (cold weather). Once I received it and opened the container I initially thought it was going to be tough getting it out but it actually is very smooth. I apply it to my children&#x27;s skin and hair and think it does a remarkable job. My son who is 4 y/o does not like the smell and will try to run away from me once he see&#x27;s the bottle but he has very dry skin and I think it works&#x27; wonders on him as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product and have already. I may purchase an essential oil to change the scent of the Shea butter because it is &#x27;raw&amp;#34;; I&#x27;ll go on-line to see how to do this.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth and soft enough to take out using your fingers with beautiful off white coloring. Came very quickly with Amazon prime. Will use this to make home made lotion bars. Love the fact that its in a BPA free jar ( will keep and re-use the jar once product ends) and produced by women&#x27;s co-ops. Only thing that would make me feel better about purchasing this product would be if it contained the cure for cancer or world hunger under the lid of the jar.</li>
            <li> I have yet to use this product because when I bought this I thought I was purchasing regular organic shea butter- This is shea butter with rosmary extract and the description did not say that. Im sure its a great product and it will eventually get used to make chapstick or something, but its not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I love this product &amp; will purchase it again. I use it to make cream for my hair. I love it</li>
            <li> This shea butter is perfect for what I am using it for.  And I love that it is organic. Smells good to me.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and great on and for my skin and face. I love it.</li>
            <li> I used this shea butter to make a nourishing homemade whipped lotion. It came out fantastic and I know most of that is because I used amazing ingredients. A big percent of the ingredients was this shea butter, which is amazing. Really great quality and the natural smell is wonderful (at least I think so :) ). I will be ordering again when my shea butter runs out!</li>
            <li> I ordered some organic raw shea butter for a blended face cream recipe I discovered. I really like the shea butter and it is easy to scoop out of the container. My order was delivered quickly which was nice since the initial email said it would be a week. I like that the shea butter has a variety of uses and since it has a very light scent, it can even be used in the morning before work. Great for this dry winter weather!</li>
            <li> my skin is super dry I tried everything this is the most amazing product I used</li>
            <li> I received the Shea butter and am very pleased/satisfied with your product. I am also impressed that you took the time to personally email me to see if I not only received the product, but you showed sincere concern as to whether or not I like it and offered suggestions for its use.&lt;br /&gt;This is a first and a tribute to the quality of your merchandise and concern for your customers&#x27; satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;After such a short time using it, my skin is softer and has a beautiful color/glow, no doubt enhanced by consistent use of the Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! I will continue to use and recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works wonderfully!! Skin is very smooth and repaired after using! A little hard when trying to get it out of tub but after you rub it on your hands it is easy to apply!</li>
            <li> Great product! Pure, organic, great price and the most important is that it doesnt feel oily after i apply it. It is quickly absorbed and very hydrating.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price. Would buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> After doing a bit of research after receiving my product I learned that there are several great ways to use shea butter. Aside from a face/body moisturizer and hair treatments, it also is a great lip balm (perfect for this time of year!) and many women use it during pregnancy to help reduce stretch marks.  The first thing I noticed when I opened the container was the smell. It does not have a bad smell, but it is also not like the commercial lotions and creams I am used to using. It has a more natural smell, which makes sense since it is a raw, unrefined product. The thickness of the product surprised me too. It is definitely much thicker than any lotions or creams I have used previously, however it softens as you rub it in and goes on quite nicely. I used it as a moisturizer for my hands and was very impressed with how quickly my hands felt softer and more hydrated. I decided to try it as a lip balm as well since the weather is getting cooler and drier. It made my lips feel very soft and smooth and it really lasted, much unlike other chap sticks or lip glosses which I find myself applying multiple times a day. I&#x27;ve seen others recommend using it as a moisturizer and even diaper cream for babies - with a newborn, I am planning to try it out to help protect my baby&#x27;s delicate skin!</li>
            <li> This is the best quality I have ever had and it was easy to use. I really loved this product!</li>
            <li> When I apply it it melts in my hands , a very good moisturizer. I will certainly buy again .</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this Shea Butter. Great packaging...prompt delivery. I will DEFINITELY  be reordering more from Key West Health &amp; Beauty. Shea is awesome for dry, cracked and flaky skin. My skin just drinks it up. Once you try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed....In fact you&#x27;ll be hooked. Thank you soooo much Key West Health &amp; Beauty! GREAT PRODUCT and very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it for everything and I love it. It is nice and smooth. I will definitely order again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> I had never ordered Shea butter before and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I purchased this to use in making my own body butters. When the Shea butter arrived the lid was open and nearly off the container. I opened it anyway to see if everything was ok. The first thing I noticed was that the smell I expected was almond and the smell this product had was most certainly not almond. The container indicates it has rosemary in it and quite possibly that was hat I smelled. Although I ordered this product through Amazon the Key West company emailed me about my satisfaction of the product. A few days after the emails the company then called my home, again to ask me about my satisfaction with the product but also to get me to sign up for what sounded like a membership to their site. Not pleased about that portion of my purchase but the Shea butter working out fine for my moisturizer with the addition of essential oils to help with the smell.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Will order again</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It is hard so you have to warm it up a little with your hands, but that&#x27;s a good thing because it doesn&#x27;t get so messy. I will say that this is serious stuff. You can&#x27;t put it on after the shower and then put your clothes on because it will stain your clothes. Put this on before bed or BEFORE you get in the shower. It will literally make you skin glow. It also doesn&#x27;t have any kind of smell.</li>
            <li> great product!  100% satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> This shea butter is great, melts in your hands and is smooth and feels great on the skin.  I can even use it on my face it&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li> Prompt service. It has a very smooth and creamy texture. It has a nice smell too. I can hardly wait to use it in my homemade soap.</li>
            <li> Very Pleased and purchase again🙏</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff...I searched all over to ensure I was getting the creamy raw shea butter that I expected.  I use it everyday around my eyes and mouth...I am 57 and have no crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is the best!! The scent is lovely and not strong at all. A great price for the quantity too. I will definitely continue to purchase shea butter from Key West Health &amp; Wellness. This is the only moisturizer I use for myself and my two young boys. I also use a small amount in my hair and I no longer need and other hair products. My hair is long, fine, and wavey. Just remember,  a small amount goes a long way! Also works great on my boys&#x27; exzema.</li>
            <li> i bought 2 jars by accident but the shea smells wonderful and really works to keep the moisture in my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I used this to attempt to create my own facial/body creams and lotions. While my recipes need some work, I have no complaints about the shea butter. The butter seems very pure and has a wonderful consistency and smell.</li>
            <li> This butter is amazing! I live in the mountains in Southern California and there is zero humidity and the UVs are strong. I&#x27;d been using Coconut oil but that didn&#x27;t moisturizer enough and my skin seemed to just suck it right up. I was so excited when the Shea arrived. It wasn&#x27;t as firm as I was expecting and I found it the perfect thickness for what my dry skin was craving! I&#x27;m never going back to store brand lotions ever again. Organic Shea is perfect and has multipurposes.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd tub I have bought...I love this stuff. Use it for my face and put a couple drops of other natural oils with lavender. I have very dry skin so oily doesn&#x27;t bother me. I also keep it at my bedside to apply to feet for smooth  heels. Great product! Efficient shipping. Big enough container to last me quite a while with what I&#x27;m using it for.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it is great for my hair and I leave it on overnight and it is not greasy and perfect for flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 containers and they were both rancid.  Only 1 was replaced.</li>
            <li> Shea butter from Key West absolutely great and I LOVE IT!  I have used Shea butter from all many different vendors, however, this is likely the best, hands down! The quality and quantity for the price cannot be compared. Thanks for such a great product as I believe this is my final go to for my Shea butter product.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time. It works as advertised. I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Very happy and will buy again.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Awesome products use it for some any things. Will definitely be buying again :) !!</li>
            <li> Just right. Perfect consistency. Definitely ordering more. Just wish it was a larger size.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter was a great addition to my homemade lotion.</li>
            <li> WOW!  THIS SHEA BUTTER IS AWESOME.  VERY MOISTURIZING.  I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN AND AM ALLERGIC TO MOST PRODUCTS, BUT HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> The real deal. Quality product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. When a durable container. Also the Shea butter was easy to get out of container and put in my homemade whipped shea butter mix I make. For just 14 dollar it has the USDA Organic seal. I&#x27;ve brought cheaper Shea Butter that doesn&#x27;t have that and one of Shea Butter came to me bad.  I use this product for my hair and body lotions. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Loved it! I have suggested it to everyone I know</li>
            <li> My eight year old daughter has eczema and is always scratching her arms, legs and belly. We have tried everything. Some things help a little, but not completely. We now use this Shea butter on her skin every time she comes out of the shower. We have seen improvements immediately. Her skin is softer and the eczema is slowly disappearing. She doesn&#x27;t scratch her body like she used to. The good thing is there is plenty of this Shea Butter and it will last us a long time. We have spend tons of money on prescriptions and other products that did not work as well as this product. Will continue to use this product, hoping it continues to improve my daughter&#x27;s eczema.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am using shea butter on my feet to take the roughness out. I am on my feet a lot and I need help. I noticed if I put the shea butter on my feet each day, they improve and are much softer. No more rough soles and bottoms of my feet. I love this shea butter and will continue to use it on my feet. My daughter will continue to use it on her arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Smooth throughout, soft, good quality. I make homeade diaper cream with this and it worked great.  My daughters bum is happy now :)</li>
            <li> Love it! Nice, smooth, no scent. This jar of Shea Butter will last a long time.  I use it on my hair, which is very curly, and I apply it immediately after washing and rinsing.  Use a little rub between your hands and then apply by squeezing your hair with your butter coated hands. Then, don&#x27;t touch your hair, let it dry naturally if possible. The result, waves and curls that are in control and shine. You can not go wrong with this product.  It also works great on your feet, makes them feel as soft as a baby.</li>
            <li> I just cannot longer live without a jar of sea butter. This is the number one secret of beauty skin. The Shea butter is amazing to prevent stretch marks and reduce their appearance. If you have stretch marks this Organic unrefined African Shea butter is the best, because it is more concentrated and dense. This product is organic and 100% pure and natural. If you tend to get stretch marks this product is essential for you, whether the cause is genetics, hormonal or weight fluctuation changes. If you are pregnant I highly recommend you to use it. I like the smell of organic unrefined Shea Butter. This butter is dense and I like to use it at night like an intensive treatment.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase again</li>
