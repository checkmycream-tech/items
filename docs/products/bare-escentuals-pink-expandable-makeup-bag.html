            <li>Just the right size to stuff in my purse or leave at my desk.</li>

            <li>I love the way it has different compartments and rings specifically for your brushes.</li>
            <li>It appears to be almost exactly as the one she had.</li>

            <li>Fits my travel size bare minerals products, great for a weekend trip but somewhat small for longer trips.</li>
            <li>It really does hold a lot of my makeup.</li>
            <li>The only way my things fit was the expandable zipper.</li>
            <li>This is a nice bag but much too small for my needs.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a black Bare Escentuals makeup bag I own</li>
            <li>I just love this little bag.</li>
            <li>I like the way it gives you a little more room if &amp; when you need it.</li>

            <li>The bag is cute but its to small.</li>
            <li>Yes, my make up is dirty and I use a variety of cheap brands in addition to bare minerals, but I was amazed that I was able to get it all in the bag!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind because it is very pretty in pink!</li>
            <li>It really only has room for a few brushes, if you are like n need room for a more than 5 brushes this not the product for you.</li>
            <li>When I was reading the reviews that other customers wrote, I couldn&#x27;t really comprehend how much make up</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>This fits all my Bare Minerals makeup, and it is compact.</li>
            <li>This bag is a small makeup bag that you&#x27;d would keep in a purse for quick fixings.</li>

            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel I need to be careful when using the zipper or getting my items in and out of the slots and pocket.  </li>

            <li> Great Makeup bag. It really does hold a lot of my makeup. It is easy to just put everything in and go.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  Very, very small and not user  friendly.</li>
            <li> I have used this at home and on vacation.  I love it  Plenty of room for my makeup and brushes and compact enough to fit in luggage.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my sister, in a few months it started becoming black</li>
            <li> This is a very nice makeup bag. I love the way it has different compartments and rings specifically for your brushes. The brown one is bigger but this is just the right size for your pocket book.</li>
            <li> This makeup bag is perfect for what I need.  I can see everything without having to blindly dip deep for items.  A cool feature is that it&#x27;s expandable for those of us who like to carry more than just the essentials.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the construction of this bag.  I&#x27;m not hard on the bag but I don&#x27;t feel I need to be careful when using the zipper or getting my items in and out of the slots and pocket.  The size is perfect for me. I can take it with me if I know I&#x27;m going to be out all day and may need a touch up.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> This fits all my Bare Minerals makeup, and it is compact. I just love this little bag.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of these bags.  I love these bags.  They close up well and are very handy.  You have to go easy on the zippers though, the zipper broke on one of my bags.</li>
            <li> My wife wore one of these out, and we finally found another.  It appears to be almost exactly as the one she had.</li>
            <li> Despite other reviews, I will still surprised at the amount of makeup you can fit in this bag.  A great buy!</li>
            <li> When I was reading the reviews that other customers wrote, I couldn&#x27;t really comprehend how much make up the bag would hold. I took a picture of my make up, which was laying out on the counter on a green wash cloth. Yes, my make up is dirty and I use a variety of cheap brands in addition to bare minerals, but I was amazed that I was able to get it all in the bag! There is no handle. That is my ONLY complaint, but I will not let it affect my rating. I can now stash my make up NEATLY under the sink. I love how the bag opens to lay flat on both sides so it will all be easy to access when I am applying it. Please see my pictures to see all that I was able to get in the bag: Bare minerals foundation, well rested, and warmth, two eye shadows, a blush, mascera, Primer, eye liner shapener, 6 brushes, two brow pencils, one eyeliner, one lip liner, three eye shadow applicators and and eyelash brush. I had to expand it to get all of these items in the bag. I also took a picture that shows where I am pointing to the bag. I think this would be a great place for bareMinerals to add a handle. Just my humble opinion. Overall, I LOVE the bag!</li>
            <li> Small but organization is great. You also have to clean it quite often. I don&#x27;t mind because it is very pretty in pink!</li>
            <li> Big enough to carry the essentials (foundation, blush, veil), not big enough to also carry the brushes for them.</li>
            <li> Everything goes where you need it to go. I like the way it gives you a little more room if &amp; when you need it.</li>
            <li> Very handy for a short trip.  Love it.</li>
            <li> It seems smaller than I had pictured, but think it will work well on long travels.  I will know for certain after our trip to Patagonia.</li>
            <li> I always look for the measurements on items I am going to purchase but I guess I didn&#x27;t on this. I figured I&#x27;d fill the bag up as I bought things but what I already have so far has it packed full! The only way my things fit was the expandable zipper. This bag is a small makeup bag that you&#x27;d would keep in a purse for quick fixings. I like the quality but the size is miniature !!</li>
            <li> Great for what I needed, works perfectly for me to carry my makeup to the gym with me in the morning, and keep it organized.</li>
            <li> The bag is cute but its to small. It really only has room for a few brushes, if you are like n need room for a more than 5 brushes this not the product for you.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this makeup bag! It is just the right size for all my makeup when I travel and keeps all products secure and neat. I plan on purchasing several for granddaughters as gifts.</li>
            <li> This bag is bigger than I thought it would be. It is the perfect size for me and I absolutely love it, I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Fits my travel size bare minerals products, great for a weekend trip but somewhat small for longer trips. Shipped fast and arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> Holds a lot of makeup for the size, very good product. It&#x27;s expandable, I like that too. Very good quality and value.</li>
            <li> Good makeup bag. I bought this bag for my daughter. She really liked the size, color, and inside pockets.</li>
            <li> I live this bag. Perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li> This is a nice bag but much too small for my needs.  The dimensions listed were a little generous. I bought this to replace a black Bare Escentuals makeup bag I own and I thought they would be the same size but this is way too small.</li>
            <li> I have the brown one and wanted the pink.  I love the compact size and the fact that you can make this larger.  Fits all your basic make up, eye liner, mascara, powder, eyeshadow, blush, concealer, tweezer and lip stick.</li>
            <li> Just the right size to stuff in my purse or leave at my desk. And because it expands, when I need to put in a couple of extra items, I can use it - no changing to another bag.</li>
