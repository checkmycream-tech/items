            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>The products smell great and do a nice job of cleansing the hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks so good now.  </li>
            <li>The Fig has a nice sweet scent, and I like  it the best.</li>
            <li>I saw the price for the three 6oz cleansing conditioners for medium/coarse hair, and decided to throw caution to the wind and went for it, and I am so glad that I did!</li>
            <li>Lovely scents, too!  </li>
            <li>Just being able to use the Cleansing Conditioner saved me tons of time in the shower!  </li>
            <li>After using it with one use all I can say is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It felt nicely conditioned as I rinsed it out.  </li>
            <li>not that oily shine, but a nice one.</li>
            <li>And my scalp feels nice and tingly afterwards.    </li>
            <li>I will make sure I keep a good amount on hand.  </li>
            <li>Also, however much water you&#x27;re using, USE MORE!!!</li>
            <li>The more water the better!</li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried thus far!  </li>
            <li>but  Wen made it soft and the volume is impressive!</li>
            <li>I used the tea trea oil one about a month ago and actually liked that one better than the fig (of which I just used the day before yesterday).  </li>
            <li>Great set to try the different cleansing conditioners, but I still like the sweet almond mint best</li>
            <li>Huge!     </li>
            <li>And my hair is detangled and more manageable  </li>
            <li>I bought the WEN trio for my hair type (Lavendar, Fig, and Tree Tea -- Fig is my favorite) on Amazon because I didn&#x27;t want to get locked into a monthly auto-delivery situation.  </li>
            <li>My hair seemed to hold more moisture.  </li>
            <li>In conclusion, my hair is softer, shiner, more manageable, and has more body.</li>
            <li>so I add one pump of the fig, and it gets better.</li>
            <li>Ok... \\&quot;sigh\\&quot; ...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>literature)The fig was better, my hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Well satisfied.  </li>
            <li>refreshing?</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try the Wen products.  </li>
            <li>I plan on using these wonderful products for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>This is the best hair product I have ever used that helps dry, frizzy uncontrollable hair.</li>
            <li>And so clean it squeaked!  </li>
            <li>Just 3 pumps at the end of my shower and good for the whole day.    </li>
            <li>I also like how easy it is to straighten my hair when the mood hits me.      </li>
            <li>No matter where I go, everyone asks me what I use on my hair or how I cankeep it so soft and healthy looking or why it always smells so good,</li>
            <li>I have fine oily hair.</li>
            <li>it is smooth, light, shiney.  </li>
            <li>Its fantastic because my hair doesn&#x27;t tangle and looks healthier. .</li>
            <li>(I thought it was a scam to get me to usemore and then buy more, but you really do get better results.)  </li>
            <li>I was very excited when I received it and used it right away .  </li>
            <li>the product is good, your hair feels super soft, detangled, and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Now my hair is very soft, which I absolutely love, and my curls are better defined.    </li>
            <li>I never been so excited.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got it.</li>
            <li>I would caution people not to be overly excited about this product.  </li>
            <li>after using the product, you feel refreshed and clean..</li>
            <li>I think the mint scent/refreshment is supposed to make your hair \\&quot;feel\\&quot; clean..</li>
            <li>After viewing many positive results I felt hopeful that it could work for me.  </li>
            <li>and I love it so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Believe me when I say, I did not have full faith in the WEN system.</li>
            <li>Got this 3 pack to compare to sweet almond.  </li>
            <li>The booklet said that the more you try the more it works, so I tried the fig the next day.  </li>
            <li>OK, first shipping on this product was super fast!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Well... I lose A LOT of hair in the shower while using the product and the smell is slightly overwhelming during the shower, after wards it is not AS overwhelming but it is a little too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it looked like straw despite the deep conditioning treatments I used weekly.  </li>
            <li>it is well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>do not recommend buying this product, but if you must, try the sampler sizes first, so you do not get stuck with the full size version of the product.</li>
            <li>I love that I only need one product to clean and condition.  </li>
            <li>good thing I need to little because its so pricey (though worth every penny).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Wen twice more since then with the same success</li>
            <li>I was ready to throw in the towel and send it back but decided to give it one more try, lucky number three and all that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just reordered more WEN and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Lavender was nice, I did not really notice any change in my hair.</li>
            <li>The first day I tried the product (lavender)</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these products and glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Chaz Dean for making me a believer of Wen!</li>
            <li>I used this product when I first received it, it didn&#x27;t do Anything to my hair, I used it again, and it looked to me like my hair was falling out .</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;m fair with freckles, my next try is the Mixed Chicks brand to see if that helps anything.</li>
            <li>Do rinse COMPLETELY with cool water.</li>
            <li>but I could never achieve the thick, rich creaminess that the instructions said I should have during the comb out stage prior to rinsing out, so I would add more and more until I achieved the required results.</li>
            <li>If i put it all over it would get oily, but just a tiny bit on ends works wonders for my fine, oily, blond locks. . .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use my straightening iron nearly as much.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The fig is very moisturizing</li>
            <li>The product really worked for me</li>
            <li>and I really wasn&#x27;t believing those reviews before me, because companies like to go and pump up there products, ya kno</li>
            <li>I have not used real shampoo in a year.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for creating them.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>After using this product one time there was a VERY noticeable difference in the condition of my hair; it literally looked as though I had just stepped out of the salon.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t give you that much.   </li>
            <li>its really just a mint peppermint something conditioner.</li>
            <li>but really it doesn&#x27;t..</li>
            <li>However, I much preferred the almond variety they make.</li>
            <li>So the first two times I used Wen was a complete disaster.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or leave a film like most conditioners.</li>
            <li>I am African American and Wen is good product to use for my hair,it curls my hair and when i flat iron my hair</li>
            <li>After, I noticed I was scratching less, and my head felt way better.</li>
            <li>I am an African American woman and have semi-curly hair and most shampoos /conditions on the market do not work for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I would like to send it back, but I&#x27;m sure that that is not possible, so I&#x27;ll just have to chalk it up to a trial that didn&#x27;t go.  </li>
            <li>I have only used the the Mint-Almond, but after the very first time, I was sold.  </li>
            <li>After using the Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner and hydrating mask, my hair looked healthy, felt soft, and was EXTREMELY manageable.</li>
            <li>the product has mint and other refreshing natural ingredients to give you that \\&quot;just out of the spa\\&quot; feeling..</li>
            <li>it is soft and straight.</li>
            <li>It made sense because I only use conditioner and rarely use shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely continue to use it as long as my pockets hold up :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had like 20 different Hair dressers and none of them could make my hair feel the way its does right now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to place an order for bigger bottles right now.  </li>
            <li>have very frizzy hair and after reading all the positive reviews I thought here&#x27;s a product that&#x27;s actually going to work on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I live in Florida where hair gets quite frizzy, and this is the answer.  </li>
            <li>Turns out I was using too much product and not enough water, waaay too much.      </li>
            <li>It came very fast and I tried it the next day.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, something was different.  </li>
            <li>What can I say I love this product and will never go back to the other products I was using.</li>
            <li>I did my hair as usual and it was okay.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels exactly like it does with my regular salon shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft!  </li>
            <li>The only time I ever saw my hair blown straight was when a professional did it.  </li>
            <li>I have thus far used all three.</li>
            <li>I thought my hair was going to come out soft and shiny...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a Latina and bought this set because I thought it would control my wild</li>
            <li>its soft and I can touch it without scratching up my hand,</li>
            <li>Even though I don&#x27;t purchase from Amazon anymore, I go directly to WEN.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for over 4 years.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, unruly, and a bit overprocessed hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thick and I feel I have more control using this process.        </li>
            <li>Well, she washed my hair with the Fig cleanser, following the directions, and after she to the rollers out of my hair, I notices right away that my hair felt softer and even cleaner than with traditional shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>From the first use, my hair looked less frizzy and was much softer.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t afford to buy it on a regular basis, so I buy only when I have a special occasion / event approaching.</li>
            <li>First off, I have relaxed, medium textured hair, which doesn&#x27;t take a lot of effort to get straight with a relaxer, or a hair dryer and round brush.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much more manageable now when dry and especially when wet!  </li>
            <li>since it costs a little more than expected, i only use it as a leave in..</li>
            <li>I have natural hair that is coarse and probably</li>
            <li>My hair was left soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I took the Fig cleanser to my domincan stylist, who sort of turned up her nose at Wen, because she is old school and believes that in order for your hair to get cleaned properly, it must lather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried the Fig Cleanser as directed and after using it, my hair felt and still feels unusually soft.  </li>
            <li>only tried it today for the first time and I will continue using it until the bottles are all empty.</li>
            <li>For those with poor results I would urge you to stick it out and try it once more.  </li>
            <li>After the first use, it took less than 10 minutes to straighten my hair,</li>
            <li>My main problem is that the ends get very dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>So take a chance, even if you jus buy a little bottle like I did, first.</li>
            <li>My hair was hard, crunchy and full of residue.  </li>
            <li>I am a \\&quot;straight\\&quot; natural with kinky, long hair!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> the product is good, your hair feels super soft, detangled, and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Now my hair is very soft, which I absolutely love, and my curls are better defined.    </li>
            <li> I never been so excited.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got it.</li>
            <li> I would caution people not to be overly excited about this product.  </li>
            <li> after using the product, you feel refreshed and clean..</li>
            <li> I think the mint scent/refreshment is supposed to make your hair \\&quot;feel\\&quot; clean..</li>
            <li> After viewing many positive results I felt hopeful that it could work for me.  </li>
            <li> and I love it so much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Believe me when I say, I did not have full faith in the WEN system.</li>
            <li> Got this 3 pack to compare to sweet almond.  </li>
            <li> The booklet said that the more you try the more it works, so I tried the fig the next day.  </li>
            <li> OK, first shipping on this product was super fast!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Well... I lose A LOT of hair in the shower while using the product and the smell is slightly overwhelming during the shower, after wards it is not AS overwhelming but it is a little too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it looked like straw despite the deep conditioning treatments I used weekly.  </li>
            <li> it is well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> do not recommend buying this product, but if you must, try the sampler sizes first, so you do not get stuck with the full size version of the product.</li>
            <li> I love that I only need one product to clean and condition.  </li>
            <li> good thing I need to little because its so pricey (though worth every penny).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen twice more since then with the same success</li>
            <li> I was ready to throw in the towel and send it back but decided to give it one more try, lucky number three and all that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just reordered more WEN and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Lavender was nice, I did not really notice any change in my hair.</li>
            <li> The first day I tried the product (lavender)</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these products and glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Chaz Dean for making me a believer of Wen!</li>
            <li> I used this product when I first received it, it didn&#x27;t do Anything to my hair, I used it again, and it looked to me like my hair was falling out .</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m fair with freckles, my next try is the Mixed Chicks brand to see if that helps anything.</li>
            <li> Do rinse COMPLETELY with cool water.</li>
            <li> but I could never achieve the thick, rich creaminess that the instructions said I should have during the comb out stage prior to rinsing out, so I would add more and more until I achieved the required results.</li>
            <li> If i put it all over it would get oily, but just a tiny bit on ends works wonders for my fine, oily, blond locks. . .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use my straightening iron nearly as much.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The fig is very moisturizing</li>
            <li> The product really worked for me</li>
            <li> and I really wasn&#x27;t believing those reviews before me, because companies like to go and pump up there products, ya kno</li>
            <li> I have not used real shampoo in a year.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for creating them.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> After using this product one time there was a VERY noticeable difference in the condition of my hair; it literally looked as though I had just stepped out of the salon.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t give you that much.   </li>
            <li> its really just a mint peppermint something conditioner.</li>
            <li> but really it doesn&#x27;t..</li>
            <li> However, I much preferred the almond variety they make.</li>
            <li> So the first two times I used Wen was a complete disaster.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or leave a film like most conditioners.</li>
            <li> I am African American and Wen is good product to use for my hair,it curls my hair and when i flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> After, I noticed I was scratching less, and my head felt way better.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman and have semi-curly hair and most shampoos /conditions on the market do not work for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I would like to send it back, but I&#x27;m sure that that is not possible, so I&#x27;ll just have to chalk it up to a trial that didn&#x27;t go.  </li>
            <li> I have only used the the Mint-Almond, but after the very first time, I was sold.  </li>
            <li> After using the Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner and hydrating mask, my hair looked healthy, felt soft, and was EXTREMELY manageable.</li>
            <li> the product has mint and other refreshing natural ingredients to give you that \\&quot;just out of the spa\\&quot; feeling..</li>
            <li> it is soft and straight.</li>
            <li> It made sense because I only use conditioner and rarely use shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely continue to use it as long as my pockets hold up :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had like 20 different Hair dressers and none of them could make my hair feel the way its does right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to place an order for bigger bottles right now.  </li>
            <li> have very frizzy hair and after reading all the positive reviews I thought here&#x27;s a product that&#x27;s actually going to work on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I live in Florida where hair gets quite frizzy, and this is the answer.  </li>
            <li> Turns out I was using too much product and not enough water, waaay too much.      </li>
            <li> It came very fast and I tried it the next day.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, something was different.  </li>
            <li> What can I say I love this product and will never go back to the other products I was using.</li>
            <li> I did my hair as usual and it was okay.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels exactly like it does with my regular salon shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft!  </li>
            <li> The only time I ever saw my hair blown straight was when a professional did it.  </li>
            <li> I have thus far used all three.</li>
            <li> I thought my hair was going to come out soft and shiny...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a Latina and bought this set because I thought it would control my wild</li>
            <li> its soft and I can touch it without scratching up my hand,</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t purchase from Amazon anymore, I go directly to WEN.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for over 4 years.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, unruly, and a bit overprocessed hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and I feel I have more control using this process.        </li>
            <li> Well, she washed my hair with the Fig cleanser, following the directions, and after she to the rollers out of my hair, I notices right away that my hair felt softer and even cleaner than with traditional shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> From the first use, my hair looked less frizzy and was much softer.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford to buy it on a regular basis, so I buy only when I have a special occasion / event approaching.</li>
            <li> First off, I have relaxed, medium textured hair, which doesn&#x27;t take a lot of effort to get straight with a relaxer, or a hair dryer and round brush.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much more manageable now when dry and especially when wet!  </li>
            <li> since it costs a little more than expected, i only use it as a leave in..</li>
            <li> I have natural hair that is coarse and probably</li>
            <li> My hair was left soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I took the Fig cleanser to my domincan stylist, who sort of turned up her nose at Wen, because she is old school and believes that in order for your hair to get cleaned properly, it must lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the Fig Cleanser as directed and after using it, my hair felt and still feels unusually soft.  </li>
            <li> only tried it today for the first time and I will continue using it until the bottles are all empty.</li>
            <li> For those with poor results I would urge you to stick it out and try it once more.  </li>
            <li> After the first use, it took less than 10 minutes to straighten my hair,</li>
            <li> My main problem is that the ends get very dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> So take a chance, even if you jus buy a little bottle like I did, first.</li>
            <li> My hair was hard, crunchy and full of residue.  </li>
            <li> I am a \\&quot;straight\\&quot; natural with kinky, long hair!  </li>
            <li> but ONE thing that is very important is that after about a week of using the product as directed, your hair really feels weighted down, dirty, and oily at the roots...</li>
            <li> Wen is much more expensive and there really was no more bang for all of the extra buck.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t rate products, but since I had a hard time deciding to even give this a try, I read most of the reviews on this.  </li>
            <li> My hair is usually a bit dry and damaged looking even after using conditioning and hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> (Or in my case, living on an Aircraft Carrier and only having access to recycled water [which lacks the minerals everyday american tap water has]) for nearly 16 months.)</li>
            <li> I could not do it myself, I would need a flat iron and about forty five minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got shoulder length very coarse extremely nappy not curly african american hair.</li>
            <li> The product left my hair extremely dry</li>
            <li> Before it always felt like I was constantly adding moisturizers and sheen to keep my hair from looking so dry, but not anymore.  </li>
            <li> This product practically, almost single-handedly, saved my hair from dry water damage which you usually get from too much salt water exposure.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase a larger size and other products from Wen.</li>
            <li> I visited YouTube looking for other African American users.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m feeling the texture of my hair now and it feels very dry ,coarse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried mixing with other products to lessen the smell, but it will not mix with other products, there is a chemcial reaction of some sort, and it pills into soft pellets.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to using this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Not soft, shiny, bouncy, and manageble like the bottle</li>
            <li> I used the product as directed for a few days, and stopped using it altogether because my hair became very greasy, weighted down, and its texture became straw</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product as most hair care products are not compatible with black hair.</li>
            <li> I could only imagine what the other 2 are going to make my hair smell like :\&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it to other African Americans.</li>
            <li> My hair is color-treated, dry, frizzy, curly and then straightened into submission with a hair dryer and straightening iron.  </li>
            <li> (I have relaxed, damaged, dry, afro-american hair.)</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and frizzy afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it is curly, dry and highlighted.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried adjusting the amount I use, but my hair still feels dry, no matter which formulation I used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and curly, but it looked a hot dry brittle mess before using these products.  </li>
            <li> but its just the product washing down your neck and back after its been sitting in your hair for 5 mins.  </li>
            <li> I used 32 pumps exactly no more, no less, 8 pumps per quadrant.  </li>
            <li> Though not as drying and harsh as other products created for European hair, this cleanser still dried out my hair and removed the natural oils.    </li>
            <li> I kept using the products and there really is no problem</li>
            <li> After doing some research, I was too curious not to try them.</li>
            <li> You have to use 10 pumps depending on how long &amp; thick your hair is, so it doesn&#x27;t last long?</li>
            <li> Even with obstacles such as it&#x27;s time for a retouch and hard water</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to try the other products this man has.  </li>
            <li> Also, in the past I had to bring a beauty supply store to the salon with me(shampoo,conditioner, deep conditioner,wrap/setting mousse and leave in conditioner) and with this one product, I don&#x27;t have to do that any longer.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the infomercial on TV I was fascinated but too skeptical to try the products.</li>
            <li> Still not the expected results!</li>
            <li> I was excited to finally try WEN, however, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> The other ones in the collection smell alright, but still no help for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, after heat styling it feels a little dry</li>
            <li> Before this product, my hair was stiff, did not have any body to it, dry and all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the negative reviews fool you, definitely purchase Wen.</li>
            <li> I tried this one because I have thick, curly red hair.</li>
            <li> It did not weight down her hair or turned it into straw, but she did not think it delivered as promised either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair felt dry and a little stiff after using it.</li>
            <li> I was seriously contemplating a $300 deep conditioning treatment at my salon when I decided I had nothing to lose by trying this.  </li>
            <li> I brought the product a less than a week ago, because I saw it on tv.  </li>
            <li> I also want to see if by chance I&#x27;ll notice a slight change in the texture of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed that I had less shedding with the tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> so almost half of the bottle is used up already just in one shower..</li>
            <li> Sorry to be so wordy, but I was looking for feedback from others with hair like mine prior to purchasing this product, and I only found 1 review that I could relate to.  </li>
            <li> I have Filipino thick, wavy, long, waist length hair...</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, porous, dry hair that can get frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair that has lots of wave and some curl.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> And it wasn&#x27;t dry in the least!  </li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t use conditioner at all for this reason, but find my hair gets a bit tangly and dull without anything.  </li>
            <li> I have very little breakage now.</li>
            <li> So I needed a product that could help take control of my hair and make it do what I want it to do NOT what it feels like doing, which is usually a Fro.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I must admit, I was a bit skeptical, because I&#x27;m already a product junkie, and I&#x27;ve been disappointed too many times.  </li>
            <li> My only problem with it, is that it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> My tips for using WEN: (1) Do use as much as they recommend.</li>
            <li> and I was forced to rewash my hair with the product I usually use and works well, \\&quot;Motions\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> What I got was dull and brillo pad Listerine smelling</li>
            <li> My stylist has converted a few of his customers, too!!</li>
            <li> but I was not impressed with the other scents.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, curly ethnic hair and the humid weather makes it impossible for my hair to hold any moisture whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Seriously...</li>
            <li> My scalp felt very dirty except when I used the tea tree scent, and this was only a momentary fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> unfortunately it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All I can say is that, \\&quot;Chaz Dean, I am so sorry for doubting you.  </li>
            <li> Sad to say that I will not be purchasing it again.  </li>
            <li> Time and , yes lots of hair falling out, also it feels, dirty, and greasy.</li>
            <li> Believe me you&#x27;ll be mad when you run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it seems like this is a very expensive product that may work for some, but not for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> yes my hair can be that bad even after hours of conditioning.</li>
            <li> and I also have a really bad flaky scalp</li>
            <li> My son asked what the bad smell was when he came into the room, and I leaned under his nose and asked it that was it, and he almost gagged.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The fig has the worst smell I&#x27;ve ever had on my hair.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have natural hair that is coarse and probably 4a/b  And my hair is detangled and more manageable  after I wash it with the Wen.   The Fig has a nice sweet scent, and I like  it the best.</li>
            <li> I view informercials with great skepticism but one day I found myself watching the segment on WEN.  My hair is color-treated, dry, frizzy, curly and then straightened into submission with a hair dryer and straightening iron.  Honestly, it looked like straw despite the deep conditioning treatments I used weekly.  I was seriously contemplating a $300 deep conditioning treatment at my salon when I decided I had nothing to lose by trying this.  I bought the WEN trio for my hair type (Lavendar, Fig, and Tree Tea -- Fig is my favorite) on Amazon because I didn&#x27;t want to get locked into a monthly auto-delivery situation.  The first time I used this, something was different.  My hair seemed to hold more moisture.  From the first use, my hair looked less frizzy and was much softer.  After continued use (about a month now), my hair texture improves each time I cleanse my hair.  I just returned to my salon and my stylist said she couldn&#x27;t believe what great shape my hair was in.  I don&#x27;t need to use my straightening iron nearly as much.  I&#x27;ve just reordered more WEN and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to shampoo.  My tips for using WEN: (1) Do use as much as they recommend. (I thought it was a scam to get me to usemore and then buy more, but you really do get better results.)  2) Do rinse COMPLETELY with cool water.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It came very fast and I tried it the next day. It is a VERY good product. I have thus far used all three. The fig is very moisturizing and I use it after every wash as a leave-in conditioner. Lavender was nice, I did not really notice any change in my hair. (I have relaxed, damaged, dry, afro-american hair.) The Tea Tree I used as an over night treatment because of what the website said it did for the scalp. After, I noticed I was scratching less, and my head felt way better. So... why four stars? Well... I lose A LOT of hair in the shower while using the product and the smell is slightly overwhelming during the shower, after wards it is not AS overwhelming but it is a little too strong for my liking. In conclusion, my hair is softer, shiner, more manageable, and has more body. Also, after heat styling it feels a little dry so I add one pump of the fig, and it gets better.</li>
            <li> I brought the product a less than a week ago, because I saw it on tv.  Before this product, my hair was stiff, did not have any body to it, dry and all. I washed my hair yesterday, and boy it is smooth, light, shiney.  I cannot wait to try the other products this man has.  The product really worked for me and I love it so much. I never been so excited.  I look forward to using this product for a long time.  And boy, was that a good deal. What can I say I love this product and will never go back to the other products I was using.</li>
            <li> Ok... \\&quot;sigh\\&quot; ... I tried this product today and used it just like it said on the bottle. I was very disappointed. I thought my hair was going to come out soft and shiny... unfortunately it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a Latina and bought this set because I thought it would control my wild hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very frizzy hair and after reading all the positive reviews I thought here&#x27;s a product that&#x27;s actually going to work on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it didn&#x27;t. It feels the same as if I used a regular shampoo and conditioner. The only difference is that the shampoo and conditioner that I use on my hair smells like fruit where this Wenz stuff makes your hair smell like Listerine. I used the Lavender one too because out of the 3, that one smelled the prettiest.  I could only imagine what the other 2 are going to make my hair smell like :\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m feeling the texture of my hair now and it feels very dry ,coarse and it&#x27;s still frizzy and flyaway. Not soft, shiny, bouncy, and manageble like the bottle said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle but just a bit of shine or bounce. What I got was dull and brillo pad Listerine smelling hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only tried it today for the first time and I will continue using it until the bottles are all empty. I paid for it so I may as well use them all. I also want to see if by chance I&#x27;ll notice a slight change in the texture of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would not buy this again. :\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If I see a difference in the texture of my hair I will rewrite my review... (but somehow I doubt that&#x27;s going to happen)</li>
            <li> As stated by others I watched the infomercial but was not convinced.  I went to the WEN website and the reviews were not all that favorable.  After reading the reviews on Amazon I thought I would give it a try, so I bought the pack with three different kinds.  I have only used the the Mint-Almond, but after the very first time, I was sold.  My hair feels like a child&#x27;s.  It feels sooooooooo good that I tell people to touch it.  I will never ever use anything else on my hair. I live in Florida where hair gets quite frizzy, and this is the answer.  I love it. Thank you, thank you.....</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, porous, dry hair that can get frizzy.  I was very excited to try the Wen products.  The first day I tried the product (lavender) (yes, I followed the instructions to a T) My hair was dry and frizzy afterwards.  The booklet said that the more you try the more it works, so I tried the fig the next day.  (My stylist said that whith hair like mine I shouldn&#x27;t shampoo every day but I followed the advice in the Wen literature)The fig was better, my hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy.  It felt nicely conditioned as I rinsed it out.  I did my hair as usual and it was okay.  I kept using the products and there really is no problem, it&#x27;s just that, there is not improvement either. My hair looks and feels exactly like it does with my regular salon shampoo and conditioner.  Wen is much more expensive and there really was no more bang for all of the extra buck.</li>
            <li> this is wonderful for my hair, it gives it a great healthy feel that doesn&#x27;t strip it of any thing but dirt. This is the only shampoo/ conditioner I use now, so i can say it has made my hair grow a bit faster and leaves it shinier and smoother as well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product as most hair care products are not compatible with black hair. Though not as drying and harsh as other products created for European hair, this cleanser still dried out my hair and removed the natural oils.    I would not recommend it to other African Americans.</li>
            <li> WEN has lived up to the hype. My hair was left soft and manageable. I would definitely recommend these products and glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have fine oily hair. I typically don&#x27;t use conditioner at all for this reason, but find my hair gets a bit tangly and dull without anything.  I use just a tidbit of this on the ends. Its fantastic because my hair doesn&#x27;t tangle and looks healthier. . not that oily shine, but a nice one. It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or leave a film like most conditioners. If i put it all over it would get oily, but just a tiny bit on ends works wonders for my fine, oily, blond locks. . . good thing I need to little because its so pricey (though worth every penny).</li>
            <li> I had seen the ads for this product for a while now and I believed it could, maybe help my hair. I&#x27;ve got shoulder length very coarse extremely nappy not curly african american hair. So I needed a product that could help take control of my hair and make it do what I want it to do NOT what it feels like doing, which is usually a Fro.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions, and my hair feels great! Honestly! its soft and I can touch it without scratching up my hand, yes my hair can be that bad even after hours of conditioning. But with WEN, its bye bye brittle hair! Hello ssoft and silky hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe me when I say, I did not have full faith in the WEN system. and I really wasn&#x27;t believing those reviews before me, because companies like to go and pump up there products, ya kno so ppl go on and buy them because of the supposedly \\&quot;good\\&quot; reviews. But this is one product that I say speaks for itsself. so if you believe no one believe this WEN works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and one last thing...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had like 20 different Hair dressers and none of them could make my hair feel the way its does right now. Seriously... no one. So take a chance, even if you jus buy a little bottle like I did, first. Believe me you&#x27;ll be mad when you run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;09/2013 UPDATE: Almost Six years later, I&#x27;m still using this product! It&#x27;s still the best thing to happen to my hair. Even though I don&#x27;t purchase from Amazon anymore, I go directly to WEN. This product practically, almost single-handedly, saved my hair from dry water damage which you usually get from too much salt water exposure. (Or in my case, living on an Aircraft Carrier and only having access to recycled water [which lacks the minerals everyday american tap water has]) for nearly 16 months.) Using WEN on the ship saved my hair from drying out and breaking off. SO! I still recommend this product not just to people with my same hair type but to EVERYONE! No matter where I go, everyone asks me what I use on my hair or how I cankeep it so soft and healthy looking or why it always smells so good, even my Aunt who is a smoker can smell it! IJS!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I vascillated back and forth about purchasing this product. I saw the price for the three 6oz cleansing conditioners for medium/coarse hair, and decided to throw caution to the wind and went for it, and I am so glad that I did! First off, I have relaxed, medium textured hair, which doesn&#x27;t take a lot of effort to get straight with a relaxer, or a hair dryer and round brush. I took the Fig cleanser to my domincan stylist, who sort of turned up her nose at Wen, because she is old school and believes that in order for your hair to get cleaned properly, it must lather. Well, she washed my hair with the Fig cleanser, following the directions, and after she to the rollers out of my hair, I notices right away that my hair felt softer and even cleaner than with traditional shampoo and conditioner. Also, in the past I had to bring a beauty supply store to the salon with me(shampoo,conditioner, deep conditioner,wrap/setting mousse and leave in conditioner) and with this one product, I don&#x27;t have to do that any longer. My hair had bounce, shine and even now it still looks great! I have tried everything that there is to try out there, and I have to look no further. My stylist was even very impressed with the results! I also use the Lavender as a shaving cream and it works great!! I will definitely purchase a larger size and other products from Wen. Wen....I am all in!!</li>
            <li> I just received Wen in the mail this morning. I was so excited when I got it. After using it with one use all I can say is amazing. It did some impressive things to my hair wow! I am African American and my hair was so coarse  but  Wen made it soft and the volume is impressive! Don&#x27;t let the negative reviews fool you, definitely purchase Wen. Thank you so much Chaz Dean for making me a believer of Wen!</li>
            <li> So the first two times I used Wen was a complete disaster. I chose Tea Tree hoping it would help my psoriasis. My hair was hard, crunchy and full of residue.  You know that stripped feeling you get from over-shampooing or over-conditioning your hair?  That was me.  I was ready to throw in the towel and send it back but decided to give it one more try, lucky number three and all that.  Well the third time truly was the charm.  Turns out I was using too much product and not enough water, waaay too much.      Prior to using Wen I visited YouTube looking for other African American users.  After viewing many positive results I felt hopeful that it could work for me.  I also watched the Wen instructional videos several times but I could never achieve the thick, rich creaminess that the instructions said I should have during the comb out stage prior to rinsing out, so I would add more and more until I achieved the required results. Big mistake!  Huge!     On the third try I decided to follow the instructions to the letter.  I used 32 pumps exactly no more, no less, 8 pumps per quadrant.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  My hair was so soft!  And so clean it squeaked!  And it wasn&#x27;t dry in the least!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it was the same product.  I&#x27;ve used Wen twice more since then with the same success and I&#x27;ve discovered that 6 quadrants, 1-2 pumps each works best for me.  My hair is thick and I feel I have more control using this process.        For those with poor results I would urge you to stick it out and try it once more.  Also, however much water you&#x27;re using, USE MORE!!! The more water the better! This was key for me!</li>
            <li> I am African American and Wen is good product to use for my hair,it curls my hair and when i flat iron my hair it is soft and straight. Good product and I need to get more.[[ASIN:B0018A8T3G WEN Set of Three for Fine-Medium Hair - 6oz]]</li>
            <li> Great set to try the different cleansing conditioners, but I still like the sweet almond mint best</li>
            <li> If you are a doubter--stop doubting. This stuff is amazing. I relax my hair (phyto-relaxer) and highlight. I have the driest hair on the planet then add the Miami Beach heat and humidity. I should be a walking hair scare. I am not! I use it at home between salon visits. I keep a bottle at the salon with my name on it. My stylist has converted a few of his customers, too!! Try this stuff it is well worth every penny. I have not used real shampoo in a year.</li>
            <li> Got this 3 pack to compare to sweet almond.  Well satisfied.  Lovely scents, too!  Wen is the best!</li>
            <li> I used this product when I first received it, it didn&#x27;t do Anything to my hair, I used it again, and it looked to me like my hair was falling out . I used it a 3rd. Time and , yes lots of hair falling out, also it feels, dirty, and greasy. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the infomercial I saw on television.  I am an African American woman and have semi-curly hair and most shampoos /conditions on the market do not work for my hair.  I was very excited when I received it and used it right away .  The product left my hair extremely dry and I was forced to rewash my hair with the product I usually use and works well, \\&quot;Motions\\&quot;.  The Lavender scent smells wonderful but I was not impressed with the other scents.  I would caution people not to be overly excited about this product.  Although this product is designed for \\&quot;Ethnic Hair\\&quot; it did not work for me and will probably not work for everyone.  Good luck and maybe it will work for you.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the infomercial on TV I was fascinated but too skeptical to try the products. I have very thick coarse hair that has lots of wave and some curl.  After doing some research, I was too curious not to try them. It made sense because I only use conditioner and rarely use shampoo. The products smell great and do a nice job of cleansing the hair.  I do not get any build up as I did with only using a conditioner.  It has been over a month and I have not touched a bottle of shampoo.  And my scalp feels nice and tingly afterwards.    The only time I ever saw my hair blown straight was when a professional did it.  I could not do it myself, I would need a flat iron and about forty five minutes.  After the first use, it took less than 10 minutes to straighten my hair, no styling product and I looked like  had just left the salon.      All I can say is that, \\&quot;Chaz Dean, I am so sorry for doubting you.  I plan on using these wonderful products for a very long time.  Thank you so much for creating them.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely AMAZING!!! After using this product one time there was a VERY noticeable difference in the condition of my hair; it literally looked as though I had just stepped out of the salon. I have thick, coarse, curly ethnic hair and the humid weather makes it impossible for my hair to hold any moisture whatsoever. My hair is usually a bit dry and damaged looking even after using conditioning and hot oil treatments. After using the Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner and hydrating mask, my hair looked healthy, felt soft, and was EXTREMELY manageable. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT and highly recommend it. Remember the more you use the better it works!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the 3-pack (fig, lavender, tea tree oil) of Wen, supposedly geared towards African American hair.  I used the tea trea oil one about a month ago and actually liked that one better than the fig (of which I just used the day before yesterday).  I noticed that I had less shedding with the tea tree oil.  Still not the expected results!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t rate products, but since I had a hard time deciding to even give this a try, I read most of the reviews on this.  Concluding, the reviews were 50/50.. For myself, its 50/50 as well.. the product is good, your hair feels super soft, detangled, and manageable.  I have Filipino thick, wavy, long, waist length hair... so almost half of the bottle is used up already just in one shower.. and they don&#x27;t give you that much.   but ONE thing that is very important is that after about a week of using the product as directed, your hair really feels weighted down, dirty, and oily at the roots... after using the product, you feel refreshed and clean.. like you just got out of the spa.. but its just the product washing down your neck and back after its been sitting in your hair for 5 mins.  the product has mint and other refreshing natural ingredients to give you that \\&quot;just out of the spa\\&quot; feeling.. just like rubbing vicks or bengay on your back.. refreshing? I guess.. anyway, the product is a great leave in conditioner though.. since it costs a little more than expected, i only use it as a leave in.. I shampoo with my regular shampoo because my hair feels cleaner that way.. I hope this review helps someone out there.. and for me.. i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll buy this again.. its really just a mint peppermint something conditioner. I tried the lavender, tea tree, and fig formulas.. all the same effect just a different scent.. I think the mint scent/refreshment is supposed to make your hair \\&quot;feel\\&quot; clean.. but really it doesn&#x27;t..</li>
            <li> The Wen hair care line is great. I tried this one because I have thick, curly red hair. However, I much preferred the almond variety they make.</li>
            <li> OK, first shipping on this product was super fast! I ordered it on Thursday evening and received it on Monday.     I&#x27;ve only tried the Fig Cleanser as directed and after using it, my hair felt and still feels unusually soft.  Even with obstacles such as it&#x27;s time for a retouch and hard water (my water filter on my shower head broke the week before), I still have a noticable change in the feel and look of my hair.      I have very thick, coarse, frizzy hair and I also have a really bad flaky scalp and this worked well for my scalp.  Because of my scalp I tend to use 2-3 different shampoos (1-2 for my scalp and 1 for my hair) and then a conditioner.  Just being able to use the Cleansing Conditioner saved me tons of time in the shower!  Apart from the way my hair looks and feels; the amount of time it saves me is great!      Sorry to be so wordy, but I was looking for feedback from others with hair like mine prior to purchasing this product, and I only found 1 review that I could relate to.  I think this is a great product and I will definitely continue to use it as long as my pockets hold up :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for about 45 days now.  My hair looks so good now.  I wear my hair natural. It&#x27;s thick and curly, but it looked a hot dry brittle mess before using these products.  Now my hair is very soft, which I absolutely love, and my curls are better defined.    I must admit, I was a bit skeptical, because I&#x27;m already a product junkie, and I&#x27;ve been disappointed too many times.  I love that I only need one product to clean and condition.  I also like how easy it is to straighten my hair when the mood hits me.      I have very little breakage now. Before it always felt like I was constantly adding moisturizers and sheen to keep my hair from looking so dry, but not anymore.  Just 3 pumps at the end of my shower and good for the whole day.    I&#x27;m about to place an order for bigger bottles right now.  These products will stay in my shower forever.</li>
            <li> I did not like this at all. it did nothing to nourish my hair, and it actually caused my scalp to itch and my hair to break off.  I use the &amp;#34;As I Am&amp;#34; brand cowash instead and it works great.  WEN was a no-win for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for over 4 years.  I am a \\&quot;straight\\&quot; natural with kinky, long hair!  This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried thus far!  My hair is so much more manageable now when dry and especially when wet!  I will make sure I keep a good amount on hand.  I won&#x27;t try another product from here on out!  I&#x27;ve found THE ONE!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I have ever used that helps dry, frizzy uncontrollable hair. My only problem with it, is that it is so expensive. You have to use 10 pumps depending on how long &amp; thick your hair is, so it doesn&#x27;t last long? I can&#x27;t afford to buy it on a regular basis, so I buy only when I have a special occasion / event approaching.</li>
            <li> This product did not work as promised on the television ad.  I have a lot of hair and it is curly, dry and highlighted.  My main problem is that the ends get very dry and frizzy.  I used the product as directed for a few days, and stopped using it altogether because my hair became very greasy, weighted down, and its texture became straw like.  My scalp felt very dirty except when I used the tea tree scent, and this was only a momentary fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the lavander scent to my sister-in-law who did not have the same effect on her hair as I did.  I think this may have to do with the fact that her hair is curlier than mine.  She also claims that her hair is dryer and frizzier.  It did not weight down her hair or turned it into straw, but she did not think it delivered as promised either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it seems like this is a very expensive product that may work for some, but not for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend buying this product, but if you must, try the sampler sizes first, so you do not get stuck with the full size version of the product.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman, with relaxed hair.  I was excited to finally try WEN, however, I was disappointed. My hair felt dry and a little stiff after using it. I&#x27;ve tried adjusting the amount I use, but my hair still feels dry, no matter which formulation I used.  After I use this I will go back to Ojon. It&#x27;s more expensive, but my hair was always shiny and silky after using it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, unruly, and a bit overprocessed hair.  A friend recommended that I try this, so I have.  Sad to say that I will not be purchasing it again.  It did nothing for my hair as I had hoped.  The fig has the worst smell I&#x27;ve ever had on my hair.  My son asked what the bad smell was when he came into the room, and I leaned under his nose and asked it that was it, and he almost gagged.  I&#x27;ve tried mixing with other products to lessen the smell, but it will not mix with other products, there is a chemcial reaction of some sort, and it pills into soft pellets.  The other ones in the collection smell alright, but still no help for my hair.  I am not fond of the &#x27;no&#x27; lather experience either.  I would like to send it back, but I&#x27;m sure that that is not possible, so I&#x27;ll just have to chalk it up to a trial that didn&#x27;t go.  Even though I&#x27;m fair with freckles, my next try is the Mixed Chicks brand to see if that helps anything.</li>
