            <li>well lets just say I won&#x27;t forget the top of my feet again!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and was very effective at preventing sunburn on my beach vacation.</li>
            <li>And following my Dr advice I was looking for a very good sun block, very good in texture, in delivering, in dealing with water and in price.</li>
            <li>Spectacular.</li>
            <li>So far no sunburns which is the best test.</li>
            <li>This is by far, the best sunscreen I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The texture is very loving, very good with, as for long time exposure effect still needs verification!</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I also found it cheaper on Amazon than in most stores.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you can find anything at a  better price.</li>
            <li>Overall, a happy customer!</li>
            <li>Many sunscreens use something else for their preservative so look around.</li>
            <li>This is an ok, inexpensive sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Okay sunscreen for the price.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I can safely say I&#x27;ve never been burnt while wearing banana boat, even snorkeling in Costa Rica.</li>
            <li>Sport and non greasy formulas are much more comfortable to wear all day.</li>
            <li>A superior product which I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Happy campers in bonnie Scotland use it every day apparently.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and cost effective when purchased via subscribe &amp; save.</li>
            <li>Thankfully Amazon is great with returns, because I have to send it back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s called the Irish allergy because fair skinned folks are more allergic to this.</li>
            <li>I usually tend to buy target brand which is great, but for the summer it is nice to increase the SPF.</li>
            <li>but I am also the one who turns a nice lobster color if not forced to wear it.</li>
            <li>I ALWAYS have sunblock with me, as I have over $2,000 worth of tattoos on my arm alone</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and spend most of my babyhood, childhood and up to my early 30&#x27;s surfing, diving swimming with no sunblock.</li>
            <li>the first sunblock that I am totally happy with and has helped me not to get dark spots when I am in the sun.</li>
            <li>Light, not greasy, and doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out.  </li>
            <li>but I can hope it is exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Good for your skin as an everyday therapy.</li>
            <li>This is the best value going for really serious broad spectrum SPF.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone that burns easily.</li>
            <li>I like this product and use it as much as needed.</li>
            <li>Do you really need to be reading a review on it?  </li>
            <li>It goes on really smooth and is very light and quite thin.</li>
            <li>But, thus far, I don&#x27;t really get much of the Neutrogena Sun Block in my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is sheer and actually makes my skin look dewy and lovely while wearing.  </li>
            <li>Light scent and works as expected.</li>
            <li>I will have to switch to the all natural oes at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>This is going to be used daily for as long as I am able to do so.</li>
            <li>This is going to be used daily for as  long as I am able to do so.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to find one that has less risk.  </li>
            <li>, so it&#x27;s always out the window!), and I will NOT let them bleach under the sun like an old biker!</li>
            <li>Wished there was an expiration date printed because I was only able to use half and the rest separated.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has a very heavy, greasy feeling, and you really need to apply a lot of it to get full coverage.</li>
            <li>The smile is not strong, which is very desirable for some people.</li>
            <li>Actually only 8% of all available sun-protection products are recommended, in part because the others include this and other harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>Great protection, not greasy or unpleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>In 2010, New York Senator Charles Schumer called on the FDA to address the possible link between skin cancer and this chemical.</li>
            <li>Use it every day to block the suns rays of the Middle East where I live.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend buying this for those who need a smaller bottle to carry down to the beach or with them in a back back.</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend buying this for those who need a smaller bottle to carry down to the beach or with them in a back back.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, it is not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it took me a few times to realize that I wasn&#x27;t getting a heat rash, I was having a reaction to the product.</li>
            <li> My bum resembles the moon (no crater jokes), and as long as I coat myself in this i stay that shade.</li>
            <li> I use lots of sunscreen every single day</li>
            <li> It is also very protective and my skin is not the least bit red, even after a few hours of sweating in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not looking for any other product (as long as price wont force me )</li>
            <li> Note the sunblock is very thick and it does take time to apply it clearly (without leaving white streaks).  </li>
            <li> My wife is a vampire, well not really.</li>
            <li> my face, I usually use Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry touch which is stickier/harder to put on than the Banana Boat.  </li>
            <li> Banana Boat sunscreens contain a preservative called  Methylchloroisothiazolinone also called Methylisothiazolinone (MI), and about 10 other names like 2-Methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, 5-Chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one., Acticide, Algucid, Amerstat 250, Euxyl K 100, Fennosan IT 21, Grotan TK2, Kathon, Kathon CG, Mergal K7, Metatin GT,</li>
            <li> So if you have a reaction to this, read labels on other products.</li>
            <li> This component, found in approximately 41% of sunscreens, has been found to possibly speed the growth of skin lesions.</li>
            <li> I am assigning a \\&quot;default\\&quot; rating for now and hope to update that after a few weeks so these comments may be considered for the seller alone.</li>
            <li> Very little odor and water resistant.  </li>
            <li> Oxybenzone, is found in approximately 60% of sunscreens and is used to enhance the penetration of other chemicals used in these products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost hard to even get a tan with this stuff on.</li>
            <li> We went for a week and knew how expensive buying it there would be.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately I and my children are allergic so i don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> No complaints on oilness or odor, I myself hate sunscreen</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> O ordered sunblock, but when the order arrived it was sunscreen .  We have not been able to use it.</li>
            <li> With a 45 min daily commute with sun exposure calls for sunblock use on arms. Light scent and works as expected.</li>
            <li> The use of a period of time, really good! The texture is very loving, very good with, as for long time exposure effect still needs verification! Overall, I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Use it every day to block the suns rays, even in the winter. This is going to be used daily for as long as I am able to do so. It is part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I use lots of sunscreen every single day and I love this stuff. It goes on really smooth and is very light and quite thin. I usually tend to buy target brand which is great, but for the summer it is nice to increase the SPF. I use this on my face daily as well as arms and neck and I have yet to have any skin issues or irritation from daily use. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This sunblock is great.  I used it for a Florida beach day including swimming and didn&#x27;t burn.  For me that is quite the feat.  Note the sunblock is very thick and it does take time to apply it clearly (without leaving white streaks).  I would definitely recommend this to anyone that burns easily.</li>
            <li> Superior sunscreen.  Great protection, not greasy or unpleasant to use.  Works well after swimming.</li>
            <li> Great product and held up to the hot Jamican sun well.  We went for a week and knew how expensive buying it there would be.  I also found it cheaper on Amazon than in most stores.  I would highly recommend buying this for those who need a smaller bottle to carry down to the beach or with them in a back back.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it took me a few times to realize that I wasn&#x27;t getting a heat rash, I was having a reaction to the product. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Light, not greasy, and doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out.  I hope they continue making it forever.</li>
            <li> This was the best value online and has worked well. So far no sunburns which is the best test. I don&#x27;t think you can find anything at a  better price.</li>
            <li> Google \\&quot;EWG Banana Boat Ultra Defense Sunscreen Lotion\\&quot; for the product to see one star rating reasoning...  I bought this, then threw it away without using it after reading details on their Web site.  EWG rates a lot of sunscreens so it&#x27;s easy to find one that has less risk.  I think that this is especially important when considering usage on children.  Nevertheless I would not use this product on myself after reading details about toxicity.</li>
            <li> Oxybenzone, is found in approximately 60% of sunscreens and is used to enhance the penetration of other chemicals used in these products. But, it has been shown to adversely affect the endocrine system, cause allergies and contribute to cellular damage. Actually only 8% of all available sun-protection products are recommended, in part because the others include this and other harmful chemicals. I will have to switch to the all natural oes at Whole Foods. Also contains retinyl palmitate, a synthetic form of vitamin A. This component, found in approximately 41% of sunscreens, has been found to possibly speed the growth of skin lesions. In 2010, New York Senator Charles Schumer called on the FDA to address the possible link between skin cancer and this chemical. Spectacular.</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS have sunblock with me, as I have over $2,000 worth of tattoos on my arm alone (my left, so it&#x27;s always out the window!), and I will NOT let them bleach under the sun like an old biker! I get no allergic reactions as some blocks will give off. Overall, a happy customer!</li>
            <li> I was a bit upset about this product and cannot use it. It states it is Sunblock, when in fact it&#x27;s sunscreen. I need sunblock since I am so fair skinned.</li>
            <li> This is the best value going for really serious broad spectrum SPF.  Not at all greasy, put it on and you&#x27;ll forget you&#x27;re wearing it.  I use it religiously in the summer.  Stock up, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Banana Boat sunscreens contain a preservative called  Methylchloroisothiazolinone also called Methylisothiazolinone (MI), and about 10 other names like 2-Methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, 5-Chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one., Acticide, Algucid, Amerstat 250, Euxyl K 100, Fennosan IT 21, Grotan TK2, Kathon, Kathon CG, Mergal K7, Metatin GT, Mitco CC 32 L.  I loved this sunscreen for the protection, unfortunately I and my children are allergic so i don&#x27;t use it.  But different folks are allergic to different things.  In the UK I hear that 10% of the population is allergic to this ingredient.  It&#x27;s also in cosmetic products for women: toners, cleansers, shampoos, moisturizers, make-up etc. So if you have a reaction to this, read labels on other products. I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s called the Irish allergy because fair skinned folks are more allergic to this. Many sunscreens use something else for their preservative so look around.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen for people that can&#x27;t have fragrance or dyes.  Not greasy either.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> My husband HATES sticky sunblock.  Usually, the higher the SPF, the stickier the lotions are.  The Banana Boat Ultra Defense Sunblock SPF 50 glides on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it stings the eyes, especially when you sweat.  So I only use this below my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my face, I usually use Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry touch which is stickier/harder to put on than the Banana Boat.  But, thus far, I don&#x27;t really get much of the Neutrogena Sun Block in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Product label was off, looks like it wasn&#x27;t made in the US.  Wondered on if the product was legitimate.</li>
            <li> Now that summer is arriving, I can order multiple units so keep on hand in backpacks &amp; in the car.  This works well for my family.  Very convenient and cost effective when purchased via subscribe &amp; save.</li>
            <li> This formulation covers well, but is not tacky or sticky once it has soaked in.  Good sun protection.  Very little odor and water resistant.  I like this formulation.</li>
            <li> This is an ok, inexpensive sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and was very effective at preventing sunburn on my beach vacation. (Don&#x27;t forget to reapply after swimming!) However I don&#x27;t think that I would purchase it again. It has a very heavy, greasy feeling, and you really need to apply a lot of it to get full coverage. Sport and non greasy formulas are much more comfortable to wear all day. At the end of the day I couldn&#x27;t wait to shower and get this sunscreen off.</li>
            <li> Okay sunscreen for the price. Takes a while to rub into skin to get rid of white cast. Wished there was an expiration date printed because I was only able to use half and the rest separated.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped \\&quot;open\\&quot; to me. I haven&#x27;t started using it as yet but I can hope it is exactly what I ordered. I am assigning a \\&quot;default\\&quot; rating for now and hope to update that after a few weeks so these comments may be considered for the seller alone.</li>
            <li> Terrific product!  Works great!</li>
            <li> This is by far, the best sunscreen I have ever used.  No stinging or burning, whatsoever, even if I happen to touch my eye area with it.  It is sheer and actually makes my skin look dewy and lovely while wearing.  NOT like I am wearing a white mask or have oil applied to my face.  It is also very protective and my skin is not the least bit red, even after a few hours of sweating in the sun.  A superior product which I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like this product and use it as much as needed. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and spend most of my babyhood, childhood and up to my early 30&#x27;s surfing, diving swimming with no sunblock. It has its price. And following my Dr advice I was looking for a very good sun block, very good in texture, in delivering, in dealing with water and in price. Use it every day to block the suns rays of the Middle East where I live. Use it also when I&#x27;m driving to work and it is an excellent product.This is going to be used daily for as  long as I am able to do so. It is part of my daily routine. I&#x27;m not looking for any other product (as long as price wont force me )</li>
            <li> The product has great quality and price. I recomnedo the seller.</li>
            <li> Do you really need to be reading a review on it?  It does what it says it should, it blocks the sun.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Sent it as a present and have heard no complaints. Happy campers in bonnie Scotland use it every day apparently.</li>
            <li> My wife is a vampire, well not really. She is just asian. She avoids the sun like I avoid the dishes. She puts this on to check the mail and has been using it for quite a while now. No complaints on oilness or odor, I myself hate sunscreen but I am also the one who turns a nice lobster color if not forced to wear it. My bum resembles the moon (no crater jokes), and as long as I coat myself in this i stay that shade. If I miss even the smallest part while applying it....well lets just say I won&#x27;t forget the top of my feet again! 10 out 10 on this product.</li>
            <li> Very good. This is what I want.</li>
            <li> This irritated my skin somethin&#x27; fierce.  Thankfully Amazon is great with returns, because I have to send it back.</li>
            <li> the first sunblock that I am totally happy with and has helped me not to get dark spots when I am in the sun. I highly recommend it, it is not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me. It&#x27;s almost hard to even get a tan with this stuff on. I can safely say I&#x27;ve never been burnt while wearing banana boat, even snorkeling in Costa Rica.</li>
            <li> It works. It protects skin from sunburn, although the skin tone still gets darker after sun exposure. The smile is not strong, which is very desirable for some people.</li>
            <li> I hope they never stop formulating this product!  Effective and delightful viscosity.  Good for your skin as an everyday therapy.</li>
