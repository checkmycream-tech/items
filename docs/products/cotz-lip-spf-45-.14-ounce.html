            <li>I intend to keep these lips for a while :D)  </li>
            <li>Excellent product and feels great on lips.</li>
            <li>My lips are incredibly sun-sensitive.</li>
            <li>This stuff does a great job at blocking UV</li>
            <li>The sun coverage is great &amp; lips didn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>Great sun protection</li>
            <li>It feels great, but has a chemically taste.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I have been researching for a great one to protect my lips under the sun without worrying too many during water activities.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Nice moisture, nice light tint that looks great on the lips and wonderful high 45 sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Just a very nice, light brown sheen.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive lips that burn in any kind of sunlight, even reflection off of snow!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many others and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you get the picture.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been as pleased.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this!  </li>
            <li>I love the face sunscreen too.</li>
            <li>most of the time.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite SPF lip balm.</li>
            <li>It saw me through a trip to the Caribbean but the heat did it in and changed the consistency, so I needed to buy more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Consider me in love.</li>
            <li>I can barely see it in the mirror, which means I put it on by feel and wind up with very good coverage.</li>
            <li>I am very fair with red undertones in my hair and skin.</li>
            <li>Cotz gives a great natural color.</li>
            <li>Feels good on, works great, but odd color!</li>
            <li>I was in the sun in South America and this seemed to work fine for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable on your lips, too, and tastes/smells fine.  </li>
            <li>This lip protection has a hint of color to it &amp; is so smooth on the lips.  </li>
            <li>but after using it, I can say it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The good: it&#x27;s not as visible as most mineral sunscreens due to the tint.  </li>
            <li>The sensitive skin sunscreen and tinted face sunscreen are beyond amazing.</li>
            <li>The taste is not bad, just sort of waxy.</li>
            <li>so easy to apply, and it nicely covers the scar, which is left after the basal cell carcinoma was removed.</li>
            <li>I still feel like my lips chapped pretty easily, and I ended up putting</li>
            <li>This is a great product though for extreme sun exposure.</li>
            <li>This stuff is wonderful - it has two kinds of physical blockers instead of the chemical kind you usually find.  </li>
            <li>It also has ginger oil in it which gives it a pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t taste as bitter as those chemical sunscreens do.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricy for a lip balm, but the money is worth.</li>
            <li>This balm goes on smooth, clear (well, a hint of tan tint to offset the whiteness of zinc oxide I imagine, but not noticeable), has a barely noticeable and pleasant flavor, and feels very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I like to use this right</li>
            <li>and it has a pretty color,</li>
            <li>If it had cost more I would have sent it back.  </li>
            <li>My sister is vegan and pretty strict about it.</li>
            <li>I expected it to taste just as nice</li>
            <li>I added a clear lip gloss on top of this lipscreen just for a weekend natural look.</li>
            <li>Really like the texture and am glad it&#x27;s not white but rather a very neutral shade of beige.  </li>
            <li>This stuff goes on easy and does not leave any white cast on your lips.</li>
            <li>The lip balm is very silky, not waxy, and has no discernible scent or feel on your lips.  </li>
            <li>Very drying.  </li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who wants chapped lip reflief.</li>
            <li>And this product really does work for us.</li>
            <li>Thanks WW</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, smooth, and has a nude color tint so that it doesn&#x27;t look too white on your lips like normal zinc blockers do.  </li>
            <li>Which is good because most of the rest leave your lips weird white, pasty or chalky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tinted brown, which will work better on some lips than others, but it&#x27;s still less visible than it would be without the tinting.  </li>
            <li>my normal chap stick over it to feel moisturized.</li>
            <li>I bought three new brands to try, and this Cotz is the winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I out-pale redheads</li>
            <li>My lips chap and dry out fairly quickly after I apply it,</li>
            <li>It may be that it works better for people with a yellow undertone to their skin, like me, than those with a pink undertone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel damage after less than an hour in strong sunlight.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be concerned about its tannish color - it applies clear!  </li>
            <li>so my usage is not excessive.</li>
            <li>I developed an allergy to chemical sunscreens and had to look for a new SPF lip balm.</li>
            <li>It does dry out my lips a bit, but it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>Naturally we are very sensitive to the sun and living in San Diego</li>
            <li>I have used it few times when I go for water sports; so far, I think it does its jobs, sun-protection &amp; moisture, and I like its pleasent light smell and non-greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is a natural product that doesn&#x27;t whiten the skin, and is not smelly or too greasy.</li>
            <li>I can only give this lip balm four stars because I find it very drying.</li>
            <li>It does what it says it will as far as protection goes-my lips never burn or even chap when I wear this</li>
            <li>This stuff works just as well as old stuff I was using which is saying a lot for something that uses zinc/titanium oxide for sun protection.</li>
            <li>I have given tubes to others who are out in the sun frequently.</li>
            <li>She was so surprised that I found one</li>
            <li>like I chose the wrong lip color for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>: It has a pretty strong (at least to my nose) bubble gum scent, and it melts at normal lip temperatures, so it&#x27; doesn&#x27;t stay in place for long.</li>
            <li>I have not tried it under or over lipstick, because I usually wear this when I&#x27;m outside at home, but I think it will be fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had trouble with my sensitive lips getting sunburned and so far this has been really doing the trick.</li>
            <li>I have had fever blisters in the past and honestly believe this balm has helped to keep them at bay because I haven&#x27;t had one since using it for the past year.  </li>
            <li>she barely got tan same for me.</li>

            <li> I decided that this was a good opportunity for comparing the options, as I was sick of &#x27;looking ghostly&#x27; or going to the extra hassle of putting makeup over it.</li>
            <li> Bad taste, but great product because of the High SPF which is hard to find in a lip balm.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works well for long stints in the sun or in a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Tasted and looked strange on my lips.  </li>
            <li> This balm has a slight tint that masks the white glow of the physical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This product produces the same dryness of my lips as almost every other lip balm besides Chap-Stick.  </li>
            <li> A bit dry for a balm, but it does protect.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste or smell  bad, doesn&#x27;t look white, goes on smoothly, but just doesn&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> my daughter did not get one single sunburn in fact</li>
            <li> My face is extremely sensitive, and even this is not good enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find lip balm with only physical sunscreen ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It has a brown colour and tastes really bitter.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive for one tube of lip balm but worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This product is a tad bit expensive, but well worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using an Australian brand that works, but is thick and white.</li>
            <li> I have used other spf lip balms, and the ones without \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; sunscreens are usually very dry and chalky.  </li>
            <li> They look all right, but they feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with all of the ingredients, but I only use this when I&#x27;m doing periodic yard work</li>
            <li> I usually end up with chapped and burnt lips on a week long camp out every year, This year I did not even experience any of that.</li>
            <li> I do not generally write negative reviews of a product.  </li>
            <li> costs less and each application lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less inclined to lick my lips and rub it off.</li>
            <li> It goes on moist but after about half an hour my lips feel completely dried out.</li>
            <li> Blocks well... not particularly stylish, but I didn&#x27;t mind --</li>
            <li> No more sunburned, windburned lips for me.  </li>
            <li> Left my lips looking very weird-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird frosty brown color that is odd</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a subtle reminder to leave them</li>
            <li> (Of course, this could be bad if you&#x27;re nibbling any white lapels, which it will probably stain.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> My lips look horrible after a few minutes of direct sunlight.</li>
            <li> I thought this was expensive when I bought it</li>
            <li> Not greasy, drying or bad tasting.</li>
            <li> bad</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like to use this right before I tan in a stand up bed before I train. My lips look horrible after a few minutes of direct sunlight. This stuff does a great job at blocking UV but it is tinted. Which is good because most of the rest leave your lips weird white, pasty or chalky. However it will stain whatever you touch your lips with a creamy brown color. And  would also look like you wiped your something else with whatever you touched your lips with. I&#x27;m sure you get the picture. This is a great product though for extreme sun exposure. Just follow up with a certified organic vegan balm to heal without petro or parabens. I like to use Hurraw! Lip balms for recovery of uv damage. You shouldn&#x27;t wear the cotz all the time. It works well for long stints in the sun or in a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> My face is extremely sensitive, and even this is not good enough. Then again, I&#x27;ve yet to find any sunscreen that my face can tolerate. Otherwise, this is a natural product that doesn&#x27;t whiten the skin, and is not smelly or too greasy.</li>
            <li> Good product. Stays put,adds moisture and protects.</li>
            <li> Bad taste, but great product because of the High SPF which is hard to find in a lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;If only they could fix that chemical taste!</li>
            <li> This lip protection has a hint of color to it &amp; is so smooth on the lips.  I would recommend to anyone.. Hint: I added a clear lip gloss on top of this lipscreen just for a weekend natural look. The sun coverage is great &amp; lips didn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> I have used it few times when I go for water sports; so far, I think it does its jobs, sun-protection &amp; moisture, and I like its pleasent light smell and non-greasy feeling.  I have been researching for a great one to protect my lips under the sun without worrying too many during water activities. It&#x27;s pricy for a lip balm, but the money is worth.</li>
            <li> Blocks well... not particularly stylish, but I didn&#x27;t mind -- I was on an Army FTX in Texas! I just didn&#x27;t want my lips burned, and they didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Tasted and looked strange on my lips.  I am very fair with red undertones in my hair and skin. Great sun protection but i just couldn&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin!  On the beach all day with no problems.</li>
            <li> I ordered this when I order the CoTZ sunscreen and I haven&#x27;t been as pleased. My lips chap and dry out fairly quickly after I apply it, and so I revert back to 30 spf chapstick, which works just as well, costs less and each application lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was grape</li>
            <li> I have used other spf lip balms, and the ones without \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; sunscreens are usually very dry and chalky.  This is not the case with Lipcotz!  I really enjoy using this!  I have not tried it under or over lipstick, because I usually wear this when I&#x27;m outside at home, but I think it will be fine. I will buy another one next year!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my photo-morphic lip rash.  Finally some relief!  This stuff is wonderful - it has two kinds of physical blockers instead of the chemical kind you usually find.  It&#x27;s gentle, smooth, and has a nude color tint so that it doesn&#x27;t look too white on your lips like normal zinc blockers do.  It also has ginger oil in it which gives it a pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t taste as bitter as those chemical sunscreens do.  I thought this was expensive when I bought it but after using it, I can say it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Not greasy, drying or bad tasting. Kept wind and sunburn away. It&#x27;s a weird frosty brown color that is odd so I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not to be worn out of context, not in the city for ex, only on the beach or mountains or while sporting in the sun. It has a brown colour and tastes really bitter.</li>
            <li> Works well but I am not too fond of the after taste</li>
            <li> Used in puerto Rico. Will buy this again. Excellent product and feels great on lips. I love the face sunscreen too.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is terrific.  It was recommended to me by a friend who was given the recommendation from her dermatologist.  We are both golfers so we are in the sun a lot.  I keep this in my golf bag and use it religiously.  I have had fever blisters in the past and honestly believe this balm has helped to keep them at bay because I haven&#x27;t had one since using it for the past year.  It does not feel &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; on your lips and doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;metallic&amp;#34; taste like some lip balms.</li>
            <li> I can only give this lip balm four stars because I find it very drying. It does what it says it will as far as protection goes-my lips never burn or even chap when I wear this and it has a pretty color, but it&#x27;s not moisturizing at all. It goes on moist but after about half an hour my lips feel completely dried out. They look all right, but they feel uncomfortable. I will still continue to use this product because it&#x27;s the best protection from the sun I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> My mother discovered this product in Arizona.  Nice moisture, nice light tint that looks great on the lips and wonderful high 45 sunscreen.  I have ordered about 4 of them over the years....</li>
            <li> Really like the texture and am glad it&#x27;s not white but rather a very neutral shade of beige.  Not thrilled with all of the ingredients, but I only use this when I&#x27;m doing periodic yard work so my usage is not excessive.</li>
            <li> This, as well as all the CoTZ products, are excellent sunscreens.  The lip balm is very silky, not waxy, and has no discernible scent or feel on your lips.  Don&#x27;t be concerned about its tannish color - it applies clear!  I re-purchase this often as the rest of my family likes it too.</li>
            <li> I do not generally write negative reviews of a product.  However, I believe others might want to know 2 things before they consider a purchase.  1 - it is brown.  2 - the package says &amp;#34; may stain some fabrics&amp;#34;.  That is a deal breaker for sonething I want to keep in my pocket.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find lip balm with only physical sunscreen ingredients.  This balm goes on smooth, clear (well, a hint of tan tint to offset the whiteness of zinc oxide I imagine, but not noticeable), has a barely noticeable and pleasant flavor, and feels very moisturizing.  A bit expensive for one tube of lip balm but worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Feels good on, works great, but odd color! This is a  brown tinted shiny sparkly balm. Left my lips looking very weird- like I chose the wrong lip color for my fair skin.</li>
            <li> I developed an allergy to chemical sunscreens and had to look for a new SPF lip balm. This stuff works just as well as old stuff I was using which is saying a lot for something that uses zinc/titanium oxide for sun protection. This stuff goes on easy and does not leave any white cast on your lips.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t talk up this brand or product enough.  All I can say, is if you are going to be in the sun, don&#x27;t forget your Cotz.  The sensitive skin sunscreen and tinted face sunscreen are beyond amazing.</li>
            <li> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA+++++++++++++++ Product</li>
            <li> This product produces the same dryness of my lips as almost every other lip balm besides Chap-Stick.  Very drying.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Cotz Lip makes your lips feel wonderful.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> If it had cost more I would have sent it back.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who wants chapped lip reflief.</li>
            <li> so easy to apply, and it nicely covers the scar, which is left after the basal cell carcinoma was removed.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are both blonde. Naturally we are very sensitive to the sun and living in San Diego we r in the sun most of the time. So I&#x27;ve become somewhat of an expert in terms of what works for us. And this product really does work for us. We just got back from three weeks in Hawaii in the ocean in the pool several hours every day my daughter did not get one single sunburn in fact she barely got tan same for me.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is the only one with physical blockers which doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue at all.  Just a very nice, light brown sheen.  It&#x27;s comfortable on your lips, too, and tastes/smells fine.  I love it!  I&#x27;ve tried so many others and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li> The good: it&#x27;s not as visible as most mineral sunscreens due to the tint.  It&#x27;s tinted brown, which will work better on some lips than others, but it&#x27;s still less visible than it would be without the tinting.  (Of course, this could be bad if you&#x27;re nibbling any white lapels, which it will probably stain.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: It has a pretty strong (at least to my nose) bubble gum scent, and it melts at normal lip temperatures, so it&#x27; doesn&#x27;t stay in place for long.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. I have given tubes to others who are out in the sun frequently.</li>
            <li> A bit dry for a balm, but it does protect.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive lips that burn in any kind of sunlight, even reflection off of snow!!! This is the only lip block that can protect my lips. If they ever discontinue this product I&#x27;m doomed!!</li>
            <li> This lip balm was recommended by my dermatologist.  I am on the tennis court mid-day for 2 hours straight and Cotz protects my lips from the harsh effects of the sun. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Perfect lip balm for those with an allergy/sensitivity to chemical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> not a fan.  It feels great, but has a chemically taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with my sensitive lips getting sunburned and so far this has been really doing the trick. It does dry out my lips a bit, but it&#x27;s totally worth it not having to deal with the sunburn.</li>
            <li> this has been a lip saver. I usually end up with chapped and burnt lips on a week long camp out every year, This year I did not even experience any of that. Awewsome!</li>
            <li> I still feel like my lips chapped pretty easily, and I ended up putting my normal chap stick over it to feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> This balm has a slight tint that masks the white glow of the physical sunscreen. Cotz gives a great natural color. This is my favorite SPF lip balm.</li>
            <li> I was in the sun in South America and this seemed to work fine for me. No sunburn on or around my lips!</li>
            <li> works well for me.  lip protection</li>
            <li> No more sunburned, windburned lips for me.  This product is a tad bit expensive, but well worth every penny.  I intend to keep these lips for a while :D)  I fish, ski, garden, water aerobics, snow shoe, snow ski, sled, and this product goes every where with me. Thanks WW</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste or smell  bad, doesn&#x27;t look white, goes on smoothly, but just doesn&#x27;t last that long.  Still, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> My sister is vegan and pretty strict about it. She wanted a chapstick with spy thats vegan. This is it! She was so surprised that I found one and she loves it!</li>
            <li> My lips are incredibly sun-sensitive. I feel damage after less than an hour in strong sunlight. This product has prevented that swollen after-feel, AND it goes on sheer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using an Australian brand that works, but is thick and white. It saw me through a trip to the Caribbean but the heat did it in and changed the consistency, so I needed to buy more. I decided that this was a good opportunity for comparing the options, as I was sick of &#x27;looking ghostly&#x27; or going to the extra hassle of putting makeup over it. I bought three new brands to try, and this Cotz is the winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I out-pale redheads and I have no issues with the tint. I can barely see it in the mirror, which means I put it on by feel and wind up with very good coverage. It may be that it works better for people with a yellow undertone to their skin, like me, than those with a pink undertone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell, which is sort of fruity. I expected it to taste just as nice but it doesn&#x27;t, which is not a bug, but a feature! I&#x27;m less inclined to lick my lips and rub it off. The taste is not bad, just sort of waxy. It&#x27;s not like I cringe every time I taste it. It&#x27;s just a subtle reminder to leave them alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider me in love.</li>
