    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>From the picture here at Amazon, I thought it would be the perfect match.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m impressed with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>This is without a doubt the best deodorant I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Amazon being a great company promptly replaced both.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bad: the  spray is not the best,  kind of splashes the deo.</li>
            <li>Amazingly it does work!</li>
            <li>It is an excellent deodorant and not anantiperspirant which is much better for one&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey for the volume, but a good product.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>All good and very safe.</li>
            <li>so I had to run it under warm water to get it working again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective.  </li>
            <li>it is very positionally sensitive &amp; must be held perfectly upright - not the best design.  </li>
            <li>I tried the others and they are way to strong for me!</li>
            <li>Quicker and easier than rubbing a salt stick 20 times and competently does the deodorant job without poisoning me.  </li>
            <li>and I think it has a better sprayer/atomizer</li>
            <li>This was recommended for me by one of the top Wellness Doctors in the country.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, I&#x27;ve used both the solid and now the spray,</li>
            <li>The product is ok but the spray does not work well</li>
            <li>Deodorant is ok.</li>
            <li>The deodorant is great - works very well.</li>
            <li>My latest rash disappeared in a couple of days &amp; no odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;No more rotating brands, no odor, or rashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for about 2 months and am rather satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Complete lack of odor is a plus because I am a chef and need to smell more important things than my armpits!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still effective hours after very intense exercise.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>and I think it could be very useful for adolescences just experiencing body odor (entering puberty).</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and is as advertised.</li>
            <li>In my case, this is a great alternative to the chemicals in the more common mass market products.  </li>
            <li>I like the unscented option along with the lack of harmful chemicals that might be absorbed into your body.</li>
            <li>More natural, healthier alternative to commercial brands, and just as effective.</li>
            <li>In addition to the difficulty finding the right position to spray so it goes where you want it, the solution backed up and solidified where the spray comes out</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I was able to swap the black spray head with one from the original style Crystal bottle.</li>
            <li>Essentially the same product as Crystal&#x27;s original deodorant body spray that I&#x27;ve been happily using for years, packaged in a masculine container.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had a hot humid summer</li>
            <li>First time trying a Crystal Rock or deodorant spray</li>
            <li>first, it took 10+ pumps for the spray to work the first time (almost gave up).  </li>
            <li>This is more of a nuisance then anything else, but a nuisance just the same.</li>
            <li>the most important part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the Crystal Body Deodorant Stick for Men http://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Deodorant-Stick-Unscented-Ounce/dp/B00028QF9U/ref&#x3D;pd_bxgy_hpc_text_y as it is the exact same thing for women, but different branding and cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Really like this deodorant, but think the manufacturer needs to rethink their bottle design.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>However, the product I received has many other ingredients (preservatives) that I don&#x27;t like, like Benzoic Acid.</li>
            <li>Downsides are that it doesn&#x27;t hold up in high activity</li>
            <li>I ordered this as it received high ratings on the EWG.org site</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to a product working for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this deodorant I thought I finally found a product that worked for me without having aluminum.</li>
            <li>I use my old super-strong Mitchum for important meeting days or if I&#x27;ll be doing a lot of physical work, but I use this now for my daily work or stay-at-home days</li>
            <li>I finally switched back to my old deodorant after 2 full weeks due to it not keeping me fresh.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for a natural, cheaper deodorant that worked well.</li>
            <li>It is a pump action, no aerosol, and sprays out a directed mist, that doesn&#x27;t spray all over your arm, but just where you have the nozzle aimed.  </li>
            <li>but it actually works and for the whole day</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s back to normal deodorant for me.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s spraying normally, but the solution inside drips a lot, and is a weird blue color that stains my sink and surrounding areas unless I clean it right away.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll never go back to aluminum/nasty deodorants; all natural, long lasting (in almost all situations -- 15-hour summer days can require a re-spritz); and lovely, fairly subtle scents.  </li>
            <li>I find if I do several sprays in each arm pit and then rub my arms down and let it dry, it tends to work a little better</li>

            <li> Only concern is that it takes some time to dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this product because of this dripping, staining, and my husband says it also doesn&#x27;t work as strong as a previous crystal spray we had.</li>
            <li> Keeps your underarms from odor all day long.</li>
            <li> This works well and seems to dry quicker than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I switched to a natural alum spray earlier this year and found it worked very well for me, but then noticed the Crystal Rock was less expensive</li>
            <li> Based on the performance of the deodorant I&#x27;ve ordered several other Crystal Rock products in other configurations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Big mess.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the spray head on the bottle I received didn&#x27;t evenly mist the product so much as squirt it in two opposing directions, neither of which were under my arms.</li>
            <li> However, the longer I used it the less it worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also one of the few deodorants that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times, and it seems to have no effect on body odor.  </li>
            <li> Have always had trouble with mass market products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get a bad rash if I didn&#x27;t rotate to different brands often.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> but I just can&#x27;t stand to have any type of bad odor.</li>
            <li> Without all that bad aluminum based stuff.  </li>
            <li> I wish the can was pressurized as I hate the pump</li>
            <li> But the design of the spay bottle is the worst I have seen -I</li>

            <li> In addition to the difficulty finding the right position to spray so it goes where you want it, the solution backed up and solidified where the spray comes out so I had to run it under warm water to get it working again. Now it&#x27;s spraying normally, but the solution inside drips a lot, and is a weird blue color that stains my sink and surrounding areas unless I clean it right away. Big mess. I&#x27;m not happy with this product because of this dripping, staining, and my husband says it also doesn&#x27;t work as strong as a previous crystal spray we had. would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Really like this deodorant, but think the manufacturer needs to rethink their bottle design. I had one that had leaked and another where the spray did not work. Amazon being a great company promptly replaced both.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to a product working for more than a few hours. But after 6-8 hours or so, this product stops working. I need longer deodorant protection so will be trying a different brand next.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Will buy again (wife uses it). Shipped quickly and is as advertised. It deodorant, so why else can I say?</li>
            <li> It is an excellent deodorant and not anantiperspirant which is much better for one&#x27;s health. unscented  leaves room for perfume!</li>
            <li> I like the unscented option along with the lack of harmful chemicals that might be absorbed into your body. Downsides are that it doesn&#x27;t hold up in high activity and you&#x27;ll begin to smell B.O., along with the fact the pumps on these bottles often stop working.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> According to the Crystal website, this product has Benzoic Acid in the ingredients list.  All of the body spray line does.  The picture of the ingredients show from the Amazon seller is not valid.  If you are looking for a deodorant that does not have harmful substances in the ingredients, then this is NOT the product for you.</li>
            <li> The deodorant itself performs well, but I was looking for the simplest possible formula. From the picture here at Amazon, I thought it would be the perfect match. However, the product I received has many other ingredients (preservatives) that I don&#x27;t like, like Benzoic Acid.</li>
            <li> Quicker and easier than rubbing a salt stick 20 times and competently does the deodorant job without poisoning me.  Complete lack of odor is a plus because I am a chef and need to smell more important things than my armpits!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been using Crystal Rock for two years and I&#x27;ll never go back to aluminum/nasty deodorants; all natural, long lasting (in almost all situations -- 15-hour summer days can require a re-spritz); and lovely, fairly subtle scents.  A bit pricey for the volume, but a good product.</li>
            <li> I switched to a natural alum spray earlier this year and found it worked very well for me, but then noticed the Crystal Rock was less expensive so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It worked as well and I think it has a better sprayer/atomizer so the bottle lasts longer.  It won&#x27;t keep you from sweating as it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, but it does prevent the odor and your shirts won&#x27;t get stained.  We&#x27;ve had a hot humid summer and I&#x27;m impressed with this stuff.  It&#x27;s also one of the few deodorants that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> First time trying a Crystal Rock or deodorant spray product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, it took 10+ pumps for the spray to work the first time (almost gave up).  Then, it&#x27;s awkward spraying underarm in a consistent way to get full exposure and without spraying into the air (or on my towels) and my face.  No directions or advice on bottle.  I have used it a few times, and it seems to have no effect on body odor.  Will return.</li>
            <li> This was recommended for me by one of the top Wellness Doctors in the country. Excellent. All good and very safe. Keeps your underarms from odor all day long.</li>
            <li> This works well and seems to dry quicker than others I&#x27;ve tried. I prefer this unscented version. I tried the others and they are way to strong for me!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;ve used both the solid and now the spray,</li>
            <li> The product is ok but the spray does not work well - I ordered 4 bottles and none of them spray as they should!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to not use harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;The whole goal of &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; is to not stink.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff was useless.&lt;br /&gt;I get the same result as not using deodorant... and I don&#x27;t have BO problems.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s back to normal deodorant for me. Ugh.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best deodorant I have ever used.  The only problem is that the spray mechanism on it sticks a third of the time.  This is more of a nuisance then anything else, but a nuisance just the same.</li>
            <li> Deodorant is ok. But the design of the spay bottle is the worst I have seen -I make this comment after using 2 seperste bottles. They don&#x27;t workout spray properly and the deo just drips out instead of spraying. I had to take time to write this review as a public service announcement</li>
            <li> The deodorant is great - works very well. The sprayer tops are not. One bottle came with a sprayer non-functional and another didn&#x27;t last long enough to finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> Have always had trouble with mass market products.  I&#x27;d get a bad rash if I didn&#x27;t rotate to different brands often.  Thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  Takes getting use to since it is a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; pump spray.  My latest rash disappeared in a couple of days &amp; no odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more rotating brands, no odor, or rashes. I wish the can was pressurized as I hate the pump it is very positionally sensitive &amp; must be held perfectly upright - not the best design.  Based on the performance of the deodorant I&#x27;ve ordered several other Crystal Rock products in other configurations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s biology is different, so that maybe why some reviews indicate it didn&#x27;t work for everyone.  In my case, this is a great alternative to the chemicals in the more common mass market products.  If you need an alternative give this a try it maybe the answer.</li>
            <li> Amazingly it does work! It&#x27;s still effective hours after very intense exercise. More natural, healthier alternative to commercial brands, and just as effective. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this deodorant I thought I finally found a product that worked for me without having aluminum. However, the longer I used it the less it worked. I finally switched back to my old deodorant after 2 full weeks due to it not keeping me fresh. Sorry but I just can&#x27;t stand to have any type of bad odor.</li>
            <li> The unscented spray is helpful when you&#x27;ve perspired and want to remove (not mask) body odor.  It&#x27;s effective.  Only concern is that it takes some time to dry.  I like the product and I think it could be very useful for adolescences just experiencing body odor (entering puberty).</li>
            <li> Essentially the same product as Crystal&#x27;s original deodorant body spray that I&#x27;ve been happily using for years, packaged in a masculine container. Unfortunately, the spray head on the bottle I received didn&#x27;t evenly mist the product so much as squirt it in two opposing directions, neither of which were under my arms. Fortunately, I was able to swap the black spray head with one from the original style Crystal bottle. Issue resolved.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as it received high ratings on the EWG.org site and I was looking for a natural, cheaper deodorant that worked well. I&#x27;ve used this product for about 2 months and am rather satisfied with it.  Doesn&#x27;t prevent sweating, but then it is not suppose to being a deodorant only.  I find if I do several sprays in each arm pit and then rub my arms down and let it dry, it tends to work a little better and I don&#x27;t rub it all off on a shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is neutral and unscented as stated.  It is a pump action, no aerosol, and sprays out a directed mist, that doesn&#x27;t spray all over your arm, but just where you have the nozzle aimed.  It says 24 hours protection, but I have not found that to be the case.  I don&#x27;t know if I am not applying it enough or that it simply wears off faster than stated.  I do not however, have to apply to throughout the day.  It does last from morning until evening, and I find that the most important part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the Crystal Body Deodorant Stick for Men http://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Deodorant-Stick-Unscented-Ounce/dp/B00028QF9U/ref&#x3D;pd_bxgy_hpc_text_y as it is the exact same thing for women, but different branding and cheaper.  I use this following showers and the body spray on days I do not need a shower.  I find both do what they are intended for, which is preventing odor.</li>
            <li> Good: it is not harmful and it works.&lt;br /&gt;Bad: the  spray is not the best,  kind of splashes the deo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they do it,  but it actually works and for the whole day</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that it&#x27;s not designed to stop sweat, just the smell. And that, it does.  Without all that bad aluminum based stuff.  I use my old super-strong Mitchum for important meeting days or if I&#x27;ll be doing a lot of physical work, but I use this now for my daily work or stay-at-home days and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this deodorant.  This is one of the only ones that don&#x27;t make me itch.  I will be buying more.</li>
