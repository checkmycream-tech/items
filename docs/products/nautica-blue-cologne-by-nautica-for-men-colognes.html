            <li>One of my favorite scents at a reasonable price!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good alternate option.</li>
            <li>I find this cologne to be a bit too sweet.</li>
            <li>Subtle yet lingering scent, great quality!</li>
            <li>Was looking for something new and fresh for my husband and we both love it.</li>
            <li>The smell is aquatic and fresh.</li>
            <li>He enjoys the fresh scents of Nautica.</li>
            <li>Nice big bottle.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for a more masculine scent.</li>
            <li>He was just right for him.  </li>
            <li>This bottle is very large.</li>
            <li>This perfume has such a refreshing scent that makes me feel good and has a lasting effect such that it always makes me smell good the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I very much like its mildness</li>
            <li>Highly recommend buying this!!</li>
            <li>No complaints whatsoever.....;)</li>
            <li>and I decided it would be nice to replace the other bottle since he likes this brand.</li>
            <li>The product has a nice, cool smell but doesn&#x27;t last as long as I want.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this product to anyone who likes a good perfume that will keep going over a long time.</li>
            <li>Smell good, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Nautica blue is quiet unique and very mild when put on.</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li>I really like this scent...</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced on amazon.</li>
            <li>going very well alone</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery helped.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It was fast delivery and real not a nock off</li>
            <li>simply neat with a clean scent.</li>
            <li>Amazing deal but fragrance dies away quick and is very subtle</li>
            <li>Reminds me of clear seas and pristine beaches!</li>
            <li>It provides a unique relief from acquiring an odor, that does not conform to the middle class standard of living.</li>
            <li>Only issue was that as the bottle was running down, like under one half, it seemed to lose its scent easily and wasn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li>But the overriding problem is that the scent lasts only about 15 minutes...doesn&#x27;t matter how much or how its applied (directly on skin, clothes, or a combination of both - 5 squirts, 10 squirts, 15 squirts..), by the time I get into my car in the morning...</li>
            <li>The only downside is he put too much on.</li>
            <li>My young teens never run out of this.  </li>
            <li>Be prepared to spray 3 times as much, but as it is three times as big</li>
            <li>The small bottle at the store was more than double what I paid on Amazon.</li>
            <li>No regrets here.</li>
            <li>Brand name stands out; not the quality of it :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to improve the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Not at all happy</li>

            <li> Highly recommend buying this!!</li>
            <li> No complaints whatsoever.....;)</li>
            <li> and I decided it would be nice to replace the other bottle since he likes this brand.</li>
            <li> The product has a nice, cool smell but doesn&#x27;t last as long as I want.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product to anyone who likes a good perfume that will keep going over a long time.</li>
            <li> Smell good, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Nautica blue is quiet unique and very mild when put on.</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent...</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced on amazon.</li>
            <li> going very well alone</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery helped.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It was fast delivery and real not a nock off</li>
            <li> simply neat with a clean scent.</li>
            <li> Amazing deal but fragrance dies away quick and is very subtle</li>
            <li> Reminds me of clear seas and pristine beaches!</li>
            <li> It provides a unique relief from acquiring an odor, that does not conform to the middle class standard of living.</li>
            <li> Only issue was that as the bottle was running down, like under one half, it seemed to lose its scent easily and wasn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li> But the overriding problem is that the scent lasts only about 15 minutes...doesn&#x27;t matter how much or how its applied (directly on skin, clothes, or a combination of both - 5 squirts, 10 squirts, 15 squirts..), by the time I get into my car in the morning...</li>
            <li> The only downside is he put too much on.</li>
            <li> My young teens never run out of this.  </li>
            <li> Be prepared to spray 3 times as much, but as it is three times as big</li>
            <li> The small bottle at the store was more than double what I paid on Amazon.</li>
            <li> No regrets here.</li>
            <li> Brand name stands out; not the quality of it :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to improve the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Not at all happy</li>
            <li> Not sure if real or fade.</li>
            <li> the smell doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Long lasting fragrance</li>
            <li> just wish I can last a little longer.</li>
            <li> Delievered on expected date</li>
            <li> Got what I expected.</li>
            <li> but other then that its grate</li>
            <li> no more Nautica Blue smell.  </li>
            <li> Skeptical at first due to price.</li>
            <li> However, at the begining it smells a little like deodorant.</li>
            <li> A small spray keeps a hint of the product on me all day.</li>
            <li> Seems like a fake.</li>
            <li> Ordered the wrong after shave by mistake.  </li>
            <li> but my spray lasts from 6 am to 11 pm (though faint, my wife can still smell it).</li>
            <li> you can not go wrong people</li>
            <li> OK..I still think he stinks</li>

            <li> My young teens never run out of this.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Cheap and good smell. However, at the begining it smells a little like deodorant. So keep that in mind befor aplying it</li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes the scent on me. Nuff said.</li>
            <li> great smelling perfume, i always get alot of compliments</li>
            <li> Good smell and a very nice gift for the price.  I found it cheaper on another site, that&#x27;s why it got the 4 and not the 5.</li>
            <li> I really love the scent.  But the overriding problem is that the scent lasts only about 15 minutes...doesn&#x27;t matter how much or how its applied (directly on skin, clothes, or a combination of both - 5 squirts, 10 squirts, 15 squirts..), by the time I get into my car in the morning...no more Nautica Blue smell.  Shame...I really like this scent...it&#x27;s a very good daily scent, not overpowering.  This is going to make me leery of buying cologne off of Amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> I like this item. Smells great and I am constantly complimented when I wear it. Mine seemed authentic so no complaints.</li>
            <li> This perfume has such a refreshing scent that makes me feel good and has a lasting effect such that it always makes me smell good the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to anyone who likes a good perfume that will keep going over a long time.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Reasonably priced on amazon. This is my husband&#x27;s favorite.  It smells light and cool. I like the way it smells too.</li>
            <li> This has a fresh and clean sexy kind of smell.</li>
            <li> Cologne fragrance Excellent ..! for use alone or combine it with another colony of your choice ..!&lt;br /&gt;my going very well alone and when combine with another colony of wonder.!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it 100% you will not regret ...</li>

            <li> If ur a person that wants a good cheap cologne get these girls love the smell</li>
            <li> Good quality and product</li>
            <li> got it for nice price</li>

            <li> Excellent and quick service...</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells!</li>
            <li> Smell good, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Only issue was that as the bottle was running down, like under one half, it seemed to lose its scent easily and wasn&#x27;t as strong. However, since I got such a great price, still going to give four stars.</li>
            <li> Nautica blue is quiet unique and very mild when put on. It provides a unique relief from acquiring an odor, that does not conform to the middle class standard of living. I very much like its mildness and it&#x27;s special.</li>
            <li> GREAT ITEM FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the price of and the product!  No complaints whatsoever.....;)</li>
            <li> I have to say i am impressed</li>
            <li> OK..I still think he stinks</li>
            <li> Nice Fragrance but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Its smell doesn&#x27;t stay in your body. Also doesn&#x27;t have an essence which you can recognize. I&#x27;ll never buy it again.</li>
            <li> It is a good choice for an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Amazing deal but fragrance dies away quick and is very subtle</li>
            <li> great smell, clean fresh, and great price.......no other place online has prices on men&#x27;s fragrances so good like amazon</li>
            <li> This is my favorite for my husband Plus this is his favorite I really enjoy the freshness this has its amazing.</li>
            <li> Smell good, properly package, Senct fates quickly! Not sure if real or fade. Good price so it even out!</li>
            <li> Be prepared to spray 3 times as much, but as it is three times as big I guess it works out. The scent is good.</li>
            <li> Got what I expected. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something new and fresh for my husband and we both love it.</li>
            <li> Gotta love the classics</li>
            <li> Just as was pictured! I am very happy with this purchased and will look for other fragrances from this shipper. I ordered another fragrance from another shipper only to find out it was a knock off. Thank you for selling what is stated in the picture.</li>
            <li> It was a big hit for my son&#x27;s Christmas. He enjoys the fresh scents of Nautica. Fast delivery helped.</li>
            <li> Great price. The small bottle at the store was more than double what I paid on Amazon. Fast shipping and it smells amazing</li>

            <li> Price was really good for the size of the bottle and it smells great too, plus shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I got the item, and when I opened it, I saw the receipt showing that the product cost $12. I paid $18.33 for this, so I think it wasn&#x27;t fair at all...</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughter&#x27;s boyfriend, recieved it fast and at a great price. Love Amazon prime.</li>
            <li> The products will be given as gifts.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad for his birthday and can&#x27;t stop smelling it!  Would have given it to my husband, but he&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; person and prefers very light colognes otherwise he sneezes up a storm.  This is a big bottle for a great price.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> Smells great on my husband.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents at a reasonable price!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am enjoying smelling like a million bucks on a government employee salary.</li>
            <li> A gift for my dad he loved it. He was just right for him.  Thanks amazon for the great experience</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first due to price. This is the real deal. I don&#x27;t know what everyone else is saying but my spray lasts from 6 am to 11 pm (though faint, my wife can still smell it). For the money and the amount, can&#x27;t beat it. Same sized bottle at target is $55.</li>
            <li> Look great smell great</li>
            <li> Great price for so much.</li>
            <li> I chose this cologne for a close friend and he expressed how much he loved the fragrance. I selected this fragrance for its &amp;#34;coolness&amp;#34; and I like it too.</li>
            <li> i recomend this fragance because its so divine, i buyed to my dad and he love this fragance, the Price its so good</li>
            <li> My Nephew received a bottle of this as gift from my Sister and something happened to it. I saw this bottle on Amazon and I decided it would be nice to replace the other bottle since he likes this brand. I spoke to him after he received it and he was very happy I sent it.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance!! I really love it and it&#x27;s very low price is great!</li>
            <li> Was a gift... Smell so good and price was excellent !</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my husband. He loves this smell.</li>

            <li> Good price!!!.... Quick delivery!!</li>
            <li> It was fast delivery and real not a nock off</li>
            <li> This is very nice my brother and husband really like it</li>
            <li> Great Product at a GREAT price!</li>
            <li> Hubby likes it a lot and so do I !!!</li>
            <li> Everyone loves it. Purchased for dad and he gets compliments all the time! One note, we love Nautica Voyage even more.</li>
            <li> no staying power.  scent gone in seconds</li>
            <li> Love how cheap this stuff is it smells so fresh and all the ladies love the smell if you have never bought please do pick up 2 for the price you can not go wrong people</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I prefer Polo blue over Nautica blue. Good alternate option.</li>
            <li> This smells so good. my fiancee loves it and so do i!</li>
            <li> I find this cologne to be a bit too sweet. I was hoping for a more masculine scent. The bottle and color though are very enjoyable and make your bathroom vanity look great.</li>
            <li> Great cologne at a great price</li>
            <li> Very refreshing aroma. Just perfect for hanging out.</li>
            <li> Awesome, smooth transaction.  No problems.  Thank you ~!~</li>
            <li> A small spray keeps a hint of the product on me all day. It&#x27;s not overpowering or overbearing.</li>
            <li> My girl friends love it. The liquid lasts forever i&#x27;ve had i for about 3 months. Its smell last all day and all night</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and really worth the $$$$$</li>
