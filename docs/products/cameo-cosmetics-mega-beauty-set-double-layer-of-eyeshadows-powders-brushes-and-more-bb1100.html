            <li>the colours stays on and the lip colours are great</li>
            <li>The box is great.</li>
            <li>Because it shows bright colors and because it says it comes with lip glosses (plural).</li>
            <li>The colors are not even close to as bright as it shows in the pictures and there are no lip glosses included at all.</li>
            <li>If it came with lip glosses as stated and the colors were bright as in the pictures I would have given it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>So good.</li>
            <li>I am very very pleased</li>

            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I got it mostly for 2 reasons.</li>
            <li>Nothing was cracked, and I LOVE the box</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so stylish.</li>
            <li>my grand daughter will love this...</li>
            <li>Cute makeup bag, the only thing is that mascara is not of good quality but good price.</li>
            <li>The tools are absolutely rubbish - cheap and trashy - but the makeup itself is great.</li>
            <li>but I am not at all happy that it doesn&#x27;t come with the lip glosses as clearly stated.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is a pretty awesome beauty set.</li>
            <li>I had high hope to received this item in good condition for birthday gift.</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors that last but don&#x27;t break my bank.</li>
            <li>I can live with the fact that the colors are not as bright as shown</li>
            <li>I am going to have to run out and try to find some that will fit in there somewhere.</li>
            <li>colours are fantastic..</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Although we can&#x27;t really compare to a Tiffany box :)</li>
            <li>You should really use this even though it&#x27;s more to the play side.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Also, the price was very reasonable!</li>
            <li>and I think I&#x27;m her new favorite person.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old daughter bought it and really it looks like a nice kit.  </li>
            <li>It came in perfect shape and none of the cosmetics were broken!  </li>
            <li>The top has a lock on it and the clasp covers the front drawer but does not stop it from sliding open while moving it around.</li>
            <li>From the size I was concerned with the amount of product there would really be.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected!</li>
            <li>Shany cosmetics has high quality pigments that can rival BH cosmetics.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Little cube transforms into a huge makeup kit!</li>
            <li>and I was surprised on the size</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 15 year old niece.</li>
            <li>Got this for my 16 year old niece</li>
            <li>It was my early Xmas splurge for myself.</li>
            <li>WOW, they are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cosmetic case is small enough to travel, but has so many options/colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>My wife liked the amount of different colors but the trays were difficult to open and close.</li>

            <li> so UPS had less time to throw it around and smash up the box like they usually do and nothing on mine was broken.</li>
            <li> They are all powder and if you don&#x27;t have a cream base they could flake away/not settle as prettily for doing smokey eye makeup, etc.</li>
            <li> Item came with 70% of the powder is crumble in pieces, Housing is broken and mirror bracket tab is broken..</li>
            <li> I noticed that some people had issues with broken products.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it came with a broken tray.</li>
            <li> When I received my Set, I found that the box, one of the eyeshadow, and one of the blush  were broken.</li>
            <li> For those who had problems with their product breaking, I&#x27;m sorry to hear.</li>
            <li> ( I cant use it yet its frozen from the cold weather</li>
            <li> (my parents were mad at me because I have a lot of make up any way</li>
            <li> I ordered this knowing that there was some bad ratings on it</li>

            <li> For those who had problems with their product breaking, I&#x27;m sorry to hear. I ordered mine knowing I would take the risk. I could  always send it back. Well, my kit is perfect. Absolutely nothing wrong with it. I have gotten to use everything yet but so far so good.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter bought it and really it looks like a nice kit.  Many colors and brushes so she can practice.  I have not tried it so I don&#x27;t know how the makeup would wear on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my tween for Christmas and she just loves it!  It came in perfect shape and none of the cosmetics were broken!  She loves the colors and they wear well.  I am very very pleased and I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I had high hope to received this item in good condition for birthday gift. Item came with 70% of the powder is crumble in pieces, Housing is broken and mirror bracket tab is broken.. ughhhh!! So disapointed! and returning does not give you a chance to get replacement and force you to get refund instead offer of replacement</li>
            <li> Although we can&#x27;t really compare to a Tiffany box :) Make-up is a close second for me. Shany cosmetics has high quality pigments that can rival BH cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I ordered this knowing that there was some bad ratings on it and I was surprised on the size it was a little smaller than I thought I opened it and I was amazed on how big it looked opened I love it (my parents were mad at me because I have a lot of make up any way but I told them that tis was the last thing I would buy) I was scared when it said delivered and I went to the post office and it was not there then I came home a little later and it was on my porch I am so happy it is here ( I cant use it yet its frozen from the cold weather lol ) cant  wait to try it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 15 year old niece. I got it mostly for 2 reasons. Because it shows bright colors and because it says it comes with lip glosses (plural). The colors are not even close to as bright as it shows in the pictures and there are no lip glosses included at all. It does include lip stick, which she doesn&#x27;t wear, and lip color which you apply with the brush and also something she doesn&#x27;t wear. Box is very cute and compact. The top has a lock on it and the clasp covers the front drawer but does not stop it from sliding open while moving it around. I can live with the fact that the colors are not as bright as shown but I am not at all happy that it doesn&#x27;t come with the lip glosses as clearly stated. I am going to have to run out and try to find some that will fit in there somewhere. I noticed that some people had issues with broken products. I have Prime shipping and it took one day to get here so UPS had less time to throw it around and smash up the box like they usually do and nothing on mine was broken. If it came with lip glosses as stated and the colors were bright as in the pictures I would have given it 4 stars. I also deducted one star for the clasp on the front not keeping the drawing locked.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 16 year old niece and I think I&#x27;m her new favorite person. She absolutely loved it. The best part is everything is included.</li>
            <li> colours are fantastic.. the drawers work perfectly as showed in pic ..the colours stays on and the lip colours are great</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it came with a broken tray. I had to send it back and get a replacement. My wife liked the amount of different colors but the trays were difficult to open and close.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected! Little cube transforms into a huge makeup kit! Bought for my daughter for Christmas to play dress up and she loved it!!</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> The cosmetic case is small enough to travel, but has so many options/colors to choose from. This product was purchased as a gift to give and when receiving it, it had me wanting one for myself. Also, the price was very reasonable!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors that last but don&#x27;t break my bank. Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Cute makeup bag, the only thing is that mascara is not of good quality but good price.</li>
            <li> When I received my Set, I found that the box, one of the eyeshadow, and one of the blush  were broken.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my neice for Christmas.  The box is great. From the size I was concerned with the amount of product there would really be. To our surprise, quite a bit. No worries about having multiple little cosmetic containers for each individual product.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a pretty awesome beauty set. It was my early Xmas splurge for myself. I&#x27;m 22, and was worried about it being &amp;#34;kiddie&amp;#34; makeup. No worries! It has everything I need and then some. The tools are absolutely rubbish - cheap and trashy - but the makeup itself is great. Nothing was cracked, and I LOVE the box, it&#x27;s so stylish. I got the recommend 13-piece SHANY set, WOW, they are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just have to say if you want cream eyeshadow, don&#x27;t get this. They are all powder and if you don&#x27;t have a cream base they could flake away/not settle as prettily for doing smokey eye makeup, etc.</li>
            <li> So good. You should really use this even though it&#x27;s more to the play side. I love it so much</li>
            <li> my grand daughter will love this...recently got into makeup</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase!!</li>
