            <li>she ask for more than is recommended.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my daughters hair is more manageable and noticeably thicker...</li>
            <li>I even give her some mineral rich and thought this more for my toddler.</li>
            <li>Also, its packed with fruits/vegetables and other things to keep her healthy!!!</li>
            <li>Within the first 30 days(one bottle) her hair was growing, healthy, shiny, and she had so much more energy.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it actually helped my daughter&#x27;s hair, but it seems to be a good vitamin.</li>
            <li>The taste is not bad.  </li>
            <li>and my son is super bummed that he doesn&#x27;t get any.</li>
            <li>have gotten better she also was having really bad stomach pains that have stop since taking this supplement,now to the best part her hair is shiny more manageable  to comb</li>
            <li>My daughter is 5 years old, rocking her beautiful natural hair and is using the Nzuri Elixir Children&#x27;s Liquid Vitamins for the first time.</li>
            <li>well worth it</li>
            <li>So far my daughter&#x27;s hair is healthy, I&#x27;m continuing to use it</li>
            <li>Even though you might not notice results right away, when you finally do you will be so pleased.</li>
            <li>Funny reaction but not for me.</li>
            <li>As for now, she is going to continue to take advantage of all the other amazing benefits of  this product.</li>
            <li>I do believe my purchase of these vitamins that my daughter wanted for her toddler daughter is a positive rating.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really seen a difference on the hair</li>
            <li>very pricy know that I recheck the price.</li>
            <li>Hair growth is really the result of genetics.  </li>
            <li>It really works for my granddaughter.thanks.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old has very short, fine hair and it grew 1/2cm.</li>
            <li>however ive seen it have more good reviews than bad reviews</li>
            <li>I have seen little hair growth for sure.</li>
            <li>Has definitely helped with healthy hair growth following the haircut her 5 yr old brother gave her!</li>
            <li>I think this is better than the flinstones vitamins i waste money on.</li>
            <li>I think diet and eating right are the key factors that will promote hair growth.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for almost 2 months now; i havent been consistent with giving to her on a daily basis but I am seeing results.</li>
            <li>I have 3 year old twin girls.</li>
            <li>The one with the shorter hair has had a marked growth.</li>
            <li>Used 1st bottle for 90 days on my 2 1/2 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I really wasnt expecting much since her hair  has been trimmed of whispies only once in 4 years and is still only around 3 inches and no  fullness.</li>
            <li>but maybe is too early to say.</li>
            <li>This product has been used by my 6 year old daughter for going on 35 days now.</li>
            <li>Shes so excited to take her vitamins everyday.</li>
            <li>At first i thought it was a bit pricey, but its a big bottle that will last you for 2 months!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about getting my ten year old daughter because her friend said &amp;#34;hey have you heard of nzuri&amp;#34;.So</li>
            <li>Ok but not great tasting.</li>
            <li>The taste seemed weird for her at first but not bad.</li>

            <li> My daughter loves the taste, but I don&#x27;t think that I have been using it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> One has shoulder length hair and the other&#x27;s hair is so short that people ask me if I cut it</li>
            <li> I likely will not repurchase due to flavor.</li>
            <li> Will finish this bottle which probably last a few months.oh</li>
            <li> I cannot speak on the results of hair growth because we hsve only been using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product actually works as advertised, my doughtier just couldn&#x27;t stand the taste, I gave it a try myself and the taste did have the feel of medicine.</li>
            <li> Her hair is finally starting to come down past her hair line on her forehead and a bit over her ears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving It to my daughter for less than thirty days</li>
            <li> Her hair was always dry and dull and wasn&#x27;t growing no matter what I tried.</li>
            <li> I take care of my little ones hair and scalp</li>
            <li> Its a little pricey but</li>
            <li> it might be here in few hours</li>
            <li> I have been giving this to my kids for about the past month now</li>
            <li> I see that there is no more shedding</li>
            <li> I will be ordering another bottle soon because it says to give it at least 60 days.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that its packed full of vitamins and minerals but the taste is awful.</li>
            <li> My child has been taking this for a month, due to a bad hair cut</li>
            <li> I have not seen unrealistic results.  </li>
            <li> I am really shocked at how well this product works.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about getting my ten year old daughter because her friend said &amp;#34;hey have you heard of nzuri&amp;#34;.So my daughter and her friend are going to take it together.Should I get the nzuri?</li>
            <li> I have been giving this to my kids for about the past month now and i must say i&#x27;m really impressed. I think this is better than the flinstones vitamins i waste money on. Even though you might not notice results right away, when you finally do you will be so pleased. My kids starting noticing results by 2 weeks now they are absolutely in love with it. It helps their sight sharper and their thinking is always on point. Never stop making this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> My daughter is 5 years old, rocking her beautiful natural hair and is using the Nzuri Elixir Children&#x27;s Liquid Vitamins for the first time. In her words,the vitamins are \\&quot;really good, I like it\\&quot;. We will continue to watch the effects of this product on my daughter&#x27;s hair, and submit a follow-up review.  Blessings.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter enjoyed the taste of it!  I have saw a reduction in shedding with use.</li>
            <li> I am really shocked at how well this product works. I have 3 year old twin girls. One has shoulder length hair and the other&#x27;s hair is so short that people ask me if I cut it (I never have). It just won&#x27;t grow! I&#x27;ve been giving it to both of them for about 1.5 months now. The one with the shorter hair has had a marked growth. Her hair is finally starting to come down past her hair line on her forehead and a bit over her ears. It&#x27;s getting thicker. My girl with the longer hair has always had a frizzy spot which has smoothed out a ton since we started this and looks shinier. Overall I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product and have already gotten my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> My son chopped off all my daughter&#x27;s hair and in a panic, I purchased this elixer.  I have no idea if it is helping the growth as it&#x27;s been a month or so.  But, she likes the taste and my son is super bummed that he doesn&#x27;t get any.</li>
            <li> It is great I see a change in my children&#x27;s hair already.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. My children didn&#x27;t like the taste of it and their hair didn&#x27;t grow and they took it faithfully for a month. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy it again..</li>
            <li> Used 1st bottle for 90 days on my 2 1/2 year old daughter. The taste seemed weird for her at first but not bad. Once she got used to it she likes it. Shes so excited to take her vitamins everyday. I have seen little hair growth for sure. Seems to be helping her hair grow and it is great vitamins for her body as well. I recommend this product. Just bought second bottle!!!</li>
            <li> I do believe my purchase of these vitamins that my daughter wanted for her toddler daughter is a positive rating.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the taste. At first i thought it was a bit pricey, but its a big bottle that will last you for 2 months!!</li>
            <li> It seemed to be working and then stalled out. My 3 year old has very short, fine hair and it grew 1/2cm. I really wasnt expecting much since her hair  has been trimmed of whispies only once in 4 years and is still only around 3 inches and no  fullness. Love the added vitamins and nutrients in her diet! Would like to try again.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair started shedding after about two weeks. The taste is not that good and I just cant see any difference.  I will not but this product again</li>
            <li> My daughter love it good results. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that its packed full of vitamins and minerals but the taste is awful. My kid would squint as if she had just bit into a lemon. Funny reaction but not for me.</li>
            <li> My daughter takes this for hair growth and it works great!</li>
            <li> This has been wonderful for my daughter&#x27;s hair! Has definitely helped with healthy hair growth following the haircut her 5 yr old brother gave her!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen a difference on the hair but maybe is too early to say. Will keep giving it though.</li>
            <li> This product has been used by my 6 year old daughter for going on 35 days now. Honestly, I can&#x27;t say if I&#x27;m noticing any hair growth just yet, guess I have to wait and see what happends after the 90 days. As for now, she is going to continue to take advantage of all the other amazing benefits of  this product. I will update my review, if any changes to the hair and or its growth after the 90 days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it actually helped my daughter&#x27;s hair, but it seems to be a good vitamin.</li>
            <li> My child has been taking this for a month, due to a bad hair cut I haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet</li>
            <li> I take care of my little ones hair and scalp I even give her some mineral rich and thought this more for my toddler.We both do not care for the taste.The color is orange and has a slighty not to great Tangy taste.Raves about the taste were what finally sold me on this.Ok but not great tasting.It is a good size bottle but very pricy know that I recheck the price.Will finish this bottle which probably last a few months.oh yes there are lot of great ingredients inside.I likely will not repurchase due to flavor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product actually works as advertised, my doughtier just couldn&#x27;t stand the taste, I gave it a try myself and the taste did have the feel of medicine.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen results as of yet. I know that I need to continue taking it.</li>
            <li> Ordered these vitamins because I was at my wits end with my daughter&#x27;s hair. Within the first 30 days(one bottle) her hair was growing, healthy, shiny, and she had so much more energy. Not only does it help aid growth in children&#x27;s hair, it nourishes your childs body as well. Its a little pricey but well worth it</li>
            <li> So glad I came across this product for my daughter,having already purchased products from this company I was really happy when they made a vitamin supplements for children that gives them all there fruit and vegetables in one serving I have noticed that my daughter is more energetic more focused in school grades have gotten better she also was having really bad stomach pains that have stop since taking this supplement,now to the best part her hair is shiny more manageable  to comb I see that there is no more shedding and it is growing so will just keep on using to see where we are at in three months but overall I&#x27;m very happy and so is my daughter</li>
            <li> Been using this for my baby girl about four months now it didn&#x27;t grow her hair I give it a try didn&#x27;t work for her it really was a waste of money so I will not be ordering any more not saying it won&#x27;t work for your child it just didn&#x27;t work for my child it was well over 90 days just didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Works great! Love this vitamin!</li>
            <li> So far my daughter&#x27;s hair is healthy, I&#x27;m continuing to use it so I can see more growth results. At present her hair is 10inches. Her skin is lighter and she loves to drink it.</li>
            <li> I have not seen unrealistic results.  It is a good multi-vitamin for kids. I think diet and eating right are the key factors that will promote hair growth. This will definitely support it. Hair growth is really the result of genetics.  Just take good care of your kids care and it will grow in time.</li>
            <li> The taste is not bad.  I cannot speak on the results of hair growth because we hsve only been using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Yes it met my expectations.It really works for my granddaughter.thanks.Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Ordering my second bottle today...</li>
            <li> Did not work on my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving It to my daughter for less than thirty days and im starting to see some results. I will write another post in 90 days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 months now; i havent been consistent with giving to her on a daily basis but I am seeing results. Her hair was always dry and dull and wasn&#x27;t growing no matter what I tried. Now its shiny and healthy looking and has also grown. Before using this product she could only get 10 beads on her braid and now her hair can hold 17 beats. I&#x27;ll will continue to use this product until i get the desired results. Plus she loves the taste taht she ask for more than is recommended. Also, its packed with fruits/vegetables and other things to keep her healthy!!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be fooled on how I said I love it my first bottle of this kids hair vitamin is coming today 10/25/2014 it might be here in few hours I will try it for the 30 day supply and let u guys know how I feel about this product I just had to put a star. however ive seen it have more good reviews than bad reviews</li>
            <li> So far so good... I have noticed that my daughters hair is more manageable and noticeably thicker... Will write another review in the next two weeks or so</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because I  haven&#x27;t been using it for a month yet. My daughter loves the taste, but I don&#x27;t think that I have been using it long enough to see results. I will be ordering another bottle soon because it says to give it at least 60 days.</li>
            <li> It has alot of suger....</li>
