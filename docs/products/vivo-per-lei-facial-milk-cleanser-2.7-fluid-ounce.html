            <li>I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>Was so happy could finally find it to go with the rest of the line.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this in the mall ran out and got it on amazon....</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better price than OROGOLD for the same amazing results.</li>
            <li>I did not like this product; my skin did not feel clean after cleansing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this item previously and LOVED IT!  </li>
            <li>People comment constantly about how good my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was reasonable and the packaging was safe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more once I run out!</li>
            <li>so it was worth</li>
            <li>what I paid at first just to find this.  </li>
            <li>I was looking around and found this product at first i was hesitant but</li>
            <li>This skin product leaves your skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is very mild and my face doesn&#x27;t get red or irritated after I use it.</li>
            <li>VERY quick shipping, low cost and high quality product!  </li>
            <li>The cleanser leaves my skin clean and not dry as do some soaps.  </li>
            <li>thanks God I bought this.</li>
            <li>I use the vivo peeling and day cream which ARE very helpful with my breakouts (they&#x27;ve stopped altogether) but this stuff has been sitting in my cabinet unused.</li>
            <li>Dont need as much moisture after using this cleanser</li>
            <li>This product uses a pea size to clean your whole face and it not only cleared my skin of blemishes, my skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Now I use it as a body wash in the shower and my whole body is so soft like never before.</li>
            <li>There is another type of cleanser for people who have less sensitive and more oily skin.  </li>
            <li>The second bottle pumps right out of the spout and no lather; just watery.  </li>
            <li>and I always considered myself to have problem skin, kind of blotchy, dry patches, a few break outs</li>
            <li>From what I read it had an amazing smell and it was a thin consistency type of cleanser.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for acne but it is a very gentle cleanser if you have sensitive skin that dries out easily or possibly to use prior to doing an at home chemical peel because of the gentleness.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to clear my adult acne, but they always seems to try my skin out and even make acne worse.</li>

            <li> Very thin, more of a liquid feel than a cream.  </li>
            <li> The first bottle was so thick it lathered.  </li>
            <li> after using it a few days I went back to my old products...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on my acne prone skin and has a subtle, creamy scent.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or make it oily.</li>
            <li> It may work for a different skin type but was not right for me.</li>
            <li> For sensitive skin this cleaner does the job delicately, it contains chamomile and jojoba oil that does wonders together.</li>
            <li> I definitely saw a difference in my skin within a few days.</li>
            <li> Guess i&#x27;ll wait and see what the quality of the other two bottles are.</li>
            <li> It was so thick I had to actually twist off the pump and manually retrieve the cleanser.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using Vivo Per Lei Facial Milk Cleanser for a few years and find it soothing and cleansing for our delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> A little disappointed, does not remove the makeup on the first use</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed I guess you get what you pay for</li>

            <li> When I received it, the pump didn&#x27;t work and the product on the inside was thick like a lotion and had no smell to it at all.</li>
            <li> I knew something was wrong when it had a sticker that said made in japan.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item previously and LOVED IT!  It was so thick I had to actually twist off the pump and manually retrieve the cleanser.  Hence, I then ordered 3 more bottles.  I&#x27;ve opened the one and it&#x27;s so watery; I then shook the bottle repeatedly over a couple days and it&#x27;s still watery. The first bottle was so thick it lathered.  The second bottle pumps right out of the spout and no lather; just watery.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll order again. Guess i&#x27;ll wait and see what the quality of the other two bottles are. Updated: 5/3/15  My mistake.  I had ordered a set of three bottles, one of which was Milk Cleanser NOT the Foaming Cleanser.  Therefore, I stand corrected and give &amp;#34;5 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> The cleanser leaves my skin clean and not dry as do some soaps.  It also does not leave a residue.  I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using Vivo Per Lei Facial Milk Cleanser for a few years and find it soothing and cleansing for our delicate skin.  Love the light scent also.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser in conjunction with the Facial Peeling, the Toner, and the day cream.  My skin has never looked so good.  People comment constantly about how good my skin looks.  I never got compliments before and I always considered myself to have problem skin, kind of blotchy, dry patches, a few break outs etc. I don&#x27;t have those problems anymore.  I bought this stuff at a kiosk in the mall and paid a ton for it.  I was worried because I was running out and it was so costly.  Got on Amazon and figured out the mall people are ripping everyone off.  The prices here a so much better.  I&#x27;m glad I gave the stuff a chance so it was worth what I paid at first just to find this.  I highly recommend it.  There is another type of cleanser for people who have less sensitive and more oily skin.  This cleanser is very mild and my face doesn&#x27;t get red or irritated after I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this and it&#x27;s better price than OROGOLD for the same amazing results. I was looking around and found this product at first i was hesitant but thanks God I bought this. The shipping was reasonable and the packaging was safe.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed, does not remove the makeup on the first use one must apply twice.</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased Vivo facial care products and decided to try this item; however, I was disappointed with the product compared to the company&#x27;s other products.  Caused facial breakout which none of the others I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Vivo Lei makes wonderful products which make my skin feel and look good.  The fragrance is addicting! I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> You are supposed to use without water.  Very thin, more of a liquid feel than a cream.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for acne but it is a very gentle cleanser if you have sensitive skin that dries out easily or possibly to use prior to doing an at home chemical peel because of the gentleness. I use the vivo peeling and day cream which ARE very helpful with my breakouts (they&#x27;ve stopped altogether) but this stuff has been sitting in my cabinet unused.</li>

            <li> I originally bought this in the mall ran out and got it on amazon.... I knew something was wrong when it had a sticker that said made in japan. It doesn&#x27;t seem to even be cleaning my face. Pretty disappointed I guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> wonderful cleanser that wont overdry your skin. Leaves a nice smooth face after washing. Dont need as much moisture after using this cleanser</li>
            <li> VERY quick shipping, low cost and high quality product!  It&#x27;s very gentle on my acne prone skin and has a subtle, creamy scent.  I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more once I run out!</li>
            <li> For sensitive skin this cleaner does the job delicately, it contains chamomile and jojoba oil that does wonders together. I recommend it..</li>
            <li> This skin product leaves your skin soft and clean. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or make it oily. I definitely saw a difference in my skin within a few days.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for this item locally. Was so happy could finally find it to go with the rest of the line.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product; my skin did not feel clean after cleansing. It may work for a different skin type but was not right for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the feeling of it.  after using it a few days I went back to my old products...</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and Amazon sells it for a great price.. It sells for 3 times this price the mall. I have tried many products to clear my adult acne, but they always seems to try my skin out and even make acne worse. This product uses a pea size to clean your whole face and it not only cleared my skin of blemishes, my skin has never been so soft. Now I use it as a body wash in the shower and my whole body is so soft like never before. I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After reading the different reviews on this product I decided to go ahead and try it. From what I read it had an amazing smell and it was a thin consistency type of cleanser. When I received it, the pump didn&#x27;t work and the product on the inside was thick like a lotion and had no smell to it at all. This is not what I was expecting.</li>
