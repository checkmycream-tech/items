            <li>Excellent product</li>
            <li>ITS AWESOME!</li>
            <li>Awesome product!</li>
            <li>Awesome delivery!!</li>
            <li>Best product out there...</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Beautiful product.</li>
            <li>This is great on my hair</li>
            <li>Always had Frederic himself cut my hair years ago and always used and loved his products.  </li>
            <li>Smell good too.</li>
            <li>Fekkai products are all exceptional, have used them for over twenty years</li>
            <li>But even when I sprayed it throughout my hair to get more texture, my hair felt too \\&quot;wispy\\&quot; to style.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>If you want volume, try it and keep adding more.</li>
            <li>I hope Fekkai continues to make the advanced Coiff Bouffant spray forever!</li>
            <li>Been using this product for years and it gives my fine hair lift, texture, and helps it look fuller.</li>
            <li>This did give my fine hair lift at the roots.</li>
            <li>The product dries out my hair, I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is a must for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Fekkai because it not only helps me style my hair, but the hair is shiny -- unlike with Surf Spray, which gives great texture but no shine.    </li>
            <li>I have tried many different products for my hair, but this is definitely the best.  </li>
            <li>I agree with the reviewer who wasn&#x27;t impressed with it for texturizing (if that means trying to create a &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; look), but It is THE best answer to adding thickness and volume to fine, limp, thin hair.</li>
            <li>STARTED TRYING DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AGAIN &amp; REMEMBERED HOW MUCH I LOVED THIS.  </li>
            <li>This product is perfect for anyone with thin fine hair.</li>
            <li>Tried this product for the first time recently and love it!</li>
            <li>THIS is too much,&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll get it just right.</li>
            <li>GREAT FOR VOLUME AND MAKES MY HAIR FEEL SO FULL AND THICK.</li>
            <li>I have learned to partially dry my hair before using this, and it makes my hair fuller and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and have tried mousse and gels to get a little body and lift, they seem to work fine for a while but eventually, my hair falls.</li>
            <li>Gives a big lift to fine hair.</li>
            <li>The trick is experimenting with how much product to use for the look you want.</li>
            <li>I love this product &amp; will never use any other hair product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a product to keep your hair high up.</li>
            <li>It gives my fine, limp hair so much volume and texture.</li>
            <li>Chances are the first time or two you try using it, you probably won&#x27;t use enough out of fear of it making your hair sticky or of flattening it.</li>
            <li>I have fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>With this product, I get lots of body and it doesn&#x27;t disappear and the hair is soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>My hair is not sticky, feels natural and it keeps all day.</li>
            <li>No other volume builder has ever come close to the results I get from this spray-gel.</li>
            <li>When my hair was longer, using Fekkai seemed to take me a bit longer to get it fully dry, but it was worth the slight difference in time for its manageability and shine.</li>

            <li> My hair is pathetic, practically invisible, so I spray a lot from roots to tips.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years. I have thin fine hair, usually worn fairly short, and this spray gel definitely gives me the body I need. Before this, I used Bumble &amp; Bumble Surf Spray. I prefer the Fekkai because it not only helps me style my hair, but the hair is shiny -- unlike with Surf Spray, which gives great texture but no shine.    When my hair was longer, using Fekkai seemed to take me a bit longer to get it fully dry, but it was worth the slight difference in time for its manageability and shine.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and it gives my fine hair lift, texture, and helps it look fuller.</li>
            <li> This did give my fine hair lift at the roots. But even when I sprayed it throughout my hair to get more texture, my hair felt too \\&quot;wispy\\&quot; to style. Very expensive for root lifter. I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and once again delivered as promised by your company...</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products for my hair, but this is definitely the best.  It gives my fine, limp hair so much volume and texture.</li>
            <li> Gives a big lift to fine hair. I&#x27;m now a believer.</li>
            <li> I have learned to partially dry my hair before using this, and it makes my hair fuller and more manageable.  I love it.</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s name is a bit of a misnomer, imo. I agree with the reviewer who wasn&#x27;t impressed with it for texturizing (if that means trying to create a &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; look), but It is THE best answer to adding thickness and volume to fine, limp, thin hair. The trick is experimenting with how much product to use for the look you want. My hair is pathetic, practically invisible, so I spray a lot from roots to tips. At least I now appear to have almost-real hair. Chances are the first time or two you try using it, you probably won&#x27;t use enough out of fear of it making your hair sticky or of flattening it. For me, I almost can&#x27;t &amp;#34;over-do&amp;#34; the amount of product. I&#x27;ll never have Jennifer Anniston&#x27;s hair without some genetic re-engineering, but at least my scalp doesn&#x27;t peek through all over. No other volume builder has ever come close to the results I get from this spray-gel. While it may seem pricey, it&#x27;s close to a miracle worker for me, so I feel I&#x27;m getting terrific value for the price. If you want volume, try it and keep adding more. Just when you think &amp;#34;now THIS is too much,&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll get it just right.</li>
            <li> HAVE USED IN THE PAST BUT TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT WHEN I CUT ALL MY HAIR OFF IN A PIXIE CUT. NOW THAT IT HAS GROWN BACK OUT I&#x27;VE STARTED TRYING DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AGAIN &amp; REMEMBERED HOW MUCH I LOVED THIS.  ITS AWESOME! GREAT FOR VOLUME AND MAKES MY HAIR FEEL SO FULL AND THICK.</li>
            <li> I have fine, limp hair.  This product gives me just the right amount of body and hold without being sticky or hard to comb through.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Awesome delivery!! I love this product &amp; will never use any other hair product. I hope Fekkai continues to make the advanced Coiff Bouffant spray forever!</li>
            <li> Best product out there...Fekkai products are all exceptional, have used them for over twenty years</li>

            <li> The product dries out my hair, I have fine hair. i like Fekkai hair spray and conditioner but not this one.</li>
            <li> Tried this product for the first time recently and love it! I have fine hair and have tried mousse and gels to get a little body and lift, they seem to work fine for a while but eventually, my hair falls. With this product, I get lots of body and it doesn&#x27;t disappear and the hair is soft to the touch. Beautiful product.</li>
            <li> This is a must for fine hair. I&#x27;m always scrunching trying to give my hair lift. I spray this in my hair when it&#x27;s damp, blow dry and voila!  My hair is not sticky, feels natural and it keeps all day.</li>
            <li> This is great on my hair</li>
            <li> Sorry they stopped making this product- for the money it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for anyone with thin fine hair. It adds body without the stickiness. I spray the roots of my hair and then style. Works great! Seller delivered on time and as expected.</li>
