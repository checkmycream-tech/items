            <li>The dentist was so impressed and told me to never stop using it.</li>
            <li>Best mouth care ever tried.</li>
            <li>so well my hygienist was impressed.</li>
            <li>It tastes very good to me.  </li>
            <li>Good luck with your money!</li>
            <li>It is the best product of its kind on the market.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Just a warning to someone looking for something great like I was.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Came on time and works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product...would order it again.</li>
            <li>Great product ...used mouthwash for years ....</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that my gum is healed and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>I saw the great reviews of this product and wanted to give it a try, so I did.  </li>
            <li>This is great.</li>
            <li>My dentist commented on how great my teeth &amp; gums were at 6 month checkup.</li>
            <li>Great for swollen gums gingivitis</li>
            <li>I will recommend this to anyone, it is also good for maintaining your teeth and gum.</li>
            <li>It takes a good deal of time each day.</li>
            <li>but otherwise this stuff seems to work fairly well.  </li>
            <li>seems like a good thing.</li>
            <li>Must be doing something good.</li>
            <li>a candidacy I was delighted to give up! :-)  </li>
            <li>Yesterday I went in for a cleaning and the hygienist told me that there is not one speck of disease anywhere and that my gums were very healthy (and I still don&#x27;t floss).  </li>
            <li>And yes, my gums are very very healthy now.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>It works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>It also has amazing reviews like this product.</li>
            <li>I liked getting everything I needed in one box.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product although it did take some getting use to the taste.</li>
            <li>:  I still think this is a good product but in the interest of honesty I have to add more information.  </li>
            <li>And to be honest, I am reluctant to go to the dentist out of fear that I will be reprimanded for not flossing.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product after reading the great reviews.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s me, but these products (toothpaste and rinse) are good adjunct products for helping keep your teeth and gums in their best condition but do not take the place of regular dental care-</li>
            <li>If it were that easy the dentists would be out of business-this is a good product for preventative and therapeutic care</li>
            <li>So first I tried enzymes, which worked great, but didn&#x27;t seem to allow it to heal, or if so, veeeeerrrrrryyyyyy sllllloooooooooowly.  </li>
            <li>great product, works fast, will be ordering again !</li>
            <li>Most liquid tastes salty.</li>
            <li>It helped to be able to try it out.  </li>
            <li>but I enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li>I saw this product claiming to give you the best gum care possible</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any more words to write.  </li>
            <li>Six or eight minutes a day is not a lot of hassle for healthy teeth and gums.   </li>
            <li>film\\&quot; and we are going to hear more about this in time to come.  </li>
            <li>It has worked better than the name brand rinses, salty water, and peroxide.  </li>
            <li>It also did not make my gums more tender.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this worked for me without any issues.</li>
            <li>Its way better than most store bought brands, and it is now a staple product for me.</li>
            <li>After a root planning and scaling and a switch of toothbrushes, you will achieve better results than a $23.00 gum care kit.</li>
            <li>have a stubborn mouth infection that more than one dentist has chosen to ignore and not treat</li>
            <li>I feel better using this product.</li>
            <li>After two weeks, I was able to use my water pik and floss without any blood or discomfort.  </li>
            <li>Since it is for healthy gum I use it all over my lower gum area.</li>
            <li>Like many noted, I did experience a change in my sense of taste.  </li>
            <li>on top of one my my molars</li>
            <li>WAY BETTER than the dentist IMO.  </li>
            <li>Now they are used to it, although I use it once a week at the most.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I used it into the product ran out.</li>
            <li>The taste is OK.</li>
            <li>Since then, I went off the product for a couple of months and found that my gums were just not as healthy.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff works wonders for my gingivitis.</li>
            <li>It just costs a lot of money and doesn&#x27;t do anything to promote healthy teeth, gums, mouth, and tongue.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews but this is a situation where a product exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li>and I have just ordered more..</li>
            <li>and I have just ordered more.</li>
            <li>treatment-&lt;br /&gt;That being said I have used this product for years AND go to the dentist for regular visits-I have been very, very happy with the products and use them accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>Highly effective oxygen cleaning and soothing aloe make my mouth feel super healthy.</li>
            <li>and once you use it, it does make your mouth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>If you have gum issues and want to try to fix them without chancing a dental visit that could lead to more than you are ready to do, by all means give the kit a fair trial.  </li>
            <li>There is no minty taste or feeling which takes time to get used to, but your mouth is definitely clean!</li>
            <li>This dentist was provided a copy of my last chart and the results were incredible.</li>
            <li>Using the trays provided is a sure cure for even advanced cases of gingivitis.&lt;br /&gt;Continued use helps to restore gums</li>
            <li>A visit to the hygenist confirmed that my gums were in much better shape (as evidenced by  pocket depth measurements).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a good opinion of the dentistry practice as a whole.  </li>
            <li>If you need the strong mint taste, then brush and gargle once a day with the old stuff and be happy, or chew some Xylitol mint gum, but make this your mainstay.  </li>
            <li>I do not know if that would make a difference if I started to do so or not.&lt;br /&gt;The mouthwash has a strong hydrogen peroxide taste</li>
            <li>So while I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re very good for the gums, as all of these other users testify, please beware that the products may affect your sense of taste.  </li>
            <li>I have darn near flawless teeth and brushed and flossed and gargled more than most people</li>
            <li>So this works just fine</li>
            <li>But I am super pleased at the results.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews here, and wanting my gums to be super-healthy, I ordered the gel toothpaste on amazon and bought the mouthwash at a local store.  </li>
            <li>It turns out I have somewhat advanced gum disease.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Albrite product where I would get a free book and in just a needle into my gym with a homemade solution with hydrogen peroxide and table salt.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Believe me, I have tried everything, and this by far is the most effective at both killing bacteria AND healing infection.</li>
            <li>actually probably does more damage than good, as it&#x27;s not a toothpaste.</li>
            <li>After using the gum care system for a month or so, and the original TheraBreath tooth paste and mouth wash for a few months before that I had the best dental checkup ever.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received the package.</li>
            <li>I was more than willing to spend the 25 bucks every couple of weeks if it was an upgrade from drug store toothpaste.</li>
            <li>So yes, I believe this is a good product, but be sure not to substitute it for getting real cleanings and getting the input of a professional.</li>
            <li>After using Perio therapy for one week I saw a significant improvement.  </li>
            <li>After using this product, I have noticed a significant reduction in bleeding.</li>
            <li>Very happy to have found this product as it is not easy to find an effective natural mouthwash w/ no alcohol.</li>
            <li>I have Periodontal Disease and after using this for a while, my dentist has commented on how clean my teeth and mouth are.  </li>
            <li>This item does nothing to stop bleeding gums or even just to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>but your teeth don&#x27;t feel clean after.</li>
            <li>Also, the instructions on the box require you to floss with the special floss supplied, for one month.</li>
            <li>I am now a true believer.</li>
            <li>I have always brushed, flossed and taken good care of my teeth</li>
            <li>(Full disclosure/soapbox:  </li>
            <li>Someone might say that my improvement is from flossing, but I really think I have seen more improvement than I have seen before from flossing alone.  </li>
            <li>The color is white,so it doesn,t stain the teeth and taste is not bad.</li>
            <li>but it quickly goes</li>
            <li>A week later, most of my sensitivity went away for the most part.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a lifetime user of Colgate Total, floss morning and night and have a very healthy mouth.</li>
            <li>You can feel it working from the very first application.  </li>
            <li>my gums wasn&#x27;t bleeding and my teeth looked better, but a week after i started using normal toothpaste again</li>
            <li>I have also noticed my gums to fill in more and my teeth, overall, feel clean throughout the day!</li>
            <li>Not that this is a good reason to avoid the dentist, and really I should be looking for a new dental practice, because  a dental hygentist torturing me with metal instruments and then lecturing me like a child is really abuse, not treatment.  </li>
            <li>I can go two days and still have a pretty clean mouth.  </li>
            <li>So far, my gums feel great, and it&#x27;s only been a week.</li>
            <li>Minty fresh gel or paste or mouthwash wasn&#x27;t fixing my gums like</li>
            <li>It is worth the money, trust me.</li>
            <li>well worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>Worth the money I think.</li>
            <li>Breath be so fresh, yo.</li>
            <li>She said she didn&#x27;t have time to clean them that day but that with that many fives I would need to come back for root scaling.  </li>
            <li>so, i usually buy 2 or more to get my free shipping and tax free!      </li>
            <li>and if there&#x27;s changes in the effectiveness in the future, I will gladly come back and edit this review, but for now I&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>But right now, I don&#x27;t know what will happen.  </li>
            <li>you can always give it a try yourself but my advice is to contact a doctor and get your checked to receive the right treatment.</li>
            <li>It has been much more effective than the useless Chlorohexadrine I was given by prescription many times.</li>
            <li>I would smear a small amount of the gel on my gums before going to bed, and in the morning my gums felt great.  </li>
            <li>It worked pretty well for us.</li>
            <li>Two hints: when softening the trays in hot water, don&#x27;t overdo the heat.</li>
            <li>This product is nothing more than a different type of toothpaste, it does not make your gum disease go away</li>
            <li>- the gum had receded upwards leaving an evident \\&quot;hole\\</li>
            <li>&quot; next to the top of the tooth where gum should be.  </li>
            <li>toothpaste products make everything taste funny?).</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it whenever I have an oral health problem and it always works wonders to get me back on track.  </li>
            <li>The price at amazon is the same as most.  </li>
            <li>Being without dental insurance, I wasn&#x27;t able to make regular visits to the dentist.</li>
            <li>Although I was eventually able to stop the bleeding gums by hurculean effort, I could never get the pockets (which ranged from 1-2 mm in front to 4-5 mm in back, and one 6 in an abnormal tooth) to heal, no matter what I did.  </li>
            <li>the first time  </li>
            <li>just make sure to buy extra toothpaste</li>
            <li>If you have allergies, test it out first</li>
            <li>, my mouth felt funny all day and my tongue was irritated again.  </li>
            <li>OK for me as I do actually drink that on occasion.</li>
            <li>At first it just seemed as if I could not taste anything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very barbaric, and unlike modern medicine, hasn&#x27;t advanced much in 2 thousand years.</li>
            <li>And I am flossing more regularly.</li>
            <li>So now I am actually gaining more confidence with my mouth and plan to go to the dentist, (although I am switching practices.)</li>
            <li>It saved me from one gum surgery for sure and will likely be saving me from others.</li>
            <li>(the seal did not appear to be removed), the first molding tray went to garbage...</li>
            <li>I will come back with more about the effect on my gums</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and did not miss any treatments.</li>
            <li>Soaking in the trays burned the first time.</li>
            <li>So thanks to this rip off of a product I&#x27;m sitting in a waiting room right now to have a root canal and spend around $2k.</li>
            <li>Overall, my gums feel a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>I had to use a special antibiotic toothpaste and rinse for 2 weeks to help clear up the issue.  </li>
            <li>I mean, we can correct vision with painless laser beams, where is that kind of technology in dentisry!)</li>
            <li>And it certainly isn&#x27;t damaging my gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;for very mild gum issues, it is probably better than using plain old hydrogen peroxide, but then the price becomes a consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a last resort, I orded Dr. Katz Perio Therapy and have been using it a couple of weeks, and I have noticed a HUGE improvement.  </li>
            <li>After using this for a month my gums still bleed but not as much as it use to.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t like the taste as much anymore.  </li>
            <li>Who writes these ecstatic reviews - real customers or promoters of the product?    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really is a crock</li>
            <li>This really helped the person who I got this for her gums quit bleeding.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>, how much time do you want to spend on this?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I would rinse and brush using periotherapy, not so much a fan of the trays.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste/gel was very soothing to my irritated gums.</li>
            <li>I trusted it too much without taking any photo for before and after.</li>
            <li>I am unsure what this product is meant to do, but I will say it didn&#x27;t really help me out at all.</li>
            <li>, dont go whole hog</li>
            <li>I have real issues with my bone and gums.</li>
            <li>I should have reviewed info more carefully  before I bought it.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price fast delivery</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not lazy and willing to follow instruction, use it.  </li>
            <li>They have never felt this clean throughout my entire life!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Want to keep your own teeth as long as possible?</li>
            <li>The toothgel also has done a fine job of getting off some old tartar on the back of my bottom front teeth (a problem spot for me since childhood)</li>
            <li>Recently a swelling had appeared high over the tooth, initially not painful, but getting tender-er as it grew.</li>
            <li>The 7&#x27;s are now 6&#x27;s, much less bleeding and most of my measurements are 3&#x27;s and 4&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for minty-fresh or fizzy, this isn&#x27;t what you seek, but if you want to take a good shot at fixing your troubled gums yourself, this is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say if you are looking for a decent product give it a try, but you may want to ease into it rather than dive in.  </li>
            <li>I had most 4&#x27;s and 6&#x27;s and only 2 12&#x27;s and actually some zero&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Within a few months I went back to the specialist and he noted that my gums were much more firm and the teeth were much more secure in their sockets.</li>
            <li>I must admit I mainly use the oral rinse, because the toothpaste does leave a wierd metallic taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>More expensive &amp; more time-consuming than drugstore toothpaste, yes.</li>
            <li>My advanced periodontitis issues of tooth pain, loose teeth and receding gums went away.  </li>
            <li>that nothing else would remove, even the high tech brushes.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for gum problems.</li>
            <li>At any rate, I still have a little sensitivity, mostly when I eat a candy bar and let it &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The teeth in the vicinity are more firmly rooted.  </li>
            <li>It was well worth the extra money for me.</li>
            <li>my canker sore got better after a few days</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to those with bleeding and sensitive teeth/gum problems..</li>
            <li>I have deep pockets, significant bone loss, instanta calcium issues, and have never had simple cleanings.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I still have my sense of smell, but really, a lot of things taste odd to me now, and they taste kind of like the way my mouth tastes after using the products (mostly neutral, not a strong taste, but a little \\&quot;off\\&quot;.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this works and its great to try less invasive and expensive alternatives first!</li>
            <li>Its yellow and smells and tastes like a chemical you&#x27;d clean your toilet with.</li>
            <li>Like the toothpaste and the directions are clear.</li>
            <li>Thanks to amazon, i don&#x27;t have to pay $25 (riteaids/CVS/Walgreens), instead, only $19..</li>
            <li>A year ago I went to get a dental cleaning and the hygienist told me I had the early stages of gum disease.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised at the improvement in my gums.</li>
            <li>I am truly surprised.</li>
            <li>I was probably too far along for any product to save me.  </li>
            <li>I will be getting professional cleanings 3-4 times a year.  </li>
            <li>Once that happens the bacteria gets sophisticated and begins to work together, and actually communicate, changing how it behaves and making it more destructive.  </li>
            <li>Listen, if you have issues with your gums, you need to seek out professional dental guidance.</li>
            <li>If you have ever used the white bottled crest mouthwash; it is much milder than that.</li>
            <li>If you have ever used the white bottled crest mouthwash; it is much milder than that.</li>
            <li>Completely natural with no toxic garbage fillers.</li>
            <li>After just a week of this product, two of my molar teeth (which never had issues before) developed tooth abcesses that now need a root canal.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s another kind of those products you see on TV claiming that they have a secret formula that does miracles.</li>
            <li>About one week later my lower gum starting disappear very fast.</li>
            <li>Recently I had my annual examination, back in April, and of course, same old story, mostly pockets above six, and several 12&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks it seemed as though my gums were healthier and the floss felt tighter in the back gums where the main problem was.  </li>
            <li>I have my doubts, but until I use this long term, I will not know if it really does the job.</li>
            <li>I am now ready to make that long overdue appointment with the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I immediately stopped using the products, and I&#x27;m hoping over time to get back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for my pregnancy related moderate gingivitis.</li>
            <li>As someone who is very anal about their dental care I couldn&#x27;t be more angry.</li>
            <li>The next day I started to notice my top gums on the inside next to my cheek were a little red and tender.</li>
            <li>Still use Dr. Katz products to this day with no regrets!</li>
            <li>(its not FDA approved) and maybe it helps some people, but looks like it can do major damage to the mouths of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like I ignor my teeth, which are really great, but I have bad gum tissue and always have.</li>
            <li>I have no more bleeding gums when flossing and my gums and tongue are pink and healthy (</li>
            <li>In brief: I was told I needed gum surgery to deal with tooth that was clearly separated from the others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m jealous of all the people that this stuff has apparently worked for.</li>
            <li>I had one area of my mouth where gum loss was apparent</li>
            <li>PeriO2 (stabilized Oxychlor compounds), tetrapotassium pyrophosphate, Xylitol, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, carageenan, sodium flouride, zince gluconate, CoQ10 (ubiquinone), essential oil of peppermint, natural flavor, sodium benzoate.   </li>
            <li>As far as cost..that is relative, but $20 seems a deal to me.</li>
            <li>As far as cost..that is relative, but $20 seems a deal to me.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I trusted him, since HMO dentists in NYC often suggest unnecessary work to beef up the bill.</li>
            <li>The plaque build up was so bad, the hygienist was only able to clean one quadrant per visit.</li>
            <li>Also since the main ingredient is the same in the toothpaste and mouthwash , why use it back to back to</li>
            <li>To here credit, she was very nice and not at all skeptical as a expected her to be as only a month had gone by since the last measurements were done..</li>
            <li>I think for minor issues, this might be fine---although I would consult a professional.</li>
            <li>I was no long a candidate for gum surgery --</li>
            <li>A day or two later however it was just too much and my gums felt horrible and incredibly tender.</li>
            <li>Few days later, started experiencing some pain on my right side upper and lower molars out of the blue (never had issues with them before).  </li>
            <li>Dentists always say perio problems are so hard to treat and are more or less chronic.</li>
            <li>My dentist has said of mouth care \\&quot;It will become your new religion\\&quot; and indeed it has because once you have gum disease it lurks and tries to come back.  </li>
            <li>I also developed something like a scab on the gum touching the tooth, perhaps gum disease, perhaps a small injury as the result of me doing too much brushing and disturbing the area further.   </li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Just a warning to someone looking for something great like I was.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> Came on time and works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product...would order it again.</li>
            <li> Great product ...used mouthwash for years ....</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that my gum is healed and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I saw the great reviews of this product and wanted to give it a try, so I did.  </li>
            <li> This is great.</li>
            <li> My dentist commented on how great my teeth &amp; gums were at 6 month checkup.</li>
            <li> Great for swollen gums gingivitis</li>
            <li> I will recommend this to anyone, it is also good for maintaining your teeth and gum.</li>
            <li> It takes a good deal of time each day.</li>
            <li> but otherwise this stuff seems to work fairly well.  </li>
            <li> seems like a good thing.</li>
            <li> Must be doing something good.</li>
            <li> a candidacy I was delighted to give up! :-)  </li>
            <li> Yesterday I went in for a cleaning and the hygienist told me that there is not one speck of disease anywhere and that my gums were very healthy (and I still don&#x27;t floss).  </li>
            <li> And yes, my gums are very very healthy now.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> It works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> It also has amazing reviews like this product.</li>
            <li> I liked getting everything I needed in one box.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product although it did take some getting use to the taste.</li>
            <li> :  I still think this is a good product but in the interest of honesty I have to add more information.  </li>
            <li> And to be honest, I am reluctant to go to the dentist out of fear that I will be reprimanded for not flossing.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product after reading the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s me, but these products (toothpaste and rinse) are good adjunct products for helping keep your teeth and gums in their best condition but do not take the place of regular dental care-</li>
            <li> If it were that easy the dentists would be out of business-this is a good product for preventative and therapeutic care</li>
            <li> So first I tried enzymes, which worked great, but didn&#x27;t seem to allow it to heal, or if so, veeeeerrrrrryyyyyy sllllloooooooooowly.  </li>
            <li> great product, works fast, will be ordering again !</li>
            <li> Most liquid tastes salty.</li>
            <li> It helped to be able to try it out.  </li>
            <li> but I enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li> I saw this product claiming to give you the best gum care possible</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any more words to write.  </li>
            <li> Six or eight minutes a day is not a lot of hassle for healthy teeth and gums.   </li>
            <li> film\\&quot; and we are going to hear more about this in time to come.  </li>
            <li> It has worked better than the name brand rinses, salty water, and peroxide.  </li>
            <li> It also did not make my gums more tender.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this worked for me without any issues.</li>
            <li> Its way better than most store bought brands, and it is now a staple product for me.</li>
            <li> After a root planning and scaling and a switch of toothbrushes, you will achieve better results than a $23.00 gum care kit.</li>
            <li> have a stubborn mouth infection that more than one dentist has chosen to ignore and not treat</li>
            <li> I feel better using this product.</li>
            <li> After two weeks, I was able to use my water pik and floss without any blood or discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Since it is for healthy gum I use it all over my lower gum area.</li>
            <li> Like many noted, I did experience a change in my sense of taste.  </li>
            <li> on top of one my my molars</li>
            <li> WAY BETTER than the dentist IMO.  </li>
            <li> Now they are used to it, although I use it once a week at the most.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I used it into the product ran out.</li>
            <li> The taste is OK.</li>
            <li> Since then, I went off the product for a couple of months and found that my gums were just not as healthy.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff works wonders for my gingivitis.</li>
            <li> It just costs a lot of money and doesn&#x27;t do anything to promote healthy teeth, gums, mouth, and tongue.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but this is a situation where a product exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> and I have just ordered more..</li>
            <li> and I have just ordered more.</li>
            <li> treatment-&lt;br /&gt;That being said I have used this product for years AND go to the dentist for regular visits-I have been very, very happy with the products and use them accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> Highly effective oxygen cleaning and soothing aloe make my mouth feel super healthy.</li>
            <li> and once you use it, it does make your mouth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> If you have gum issues and want to try to fix them without chancing a dental visit that could lead to more than you are ready to do, by all means give the kit a fair trial.  </li>
            <li> There is no minty taste or feeling which takes time to get used to, but your mouth is definitely clean!</li>
            <li> This dentist was provided a copy of my last chart and the results were incredible.</li>
            <li> Using the trays provided is a sure cure for even advanced cases of gingivitis.&lt;br /&gt;Continued use helps to restore gums</li>
            <li> A visit to the hygenist confirmed that my gums were in much better shape (as evidenced by  pocket depth measurements).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a good opinion of the dentistry practice as a whole.  </li>
            <li> If you need the strong mint taste, then brush and gargle once a day with the old stuff and be happy, or chew some Xylitol mint gum, but make this your mainstay.  </li>
            <li> I do not know if that would make a difference if I started to do so or not.&lt;br /&gt;The mouthwash has a strong hydrogen peroxide taste</li>
            <li> So while I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re very good for the gums, as all of these other users testify, please beware that the products may affect your sense of taste.  </li>
            <li> I have darn near flawless teeth and brushed and flossed and gargled more than most people</li>
            <li> So this works just fine</li>
            <li> But I am super pleased at the results.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews here, and wanting my gums to be super-healthy, I ordered the gel toothpaste on amazon and bought the mouthwash at a local store.  </li>
            <li> It turns out I have somewhat advanced gum disease.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Albrite product where I would get a free book and in just a needle into my gym with a homemade solution with hydrogen peroxide and table salt.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> Believe me, I have tried everything, and this by far is the most effective at both killing bacteria AND healing infection.</li>
            <li> actually probably does more damage than good, as it&#x27;s not a toothpaste.</li>
            <li> After using the gum care system for a month or so, and the original TheraBreath tooth paste and mouth wash for a few months before that I had the best dental checkup ever.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received the package.</li>
            <li> I was more than willing to spend the 25 bucks every couple of weeks if it was an upgrade from drug store toothpaste.</li>
            <li> So yes, I believe this is a good product, but be sure not to substitute it for getting real cleanings and getting the input of a professional.</li>
            <li> After using Perio therapy for one week I saw a significant improvement.  </li>
            <li> After using this product, I have noticed a significant reduction in bleeding.</li>
            <li> Very happy to have found this product as it is not easy to find an effective natural mouthwash w/ no alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have Periodontal Disease and after using this for a while, my dentist has commented on how clean my teeth and mouth are.  </li>
            <li> This item does nothing to stop bleeding gums or even just to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> but your teeth don&#x27;t feel clean after.</li>
            <li> Also, the instructions on the box require you to floss with the special floss supplied, for one month.</li>
            <li> I am now a true believer.</li>
            <li> I have always brushed, flossed and taken good care of my teeth</li>
            <li> (Full disclosure/soapbox:  </li>
            <li> Someone might say that my improvement is from flossing, but I really think I have seen more improvement than I have seen before from flossing alone.  </li>
            <li> The color is white,so it doesn,t stain the teeth and taste is not bad.</li>
            <li> but it quickly goes</li>
            <li> A week later, most of my sensitivity went away for the most part.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a lifetime user of Colgate Total, floss morning and night and have a very healthy mouth.</li>
            <li> You can feel it working from the very first application.  </li>
            <li> my gums wasn&#x27;t bleeding and my teeth looked better, but a week after i started using normal toothpaste again</li>
            <li> I have also noticed my gums to fill in more and my teeth, overall, feel clean throughout the day!</li>
            <li> Not that this is a good reason to avoid the dentist, and really I should be looking for a new dental practice, because  a dental hygentist torturing me with metal instruments and then lecturing me like a child is really abuse, not treatment.  </li>
            <li> I can go two days and still have a pretty clean mouth.  </li>
            <li> So far, my gums feel great, and it&#x27;s only been a week.</li>
            <li> Minty fresh gel or paste or mouthwash wasn&#x27;t fixing my gums like</li>
            <li> It is worth the money, trust me.</li>
            <li> well worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> Worth the money I think.</li>
            <li> Breath be so fresh, yo.</li>
            <li> She said she didn&#x27;t have time to clean them that day but that with that many fives I would need to come back for root scaling.  </li>
            <li> so, i usually buy 2 or more to get my free shipping and tax free!      </li>
            <li> and if there&#x27;s changes in the effectiveness in the future, I will gladly come back and edit this review, but for now I&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> But right now, I don&#x27;t know what will happen.  </li>
            <li> you can always give it a try yourself but my advice is to contact a doctor and get your checked to receive the right treatment.</li>
            <li> It has been much more effective than the useless Chlorohexadrine I was given by prescription many times.</li>
            <li> I would smear a small amount of the gel on my gums before going to bed, and in the morning my gums felt great.  </li>
            <li> It worked pretty well for us.</li>
            <li> Two hints: when softening the trays in hot water, don&#x27;t overdo the heat.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing more than a different type of toothpaste, it does not make your gum disease go away</li>
            <li> - the gum had receded upwards leaving an evident \\&quot;hole\\</li>
            <li> &quot; next to the top of the tooth where gum should be.  </li>
            <li> toothpaste products make everything taste funny?).</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it whenever I have an oral health problem and it always works wonders to get me back on track.  </li>
            <li> The price at amazon is the same as most.  </li>
            <li> Being without dental insurance, I wasn&#x27;t able to make regular visits to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Although I was eventually able to stop the bleeding gums by hurculean effort, I could never get the pockets (which ranged from 1-2 mm in front to 4-5 mm in back, and one 6 in an abnormal tooth) to heal, no matter what I did.  </li>
            <li> the first time  </li>
            <li> just make sure to buy extra toothpaste</li>
            <li> If you have allergies, test it out first</li>
            <li> , my mouth felt funny all day and my tongue was irritated again.  </li>
            <li> OK for me as I do actually drink that on occasion.</li>
            <li> At first it just seemed as if I could not taste anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very barbaric, and unlike modern medicine, hasn&#x27;t advanced much in 2 thousand years.</li>
            <li> And I am flossing more regularly.</li>
            <li> So now I am actually gaining more confidence with my mouth and plan to go to the dentist, (although I am switching practices.)</li>
            <li> It saved me from one gum surgery for sure and will likely be saving me from others.</li>
            <li> (the seal did not appear to be removed), the first molding tray went to garbage...</li>
            <li> I will come back with more about the effect on my gums</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and did not miss any treatments.</li>
            <li> Soaking in the trays burned the first time.</li>
            <li> So thanks to this rip off of a product I&#x27;m sitting in a waiting room right now to have a root canal and spend around $2k.</li>
            <li> Overall, my gums feel a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> I had to use a special antibiotic toothpaste and rinse for 2 weeks to help clear up the issue.  </li>
            <li> I mean, we can correct vision with painless laser beams, where is that kind of technology in dentisry!)</li>
            <li> And it certainly isn&#x27;t damaging my gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;for very mild gum issues, it is probably better than using plain old hydrogen peroxide, but then the price becomes a consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a last resort, I orded Dr. Katz Perio Therapy and have been using it a couple of weeks, and I have noticed a HUGE improvement.  </li>
            <li> After using this for a month my gums still bleed but not as much as it use to.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t like the taste as much anymore.  </li>
            <li> Who writes these ecstatic reviews - real customers or promoters of the product?    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really is a crock</li>
            <li> This really helped the person who I got this for her gums quit bleeding.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> , how much time do you want to spend on this?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I would rinse and brush using periotherapy, not so much a fan of the trays.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste/gel was very soothing to my irritated gums.</li>
            <li> I trusted it too much without taking any photo for before and after.</li>
            <li> I am unsure what this product is meant to do, but I will say it didn&#x27;t really help me out at all.</li>
            <li> , dont go whole hog</li>
            <li> I have real issues with my bone and gums.</li>
            <li> I should have reviewed info more carefully  before I bought it.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price fast delivery</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not lazy and willing to follow instruction, use it.  </li>
            <li> They have never felt this clean throughout my entire life!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Want to keep your own teeth as long as possible?</li>
            <li> The toothgel also has done a fine job of getting off some old tartar on the back of my bottom front teeth (a problem spot for me since childhood)</li>
            <li> Recently a swelling had appeared high over the tooth, initially not painful, but getting tender-er as it grew.</li>
            <li> The 7&#x27;s are now 6&#x27;s, much less bleeding and most of my measurements are 3&#x27;s and 4&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for minty-fresh or fizzy, this isn&#x27;t what you seek, but if you want to take a good shot at fixing your troubled gums yourself, this is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say if you are looking for a decent product give it a try, but you may want to ease into it rather than dive in.  </li>
            <li> I had most 4&#x27;s and 6&#x27;s and only 2 12&#x27;s and actually some zero&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Within a few months I went back to the specialist and he noted that my gums were much more firm and the teeth were much more secure in their sockets.</li>
            <li> I must admit I mainly use the oral rinse, because the toothpaste does leave a wierd metallic taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> More expensive &amp; more time-consuming than drugstore toothpaste, yes.</li>
            <li> My advanced periodontitis issues of tooth pain, loose teeth and receding gums went away.  </li>
            <li> that nothing else would remove, even the high tech brushes.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for gum problems.</li>
            <li> At any rate, I still have a little sensitivity, mostly when I eat a candy bar and let it &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The teeth in the vicinity are more firmly rooted.  </li>
            <li> It was well worth the extra money for me.</li>
            <li> my canker sore got better after a few days</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to those with bleeding and sensitive teeth/gum problems..</li>
            <li> I have deep pockets, significant bone loss, instanta calcium issues, and have never had simple cleanings.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I still have my sense of smell, but really, a lot of things taste odd to me now, and they taste kind of like the way my mouth tastes after using the products (mostly neutral, not a strong taste, but a little \\&quot;off\\&quot;.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this works and its great to try less invasive and expensive alternatives first!</li>
            <li> Its yellow and smells and tastes like a chemical you&#x27;d clean your toilet with.</li>
            <li> Like the toothpaste and the directions are clear.</li>
            <li> Thanks to amazon, i don&#x27;t have to pay $25 (riteaids/CVS/Walgreens), instead, only $19..</li>
            <li> A year ago I went to get a dental cleaning and the hygienist told me I had the early stages of gum disease.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised at the improvement in my gums.</li>
            <li> I am truly surprised.</li>
            <li> I was probably too far along for any product to save me.  </li>
            <li> I will be getting professional cleanings 3-4 times a year.  </li>
            <li> Once that happens the bacteria gets sophisticated and begins to work together, and actually communicate, changing how it behaves and making it more destructive.  </li>
            <li> Listen, if you have issues with your gums, you need to seek out professional dental guidance.</li>
            <li> If you have ever used the white bottled crest mouthwash; it is much milder than that.</li>
            <li> If you have ever used the white bottled crest mouthwash; it is much milder than that.</li>
            <li> Completely natural with no toxic garbage fillers.</li>
            <li> After just a week of this product, two of my molar teeth (which never had issues before) developed tooth abcesses that now need a root canal.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s another kind of those products you see on TV claiming that they have a secret formula that does miracles.</li>
            <li> About one week later my lower gum starting disappear very fast.</li>
            <li> Recently I had my annual examination, back in April, and of course, same old story, mostly pockets above six, and several 12&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks it seemed as though my gums were healthier and the floss felt tighter in the back gums where the main problem was.  </li>
            <li> I have my doubts, but until I use this long term, I will not know if it really does the job.</li>
            <li> I am now ready to make that long overdue appointment with the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I immediately stopped using the products, and I&#x27;m hoping over time to get back to normal.  </li>
            <li> Works very well for my pregnancy related moderate gingivitis.</li>
            <li> As someone who is very anal about their dental care I couldn&#x27;t be more angry.</li>
            <li> The next day I started to notice my top gums on the inside next to my cheek were a little red and tender.</li>
            <li> Still use Dr. Katz products to this day with no regrets!</li>
            <li> (its not FDA approved) and maybe it helps some people, but looks like it can do major damage to the mouths of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I ignor my teeth, which are really great, but I have bad gum tissue and always have.</li>
            <li> I have no more bleeding gums when flossing and my gums and tongue are pink and healthy (</li>
            <li> In brief: I was told I needed gum surgery to deal with tooth that was clearly separated from the others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m jealous of all the people that this stuff has apparently worked for.</li>
            <li> I had one area of my mouth where gum loss was apparent</li>
            <li> PeriO2 (stabilized Oxychlor compounds), tetrapotassium pyrophosphate, Xylitol, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, carageenan, sodium flouride, zince gluconate, CoQ10 (ubiquinone), essential oil of peppermint, natural flavor, sodium benzoate.   </li>
            <li> As far as cost..that is relative, but $20 seems a deal to me.</li>
            <li> As far as cost..that is relative, but $20 seems a deal to me.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I trusted him, since HMO dentists in NYC often suggest unnecessary work to beef up the bill.</li>
            <li> The plaque build up was so bad, the hygienist was only able to clean one quadrant per visit.</li>
            <li> Also since the main ingredient is the same in the toothpaste and mouthwash , why use it back to back to</li>
            <li> To here credit, she was very nice and not at all skeptical as a expected her to be as only a month had gone by since the last measurements were done..</li>
            <li> I think for minor issues, this might be fine---although I would consult a professional.</li>
            <li> I was no long a candidate for gum surgery --</li>
            <li> A day or two later however it was just too much and my gums felt horrible and incredibly tender.</li>
            <li> Few days later, started experiencing some pain on my right side upper and lower molars out of the blue (never had issues with them before).  </li>
            <li> Dentists always say perio problems are so hard to treat and are more or less chronic.</li>
            <li> My dentist has said of mouth care \\&quot;It will become your new religion\\&quot; and indeed it has because once you have gum disease it lurks and tries to come back.  </li>
            <li> I also developed something like a scab on the gum touching the tooth, perhaps gum disease, perhaps a small injury as the result of me doing too much brushing and disturbing the area further.   </li>
            <li> (I recently looked into highly acclaimed dental schools in my area where the root planning and scaling cost me a little over $100 dollars.)</li>
            <li> I would rather use other products that do the same thing, cost less, and are available locally for a lot LESS money.</li>
            <li> I have one spot where the gum is a little high</li>
            <li> &quot; but there&#x27;s an obvious lack of scuzz on the teeth for a long period of time, longer than with regular toothpaste and mouthwash, even after eating.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say my gums have been growing back yet but since using these products my gums have not bled once, where as they used to bleed quite a bit every single time I brushed before.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 7 years and it really works.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, and the oral rinse is a must.  </li>
            <li> But so far, I have noticed that the swelling in my gums has gone down to almost zero.  </li>
            <li> My gums are growing back, no new caries and the cleaning/probing did not hurt.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure what chemicals are in this therapy system, but buyers beware - especially those who have sensitive teeth to begin with.  </li>
            <li> Now I just hope that it hasn&#x27;t caused any long term damage.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked long term.  </li>
            <li> (Not much floss was provided, so I have used regular floss too.)  </li>
            <li> My mouth stays clean-feeling long after brushing and swishing.  </li>
            <li> As I continued the therapy the taste would linger long after my meal.</li>
            <li> AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL; I DO NOT WORK FOR THE COMPANY-</li>
            <li> Trying different things, I&#x27;d coax it back down, but it would recede again.  </li>
            <li> My gum is back in place (no hole) and the swelling above is going down.  </li>
            <li> I had no clue what was wrong until a slightly wiggly tooth got more wiggly and made me get to a dentist, who has sent me on to a periodontist for a series of stuff that will include cleanings and extractions.  </li>
            <li> and I had read a while back that a number of people who used a zinc product to ward off colds subsequently lost their sense of smell, and their food tasted odd to them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised by this reaction as I&#x27;m not typically a person who reacts badly to things, and also because no other reviewer has mentioned it (so far anyway.)  </li>
            <li> Just bought this a few days ago and not to trash the product as it is not my thing, but buying any regular hydrogen peroxide product will achieve the very same results at 1/4 of the cost of what this dentist here is selling it for.</li>
            <li> so i had several 5&#x27;s on a few back teeth).  </li>
            <li> Not normally what they look or feel like.</li>
            <li> and they were a swollen dark red purple color.</li>
            <li> much brushing or brushing with the wrong type of brush, flossing incorrectly and using all different types of rinses and toothpastes can actually make gum disease worse-&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Somehow I had the idea that this product was more about gum health and less about bad breath, although that&#x27;s certainly a major problem for a lot of people and this product probably addresses that.</li>
            <li> Like other users, during the transition, I developed a funky taste in my mouth that made even plain water taste icky, but that seems to have passed, lasting only maybe 4-5 days.  </li>
            <li> Be careful when doing the mouth piece, when I took it out of the water, only in a few seconds and moved it as instructed with the correct water temperature, the mouth piece collapsed and I could not get it into my mouth around my teeth, afraid it would happen again, did not have the water hot enough for the second one</li>
            <li> This product is one huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> My gums are a pink color I haven&#x27;t seen in years.</li>
            <li> Gums a rosy pink inside of a week.</li>
            <li> It killed the infection almost instantly, not after 3 weeks like the prescription mouthwash from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions minus using the trays and having the gel sit in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Katz website, made a few calls to them,ordered the perio therapy rinse, toothpaste, and ordered the hydro floss (similar to water pick).</li>
            <li> I had no 5mm measurements at all and only a few 4mm measurements.  </li>
            <li> I never really ate within a couple hours of using it</li>
            <li> I never really ate within a couple hours of using it</li>
            <li> It only comes with a few pieces of floss</li>
            <li> It developed slowly.</li>
            <li> It is nice not to have that bloody taste in my mouth after brushing.</li>
            <li> Nutshell version is that there is a difference between free-floating bacteria and bacteria that has settled down in a single spot and become bio film or plaque.  </li>
            <li> Bleeding gums and other infections?</li>
            <li> I am going to continue using these products along with periogen and see what happens in the next few months!</li>
            <li> Either way I didn&#x27;t expect this to happen since the man claims it&#x27;s gentlerthan other toothpastes that use sulfates.</li>
            <li> I have been on the other side of the fence where you say \\&quot;For Pete&#x27;s sake</li>
            <li> I told him nothing other then using this tooth gel.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but willing to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> No alcohol or other irritants.</li>
            <li> Did not change taste buds either as other users reported.</li>
            <li> I used a mix of half toothpaste and half of this paste as well as using a mix of half Listerine and half this mouthwash for an overall cleaner feeling.</li>
            <li> This was the 3rd or 4th product I tried and it was the only one that didn&#x27;t make the problem worse.  </li>
            <li> My gums stopped receding and turned to rosy pink within days and no more loose teeth or tooth pains bothered me.  </li>
            <li> My gums feel better, no more bleeding and bad breath, I will recommend this product</li>
            <li> Then while I was lying in bed, it occurred to me that the only thing I&#x27;ve started doing differently lately is using the gel and mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> although I really didn&#x27;t think they were unhealthy before until I saw the difference!)</li>
            <li> I noticed the swelling went down on my gums within a week.</li>
            <li> They just bled a little when I brushed hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got my husband using it and it has significantly reduced his bad breadth.  </li>
            <li> I think they changed the forumla slightly from 8 years ago</li>
            <li> If I start to taste the odd taste, I just skip this product for a day.  </li>
            <li> Within a week and a half I could see a difference.  </li>
            <li> My gums bleed less (if at all) and my mouth feels fresher when I use this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it irritated my mouth, particularly my tongue.  </li>
            <li> Did someone mess with something here????</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little odd getting used to rinsing with the mouthwash and not water, but</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t experience a particularly bad taste or a unusual change in the way other foods/beverages taste</li>
            <li> I sat in that chair for 15 minutes as she did a little scraping and then polishing.  </li>
            <li> The price is a little steep</li>
            <li> You also get two rubber arch forms  and a little floss.</li>
            <li> I waited a little bit til</li>
            <li> Instead of being chicken, I should have gone to a dentist and gotten a real diagnosis.  </li>
            <li> Definately notice when I skip using it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few things that seem to be helping.</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t minty sickening, It gives a healthy mouth feeling.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company and they said that it happened sometimes and it would go away after a few days.</li>
            <li> I was scared everyday that my teeth would fall out when I ate lunch.  </li>
            <li> Mine arrived missing the measuring cup but was sealed.</li>
            <li> Something with that price tag couldn&#x27;t possibly be bad right?</li>
            <li> think anything that makes your tastebuds dull out or change is not a great thing for your gums well-being in general.</li>
            <li> Plain water.  </li>
            <li> the measuring cup is broken, the tooth paste appears to be half empty</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helped my gums</li>
            <li> This is no magic solution to your gum disease.</li>
            <li> Self-treatment without professional diagnosis can be dangerous.  </li>
            <li> I swish with Plax and brush after every meal or snack and usually water pic too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why others are having problems, but this product (since 2008) has always worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I was not able to sleep at night without putting clove oil onto my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was also anxious to try this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one only helped one issue for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure what chemicals are in this</li>
            <li> It may be a little expensive, but I find I use a little less and regardless it has worked a miracle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any particular bad taste or smell.</li>
            <li> For years, I have had trouble with bleeding gums, and feared that I would end up at a periodontist with a serious problem.</li>
            <li> No more bleeding, no more swollen gums, and no more dentist drilling!      </li>
            <li> Of course I went back to my old nasty habits...</li>
            <li> After using this product, the lump that I believe to be calcification, has been reduced by at least 75%.</li>
            <li> I never flossed and often ate late at night after brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd, the first day on it, I could not drink coffee or water, both tasted horrible, and I am a girl that loves her coffee in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I take that to mean my pockets are closing up.  </li>
            <li> Then it changed to everything having the same terrible taste; everything tasted the same.</li>
            <li> The paste is just a little minty, the was not at all, it does taste a lot like stale chamomile tea.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little scary such small idiot creepies can do this anywhere, let alone in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> My gums have never been in this bad of a condition my entire life.</li>
            <li> Bad breath under control in the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> They have always been deep scaling, always in multipule visits and always painful.</li>
            <li> That solution was too messy and difficult.  </li>
            <li> so not a good start.</li>
            <li> It is not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> However, I am disappointed in the seller because the box says that there are 3 trays in the kit, and yet, in the box that was sent to me, there were only 2.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to pour it down the drain because I&#x27;m afraid of what it would do to the environment.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely horrified to see how terrible my gums looked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that a lot of things can factor into gum disease, and poor oral hygiene is not always the cause.  </li>
            <li> I finally tired of the dentist and the prescriptions that are unnatural and inhibit the healing process.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overpriced, and I feel like it gives people false hope that it will cure gum issues.</li>
            <li> She was shocked however after the measurements when she compared them to my chart from the previous time.  </li>
            <li> After the appointment I got very serious about taking care of the issue before it progressed.  </li>
            <li> I have a few periodontic issues, and my dentist said that this was bad</li>
            <li> Some people have commented that the product is expensive and tastes poorly.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me I needed expensive sublingual antibiotic treatment and that I had bone loss around my crowns, my two front teeth.</li>
            <li> But I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Scam products are often overpriced, and this is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> wrong.</li>
            <li> You are supposed to put the toothpaste in the forms and hold them against your teeth, but I have not been doing that because the toothpaste is so expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had some sort of allegic reaction to either the toothpaste or the floss.  </li>
            <li> and that maybe I had a cracked tooth or something and needed a root canal, so I went to my dentist and he found nothing wrong.  </li>
            <li> she said there was a dramatic difference!</li>
            <li> My gums have been bleeding for years now, and they gotten worse but not as bad as others have reported on here.</li>
            <li> I found it inconvenient to use and difficult to prepare the trays.  </li>
            <li> This gel and mouthwash are a little boring tasting.  </li>
            <li> This product has saved me from having expensive and painful dental surgery.  </li>
            <li> If your breath stinks, use it.   </li>
            <li> I was afraid to put it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> but I was getting desperate).  </li>
            <li> Now my lower gum in a dangerous situation.</li>
            <li> The end of the story is that I never had to have the expensive and painful oral surgery that was recommended for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;leaves an awful aftertaste, and your taste perception will be altered for at least 12 hours after use.</li>
            <li> The specialist wanted to cut and scrape all 4 quadrants, very expensive and painful.</li>
            <li> Like bad.  </li>
            <li> the &#x27;bad taste&#x27; thing went away.  </li>
            <li> My gums were so bad, I didn&#x27;t want to go to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> this product taste really bad, feels bad, and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My gums weren&#x27;t in really bad shape before I tried this.</li>
            <li> but I never noticed a bad taste at all.  </li>
            <li> but I never noticed a bad taste at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: wish I read the bad reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li> I sat in that chair for over an hour as she scraped my teeth (my mouth was bleeding and extremely painful after that).  </li>
            <li> I bought it to get me through a painful spell until my dentist appointment.</li>
            <li> did not work for me. :(</li>
            <li> This could be very dangerous product.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying.    </li>
            <li> The toothpaste and mouthwash in this kit tastes so awful that I literally threw up using it!</li>
            <li> Whether or not it works I will never know, because I cannot get beyond the awful taste.</li>
            <li> However, by day four everything I ate tasted horrible!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible.</li>

            <li> I use one kit a month, especially the toothpaste and oral rinse, and I no longer have sore gums.  This product has saved me from having expensive and painful dental surgery.  It is the best product of its kind on the market.</li>
            <li> Helped with bleeding gums</li>
            <li> Both my sister and I had gingivitis/gum disease issues, and so we tried out this PerioTherapy kit.  It worked pretty well for us.</li>
            <li> If your gum is swollen, use it.   If your gum is bleeding, use it.   If your breath stinks, use it.   If you&#x27;re not lazy and willing to follow instruction, use it.  Instruction: 1. brush with perio paste 2. rinse with perio solution 3. use your included teetch mold with perio paste for 20+min..     Result:  No more bleeding, no more swollen gums, and no more dentist drilling!      I&#x27;m not kidding... this product works..  My gums used to bleed everytime I floosed, but after properly using this product, it stopped bleeding.. When i stopped using this product, my problem came back after, mayb, 4-6 months, so I&#x27;m using it again.. No coincidence, this product works!    Thanks to amazon, i don&#x27;t have to pay $25 (riteaids/CVS/Walgreens), instead, only $19.. so, i usually buy 2 or more to get my free shipping and tax free!      Highly recommend to those with bleeding and sensitive teeth/gum problems..</li>
            <li> I have my doubts, but until I use this long term, I will not know if it really does the job.</li>
            <li> A year ago I went to get a dental cleaning and the hygienist told me I had the early stages of gum disease.  I sat in that chair for over an hour as she scraped my teeth (my mouth was bleeding and extremely painful after that).  I had to use a special antibiotic toothpaste and rinse for 2 weeks to help clear up the issue.  Of course I went back to my old nasty habits...I hate flossing.  It was time to go back for a cleaning and I saw Perio Therapy at my grocery store and thought I give it a try.  I have been using it for about a month.  Yesterday I went in for a cleaning and the hygienist told me that there is not one speck of disease anywhere and that my gums were very healthy (and I still don&#x27;t floss).  I sat in that chair for 15 minutes as she did a little scraping and then polishing.  I can&#x27;t believe the results.  The price is a little steep but so are dental visits.  I have recommended this to my friends and family.  I am now a true believer.</li>
            <li> My gums have been bleeding for years now, and they gotten worse but not as bad as others have reported on here. So I tried this and once you use it, it does make your mouth feel very clean. After using this for a month my gums still bleed but not as much as it use to. I don&#x27;t expect a miracle in a month by any means. I will try OraMD and do a review on that. Also since the main ingredient is the same in the toothpaste and mouthwash , why use it back to back to back everytime you have to use it.</li>
            <li> I think they changed the forumla slightly from 8 years ago but i don&#x27;t like the taste as much anymore.  I think its the zinc.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews here, and wanting my gums to be super-healthy, I ordered the gel toothpaste on amazon and bought the mouthwash at a local store.  After 9 or 10 days using both the gel and the mouthwash morning and night, I started to notice that my usual filtered water tasted funny to me.  Like bad.  Like I couldn&#x27;t stand to drink it.  Plain water.  Then while I was lying in bed, it occurred to me that the only thing I&#x27;ve started doing differently lately is using the gel and mouthwash.  I have no idea if there is a correlation, but there is zinc in this product and I had read a while back that a number of people who used a zinc product to ward off colds subsequently lost their sense of smell, and their food tasted odd to them.  I still have my sense of smell, but really, a lot of things taste odd to me now, and they taste kind of like the way my mouth tastes after using the products (mostly neutral, not a strong taste, but a little \\&quot;off\\&quot;.)  So while I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re very good for the gums, as all of these other users testify, please beware that the products may affect your sense of taste.  It is not pleasant.  I immediately stopped using the products, and I&#x27;m hoping over time to get back to normal.  But right now, I don&#x27;t know what will happen.  I&#x27;m very surprised by this reaction as I&#x27;m not typically a person who reacts badly to things, and also because no other reviewer has mentioned it (so far anyway.)  Disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I used a different toothpaste and rinse for a couple of days and the &#x27;bad taste&#x27; thing went away.  I now use this product at night, and a different toothpaste during the day.  If I start to taste the odd taste, I just skip this product for a day.  So far, so good.  And yes, my gums are very very healthy now.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is a 3rd purchase.... wonderful product or should I say it is a WONDER product. If you have an issue with your gums, this is the product that has helped several of my relatives.</li>
            <li> Bleeding gums and other infections? this is your answer, it works! I will recommend this to anyone, it is also good for maintaining your teeth and gum.</li>
            <li> for moderate gum disease, don&#x27;t expect miracles using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for very mild gum issues, it is probably better than using plain old hydrogen peroxide, but then the price becomes a consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;leaves an awful aftertaste, and your taste perception will be altered for at least 12 hours after use.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me I needed expensive sublingual antibiotic treatment and that I had bone loss around my crowns, my two front teeth. I wasn&#x27;t sure I trusted him, since HMO dentists in NYC often suggest unnecessary work to beef up the bill. Also, I am a bit dentist-phobic.    I started looking for cures and found this product, read the reviews, and considered ordering. But I was skeptical. How come dentists don&#x27;t prescribe this if it works? Scam products are often overpriced, and this is a bit expensive. Who writes these ecstatic reviews - real customers or promoters of the product?    I ordered it anyway. I am surprised at the improvement in my gums. Dentists always say perio problems are so hard to treat and are more or less chronic. My gums are a pink color I haven&#x27;t seen in years. It has been much more effective than the useless Chlorohexadrine I was given by prescription many times. This is after about a week of use.    Two hints: when softening the trays in hot water, don&#x27;t overdo the heat. Just a brief dip in less-than-boiling water. Otherwise they come apart. Also: for me this product has warped my taste buds a bit. Most liquid tastes salty. It&#x27;s annoying.    So far, my gums feel great, and it&#x27;s only been a week. I am truly surprised.</li>
            <li> I liked getting everything I needed in one box.  It helped to be able to try it out.  I liked this product although it did take some getting use to the taste.</li>
            <li> I was told a month ago by a dentist that I had stage 4 &amp; 5 periodontal disease with pockets as deep as 7 and that I would need root scaling and planing as well as laser surgery. In just a month of using periotherapy mouthwash in an oral irrigator (2x a day), using the toothpaste, and twice daily flossing I had my gums rechecked yesterday and the dentist is now moved me two stage 3 &amp; 4. The 7&#x27;s are now 6&#x27;s, much less bleeding and most of my measurements are 3&#x27;s and 4&#x27;s. I have no more bleeding gums when flossing and my gums and tongue are pink and healthy (although I really didn&#x27;t think they were unhealthy before until I saw the difference!) I am going to continue using these products along with periogen and see what happens in the next few months! I&#x27;d say this works and its great to try less invasive and expensive alternatives first!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helped my gums but I enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li> I found it inconvenient to use and difficult to prepare the trays.  It takes a good deal of time each day.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received the package. I started using the toothpaste and mouthwash immediately. The next day I started to notice my top gums on the inside next to my cheek were a little red and tender. Not normally what they look or feel like. I ignored it though, thinking it would pass. Over the next couple of days I followed the directions, brushing and rinsing twice a day and flossing at night. By day three my gums were feeling irritated and looked a darker red. I got one of those dental mirrors and looked at them from the side and they were a swollen dark red purple color. I didn&#x27;t know if this was just part of a healing process so I didn&#x27;t stop using the toothpaste and mouthwash twice a day like recommended. A day or two later however it was just too much and my gums felt horrible and incredibly tender. They were swollen along the line that they met my teeth and looked like they were receding. As someone who is very anal about their dental care I couldn&#x27;t be more angry. I was absolutely horrified to see how terrible my gums looked. I&#x27;ve been a lifetime user of Colgate Total, floss morning and night and have a very healthy mouth. I saw this product claiming to give you the best gum care possible and I thought that it could only improve my oral health. Something with that price tag couldn&#x27;t possibly be bad right? wrong. This product is one huge disappointment. I&#x27;m running my tongue over my tender swollen gums and couldn&#x27;t be angrier. My gums have never been in this bad of a condition my entire life. Now I just hope that it hasn&#x27;t caused any long term damage. I hope Colgate can repair the damage.      I&#x27;m jealous of all the people that this stuff has apparently worked for. I was more than willing to spend the 25 bucks every couple of weeks if it was an upgrade from drug store toothpaste. I don&#x27;t know if it really is a crock or there&#x27;s something in it that&#x27;s an irritant to just me. Either way I didn&#x27;t expect this to happen since the man claims it&#x27;s gentlerthan other toothpastes that use sulfates. Just a warning to someone looking for something great like I was. I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to any product I&#x27;ve ever used.     Oh yes and the mouthwash is something to comment on. Its yellow and smells and tastes like a chemical you&#x27;d clean your toilet with. I was afraid to put it in my mouth. This stuff makes Listerine taste like candy. Now I have this junk I&#x27;m never going to use sitting in my cabinet. I don&#x27;t want to pour it down the drain because I&#x27;m afraid of what it would do to the environment.</li>
            <li> I am in the middle of moving so have not yet had a chance to try the product. However, I am disappointed in the seller because the box says that there are 3 trays in the kit, and yet, in the box that was sent to me, there were only 2. Also, the instructions on the box require you to floss with the special floss supplied, for one month. Yet, inside the box are only 6 floss strands. Both the floss and the &#x27;trays&#x27; are in a ziplock plastic baggie. Did someone mess with something here????</li>
            <li> This really helped the person who I got this for her gums quit bleeding.  And her teeth tightened up. Now she is seeing a dentist. Thanks so much</li>
            <li> Works very well for my pregnancy related moderate gingivitis. I used a mix of half toothpaste and half of this paste as well as using a mix of half Listerine and half this mouthwash for an overall cleaner feeling. I noticed the swelling went down on my gums within a week.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Came on time and works great. Like the toothpaste and the directions are clear. I don&#x27;t have any more words to write.  Why is there a minimum?</li>
            <li> I have used this treatment and followed the instructions word by word. This product is nothing more than a different type of toothpaste, it does not make your gum disease go away and it doesn&#x27;t show any improvement either. it&#x27;s another kind of those products you see on TV claiming that they have a secret formula that does miracles. you can always give it a try yourself but my advice is to contact a doctor and get your checked to receive the right treatment. This is no magic solution to your gum disease.</li>
            <li> Please see the addendum at the bottom of this review.  If you are looking for minty-fresh or fizzy, this isn&#x27;t what you seek, but if you want to take a good shot at fixing your troubled gums yourself, this is worth it.  I had one area of my mouth where gum loss was apparent - the gum had receded upwards leaving an evident \\&quot;hole\\&quot; next to the top of the tooth where gum should be.  Trying different things, I&#x27;d coax it back down, but it would recede again.  The two teeth in the area were getting wiggly too.  Recently a swelling had appeared high over the tooth, initially not painful, but getting tender-er as it grew. I also developed something like a scab on the gum touching the tooth, perhaps gum disease, perhaps a small injury as the result of me doing too much brushing and disturbing the area further.   I had been trying different things as a fix (a spinning Oral-B plaque-remover, a Sonicare brush, swishing w/ hydrogen peroxide, applying Neosporin to the spot before bed, not recommended since it&#x27;s not for oral use but I was getting desperate).  Nothing worked long term.  I ordered this kit - containing gel cleaner, the mouthwash, trays, and floss.  THIS was what I needed- something that worked AND encouraged regular use.  Unlike my home-grown attempts, I used the kit with regularity and confidence.  I have used only the mouthwash and toothgel and floss, and have not yet used the trays.  (Not much floss was provided, so I have used regular floss too.)  Within a week and a half I could see a difference.  My gum is back in place (no hole) and the swelling above is going down.  The teeth in the vicinity are more firmly rooted.  My mouth stays clean-feeling long after brushing and swishing.  It&#x27;s not \\&quot;minty fresh\\&quot; but there&#x27;s an obvious lack of scuzz on the teeth for a long period of time, longer than with regular toothpaste and mouthwash, even after eating.  I swish with the mouthwash anytime I think of it. The toothgel also has done a fine job of getting off some old tartar on the back of my bottom front teeth (a problem spot for me since childhood) that nothing else would remove, even the high tech brushes.  Perhaps the combination of the brushes with this gel is a winner.  Like other users, during the transition, I developed a funky taste in my mouth that made even plain water taste icky, but that seems to have passed, lasting only maybe 4-5 days.  Some users want the minty taste we&#x27;ve been conditioned to think equals \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.  This gel and mouthwash are a little boring tasting.  But you know what?  Minty fresh gel or paste or mouthwash wasn&#x27;t fixing my gums like this stuff is.  I&#x27;m enough of a grown-up to pass by the pleasure of taste for something that actually works.  If you need the strong mint taste, then brush and gargle once a day with the old stuff and be happy, or chew some Xylitol mint gum, but make this your mainstay.  My routine now is to swish with hydrogen peroxide, brush with PerioTherapy gel, rinse with PerioTherapy mouthwash.  I do this three times daily and floss once or twice.  Six or eight minutes a day is not a lot of hassle for healthy teeth and gums.   Today I&#x27;m re-ordering the tooth gel and oral rinse and if there&#x27;s changes in the effectiveness in the future, I will gladly come back and edit this review, but for now I&#x27;m very satisfied.  If you have gum issues and want to try to fix them without chancing a dental visit that could lead to more than you are ready to do, by all means give the kit a fair trial.  Once you&#x27;ve done that and established that it works for you, you can re-order the components as needed to maintain the results.  [Ingredients:   Tooth gel: Sorbitol, hydrated silica, water, aloe vera, gel, glycerine (from vegetable sources), PeriO2 (stabilized Oxychlor compounds), tetrapotassium pyrophosphate, Xylitol, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, carageenan, sodium flouride, zince gluconate, CoQ10 (ubiquinone), essential oil of peppermint, natural flavor, sodium benzoate.

Instead of being chicken, I should have gone to a dentist and gotten a real diagnosis.  Self-treatment without professional diagnosis can be dangerous.  It turns out I have somewhat advanced gum disease.  The use of the product did not cause it, and may have slowed it, or maybe even covered it up for a while.  I had no clue what was wrong until a slightly wiggly tooth got more wiggly and made me get to a dentist, who has sent me on to a periodontist for a series of stuff that will include cleanings and extractions.  The puffy lump over the tooth was infection moving into the gum, and over time it has destroyed some bone so the tooth has nothing to cling to now. I was probably too far along for any product to save me.  I&#x27;ve learned that a lot of things can factor into gum disease, and poor oral hygiene is not always the cause.  I have darn near flawless teeth and brushed and flossed and gargled more than most people so it blew me away to get this.  My dentist has said of mouth care \\&quot;It will become your new religion\\&quot; and indeed it has because once you have gum disease it lurks and tries to come back.  I will be getting professional cleanings 3-4 times a year.  Every night in front of TV I am flossing, using tiny in-between brushes, rubber picks.  Every morning I get up and water pic.  I swish with Plax and brush after every meal or snack and usually water pic too.  I am consuming lots of Xylitol (gum and mints and in toothpaste) and using Biotene PBF formula.  The layman&#x27;s explanation is that Xylitol is a sugar the bacteria in your mouth will consume, but they can&#x27;t digest it so theoretically it starves them.  Biotene PBF and Plax both focus on getting ridof plaque or \\&quot;bio film\\&quot; and we are going to hear more about this in time to come.  Nutshell version is that there is a difference between free-floating bacteria and bacteria that has settled down in a single spot and become bio film or plaque.  Bio film happens in your mouth when the bacteria is setting up housekeeping on a solid surface, like a tooth.  Once that happens the bacteria gets sophisticated and begins to work together, and actually communicate, changing how it behaves and making it more destructive.  The scientists call it \\&quot;quorum sensing\\&quot; and it&#x27;s a little scary such small idiot creepies can do this anywhere, let alone in your mouth.  Oh- and you can give gum disease to your spouse, or get it from them too.  I have been on the other side of the fence where you say \\&quot;For Pete&#x27;s sake, how much time do you want to spend on this?\\&quot;  My answer is \\&quot;Whatever it takes so I get to keep my teeth.\\&quot;  So yes, I believe this is a good product, but be sure not to substitute it for getting real cleanings and getting the input of a professional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why others are having problems, but this product (since 2008) has always worked for me.  I used it when oral contraceptives started making me have gum problems such as swelling and bleeding.  I would rinse and brush using periotherapy, not so much a fan of the trays.  This was the 3rd or 4th product I tried and it was the only one that didn&#x27;t make the problem worse.  It has worked better than the name brand rinses, salty water, and peroxide.  Unlike other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t experience a particularly bad taste or a unusual change in the way other foods/beverages taste b/c I didn&#x27;t drink immediately afterwards (don&#x27;t all mouthwashes/toothpaste products make everything taste funny?). It also did not make my gums more tender.  I love this product and use it whenever I have an oral health problem and it always works wonders to get me back on track.  It must be that some people have some type of allergy or increased sensitivity to the product while others don&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m glad this worked for me without any issues. I&#x27;d say if you are looking for a decent product give it a try, but you may want to ease into it rather than dive in.  It was well worth the extra money for me.</li>
            <li> My gums bleed less (if at all) and my mouth feels fresher when I use this product. Its way better than most store bought brands, and it is now a staple product for me.</li>
            <li> The price at amazon is the same as most.  Products keeps my gum disease in check.  Definately notice when I skip using it for a few days.  About $150/yr for following label dosage.  I reccommend for those who have cronic gum issues.</li>
            <li> Being without dental insurance, I wasn&#x27;t able to make regular visits to the dentist. I purchased the Perio Therapy Kit when my gums started to bleed during brushing or flossing. The toothpaste/gel was very soothing to my irritated gums. I would smear a small amount of the gel on my gums before going to bed, and in the morning my gums felt great.  After using this product for a couple of weeks, I can see an improvement in the appearance and feel of my gums. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have deep pockets, significant bone loss, instanta calcium issues, and have never had simple cleanings. They have always been deep scaling, always in multipule visits and always painful. It&#x27;s not like I ignor my teeth, which are really great, but I have bad gum tissue and always have. Recently I had my annual examination, back in April, and of course, same old story, mostly pockets above six, and several 12&#x27;s. I started using this product, and not as per instructions and only the tooth paste. I changed dentist and this week I was re-examined. This dentist was provided a copy of my last chart and the results were incredible. When the dentist asked the hygenist how these results compared to the last chart.........she said there was a dramatic difference! The dentist wanted to know what I was doing different. I told him nothing other then using this tooth gel. I had most 4&#x27;s and 6&#x27;s and only 2 12&#x27;s and actually some zero&#x27;s. I serisouly can&#x27;t believe it, it has to be this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Use Dr. Katz&#x27;s PERIO-Therapy as instructed and you will begin seeing results in VERY short order. Bleeding gums disappear in 48 hours. Bad breath under control in the same amount of time. Gums a rosy pink inside of a week. It&#x27;s amazing and I am a fan for life! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, PERIO-Therapy.</li>
            <li> You can feel it working from the very first application.  After using the gum care system for a month or so, and the original TheraBreath tooth paste and mouth wash for a few months before that I had the best dental checkup ever.  My gums are growing back, no new caries and the cleaning/probing did not hurt.  I just do the basic routine before and after bed: brush floss brush rinse.</li>
            <li> I think for minor issues, this might be fine---although I would consult a professional. I have a few periodontic issues, and my dentist said that this was bad news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think anything that makes your tastebuds dull out or change is not a great thing for your gums well-being in general. After a root planning and scaling and a switch of toothbrushes, you will achieve better results than a $23.00 gum care kit. (I recently looked into highly acclaimed dental schools in my area where the root planning and scaling cost me a little over $100 dollars.)</li>
            <li> This is basically a hydrogen peroxide based toothpaste and mouthwash. You also get two rubber arch forms  and a little floss. You are supposed to put the toothpaste in the forms and hold them against your teeth, but I have not been doing that because the toothpaste is so expensive. I do not know if that would make a difference if I started to do so or not.&lt;br /&gt;The mouthwash has a strong hydrogen peroxide taste but it quickly goes away.&lt;br /&gt;I have a stubborn mouth infection that more than one dentist has chosen to ignore and not treat so I have been trying various home remedies. This is one of the few things that seem to be helping.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a drastic difference, but notice when I don&#x27;t use it. I feel better using this product.</li>
            <li> I started with Thera breath by doctor katz and switched to Perio theraphy when I found it in a local drugstore.  My gums were so bad, I didn&#x27;t want to go to the dentist.  The plaque build up was so bad, the hygienist was only able to clean one quadrant per visit. After using Perio therapy for one week I saw a significant improvement.  After two weeks, I was able to use my water pik and floss without any blood or discomfort.  The swelling and soreness is gone and I swear my gums are tightening up.  I am now ready to make that long overdue appointment with the dentist.  I&#x27;ve got my husband using it and it has significantly reduced his bad breadth.  It may be a little expensive, but I find I use a little less and regardless it has worked a miracle.</li>
            <li> This could be very dangerous product. I had only one tooth area had some problem so I bought this try to help for a &amp;#34;healthy gum&amp;#34;. Since it is for healthy gum I use it all over my lower gum area. About one week later my lower gum starting disappear very fast. I trusted it too much without taking any photo for before and after. Now my lower gum in a dangerous situation.</li>
            <li> I have been treated for light/medium periodontitis for about 2 years now.  I went to the dentist (whom I&#x27;m suspicious caused the periodontitis so they could get $$$ treating me), who had me coming back every 3 months.  I used the prescription mouthwash and did everything the dentist said to do. Although I was eventually able to stop the bleeding gums by hurculean effort, I could never get the pockets (which ranged from 1-2 mm in front to 4-5 mm in back, and one 6 in an abnormal tooth) to heal, no matter what I did.  I finally tired of the dentist and the prescriptions that are unnatural and inhibit the healing process.  So first I tried enzymes, which worked great, but didn&#x27;t seem to allow it to heal, or if so, veeeeerrrrrryyyyyy sllllloooooooooowly.  Also, you had to brush/floss/follow with enzyme rinse EVERY NIGHT before bed, no exceptions or the infection comes back.  Oh yes, and I am ocd about tooth hygiene--I floss every night, brush with a Sonicare, and rinse with something afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I went to try the TherBreath PerioTherapy system.  Before doing so, I read the reviews.  Like many noted, I did experience a change in my sense of taste.  It&#x27;s odd, the first day on it, I could not drink coffee or water, both tasted horrible, and I am a girl that loves her coffee in the morning.  It sucked!  But... I do have to say, IT WORKED.  Like, nearly instantly.  It killed the infection almost instantly, not after 3 weeks like the prescription mouthwash from the dentist.  A week later, most of my sensitivity went away for the most part.  I take that to mean my pockets are closing up.  I will update after my next dental appointment for details on the pocket readings.  At any rate, I still have a little sensitivity, mostly when I eat a candy bar and let it &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; on top of one my my molars so the juices soak into my teeth.  But I am super pleased at the results.  WAY BETTER than the dentist IMO.  I can go two days and still have a pretty clean mouth.  It works amazingly well.  Believe me, I have tried everything, and this by far is the most effective at both killing bacteria AND healing infection. Even though the taste sensation changed a bit, it is not permanent, nor is it bothersome enough to discontinue use.  While it does irritate me, I see it merely as a &amp;#34;side effect&amp;#34; seen in so many prescription meds.</li>
            <li> This is a great product...would order it again.</li>
            <li> Great product for the Gums!  Long lasting, and the oral rinse is a must.  Don&#x27;t forget to brush the gums and to floss</li>
            <li> Bought this item to help with my dental checkups. Frankly, I didn&#x27;t see the difference it advocated and neither did my dentist. I won&#x27;t buy it again...did not work for me. :(</li>
            <li> Great product ...used mouthwash for years ....highly recommend this product for gum problems.</li>
            <li> If you are on a budget maybe hydrogen peroxide would be a way to save some money but otherwise this stuff seems to work fairly well.  the first time  I gargled it my tonsils were sore for a day.  Now they are used to it, although I use it once a week at the most.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a week ago, and it does the job!!!... My gums feel better, no more bleeding and bad breath, I will recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love this product, I used it into the product ran out. It worked! my gums wasn&#x27;t bleeding and my teeth looked better, but a week after i started using normal toothpaste again it started to bleed again. So this works just fine just make sure to buy extra toothpaste</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 7 years and it really works. It is worth the money, trust me. I learned about it while shopping at cvs. They stopped stocking it so I decided to buy from amazon.com. I am happy to say that my gum is healed and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I am unsure what this product is meant to do, but I will say it didn&#x27;t really help me out at all. I bought it to get me through a painful spell until my dentist appointment. It&#x27;s overpriced, and I feel like it gives people false hope that it will cure gum issues. Listen, if you have issues with your gums, you need to seek out professional dental guidance. There is no miracle cure.</li>
            <li> seems like a good thing. Bought for the spouse but I tried the products myself.  Unfortunately I had some sort of allegic reaction to either the toothpaste or the floss.  If you have allergies, test it out first, dont go whole hog like I did and suffer the consequences.&lt;br /&gt;The spousal unit likes the product and thinks it is helping his gums stay healthier.</li>
            <li> I saw the great reviews of this product and wanted to give it a try, so I did.  Unfortunately, it irritated my mouth, particularly my tongue.  And I got canker sores on the tip of my tongue.  I followed the directions minus using the trays and having the gel sit in my mouth.  I just did the brushing, flossing, and mouthwash parts.  I waited a little bit til my canker sore got better after a few days and I tried with the process again.  Same thing though, my mouth felt funny all day and my tongue was irritated again.  Then I got another canker sore.  Before this, I can&#x27;t even remember the last time I got a canker sore.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so pricey I&#x27;d use it every day in my waterpic. The taste isn&#x27;t minty sickening, It gives a healthy mouth feeling.</li>
            <li> My local dentist had decided that I had gum disease issues so I was referred to a gum disease specialist who diagnosed my problem. The specialist wanted to cut and scrape all 4 quadrants, very expensive and painful. I have always brushed, flossed and taken good care of my teeth but for whatever reason I was having this problem. I found the Dr.Katz website, made a few calls to them,ordered the perio therapy rinse, toothpaste, and ordered the hydro floss (similar to water pick). Within a few months I went back to the specialist and he noted that my gums were much more firm and the teeth were much more secure in their sockets. The end of the story is that I never had to have the expensive and painful oral surgery that was recommended for me. Still use Dr. Katz products to this day with no regrets!</li>
            <li> The toothpaste and mouthwash in this kit tastes so awful that I literally threw up using it! Whether or not it works I will never know, because I cannot get beyond the awful taste. I would rather use other products that do the same thing, cost less, and are available locally for a lot LESS money.</li>
            <li> I have Periodontal Disease and after using this for a while, my dentist has commented on how clean my teeth and mouth are.  Must be doing something good.</li>
            <li> It is excellent. The color is white,so it doesn,t stain the teeth and taste is not bad. It targets purpose.</li>
            <li> great product, works fast, will be ordering again !</li>
            <li> this product taste really bad, feels bad, and doesn&#x27;t work. actually probably does more damage than good, as it&#x27;s not a toothpaste. and smell and taste like a wheel of a car, burned plastic.</li>
            <li> This is great. Can&#x27;t say my gums have been growing back yet but since using these products my gums have not bled once, where as they used to bleed quite a bit every single time I brushed before. It&#x27;s a little odd getting used to rinsing with the mouthwash and not water, but well worth it in the end. The taste is OK. The paste is just a little minty, the was not at all, it does taste a lot like stale chamomile tea. OK for me as I do actually drink that on occasion. I haven&#x27;t noticed these products changing my sense of taste. I never felt like eating or drinking for quite a while with any toothpaste I have used over the years, so that might have something to do with it. I will stick with this for a while. It is nice not to have that bloody taste in my mouth after brushing.</li>
            <li> Be careful when doing the mouth piece, when I took it out of the water, only in a few seconds and moved it as instructed with the correct water temperature, the mouth piece collapsed and I could not get it into my mouth around my teeth, afraid it would happen again, did not have the water hot enough for the second one so it did not shape properly.  They should give you 3 or four with the kit.</li>
            <li> BEST ON THE MARKET FOR ROAL CARE..,PERIOD!!!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product after reading the great reviews. However, by day four everything I ate tasted horrible!! It developed slowly. At first it just seemed as if I could not taste anything. Then it changed to everything having the same terrible taste; everything tasted the same. As I continued the therapy the taste would linger long after my meal. I contacted the company and they said that it happened sometimes and it would go away after a few days. It became intolerable.</li>
            <li> Wow! Dr. Katz&#x27; Perio Therapy is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! I was skeptical but willing to give it a shot. I was told by my dentist that I was at the beginning stages of periodontitis. My gums were bleeding when I flossed and when I brushed. After using this product, I have noticed a significant reduction in bleeding. I have also noticed my gums to fill in more and my teeth, overall, feel clean throughout the day! They have never felt this clean throughout my entire life!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also growing what I believe to be calcification on the outer part of my lower jaw and was told by my dentist it was just bone. After using this product, the lump that I believe to be calcification, has been reduced by at least 75%. I think I&#x27;m going to be a customer for life!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible. It smells like a public urinal. My gums weren&#x27;t in really bad shape before I tried this. They just bled a little when I brushed hard. Anyway, after using this stuff for 2 weeks there was no change EXCEPT it made me develop a tooth abscess. So thanks to this rip off of a product I&#x27;m sitting in a waiting room right now to have a root canal and spend around $2k. I wish I could sue these people.</li>
            <li> Using the trays provided is a sure cure for even advanced cases of gingivitis.&lt;br /&gt;Continued use helps to restore gums</li>
            <li> I did extensive research before I purchased the product.  I tried the Albrite product where I would get a free book and in just a needle into my gym with a homemade solution with hydrogen peroxide and table salt.  That solution was too messy and difficult.  I would not recommend the product.  I tried vitamin e, xylitol and an irrigator but it did not work.  The gums kept receding and I would panic every time I looked in the mirror.  I read reviews about this product ripping it saying that the Periotherapy solution destroys tastebuds and is not as presented.  I ordered the product anyway.  My advanced periodontitis issues of tooth pain, loose teeth and receding gums went away.  I was not able to sleep at night without putting clove oil onto my teeth and gums.  I was scared everyday that my teeth would fall out when I ate lunch.  My job gives no dental insurance and they wanted 380 dollars that I do not have just for xrays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product.  My gums stopped receding and turned to rosy pink within days and no more loose teeth or tooth pains bothered me.  The taste of the product is a minty taste.  It tastes very good to me.  Almost like chewing gum.  The gum trays and toothpaste, instructions and mouth wash came.  I am very pleased with the product.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> For years, I have had trouble with bleeding gums, and feared that I would end up at a periodontist with a serious problem. And to be honest, I am reluctant to go to the dentist out of fear that I will be reprimanded for not flossing.  Not that this is a good reason to avoid the dentist, and really I should be looking for a new dental practice, because  a dental hygentist torturing me with metal instruments and then lecturing me like a child is really abuse, not treatment.  (Full disclosure/soapbox:  I don&#x27;t have a good opinion of the dentistry practice as a whole.  It&#x27;s very barbaric, and unlike modern medicine, hasn&#x27;t advanced much in 2 thousand years. I mean, we can correct vision with painless laser beams, where is that kind of technology in dentisry!) As a last resort, I orded Dr. Katz Perio Therapy and have been using it a couple of weeks, and I have noticed a HUGE improvement.  I must admit I mainly use the oral rinse, because the toothpaste does leave a wierd metallic taste in my mouth.  And I am flossing more regularly. But so far, I have noticed that the swelling in my gums has gone down to almost zero.  Bleeding is all but gone as well, although the back of my mouth by the molars needs some work. Maybe that&#x27;s what the toothpaste and trays are for?  Overall, my gums feel a whole lot better. Someone might say that my improvement is from flossing, but I really think I have seen more improvement than I have seen before from flossing alone.  So now I am actually gaining more confidence with my mouth and plan to go to the dentist, (although I am switching practices.) If only a hygentist or dentist had recommended this product to me sooner.</li>
            <li> In brief: I was told I needed gum surgery to deal with tooth that was clearly separated from the others. About a month after using the Dr Katz product (brushing and rinsing, but not using the mouth trays), I could tell things were vastly improved when floss got caught between the problem tooth and its neighbors. That is, the tooth was longer separated.  A visit to the hygenist confirmed that my gums were in much better shape (as evidenced by  pocket depth measurements).  I was no long a candidate for gum surgery -- a candidacy I was delighted to give up! :-)  Since then, I went off the product for a couple of months and found that my gums were just not as healthy.  I went back on Dr Katz&#x27;s system. It saved me from one gum surgery for sure and will likely be saving me from others.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 6 years ago. I have real issues with my bone and gums. I actually started losing teeth! This product stopped all that! The dentist was so impressed and told me to never stop using it.</li>
            <li> Just bought this a few days ago and not to trash the product as it is not my thing, but buying any regular hydrogen peroxide product will achieve the very same results at 1/4 of the cost of what this dentist here is selling it for. Good luck with your money!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff works wonders for my gingivitis. My child even likes the stuff. Worth the money I think. Try it</li>
            <li> It just costs a lot of money and doesn&#x27;t do anything to promote healthy teeth, gums, mouth, and tongue. This guy is a scam artist.</li>
            <li> Somehow I had the idea that this product was more about gum health and less about bad breath, although that&#x27;s certainly a major problem for a lot of people and this product probably addresses that. And it certainly isn&#x27;t damaging my gums. I should have reviewed info more carefully  before I bought it.</li>
            <li> Received the product today..the measuring cup is broken, the tooth paste appears to be half empty (the seal did not appear to be removed), the first molding tray went to garbage...so not a good start. I will come back with more about the effect on my gums</li>
            <li> This works; healthier gums, stronger teeth. My dentist commented on how great my teeth &amp; gums were at 6 month checkup. More expensive &amp; more time-consuming than drugstore toothpaste, yes. Want to keep your own teeth as long as possible? Buy &amp; use this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but this is a situation where a product exceeded my expectations and I have before and after results from a dentist to verify it.  I hadn&#x27;t been to the dentist in a couple years and i made an appointment for about 5 weeks ago. I went and they did x rays and then measured my gums.  I had multiple measurements of 4mm and 11 measurements of 5 mm (granted that there are 3 measurements per tooth so i had several 5&#x27;s on a few back teeth).  She said she didn&#x27;t have time to clean them that day but that with that many fives I would need to come back for root scaling.  My hygiene up to this point had been slack. I never flossed and often ate late at night after brushing my teeth. After the appointment I got very serious about taking care of the issue before it progressed.  I did some research and ordered this product. I also bought a water pic and a sonic toothbrush from phillips. I began brushing every morning and night, flossing once a day, and using the provided toothpaste and mouthwash. I only used the trays once or twice. After a couple weeks it seemed as though my gums were healthier and the floss felt tighter in the back gums where the main problem was.  I called the dentist office and changed my appointment from a deep cleaning with root scaling to a standard cleaning bc i wanted to have my gums examined again before I had it done.  I told the hygienist that i felt like there was improvement and could she measure my gums to see where we stood. To here credit, she was very nice and not at all skeptical as a expected her to be as only a month had gone by since the last measurements were done.. She was shocked however after the measurements when she compared them to my chart from the previous time.  I had no 5mm measurements at all and only a few 4mm measurements.  She agreed that i definitely didn&#x27;t need root scaling at that point and to keep doing whatever I was doing. Some people have commented that the product is expensive and tastes poorly. I never really ate within a couple hours of using it but I never noticed a bad taste at all.  If you have ever used the white bottled crest mouthwash; it is much milder than that. As far as cost..that is relative, but $20 seems a deal to me. Especially when compared to dental procedures. The product lasted 5 weeks and I have just ordered more..

            <li> my periodontist says that I should keep doing whatever I&#x27;ve been doing and keep using whatever I&#x27;ve been using.  Please don&#x27;t tell him that I don&#x27;t always floss every day.</li>
            <li> I like the gentleness of the rinse and paste. I felt like it healed and cleaned. There is no minty taste or feeling which takes time to get used to, but your mouth is definitely clean!</li>
            <li> Best mouth care ever tried. Completely natural with no toxic garbage fillers. Highly effective oxygen cleaning and soothing aloe make my mouth feel super healthy. Cleans so well my hygienist was impressed. Even cleans your tongue. No alcohol or other irritants. Very happy to have found this product as it is not easy to find an effective natural mouthwash w/ no alcohol.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s me, but these products (toothpaste and rinse) are good adjunct products for helping keep your teeth and gums in their best condition but do not take the place of regular dental care-What toothpaste and/or rinse could actually cure gum disease??  If it were that easy the dentists would be out of business-this is a good product for preventative and therapeutic care but you still need to go to the dentist for a diagnosis and treatment-&lt;br /&gt;That being said I have used this product for years AND go to the dentist for regular visits-I have been very, very happy with the products and use them accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;After reading all the things that people to their teeth and gums, constantly brushing, flossing, rinsing, poking, it is wonder that they have any teeth at all!&lt;br /&gt;Too much brushing or brushing with the wrong type of brush, flossing incorrectly and using all different types of rinses and toothpastes can actually make gum disease worse-&lt;br /&gt;You need to treat your teeth an gums \\&quot;gently\\&quot; not constantly assault them with all sorts of agents---your dentist or hygienest should explain this to you during cleanings and visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL; I DO NOT WORK FOR THE COMPANY- I AM JUST A REGULAR PERSON WITH TOOTH AND GUM ISSUES WHO IS TRYING TO KEEP THEIR TEETH</li>
            <li> Reasonable price fast delivery</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was also anxious to try this. Mine arrived missing the measuring cup but was sealed. I followed the directions exactly and did not miss any treatments. Soaking in the trays burned the first time. I didn&#x27;t experience any particular bad taste or smell. Did not change taste buds either as other users reported. I used all of the product and it stopped the bleeding that sometimes occurred when flossing. It only comes with a few pieces of floss but I had similar to use when it was gone. I have one spot where the gum is a little high but it did not change it at all. I am now trying &#x27;Oregadent&#x27; by American Herb and Spice. It also has amazing reviews like this product. Unfortunately this one only helped one issue for me.</li>
            <li> Breath be so fresh, yo. Make the transaction.</li>
            <li> Great for swollen gums gingivitis</li>
            <li> I had some gum bleeding issues on my left molar so decided to give this a try.  Few days later, started experiencing some pain on my right side upper and lower molars out of the blue (never had issues with them before).  A week of using this stuff later, I am in constant throbbing pain, and need pain killers daily.  Thought it was a coincidence and that maybe I had a cracked tooth or something and needed a root canal, so I went to my dentist and he found nothing wrong.  Went to specialist, same thing.  Both said that something may have caused trauma that is causing inflammation, but they cannot identify with Xrays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what chemicals are in this therapy system, but buyers beware - especially those who have sensitive teeth to begin with.  Not sure what chemicals are in this (its not FDA approved) and maybe it helps some people, but looks like it can do major damage to the mouths of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: wish I read the bad reviews for this product.  There were reviews warning about how this product kills your teeth, requiring you a root canal.  After just a week of this product, two of my molar teeth (which never had issues before) developed tooth abcesses that now need a root canal.  If you have any gum issues or exposed roots or cracked tooth or cavities, do NOT use this product - it will kill your tooth in a matter of a week or two.</li>
            <li> This item does nothing to stop bleeding gums or even just to clean your teeth. The tooth paste says it has flouride but your teeth don&#x27;t feel clean after. It&#x27;s like rinsing with water!</li>
