            <li>Refills by the way are very easy.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT, have given many as gifts.</li>
            <li>So I decided to purchase this product because one of my perfumes top was removed and lost</li>
            <li>YES I can get perfume out of a bottle that the top was lost to</li>
            <li>Love love love it and so convenient.</li>
            <li>My sister is a perfume junky and although she has so many, we travel a lot</li>
            <li>I love mine.</li>
            <li>It never has leaked and now I can take my favorite purfume anywhere.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li>But for God&#x27;s sake, make sure you are not using Butane.</li>
            <li>Very easy to refill and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>It is easy to fill and has never leaked.</li>
            <li>These do not leak, are easy to load and do not require any addiitonal parts to load -</li>
            <li>The travelo worked great however 1 year later I can pump out from the perfume bottle</li>
            <li>, just don&#x27;t try to light your cigarette with it.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to pump any perfume into this atomizer.</li>
            <li>I thought it was unique, so I bought one.</li>
            <li>This product is seriously so useful and compact!</li>
            <li>Just a cute little thing to have if you love to always smell like your fav scents!</li>
            <li>this had great reviews; but my perfume was in this for maybe a few weeks and the perfume evaporated.</li>
            <li>handy and fits amazingly in my tiny clutch&#x27;s , doesn&#x27;t leak or anything and m</li>
            <li>just pump right onto your perfume bottle.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them, I have them in different colors and love them!</li>
            <li>Love the concept, but, several people tried and we could never load our perfume into the spray container as demonstrated</li>
            <li>And with perfume being so expensive, that is the best thing about this.</li>
            <li>I have 3 and bought several more as gifts for Christmas.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have something like this to put your favorite perfume in for a vacation instead of halling the entire bottle with, especially with all of the new TSA regulations.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and you don&#x27;t have to carry around a big bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really neat how you fill it up.</li>
            <li>This is supposedly the &amp;#34;beauty product of the year&amp;#34; and I love a good atomizer to keep in my bag, etc, however I&#x27;ve found that this is slowly leaking and not worth the price at all.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these a few months ago and love it so much I ordered one for a friend.  </li>
            <li>But for normal use, I can go a week between refills.</li>
            <li>I bought several more for Christmas gifts and a extra one for me to carry a couple of different perfumes with me.</li>
            <li>The Travalo is literally just a little pump... so simple and easy!</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m surprised there is not a warning against using Butane.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill and small for your purse.</li>
            <li>While I can still manage to fit it in a bigger purse, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to shove it in a little crossbody purse!</li>
            <li>Only to realize upon receiving it that it was hot pink.  </li>
            <li>Small enough to satisfy the TSA - Thousand Standing Around, and large enough to hold a few days worth of spray.</li>

            <li> I started searching for a black one since it was for a guy who wouldn&#x27;t want hot or baby pink or swirls.  </li>
            <li> Now I realize that hot pink is in the name of this product, but the black one is the picture.  </li>
            <li> i have 2 in my purse, they are small, and work very well, never had a leak, and you can&#x27;t smell whats in them until  </li>
            <li> Btw the actual bottle isn&#x27;t this dark ugly pink but a lighter pretty pink :-)</li>
            <li> I was showed one of these in a discount perfume store in the local outlet center.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a subjective statement, because if you spray constantly, like your trying to hide the fact you haven&#x27;t showered for a few days, this may not last for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would be able to use it often if perfume evaporates:(</li>

            <li> My perfume is bulky and heavy.</li>
            <li> Just take the atomizer off you perfume or cologne bottle, insert it into the bottom of this Travalo, and pump a few times to fill up.  </li>
            <li> I purchased an atomizer from the Sephora brand and I returned it the next day because the process of putting the perfume into the atomizer seemed way too messy and complicated than it should have been.</li>
            <li> I was very confused as I knew I ordered a black one and didn&#x27;t even have a drop down to select color when I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> I can see the late night ads now...</li>
            <li> so it was hard for her to chose just one scent!</li>
            <li> Please update this - bad advertising.</li>
            <li> but it does not spray :-(</li>

            <li> This product is awesome !!!!!!!! i have 2 in my purse, they are small, and work very well, never had a leak, and you can&#x27;t smell whats in them until  you spray it .... LOVE THIS PRODUCT, have given many as gifts.</li>
            <li> I saw these in a magazine this summer and bought one for myself and loved it, so I bought these for Christmas sussies for all of the girls in my family and they all loved them as well! Great invention to make any perfume into a travel size.  Very easy to use.</li>

It is nice to have something like this to put your favorite perfume in for a vacation instead of halling the entire bottle with, especially with all of the new TSA regulations. Great product!</li>
            <li> I receive a pink spray and i was buying a black one. Disapoint it.&lt;br /&gt;Disapoint it&lt;br /&gt;Disapoint it.&lt;br /&gt;Disapoint it</li>
            <li> I bought several of these to attach to birthday gifts.  The people I gave them to just loved them.  Easy to fill and small for your purse.</li>
            <li> I was showed one of these in a discount perfume store in the local outlet center. I thought it was unique, so I bought one. I wanted another one, so I looked on Amazon and found one. The price was cheaper even than the discount store. It&#x27;s really neat how you fill it up. It&#x27;s easy and you don&#x27;t have to carry around a big bottle of perfume. You can put it in your pocket and give yourself a little spritz whenever you want to.</li>
            <li> So I decided to purchase this product because one of my perfumes top was removed and lost and I could not spray it and I loved that perfume. The travelo worked great however 1 year later I can pump out from the perfume bottle but it does not spray :-( out from the travelo.  So I can no longer use it and it has perfume in it. Would I purchase again YES I can get perfume out of a bottle that the top was lost to and I can put in my purse. It really is a great product even if it gave out on me.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a few months ago and love it so much I ordered one for a friend.  I started searching for a black one since it was for a guy who wouldn&#x27;t want hot or baby pink or swirls.  Finally found this one and ordered it.  Only to realize upon receiving it that it was hot pink.  I was very confused as I knew I ordered a black one and didn&#x27;t even have a drop down to select color when I ordered it.  Now I realize that hot pink is in the name of this product, but the black one is the picture.  Please update this - bad advertising.</li>
            <li> Love love love it and so convenient.</li>
            <li> Love the concept, but, several people tried and we could never load our perfume into the spray container as demonstrated</li>
            <li> Excelente el articulo me llego en buen estado y funciona a la perfección!</li>
            <li> Love this item,easy to fill &amp; great size!!</li>
            <li> My sister is a perfume junky and although she has so many, we travel a lot so it was hard for her to chose just one scent! I bought a few of these for she &amp; I and she loves it! I carry one in my purse at all times. No spillage or anything like that. Just a cute little thing to have if you love to always smell like your fav scents!</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I bought several more for Christmas gifts and a extra one for me to carry a couple of different perfumes with me. It is easy to fill and has never leaked. And with perfume being so expensive, that is the best thing about this.</li>
            <li> I have 3 and bought several more as gifts for Christmas. Everyone loved it. I love mine. It never has leaked and now I can take my favorite purfume anywhere.</li>
            <li> this had great reviews; but my perfume was in this for maybe a few weeks and the perfume evaporated. I don&#x27;t think I would be able to use it often if perfume evaporates:(</li>
            <li> My perfume is bulky and heavy. While I can still manage to fit it in a bigger purse, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to shove it in a little crossbody purse! This product is seriously so useful and compact! It is super easy to pump any perfume into this atomizer. I had no problems with it leaking or spraying incorrectly. It is literally a miniature on-the-go perfume bottle! I absolutely love this thing. I purchased an atomizer from the Sephora brand and I returned it the next day because the process of putting the perfume into the atomizer seemed way too messy and complicated than it should have been. The Travalo is literally just a little pump... so simple and easy! Btw the actual bottle isn&#x27;t this dark ugly pink but a lighter pretty pink :-)</li>
            <li> Small enough to satisfy the TSA - Thousand Standing Around, and large enough to hold a few days worth of spray. That&#x27;s a subjective statement, because if you spray constantly, like your trying to hide the fact you haven&#x27;t showered for a few days, this may not last for you. But for normal use, I can go a week between refills. Refills by the way are very easy. Just take the atomizer off you perfume or cologne bottle, insert it into the bottom of this Travalo, and pump a few times to fill up.  Kind of like refilling a lighter with butane. But for God&#x27;s sake, make sure you are not using Butane. In fact, I&#x27;m surprised there is not a warning against using Butane. You know, there are lawyers out there just waiting to take on that case. I can see the late night ads now...&amp;#34;Have you been injured in a car wreck, slipped in a store aisle, pumped Butane in your Travalo?&amp;#34; Anyway, works good for cologne or perfume, just don&#x27;t try to light your cigarette with it.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised. Very easy to refill and easy to use. Saves money because I don&#x27;t have to buy travel perfume. Get a separate one for each perfume you want to travel with. I don&#x27;t know how you could possibly remove one scent to add another.</li>
            <li> handy and fits amazingly in my tiny clutch&#x27;s , doesn&#x27;t leak or anything and m so happy i got it</li>
            <li> These travel sprays are the very best. They are easy to use and convenient to have in the purse, and they are the perfect size for traveling on planes. Highly recommend them, I have them in different colors and love them!</li>
            <li> Especially as a great gift to give with perfume. My perfume didn&#x27;t come as a travel size so I had to get one for my purse/travel. These do not leak, are easy to load and do not require any addiitonal parts to load - just pump right onto your perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> This is supposedly the &amp;#34;beauty product of the year&amp;#34; and I love a good atomizer to keep in my bag, etc, however I&#x27;ve found that this is slowly leaking and not worth the price at all.</li>
