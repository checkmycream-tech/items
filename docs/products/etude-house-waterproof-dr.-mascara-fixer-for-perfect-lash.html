            <li>It&#x27;s amazing-</li>
            <li>This is quite good easy to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One problem is the whiteness (its like wax sort of) can be seen in bright light.</li>
            <li>Really in love with this mascara primer.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>Works ok.  </li>
            <li>I have had better</li>
            <li>Holy grail :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I have on top of it.</li>
            <li>You apply it on top of your mascara and it won&#x27;t come off until you make a concentrated effort to remove it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s easy</li>
            <li>OMG Hands down the BEST!!</li>
            <li>instead, it works better and it&#x27;s not like super glue</li>
            <li>I love this fixer, because my eyelashes just won&#x27;t hold curl on their own.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really light and creamy, but my mascara goes right over it</li>
            <li>Also works just to keep my lashes curled without mascara if Im going for a more natural look :)</li>
            <li>The product was clear which i liked.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>it makes lashes look full, curled and not clumped.  </li>
            <li>As an experiment, I didn&#x27;t use a makeup remover and my lashes still looked almost perfect the next day, although overnight some flaking did finally occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>stays on like super glue</li>
            <li>My eyes are deep set so that my lashes touch the top of my lids, plus my lid skin gets oily and my eyes tear easily.  </li>
            <li>I use a little to shape my eyebrows, and it works great.</li>
            <li>I use mine every day, work and fun.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are very straight</li>
            <li>Keeps my stick straight lashes curled, even with mascara on!</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I normally use Sheseido lash primer which leaves my lashes looking full.</li>
            <li>First off, there were no directions (do I apply before or after my mascara application?).</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>You apply it first then your mascara to make them look longer and stay that way all day.</li>
            <li>This is the best and cheapest mascara primer I have ever used, it holds your curl, gives you more volume, and adds length, everything I look for in a base.  </li>
            <li>so they tend to fall straight after curling, unless I use waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are very curly and the product made my eyelashes clumpy with a thinned fanned look with length but no volume.</li>
            <li>but, I haven&#x27;t noticed any visible or real difference in how my mascara holds.  </li>
            <li>Really is waterproof and sweatproof</li>
            <li>The seller Emunah gave me translation with the intructions of the product, because i dont know the language, and it was shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I have to use waterproof mascara and a very &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect this to work</li>
            <li>It was better than what I expected.</li>
            <li>meh, it didnt do much besides separating the lashes</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see a difference when I used this</li>
            <li>as a primer for lashes I am ok with it as I like it better than white primer which is hard to cover with mascara</li>
            <li>I would love to know I&#x27;m not wasting money on a tube of this that will only last about a week or 2.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but honestly this does the job just its hard to wash off</li>
            <li>so I have a full supply and not run out because of how long it takes coming from Korea.  </li>
            <li>I curl my lashes normally, then apply this product, then my mascara.  </li>
            <li>I used everyday ,love it ,I will use it forever now</li>
            <li>I curl my lashes, put on a thin coat of Dr mascara fixer, &amp; one coat of mascara, &amp; I&#x27;m good to go from morning until bedtime.</li>
            <li>The first time, I stumbled upon it while browsing for other Etude House products and the positive reviews convinced me in giving it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this is a clear primer.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really didn&#x27;t like was it took over 3 weeks to get it as it came from South Korea but would still recommend it</li>
            <li>But if you have sensitive eyes then I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or it will leave some white clumps</li>
            <li>a 17 year old girl</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid climate &amp; my eyelashes never made it through a day without falling straight down until I used this product.</li>
            <li>I have straight Asian lashes and this is the only product that holds my curl when I apply this as a primer before mascara!</li>
            <li>There was barely any product on the mascara brush.</li>
            <li>I really like this in general, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really waterproof.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference other than it makes my mascara last longer</li>
            <li>The product I received was in a white tube (not pink) and almost nothing in it.  </li>
            <li>I have stick straight eyelashes and whenever I apply mascara it always droops down even after I curl it.</li>
            <li>If you have typical Asian lashes that are short straight &amp; sparse you need this in your life!</li>
            <li>The very first tube I bought, was pink and full (and unfortunately, destroyed by my dog).  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After letting all the air out of the the very plump tube, upon arrival - found that the tube, and it&#x27;s contents to be LESS THAN the width of the mascara</li>

            <li> L&#x27;oreal Telescopic carbon black, the new Urban Decay perversion works for me.</li>
            <li> other than that i like it so far.</li>
            <li> overall it was a good base for your actually mascara</li>
            <li> It took a couple of tries to learn just how much to apply as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different mascaras and primers and snake oils to keep my mascara from flaking or creating dark stains under my eyes by the end of my eight hour work shift and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> The bulk of 6 are white and are practically empty.  </li>
            <li> it curls and keeps lashes curled all day long.  </li>
            <li> My lashes stay curled all day long.  </li>
            <li> It could keeps my eyelashes curly and long all day.</li>
            <li> I was concerned this may happen since other reviewers has commented on the same issue, but I wanted 2 day shipping</li>
            <li> Most of the curl will remain after applying, even with the slow and methodical application method of slowly moving the comb down the lashes from underneath, but the ends of the lashes end up straighter than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this product because of the clumps, a new bottle more than half empty and the directions are written in a different language (Korean) I think.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump up your regular mascara or mess it up.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in the mascara tube almost empty.</li>
            <li> Item I received did not match the picture, and the tube I received was mostly empty.</li>
            <li> The tube seemed empty.</li>
            <li> and I use it every single day ,thank you!!</li>
            <li> to keep in the cosmetic bag or other bag.</li>
            <li> I buy tons of products on amazon and this was the first time it&#x27;s failed me.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s extremely hard to take off, not very friendly for daily</li>
            <li> but I think the company Etude House has changed the way they produce this because the last 2 times I ordered a bulk of 6, both times, all 6 came with hardly any product in it.  </li>
            <li> I had some migration down the outer corner of my eyes.</li>
            <li> lot of air and extremely little</li>
            <li> Helps decclump and length a little.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a clear mascara, but i was wrong.</li>
            <li> This stuff left my lashes looking thin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used a few mascara that is not waterproof with this product and it waterproofed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually, I can get mascara to come off of my eyelashes by just washing my face.  </li>
            <li> I am honestly not sure what this product does.  </li>
            <li> We usually use waterproof mascara to hold a curl.</li>
            <li> I usually wash it off at the end of the day and it holds the curl and everything.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that has a hard time with their lashes holding a curl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to get off though.</li>
            <li> I have hard to curl lashes</li>
            <li> To all the girls out there who have sparse eyelashes or hard to curl lashes.</li>

            <li> This is quite good easy to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is good carry or hold everywhere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s easy to keep in the cosmetic bag or other bag.</li>
            <li> as a primer for lashes I am ok with it as I like it better than white primer which is hard to cover with mascara and this is a clear primer.The only thing I really didn&#x27;t like was it took over 3 weeks to get it as it came from South Korea but would still recommend it</li>
            <li> OMG Hands down the BEST!! Mascara primer I have ever used. Lasts all day and is very effective. A definite repurchase!</li>
            <li> This does what it promises and now I have no mascara leaking</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this primer!  I have stick straight lashes and this base holds my curl through rain, sweat, humidity, and tears.  Curl does NOT budge or fall.  Paired with Covergirl Lashblast 24 Hour, my lashes are set for the day and nothing comes off or smudges until I remove it in the evening for bedtime.  I wish a company in the US would find this and sell it so I could get it faster.  I order in quantities so I have a full supply and not run out because of how long it takes coming from Korea.  I would recommend this product to anyone that has a hard time with their lashes holding a curl.&lt;br /&gt;**EDIT**&lt;br /&gt;I still give this product a 5 star rating because it does what it says it will but I think the company Etude House has changed the way they produce this because the last 2 times I ordered a bulk of 6, both times, all 6 came with hardly any product in it.  The very first tube I bought, was pink and full (and unfortunately, destroyed by my dog).  The bulk of 6 are white and are practically empty.  What gives?!  I would love to know I&#x27;m not wasting money on a tube of this that will only last about a week or 2.  I use mine every day, work and fun.</li>
            <li> The product did everything it was supposed to do and on anyone else it probably would have been perfect. But if you have sensitive eyes then I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Really in love with this mascara primer. I have Asian lashes so they tend to fall straight after curling, unless I use waterproof mascara. This totally saves my curl and now it doesn&#x27;t matter if my mascara is waterproof or not. Also, it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes clumpy! :) Will definitely buy again once I run out!</li>
            <li> i like it but i doesn&#x27;t look same as picture so i gave 4 stars. other than that i like it so far.</li>
            <li> I buy tons of products on amazon and this was the first time it&#x27;s failed me.  The product I received was in a white tube (not pink) and almost nothing in it.  I was concerned this may happen since other reviewers has commented on the same issue, but I wanted 2 day shipping so I ignored and ordered this here anyway.  I am very disappointed and will buy elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I love this fixer, because my eyelashes just won&#x27;t hold curl on their own.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really light and creamy, but my mascara goes right over it and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this product.. It helps keep my lashes curl last longer and make my lashes longer. I would buy another one and recommend to others..</li>
            <li> The product arrived in the mascara tube almost empty. The product was clear which i liked. My eyelashes are very curly and the product made my eyelashes clumpy with a thinned fanned look with length but no volume. Very unhappy with this product because of the clumps, a new bottle more than half empty and the directions are written in a different language (Korean) I think. No English anywhere on this tubing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is... very weirdly oily? It does increase the volume in my lashes but I didn&#x27;t expect such an oily formula; I don&#x27;t reach for it as often anymore.</li>
            <li> This product does just what it says..it curls and keeps lashes curled all day long.  I love this product!!!  I curl my lashes normally, then apply this product, then my mascara.  My lashes stay curled all day long.  If you are spectacle like I am, this is the review for you!!!  Try it.  You will love it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my stick straight lashes curled, even with mascara on! Also works just to keep my lashes curled without mascara if Im going for a more natural look :)</li>
            <li> Works great. Hard to get off though.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to work as well as it did.  Usually, I can get mascara to come off of my eyelashes by just washing my face.  For this, I have to use the eye makeup remover, and even then, it&#x27;s difficult.  It&#x27;s great if, like me, your mascara always seems to be smudgy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I had hoped this would give me the volume needed prior to applying mascara; it did not! It went on very thick and almost impossible to take off. I don&#x27;t like anything that needs to come off the eye area with tugging and pulling; I finally let it wear off; not the healthiest option. Would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have a horrible time finding mascara that does everything i need it to. My eyes are deep set so that my lashes touch the top of my lids, plus my lid skin gets oily and my eyes tear easily.  My lashes are also lighter than my hair, so if I forgo mascara, I look a bit strange.&lt;br /&gt;This product helps me solve my mascara woes. I just use a good smudge-proof mascara and apply the fixer and I don&#x27;t have to worry about looking like a raccoon or an Alice Cooper wannabe.</li>
            <li> Did not like. Lashes stuck together like glue. Weird consistency.</li>
            <li> Item I received did not match the picture, and the tube I received was mostly empty. Will be getting a refund.</li>
            <li> I used everyday ,love it ,I will use it forever now and I use it every single day ,thank you!!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this product. It really works! My eyelashes are very straight &amp; I&#x27;ve always used an eyelash curler. I live in a very humid climate &amp; my eyelashes never made it through a day without falling straight down until I used this product. It took a couple of tries to learn just how much to apply as a little goes a long way. I curl my lashes, put on a thin coat of Dr mascara fixer, &amp; one coat of mascara, &amp; I&#x27;m good to go from morning until bedtime.</li>
            <li> seriously is crazy tough. Stays on all day, and for the price, it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m insanely impressed with it. Wonderful product! ^-^</li>
            <li> This stuff left my lashes looking thin. I normally use Sheseido lash primer which leaves my lashes looking full. This just didnt cut the mustard.</li>
            <li> Really great! curls like crazy.  One problem is the whiteness (its like wax sort of) can be seen in bright light. But otherwise, its amazing</li>
            <li> First off, there were no directions (do I apply before or after my mascara application?). All in Japanese. Based on the reviews, I applied after. There was barely any product on the mascara brush. The tube seemed empty. Either that or the item is over-packaged.</li>
            <li> I am honestly not sure what this product does.  I use it under my mascara but, I haven&#x27;t noticed any visible or real difference in how my mascara holds.  I also do not see any difference in terms of length of thickness after putting this on under my mascara.  I hope it&#x27;s conditioning my lashes but, I have no idea.  Since it doesn&#x27;t appear to be doing any damage, I&#x27;ll keep using it until I&#x27;m done with the container but, I would not recommend, nor would I purchase again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of air and extremely little product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After letting all the air out of the the very plump tube, upon arrival - found that the tube, and it&#x27;s contents to be LESS THAN the width of the mascara brush!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned.</li>
            <li> Amazing honestly. Doesn&#x27;t clump up your regular mascara or mess it up. Helps decclump and length a little. Really is waterproof and sweatproof</li>
            <li> Lasts all day and prevents mascara from smudging.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference other than it makes my mascara last longer but it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl</li>
            <li> Works ok.  I have had better and I have had worse.  Don&#x27;t think I will purchase this brand again.  The end.</li>
            <li> I always use it, it works. i will repurchase again. i Recommend it. The seller Emunah gave me translation with the intructions of the product, because i dont know the language, and it was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a clear mascara, but i was wrong. overall it was a good base for your actually mascara</li>
            <li> Awesome. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like this in general, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really waterproof. I had some migration down the outer corner of my eyes. It&#x27;s possible I didn&#x27;t fully coat my lashes with this after fully coating them with my mascara. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to let me keep all my eyelash curl. Most of the curl will remain after applying, even with the slow and methodical application method of slowly moving the comb down the lashes from underneath, but the ends of the lashes end up straighter than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use it when I&#x27;m not wearing falsies in humid climates, since it does help a lot in those instances, even if not perfect. Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Great product! Holy grail :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have stick straight eyelashes and whenever I apply mascara it always droops down even after I curl it. but honestly this does the job just its hard to wash off</li>
            <li> If you have typical Asian lashes that are short straight &amp; sparse you need this in your life! Recommended by Korean friends who reside in Korea. Works great @ holding a curl &amp; adding definition. Works with non-waterproof mascara. You will have to experiment with different brands. L&#x27;oreal Telescopic carbon black, the new Urban Decay perversion works for me. We usually use waterproof mascara to hold a curl. This provides an alternative to waterproof. Btw, it works with waterproof as well!</li>
            <li> It is seriously waterproof. I put it over my regular mascara and it seriously stays on until you wash it off. I usually wash it off at the end of the day and it holds the curl and everything. Etude House, you&#x27;ve done well. ^_^</li>
            <li> It works well for keeping lashes waterproof. I have hard to curl lashes and I thought it would help keep lashes curled.That&#x27;s the only thing I wasn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;impressed with. Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing! best lash primer ever and I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> I love it! keeps lashes curled!</li>
            <li> I love this! can&#x27;t go a day without it. I wear it under mascara and it keeps my lashes curled.</li>
            <li> It could keeps my eyelashes curly and long all day. I have tried to wear this overnight, and my eyelashes still have perfect curve till I remove it. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have straight Asian lashes and this is the only product that holds my curl when I apply this as a primer before mascara!</li>
            <li> Love it on my lashes! It holds curl and turns any mascara into waterproof. It&#x27;s a must have item for me.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this mascara fixer. The first time, I stumbled upon it while browsing for other Etude House products and the positive reviews convinced me in giving it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This truly lengthens your lashes, keeps the curl but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s volumizing. I&#x27;m not exactly sure how you apply this, but I put this on first and then apply any mascara (even crappy ones that smudges) I have on top of it. You cannot use this alone because it leaves a white film on your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what mascara you use on top of it, it will not smudge or budge! I used a few mascara that is not waterproof with this product and it waterproofed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached a before and after photo of my nonexistent lashes to noticeable ones.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do. You apply it on top of your mascara and it won&#x27;t come off until you make a concentrated effort to remove it. I&#x27;ve tried several different mascaras and primers and snake oils to keep my mascara from flaking or creating dark stains under my eyes by the end of my eight hour work shift and nothing worked. As an experiment, I didn&#x27;t use a makeup remover and my lashes still looked almost perfect the next day, although overnight some flaking did finally occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have an oil based makeup remover in your kit, you will need one to get this stuff off. I use an oil cleanser.</li>
            <li> Nothing else has come close to keeping my eyelashes curled, &amp; even this product doesn&#x27;t succeed all day, but I do use it, I just wish it were easier to remove.</li>
            <li> This is not a mascara, don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re getting. This is to help your eyelashes  look longer. You apply it first then your mascara to make them look longer and stay that way all day. If you put on only the eyelash fixer it&#x27;ll look white and make it look like you have something stuck in your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! To all the girls out there who have sparse eyelashes or hard to curl lashes. Must have!! Recommended by saaammage from youtube &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> PROs:&lt;br /&gt;It does the job of keeping your lashes curled and in place and waterproof, like She Laq makeup sealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;It stays on like super glue and it&#x27;s extremely hard to take off, not very friendly for daily usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try FAIRYDROPS Scandal Queen Mascara instead, it works better and it&#x27;s not like super glue</li>
            <li> I have very difficult eyelashes.  I have to use waterproof mascara and a very &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; formula since I always use a lash curler.  I really didn&#x27;t expect this to work but it does.  It&#x27;s amazing- no smudging and will still hold the curl.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great- it makes lashes look full, curled and not clumped.  It was better than what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is the best and cheapest mascara primer I have ever used, it holds your curl, gives you more volume, and adds length, everything I look for in a base.  Good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Good product. It does the job and stops the mascara from running but it feels sticky. I use a little to shape my eyebrows, and it works great. Don&#x27;t use too much or it will leave some white clumps</li>
            <li> meh, it didnt do much besides separating the lashes</li>
            <li> Eh.  I didn&#x27;t really see a difference when I used this and when I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> REAAAALLLY GOOD !! im a 17 year old girl and I was doubting this product but I put it on and went in my pool went swimming for a while and It was still perrrfect! GO KOREA !</li>
