            <li>I love this body butter</li>
            <li>After waiting about 30 minutes to see if it got better, I jumped in the shower again towash it off.  </li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, too!</li>
            <li>I love this body cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent is sutle not too overbearing absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>yet it makes your skin feel so soft &amp; smells good for hours!  </li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and delivered on time.</li>
            <li>This &#x27;Almond Butter Body&#x27; is so light</li>
            <li>This lotion is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, absorbs well and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I use it on my son and he still smells Almond fresh in the evening!</li>
            <li>There are many fragrances there but who wants to walk around smelling &#x27;fruity&#x27; all day?!</li>
            <li>i am a hand lotion addict (since i usually have alligator skin) - this is the best stuff i have ever used.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Its smells great and its long lasting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one has a nice gentle smell that does not linger after absorbed.</li>
            <li>It has the texture of margarine, but \\&quot;Body Margarine\\&quot; does not have quite the same pleasant ring as \\&quot;Body Butter.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>It feels light in the skin and certainly makes it feel much more smooth, soft and lovely to feel.  </li>
            <li>I received this as a gift initially and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind it, but people who don&#x27;t like overly sweet lotions should try another scent.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly without any hint of greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i shall be buying many more and stashing them in strategic places around my daily life:</li>
            <li>Normally she didn&#x27;t want anyone touching her feet.</li>
            <li>My favorite so far is the Brazil Nut Body butter!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all I can think of but need three more words to complete review.</li>
            <li>The body butter just melts into skin making it soft and smooth from the first use!</li>
            <li>Excelent came super fast just what i wanted</li>
            <li>They can be found in many different fragrances.</li>
            <li>exactly as described, thanks</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>It made me feel very greasy.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly and I&#x27;m left feeling moisturized, not greasy.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Rubs in completely.</li>
            <li>word of note regarding the almond scent: it is VERY sweet-smelling, well beyond what I would have expected an almond scent to smell like.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and moisturized even after my next shower.  </li>

            <li> Body Shop Body Butter is a very thick, rich moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It seems like a relatively small container, but it is so rich I only need a little</li>
            <li> The only thing that I use to heal my dry skin.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I prefer the ones that are for extemely dry skin.</li>
            <li> She left behind drifts of dry skin that felt like sand.</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderfully subtle, but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> bad thing is that its seasonal so not always readily avaialable  </li>
            <li> I have used the coconut body butter in the past, I just wish the almond body butter had a stronger almond scent.</li>
            <li> It actually smelled ver weird.</li>
            <li> It was so thick and greasy, I returned it.</li>
            <li> I had terrible dry skin from daily swimming all summer and none of the supermarket lotions I tried did a thing to help it.  </li>
            <li> So sad when I heard this flavor was discontinued.</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing. Typically I&#x27;m not a big fan of lotions and such. I received this as a gift initially and absolutely loved it. It absorbs into the skin quickly and I&#x27;m left feeling moisturized, not greasy. The scent is wonderfully subtle, but lasts a long time. It seems like a relatively small container, but it is so rich I only need a little so it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom&#x27;s feet were extremely dry, calloused, and sore. She left behind drifts of dry skin that felt like sand. This stuff was like magic. Normally she didn&#x27;t want anyone touching her feet. She loved having this rubbed into them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a number of friends drawn in by the smell of this almond butter and wanted to buy as soon as they tried it.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely.  The texture is nice and creamy but not greasy.  It feels light in the skin and certainly makes it feel much more smooth, soft and lovely to feel.  I don&#x27;t think I will get out the house without using this body cream or the other creams I recently bought.</li>
            <li> Excellent item.  Smells fantastic and delivered on time.</li>

            <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>

            <li> Love this body butter. The smell is awesome and love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling product.  I use it on my son and he still smells Almond fresh in the evening!</li>
            <li> I order this product because I had been purchasing it from the Body Shop and they stop carrying it. I love this body butter it smells so good and is very good for my skin. It keeps my skin soft and moisturized. Will continue to buy it as long amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> Great smell. Rubs in completely. Would order again.</li>
            <li> It was so thick and greasy, I returned it. I also couldn&#x27;t get with the smell either.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews.  And I hated it.  It made me feel very greasy.  My t shirt was clinging to me.  After waiting about 30 minutes to see if it got better, I jumped in the shower again towash it off.  I do not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Works just like I have heard.</li>
            <li> I love the Body Shop&#x27;s body butters! They can be found in many different fragrances. The body butter just melts into skin making it soft and smooth from the first use! Some of them are made for normal-dry skin (as this one is.) I prefer the ones that are for extemely dry skin. This one has a nice gentle smell that does not linger after absorbed. My favorite so far is the Brazil Nut Body butter! Try these--great gifts!</li>
            <li> So sad when I heard this flavor was discontinued. I bought 4 tubs of it while I could. Maybe one day they will bring it back.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;Almond Butter Body&#x27; is so light yet it makes your skin feel so soft &amp; smells good for hours!  Don&#x27;t know why it was discontinued in The Body Shop, but surely it had to be a &#x27;Best Seller&#x27;.  There are many fragrances there but who wants to walk around smelling &#x27;fruity&#x27; all day?! LOVING IT!!!</li>
            <li> i am a hand lotion addict (since i usually have alligator skin) - this is the best stuff i have ever used. ever.  ever.  i shall be buying many more and stashing them in strategic places around my daily life: car/bedside/living room/office</li>
            <li> This lotion is fantastic.  I had terrible dry skin from daily swimming all summer and none of the supermarket lotions I tried did a thing to help it.  This body butter cured me up after literally one use.  I&#x27;ve been slathering it on daily and it&#x27;s now an essential item.  Smells fantastic, too!</li>
            <li> Was very nice and has a pleasant fragrance. I have used the coconut body butter in the past, I just wish the almond body butter had a stronger almond scent.</li>
            <li> Excelent came super fast just what i wanted</li>
            <li> Did not smell like the one I purchase at store at all.  It actually smelled ver weird.</li>
            <li> Love this product and happy to see it cheaper on Amazon than at The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> I love this body cream.  It leaves my skin soft and moisturized even after my next shower.  And of course, the fragrance is addicting.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Its smells great and its long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is sutle not too overbearing absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing is that its seasonal so not always readily avaialable  :(&lt;br /&gt;Thank God i was able to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Men -- a long back-scratch followed by a firm massage and this almond butter is exactly the attention she craves.  Massage and butter her feet too.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I use to heal my dry skin.</li>
