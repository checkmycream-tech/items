            <li>Loved by many.</li>
            <li>So it was a nice surprise.</li>

            <li>The ladies love it, and isn&#x27;t that what wearing a cologne is all about?</li>

            <li>Who could ask for more.      </li>
            <li>Women LOVE it.</li>

            <li>Love how this smells.</li>
            <li>but then the spice mostly goes away</li>
            <li>Retail stores don&#x27;t carry it any more and the ones that do</li>

            <li>I love the scent and women</li>
            <li>Good classic stuff!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong like so many of the mens colognes on the market</li>
            <li>Simply put: \\&quot;it is a very good scent to be around, and to wear\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Of course, I enjoy when he wears it too. :-)</li>
            <li>This is a good scent and it hold the whole day.</li>
            <li>It has a very light clean smell almost like getting out of the shower smell.</li>
            <li>Using our Amazon Prime account makes it so easy to order and receive packages without problems.</li>
            <li>it smelled like rubbing alcohol and was extremely strong</li>
            <li>I know a lot of men like that STRONG skunk smell that you can&#x27;t even wash off in the bathtub.  </li>
            <li>My father passed this kind of cologne on to me when I went on my first dance.</li>
            <li>It has an overpowering strong cheap perfumey smell.</li>
            <li>It came in nicely packed and smelled so good and lasted a  long time on my bf clothes.</li>
            <li>Great Cologne, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Relatively cheap.</li>
            <li>This scent is so yummy, complimentary and enjoyable.</li>
            <li>Its a fantastic product</li>
            <li>Civilized yet manly scent but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>We all enjoy the scent and it came in with time to spare for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Old school, winter wear, good silage and projection.</li>
            <li>Not the absolute best scent ever, but it is definitely something that they would recommend.</li>
            <li>This cologne is my husband&#x27;s favorite and the purchasing experience was very positive and there were no issues that we encountered.</li>
            <li>For this one which is Men Passion cologne is strong, great smell &amp; stays for long time</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>If you like your man smelling sexy or if your a man who would like to smell sexy for that special someone, I really recommend using Passion.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this many years ago after buying Passion for Women for My 1st Wife.</li>
            <li>It does smell great, but to me the quality is how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>Amazon had it and as usual the best deal going.</li>
            <li>I liked this cologne well, and it last an ok amount of time.</li>
            <li>It is a clean, spicy, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Most people love the way i smell especially women.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>and this is one of his favorite classic scents.</li>
            <li>It smells good and lasts as long as any</li>
            <li>This is my dads favorite scent so for Christmas this was a natural gift choice!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good those have to get use to it if u never had it be for or if your just starting to really wear cologne like me</li>
            <li>This cologne was the balm meaning it was everything that I was anticipating, it had a soft scent that were not over bearing to the nose and received many compliments.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years, and will probably never switch to a different kind of cologne.</li>
            <li>A lot of my female friends say it&#x27;s a nice smell.</li>
            <li>good for dating and other night out&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This is what I imagine John Kennedy smelled like when he was driving around Martha&#x27;s vineyard with nothing much to do besides being rich.</li>
            <li>The bottle they shipped isn&#x27;t even the right design.  </li>
            <li>It still smells great, a distinguished gentlemanly smell, a small of success.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong so be light, only one or two sprays.</li>
            <li>this is too strong and spicy&amp;#34;, something like an old mans aftershave.</li>
            <li>Its also a very musky and formal wear, not something a young kid should wear on his first date but at a formal dinner party this would quite appropriate.</li>
            <li>I have Michael Jordon cologne for business meetings/day time which I like very much</li>
            <li>It is so very much like the woman&#x27;s version of Passion.  </li>
            <li>A like very much.</li>
            <li>I know seem to enjoy it more than other colognes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my step father who loved it , but it was a little pricey.</li>
            <li>Thanks AMAZON!</li>
            <li>I believe most men will appreciate the cologne, especially on dates.</li>
            <li>Way too sweet and much too much perfume like for my taste.  </li>
            <li>No, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been working at the office all day and, while I remain GQ, I also smell like I need to go back to work for a few more hours and smell good there</li>
            <li>so I just put it back in the box and took it to the salvation army, I am sure someone will like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gettin hot in here so take off all your.......</li>
            <li>So when first spraying on i think &amp;#34;wow</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is my first bottle of this cologne</li>
            <li>Thanks a million!</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase on line.</li>
            <li>With hints of vanilla and cedar, this a classic sent and one that is worth a try.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m left with a pretty strong vanilla smell.</li>
            <li>Pleasant aroma, but does not last long.</li>
            <li>We saw positive reviews</li>
            <li>I have used Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s \\&quot;Passion\\&quot; for a long time &amp; love it as have all of my dates &amp; women I&#x27;ve been around.</li>
            <li>Also just because i say it&#x27;s only APPROPRIATE on a late night doesn&#x27;t make it good to wear on any date.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to all Men, because it smells like Liz Taylor was just at your house and sprayed just the right amount on you.</li>
            <li>BUT IAM SURE AS NORMAL IT WILL SMELL DIFFERENT ON EVERYONE</li>
            <li>I would certainly give this a try, and I can still smell it on my clothes when I take them off at night.</li>
            <li>(My wife doesn&#x27;t care that much for it when I first put it on, but a little while later she says it smells great).</li>
            <li>It was a great price and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li>Every woman that I&#x27;ve dated has commented on how much they like it.  </li>
            <li>Theyve probably never heard of it, and its reasonably price at $20 for a 4oz bottle.  </li>
            <li>This was just what I needed at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this cologne, and my woman likes it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Husband loves this scent and it isn&#x27;t always readily found,so</li>
            <li>Best cologne ever, women go crazy</li>
            <li>Do not spray too much else</li>
            <li>It was a real turn off</li>
            <li>I dont mind the Cologne that much</li>
            <li>This fragance is durable and intense....</li>
            <li>And he was very suprise to get this gift.</li>
            <li>Sometimes  you wonder if iy&#x27;s the real deal....</li>
            <li>I like the fragrance, it lasts all day, and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>but it seem light enough for day wear as well.</li>
            <li>I had used Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s Passion  for men  since the late nineties, and i loved it .When</li>
            <li>Four ounces doesn&#x27;t sound like much, but this bottle goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>However, the scent didn&#x27;t seem like it could last a full day.</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t really like the new smell.but</li>
            <li>I would say half hour the most is the duration.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not ridiculously priced.  </li>
            <li>This particular cologne is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>It is a little strong at first but settles in after 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Very masculine!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have literally sprayed it one time and I highly doubt I will ever use it again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend having Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>Sometimes there is actually a true meaning behind the name of a Product :)</li>
            <li>All in all i would go for something else that has a more citrus smell or something not so heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Fine with the purchases made with this the other cologne I brought.</li>
            <li>Cologne was new in wrapped box.</li>
            <li>This is an older cologne and my 91 year old father-in-law loves it.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I love this fragrance and the price was a whole lot less than the local stores.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I buy this one personally.</li>
            <li>I used to wear this back when it first came out</li>
            <li>My husbands favorite cologne - it is hard to find in retail in my area.</li>
            <li>You know how some men&#x27;s cologne is so STRONG that when you are wearing it and shopping for groceries, when you pass other customers, they PASS OUT and fall into their shopping carts, because there wasn&#x27;t enough oxygen in the store because of your damn overpowering cologne!!!  </li>
            <li>purchased product in early 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My wife picked it for me when we started dating in the early 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Wow, Liz outdid herself when she came up with this men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li>The Cologne smelled old.</li>
            <li>Vanilla is pretty strong and &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; sent, after awhile you get really tired of it.</li>
            <li>but you only need to spray a little because the scent is very strong and it last all day.  </li>
            <li>I bought many cologne at this price range but was never satisfied like this one!</li>
            <li>I like that clean smell that isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li>Item is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know about her other fragrances, but this certainly qualifies!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t take me wrong, I like a light smell on myself or other men, but this is, over the top.</li>
            <li>The only time that this would be appropriate to wear would be on a late night date.</li>
            <li>After long time, i choosed the right one, it stands long and great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>etc  This 4 Ounces is a very large bottle for less than $21   </li>
            <li>Other people also make positive comments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Manly and masculine all at the same time..</li>
            <li>Arrived as expected and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to receive a massive 4 ounce spray bottle.</li>
            <li>afraid it will be discontinued like everything else good in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Well, Passion isn&#x27;t that way,,,it is a nice faint scent and</li>
            <li>Love this cologne maybe outdated to some guys</li>
            <li>Note that the 4 oz bottle is large and one heck of a value when compared to some of my other favorites like McGraw and Polo.</li>
            <li>really a good buy, highly recommend it, you wouldn&#x27;t Be disappointed.......</li>
            <li>It is a potently old scent reminiscent of your local Goodwill.  </li>

            <li> The ladies love it, and isn&#x27;t that what wearing a cologne is all about?</li>

            <li> Who could ask for more.      </li>
            <li> Women LOVE it.</li>

            <li> Love how this smells.</li>
            <li> but then the spice mostly goes away</li>
            <li> Retail stores don&#x27;t carry it any more and the ones that do</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have worn the product for many years and am always satisfied with the results.</li>

            <li> Good classic stuff!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong like so many of the mens colognes on the market</li>
            <li> Simply put: \\&quot;it is a very good scent to be around, and to wear\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Of course, I enjoy when he wears it too. :-)</li>
            <li> This is a good scent and it hold the whole day.</li>
            <li> It has a very light clean smell almost like getting out of the shower smell.</li>
            <li> Using our Amazon Prime account makes it so easy to order and receive packages without problems.</li>
            <li> it smelled like rubbing alcohol and was extremely strong</li>
            <li> I know a lot of men like that STRONG skunk smell that you can&#x27;t even wash off in the bathtub.  </li>
            <li> My father passed this kind of cologne on to me when I went on my first dance.</li>
            <li> It has an overpowering strong cheap perfumey smell.</li>
            <li> It came in nicely packed and smelled so good and lasted a  long time on my bf clothes.</li>
            <li> Great Cologne, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Relatively cheap.</li>
            <li> This scent is so yummy, complimentary and enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Its a fantastic product</li>
            <li> Civilized yet manly scent but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> We all enjoy the scent and it came in with time to spare for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Old school, winter wear, good silage and projection.</li>
            <li> Not the absolute best scent ever, but it is definitely something that they would recommend.</li>
            <li> This cologne is my husband&#x27;s favorite and the purchasing experience was very positive and there were no issues that we encountered.</li>
            <li> For this one which is Men Passion cologne is strong, great smell &amp; stays for long time</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> If you like your man smelling sexy or if your a man who would like to smell sexy for that special someone, I really recommend using Passion.  </li>
            <li> I first tried this many years ago after buying Passion for Women for My 1st Wife.</li>
            <li> It does smell great, but to me the quality is how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Amazon had it and as usual the best deal going.</li>
            <li> I liked this cologne well, and it last an ok amount of time.</li>
            <li> It is a clean, spicy, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Most people love the way i smell especially women.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> and this is one of his favorite classic scents.</li>
            <li> It smells good and lasts as long as any</li>
            <li> This is my dads favorite scent so for Christmas this was a natural gift choice!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good those have to get use to it if u never had it be for or if your just starting to really wear cologne like me</li>
            <li> This cologne was the balm meaning it was everything that I was anticipating, it had a soft scent that were not over bearing to the nose and received many compliments.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, and will probably never switch to a different kind of cologne.</li>
            <li> A lot of my female friends say it&#x27;s a nice smell.</li>
            <li> good for dating and other night out&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is what I imagine John Kennedy smelled like when he was driving around Martha&#x27;s vineyard with nothing much to do besides being rich.</li>
            <li> The bottle they shipped isn&#x27;t even the right design.  </li>
            <li> It still smells great, a distinguished gentlemanly smell, a small of success.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit strong so be light, only one or two sprays.</li>
            <li> this is too strong and spicy&amp;#34;, something like an old mans aftershave.</li>
            <li> Its also a very musky and formal wear, not something a young kid should wear on his first date but at a formal dinner party this would quite appropriate.</li>
            <li> I have Michael Jordon cologne for business meetings/day time which I like very much</li>
            <li> It is so very much like the woman&#x27;s version of Passion.  </li>
            <li> A like very much.</li>
            <li> I know seem to enjoy it more than other colognes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my step father who loved it , but it was a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Thanks AMAZON!</li>
            <li> I believe most men will appreciate the cologne, especially on dates.</li>
            <li> Way too sweet and much too much perfume like for my taste.  </li>
            <li> No, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been working at the office all day and, while I remain GQ, I also smell like I need to go back to work for a few more hours and smell good there</li>
            <li> so I just put it back in the box and took it to the salvation army, I am sure someone will like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gettin hot in here so take off all your.......</li>
            <li> So when first spraying on i think &amp;#34;wow</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle of this cologne</li>
            <li> Thanks a million!</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase on line.</li>
            <li> With hints of vanilla and cedar, this a classic sent and one that is worth a try.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m left with a pretty strong vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> Pleasant aroma, but does not last long.</li>
            <li> We saw positive reviews</li>
            <li> I have used Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s \\&quot;Passion\\&quot; for a long time &amp; love it as have all of my dates &amp; women I&#x27;ve been around.</li>
            <li> Also just because i say it&#x27;s only APPROPRIATE on a late night doesn&#x27;t make it good to wear on any date.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to all Men, because it smells like Liz Taylor was just at your house and sprayed just the right amount on you.</li>
            <li> BUT IAM SURE AS NORMAL IT WILL SMELL DIFFERENT ON EVERYONE</li>
            <li> I would certainly give this a try, and I can still smell it on my clothes when I take them off at night.</li>
            <li> (My wife doesn&#x27;t care that much for it when I first put it on, but a little while later she says it smells great).</li>
            <li> It was a great price and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> Every woman that I&#x27;ve dated has commented on how much they like it.  </li>
            <li> Theyve probably never heard of it, and its reasonably price at $20 for a 4oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> This was just what I needed at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> THANKS AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne, and my woman likes it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Husband loves this scent and it isn&#x27;t always readily found,so</li>
            <li> Best cologne ever, women go crazy</li>
            <li> Do not spray too much else</li>
            <li> It was a real turn off</li>
            <li> I dont mind the Cologne that much</li>
            <li> This fragance is durable and intense....</li>
            <li> And he was very suprise to get this gift.</li>
            <li> Sometimes  you wonder if iy&#x27;s the real deal....</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance, it lasts all day, and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> but it seem light enough for day wear as well.</li>
            <li> I had used Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s Passion  for men  since the late nineties, and i loved it .When</li>
            <li> Four ounces doesn&#x27;t sound like much, but this bottle goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> However, the scent didn&#x27;t seem like it could last a full day.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t really like the new smell.but</li>
            <li> I would say half hour the most is the duration.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not ridiculously priced.  </li>
            <li> This particular cologne is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> It is a little strong at first but settles in after 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Very masculine!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have literally sprayed it one time and I highly doubt I will ever use it again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend having Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> Sometimes there is actually a true meaning behind the name of a Product :)</li>
            <li> All in all i would go for something else that has a more citrus smell or something not so heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Fine with the purchases made with this the other cologne I brought.</li>
            <li> Cologne was new in wrapped box.</li>
            <li> This is an older cologne and my 91 year old father-in-law loves it.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I love this fragrance and the price was a whole lot less than the local stores.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I buy this one personally.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this back when it first came out</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite cologne - it is hard to find in retail in my area.</li>
            <li> You know how some men&#x27;s cologne is so STRONG that when you are wearing it and shopping for groceries, when you pass other customers, they PASS OUT and fall into their shopping carts, because there wasn&#x27;t enough oxygen in the store because of your damn overpowering cologne!!!  </li>
            <li> purchased product in early 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My wife picked it for me when we started dating in the early 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Wow, Liz outdid herself when she came up with this men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li> The Cologne smelled old.</li>
            <li> Vanilla is pretty strong and &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; sent, after awhile you get really tired of it.</li>
            <li> but you only need to spray a little because the scent is very strong and it last all day.  </li>
            <li> I bought many cologne at this price range but was never satisfied like this one!</li>
            <li> I like that clean smell that isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li> Item is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about her other fragrances, but this certainly qualifies!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take me wrong, I like a light smell on myself or other men, but this is, over the top.</li>
            <li> The only time that this would be appropriate to wear would be on a late night date.</li>
            <li> After long time, i choosed the right one, it stands long and great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> etc  This 4 Ounces is a very large bottle for less than $21   </li>
            <li> Other people also make positive comments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Manly and masculine all at the same time..</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to receive a massive 4 ounce spray bottle.</li>
            <li> afraid it will be discontinued like everything else good in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Well, Passion isn&#x27;t that way,,,it is a nice faint scent and</li>
            <li> Love this cologne maybe outdated to some guys</li>
            <li> Note that the 4 oz bottle is large and one heck of a value when compared to some of my other favorites like McGraw and Polo.</li>
            <li> really a good buy, highly recommend it, you wouldn&#x27;t Be disappointed.......</li>
            <li> It is a potently old scent reminiscent of your local Goodwill.  </li>
            <li> the price for the size not bad at all, the smell just doesn&#x27;t last as long; at least from the bottle that i purchased.</li>
            <li> the fragrance smell somewhat the same, but does not last as long as it did then.</li>
            <li> needless to say,  i was pleasantly surprised,  when i sprayed a little on my hand, it was the same fragrance from the yesteryear that i used to love and adore.</li>
            <li> it is expensive and only available in the smaller quantity.  </li>
            <li> He tried to buy it from the same site long time ago but he couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I like scent, but it does not last for too long.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stay as long.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry this review took so long</li>
            <li> SCENT!RECEIVE COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME AND KEEP ME FROM SWEATING ALL SUMMER LONG!</li>
            <li> Will keep buying it as long as they sell it!</li>
            <li> I using the same cologne for last few years but this bottle i got from Amazon is smell little different</li>
            <li> He formerly used an Armani cologne which was nice and subtle, but pricier so he wanted to try something less expensive.</li>
            <li> There was cologne everywhere and the bottle had about half of the cologne left in it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for items I buy on Amazon, but I&#x27;m hoping somebody will read this and realize the other reviews are a complete scam.</li>
            <li> I would urge all of the younger men, who are not familiar with this treasure,  and  that are looking for a quality colonge, to buy this one.</li>
            <li> it is OK not really too bad.</li>
            <li> Stinks really smells like old fragrance</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no shot that the reviews for this item are 100% legitimate.</li>
            <li> The package arrived on the expected day, 1 day after the DVDs I ordered.</li>
            <li> It has a very subtle scent, one that doesn&#x27;t cause people nearby to gasp for air; unless of course you just use too much.</li>
            <li> I was brought up to dress sharp and coordinate well.</li>
            <li> there anything that can be done?????????.&lt;br /&gt;The other items in this order were just want we wanted.</li>
            <li> This is surely not something you are going to wear daily</li>
            <li> This is the only stink that I wear [past 22 yrs.].</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the cheaper side of colognes and I had less expectations for it than some other products.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this brand for men &amp; it was a third of the retail price when you can find it.</li>
            <li> I bought into the hype and decided to see if I could find a cheap bottle of cologne, bad move.</li>
            <li> found Dark Obsession by Calvin Klein</li>
            <li> well, it is not great, it is like a cologne for really old people, I can not return it</li>
            <li> the smell can be strong and be annoying to your nose.</li>
            <li> Receiving compliments was a very common thing,but for the last year and a half that doesn&#x27;t happen anymore.</li>
            <li> which  is kinda disappointing for how large it is.</li>
            <li> It is getting difficult to find in stores near my home.  </li>
            <li> wasted of  money here...</li>
            <li> Took a few weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> By far the worst cologne i ever bought in my whole life!</li>
            <li> This said it would smell like vanilla, it stinks like an old lady!</li>
            <li> Its like there is very little fragrance at all</li>
            <li> Very weak , not the same potency, I was disappointed in the shippment, same bottle, but it is not the same</li>
            <li> I was given a small bottle of this years ago as a gift and decided to try it out.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why this product is called a men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li> from the packaging in the past but just thought they had updated their packaging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received comments  when I put a small amount on..  </li>
            <li> , MAYBE TRY A SMALL BOTTLE</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for the past twelve years.</li>
            <li> Plus, its getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> AGO HARD TO FIND FOUND HERE</li>
            <li> I am neither surprised or disappointed by the smell.</li>
            <li> I received this in really poor condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not a great scent (in my opinion).</li>
            <li> this is by far one of the worst colognes ever.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed in the condition of the shipping package, looked like the UPS truck ran over it.</li>
            <li> Very weak cologne.</li>
            <li> But it got expensive and I could not afford it until I came across it again at Amazon.</li>
            <li> but I just discovered that you sent the wrong</li>
            <li> I probaly wasnt gonna go wrong</li>
            <li> Even though he&#x27;s a teenager whose taste runs to flashy he agreed with me and didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> This looks really fake.</li>
            <li> I went crazy for the scent on him</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in Amazon and may not order from you again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Disappointed .Don&#x27;t like.the smell at all</li>
            <li> , IT&#x27;S A FAKE!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After long time, i choosed the right one, it stands long and great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It good for dating and other night out&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I was given a small bottle of this years ago as a gift and decided to try it out.  Several years later it&#x27;s the only cologne I wear.  Every woman that I&#x27;ve dated has commented on how much they like it.  \\&quot;My God, you smell good\\&quot; is one comment I remember hearing.  It&#x27;s not too strong like so many of the mens colognes on the market and it&#x27;s not ridiculously priced.  The ladies love it, and isn&#x27;t that what wearing a cologne is all about?</li>
            <li> Smells great for my father</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite cologne - it is hard to find in retail in my area.</li>
            <li> Stinks really smells like old fragrance</li>
            <li> Great Cologne, especially for the price. It smells great and I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne for night  I have Michael Jordon cologne for business meetings/day time which I like very much but it doesn&#x27;t stay as long.    For this one which is Men Passion cologne is strong, great smell &amp; stays for long time but again it&#x27;s more for night/wedding/formal dinner/..etc  This 4 Ounces is a very large bottle for less than $21   It &#x3D; 118ml which is even cheaper than the price of 30ml or 50ml anywhere else!    Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Have all read talked on this product</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne for men.  I got this for my husband.  The price was unbeatable..  Great deal, awesome cologne. Arrived on time.  Who could ask for more.      Thanks AMAZON!</li>
            <li> i hae used this product before and I loved it. But it got expensive and I could not afford it until I came across it again at Amazon. Great price and a great product. Every one loves the smell.</li>
            <li> Women LOVE it. Theyve probably never heard of it, and its reasonably price at $20 for a 4oz bottle.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s \\&quot;Passion\\&quot; for a long time &amp; love it as have all of my dates &amp; women I&#x27;ve been around. There is no substitute for a quality cologne &amp; this one definitely delivers.</li>
            <li> This is an older cologne and my 91 year old father-in-law loves it.  It is getting difficult to find in stores near my home.  I was delighted that you stock the product and the purchase price was outstanding.</li>
            <li> I using the same cologne for last few years but this bottle i got from Amazon is smell little different and i don&#x27;t really like the new smell.but it is OK not really too bad.</li>
            <li> Arrived as scheduled with no problems. One of the best prices on the web.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I buy this one personally. A friend had given me his before to try (almost done with it) and it was really nice smell. I liked this cologne well, and it last an ok amount of time. Just make sure you don&#x27;t bathe in it or else the smell can be strong and be annoying to your nose.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no shot that the reviews for this item are 100% legitimate. I bought into the hype and decided to see if I could find a cheap bottle of cologne, bad move. I have literally sprayed it one time and I highly doubt I will ever use it again. Honestly, I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for items I buy on Amazon, but I&#x27;m hoping somebody will read this and realize the other reviews are a complete scam.</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong something you might wear in your 40&#x27;s lol but it&#x27;s good those have to get use to it if u never had it be for or if your just starting to really wear cologne like me</li>
            <li> This was just what I needed at a very affordable price. Delivery was prompt and all expectations were met or exceeded. My wife loves the scent and I do too. Recommend.</li>
            <li> purchased product in early 90&#x27;s. the fragrance smell somewhat the same, but does not last as long as it did then. maybe the shelf life took away from the longevity of the smell. the price for the size not bad at all, the smell just doesn&#x27;t last as long; at least from the bottle that i purchased.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and I love the price.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED PASSION FOR YEARS AND COULD NOT FIND IT IN THE STORES ANY MORE.  AMAZON CAME THOUGH FOR ME.  THANKS AMAZON.</li>
            <li> I first tried this many years ago after buying Passion for Women for My 1st Wife. I really liked it when My Wife wore it. I tried the Passion for Men at My wifes request. Been wearing it ever since ( almost 10 years ). Simply put: \\&quot;it is a very good scent to be around, and to wear\\&quot;. An excellent choice for an evening out on the town or at home.</li>
            <li> Pleasant aroma, but does not last long. About one to two hours tops for me.</li>
            <li> My Lady purchased this fragrence for me 20 year ago. She still likes to smell it on me so I love to wear it for her. Other people also make positive comments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Something I have been buying for years.</li>
            <li> I was brought up to dress sharp and coordinate well. Part of that has been to select good colognes. This particular cologne is one of my favorites. It smells good and lasts as long as any I have ever found (5 AM to 7 PM). It is a little strong at first but settles in after 10-15 minutes. (My wife doesn&#x27;t care that much for it when I first put it on, but a little while later she says it smells great). Note that the 4 oz bottle is large and one heck of a value when compared to some of my other favorites like McGraw and Polo.</li>
            <li> You guys pulled through as promised.  Delivered rapidly and at a rock botto price.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I have been using Passion cologne for some time.  I believe most men will appreciate the cologne, especially on dates. I love it.</li>
            <li> Item was just as described and received in a timely manner</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product is called a men&#x27;s cologne.  It is so very much like the woman&#x27;s version of Passion.  Way too sweet and much too much perfume like for my taste.  Nothing about it, in opinon says MAN.  Don&#x27;t take me wrong, I like a light smell on myself or other men, but this is, over the top.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this for years. You can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so I am so glad to be able to buy it on Amazon and at a great price. It smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Have used this cologne for years, ever since it came out and a lady bought it for me. I like that clean smell that isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a cologne that smells good that works. This is a very good one to use.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite cologne&#x27;s that my husband wears.  When I found out that he had almost used all of the last bottle he had, I checked on Amazon to see if they carried it.  I had discovered recently that they carry a lot of items that I have been buying locally.  I found, once again, that I could purchase yet another item that I could have been saving a lot of money on.  If you like your man smelling sexy or if your a man who would like to smell sexy for that special someone, I really recommend using Passion.  Sometimes there is actually a true meaning behind the name of a Product :)</li>
            <li> Very weak , not the same potency, I was disappointed in the shippment, same bottle, but it is not the same</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne, and my woman likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;A great deal compared to buying in the store.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m afraid it will be discontinued like everything else good in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Husband loves this scent and it isn&#x27;t always readily found,so it&#x27;s great to have it delivered and not have to go hunting for it.</li>
            <li> I received this in really poor condition. The bottle must have been opened because it was leaking all over the package and it was sticky. There was cologne everywhere and the bottle had about half of the cologne left in it. I can&#x27;t return it either because it&#x27;s not aloud... I didn&#x27;t like the smell either.. especially because it was all over the package.</li>
            <li> A manly scent. Its ok...</li>
            <li> This is a great smell. It&#x27;s smells like warm wealth, if wealth could be a smell. There&#x27;s no rustic musk here. No, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been working at the office all day and, while I remain GQ, I also smell like I need to go back to work for a few more hours and smell good there so people will acknowledge my smell with an eyebrow raise so that I, too, know I smell good&amp;#34; smell here either. This is what I imagine John Kennedy smelled like when he was driving around Martha&#x27;s vineyard with nothing much to do besides being rich.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for years. It smells great and not to strong. I have numerous people over the years ask me what cologne I was wearing. It stays with you as well throughout the day. Great value.</li>
            <li> I used it some time ago but never could find it, just happen to find the container it came in and put it in the search box, click and there it was.</li>
            <li> This cologne is my husband&#x27;s favorite and the purchasing experience was very positive and there were no issues that we encountered.</li>
            <li> This Is about the third or fourth time that I have purchase this item. You can&#x27;t bet this price. I love it!</li>
            <li> It was competitively priced and affords a very pleasant smell. I&#x27;ll reorder again when the time comes to do so.</li>
            <li> ehh wasn&#x27;t that great, smell fades too quickly</li>
            <li> I bought the Passion for women so I bought the Passion for men for my husband I went crazy for the scent on him, it had me mesmorized.</li>
            <li> WORN THIS COLOGNE SPRAY FOR MANY YEARS! NOT TO PERFUME MORE OF A MANLY SCENT!RECEIVE COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME AND KEEP ME FROM SWEATING ALL SUMMER LONG!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and excellent price point!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my step father who loved it , but it was a little pricey. Saw it in the stores cheaper.</li>
            <li> I buy this periodically throughout the year to give to my dad for different occasions. My dad is in his 70&#x27;s and this is his favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> Good scent. Relatively cheap.</li>
            <li> Passion by Elizabeth Taylor has been my fragrance of choice for several years for evening wear.  Excellent fragrance, which generally attracts attention from others.</li>
            <li> What an intoxicating smell.  Compliments abound.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, a lot of them.  Nothing but complements from mostly the ladies.  Could not find this anywhere for a couple of years.  Then two years or so ago found it on Amazon.  Try it guys, you will love it....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used too many colognes in my life, but this is definitely my favorite. It has a very subtle scent, one that doesn&#x27;t cause people nearby to gasp for air; unless of course you just use too much. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments from people on it, and its price is more than fair.</li>
            <li> so many reviews about this cologne,  so I had to try it, well, it is not great, it is like a cologne for really old people, I can not return it so I just put it back in the box and took it to the salvation army, I am sure someone will like it. wasted of  money here...</li>
            <li> This cologne was the balm meaning it was everything that I was anticipating, it had a soft scent that were not over bearing to the nose and received many compliments. Wonderful Item.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance so gave it to my brother.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my b/f and it smells great. It has a very light clean smell almost like getting out of the shower smell.</li>
            <li> Best cologne ever, women go crazy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gettin hot in here so take off all your.......</li>
            <li> Great deal and it smells great</li>
            <li> This scent is so yummy, complimentary and enjoyable. I&#x27;ve purchased this for my husband for many years It&#x27;s so pleasant.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne maybe outdated to some guys but this is the only cologne I will still use after all this yrs</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne for the price.  Read that Dame Elizabeth wanted designer quality at a drugstore price in her fragrances.  Don&#x27;t know about her other fragrances, but this certainly qualifies!  Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not a great scent (in my opinion). I can see why there is an appeal for others though.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this fragrance and the price was a whole lot less than the local stores. Plus, its getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> My father passed this kind of cologne on to me when I went on my first dance. Ive been using it ever since. Its a fantastic product and I get a lot of people tell me that it smells great. So I recommend.</li>
            <li> Old school, winter wear, good silage and projection. Age 35+. Do not spray too much else it will clog anyone around you.</li>
            <li> My husband has been used this for years. I love the smell and he likes it better than any he has used. Will keep buying it as long as they sell it!</li>
            <li> This is a good scent and it hold the whole day. Most people love the way i smell especially women. I recommend this cologne to all my friends</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in Amazon and may not order from you again.&lt;br /&gt;I finally opened the package of men&#x27;s perfume which I thought was&lt;br /&gt;different from the packaging in the past but just thought they had updated their packaging.&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise and dissatisfaction instead of Passion by Eliuzabeth Taylor for Men&lt;br /&gt;I found Dark Obsession by Calvin Klein which I do not like.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry this review took so long but I just discovered that you sent the wrong Passion.&lt;br /&gt;Is there anything that can be done?????????.&lt;br /&gt;The other items in this order were just want we wanted.</li>
            <li> Love how this smells. I just ordered this and I wear it to work sometimes or when I&#x27;m going to the grocery.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and the smell is great !! You have to try it out, it&#x27;s a room stopper.</li>
            <li> So when first spraying on i think &amp;#34;wow this is too strong and spicy&amp;#34;, something like an old mans aftershave. It was a real turn off but then the spice mostly goes away and i&#x27;m left with a pretty strong vanilla smell. It&#x27;s ok at best. This is surely not something you are going to wear daily which  is kinda disappointing for how large it is. The only time that this would be appropriate to wear would be on a late night date. Also just because i say it&#x27;s only APPROPRIATE on a late night doesn&#x27;t make it good to wear on any date. I say you shouldn&#x27;t wear it on a date because no women is going to think this is sexy or manly and this sent just ins&#x27;t popular anymore. If you want to impress a girl, this isn&#x27;t going to do it. So basically i have no use for this product. Vanilla is pretty strong and &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; sent, after awhile you get really tired of it. All in all i would go for something else that has a more citrus smell or something not so heavy.</li>
            <li> By far the worst cologne i ever bought in my whole life! Trust me, Save your money for something valuable!</li>
            <li> Only mens cologne I can stand to smell. It smells great on my husband.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne so at this great price I had to buy one for my step-son for his birthday. I buy this every year to give him for Christmas. Keep up the great price and I will be a repeat customer. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I dont mind the Cologne that much but my wife hates it.</li>
            <li> Used it for years. Loved by many.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was really happy with it!!! He tried to buy it from the same site long time ago but he couldn&#x27;t. So it was a nice surprise. Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Just what it is supposed to be. Ordered at Christmas. Took a few weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> I like scent, but it does not last for too long. I would say half hour the most is the duration. It does smell great, but to me the quality is how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I had used Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s Passion  for men  since the late nineties, and i loved it .When my package from Amazon.com arrived today, i opened up the package expectantly...needless to say,  i was pleasantly surprised,  when i sprayed a little on my hand, it was the same fragrance from the yesteryear that i used to love and adore.It still smells great, a distinguished gentlemanly smell, a small of success.....and it is not dated at all.I would urge all of the younger men, who are not familiar with this treasure,  and  that are looking for a quality colonge, to buy this one.Don&#x27;t let the name fool you, Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s Passion for men, is a man&#x27;s colonge!</li>
            <li> It was just what I had ordered , no surprises here , the same product that I always use . Amazon is the way to go !!!</li>
            <li> This said it would smell like vanilla, it stinks like an old lady! I don&#x27;t know how any man could wear this crap!</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Taylor nailed it for her man&#x27;s cologne. Although, it is a scent noted best as an evening cologne, it works just as wonderful as a day scent. It is a clean, spicy, fresh scent. Very masculine! Bravo Elizabeth!! You will be missed.</li>
            <li> This is the only stink that I wear [past 22 yrs.]. Retail stores don&#x27;t carry it any more and the ones that do it is expensive and only available in the smaller quantity.  Amazon had it and as usual the best deal going.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my scent. I love it.</li>
            <li> Not at all recommend I return it didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> Great product at a competitive price. Wonderful fragrance that always gets attention when I meet a new acquaintance. I have worn the product for many years and am always satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller and products and very nice</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance on my husband...it is great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for 20 years and hope it continues to be made. My wife picked it for me when we started dating in the early 90&#x27;s. She loved the frangance and therefore, I do too.</li>
            <li> If you were to go buy this Cologne at a Dept store you would only get the 2oz for this price! Its a great deal!</li>
            <li> The name says it all in one word Passion</li>
            <li> Disappointed .Don&#x27;t like.the smell at all</li>
            <li> This product met all of my expectations.  It the smell was very good.  I received comments  when I put a small amount on..  Very good!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE SCENT BUT IAM SURE AS NORMAL IT WILL SMELL DIFFERENT ON EVERYONE, MAYBE TRY A SMALL BOTTLE I THINK ITS A GREAT FRAGRANCE AND THE SELLER WAS QUICK SHIPPING</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit strong so be light, only one or two sprays. Its also a very musky and formal wear, not something a young kid should wear on his first date but at a formal dinner party this would quite appropriate. With hints of vanilla and cedar, this a classic sent and one that is worth a try.</li>
            <li> This fragance is durable and intense....It is very good. A like very much. Good Purchase. I had bought a excellent product.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne and gets many compliments when he wears it. Of course, I enjoy when he wears it too. :-) Using our Amazon Prime account makes it so easy to order and receive packages without problems. I highly recommend having Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for several years. My wife loves it on me. And that&#x27;s what counts! Civilized yet manly scent but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> My friend love it because that the type he uses. And he was very suprise to get this gift. And I love the cologne on him.</li>
            <li> It came in nicely packed and smelled so good and lasted a  long time on my bf clothes. He loves it/</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this scent !! guaranteed to turn heads and get compliments  it also last for the entire day as well,  really a good buy, highly recommend it, you wouldn&#x27;t Be disappointed.......</li>
            <li> Hard to find this brand for men &amp; it was a third of the retail price when you can find it.</li>
            <li> This is my dads favorite scent so for Christmas this was a natural gift choice! We all enjoy the scent and it came in with time to spare for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Just love the smell!  I have used this for years, and will probably never switch to a different kind of cologne.</li>
            <li> Great price..Will buy again</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle of this cologne and I decided t try it and I knew with L.T. I probaly wasnt gonna go wrong and guess what I hit the jackpot. It arrived in excellent time and the smell is amazing. Manly and masculine all at the same time..Men Get This Cologne..youll reorder when this bottle runs out..PROMISE!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift. Arrived as expected and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. The ladies love it.  :)</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, Its my wife favorite</li>
            <li> Smells great. A good value buy amount per bottle. I would recommend it to any man who likes to smell nice at a good price.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Cologne was new in wrapped box. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.  I bought this for my husband ten years ago and he has been wearing it since then.</li>
            <li> Sometimes  you wonder if iy&#x27;s the real deal.... it appears to be. The handling of the delievery went smooth, happy with that.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations I was quite  pleased</li>
            <li> My son bought this to try. It has an overpowering strong cheap perfumey smell. Even though he&#x27;s a teenager whose taste runs to flashy he agreed with me and didn&#x27;t like the smell. He formerly used an Armani cologne which was nice and subtle, but pricier so he wanted to try something less expensive. We saw positive reviews but I guess taste in scents run the gamut. Try it in a department store before you buy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my man, and he just loves it, and I love the way it smells on him. It is one of his favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my fiance because I swear by passion for women.  It smells good but you only need to spray a little because the scent is very strong and it last all day.  I love it though</li>
            <li> Love this cologne, smells gd</li>
            <li> This is great , lovely.</li>
            <li> I ordered a 4 oz bottle and they (Sams Online) shipped me a .85 oz bottle.  I opened it up and smelled it and its a knock off.  It does not smell anything like Passion for Men.  I have a bottle of it that I bought from a store, so I know what it smells like.  The bottle they shipped isn&#x27;t even the right design.  Looks nothing like what it should.  DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT, IT&#x27;S A FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance, it lasts all day, and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my son, for a Christmas gift. I&#x27;ve never smelled the men&#x27;s version of this, but once he opened it, we both liked it. A little disappointed in the condition of the shipping package, looked like the UPS truck ran over it. Thankful the actual bottle wasn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
            <li> a very nice smelling cologne.what do you expect, a beautiful smelling mens cologne from one of the most beautiful women of the world.nice bottle too, kinda art deco type that looks good on my dresser.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great smelling fragrance!! I used to wear this back when it first came out and I get compliments now just like I did back then. I would certainly give this a try, and I can still smell it on my clothes when I take them off at night. Good classic stuff!!</li>
            <li> Very weak cologne. It lasts ten minutes instead of all day, like it used to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the cheaper side of colognes and I had less expectations for it than some other products. However, the scent didn&#x27;t seem like it could last a full day. The scent itself was on the weaker side as well.&lt;br /&gt;I would say I&#x27;d probably get another cologne for twice the price of this product, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for the past twelve years.Receiving compliments was a very common thing,but for the last year and a half that doesn&#x27;t happen anymore.Something has changed in the way they make it.Ever since Liz passed away whoever is making this stuff has changed the formula.Its like there is very little fragrance at all and it doesn&#x27;t last.What a shame....So much for a good product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> this is by far one of the worst colognes ever. it smelled like rubbing alcohol and was extremely strong I wanted to choke and die.</li>
            <li> This may be a bit too floral for me, but the chicks dig it, so that&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> Thank you. Gift for brother. He loves the smell.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item as it was a gift for a friends birthday and this is one of his favorite classic scents. The price was an excellent deal. The item shipped almost immediately and arrived well before the stated time frame. The item was well packaged and the item was in pristine condition when it did arrive. Smells great and all around this was a very positive online purchasing experience. I will order again with no hesitation. Trustworthy seller and item was as described.  Thanks a million!</li>
            <li> Warm scent that not musky.Not over powering.It say evening wear but it seem light enough for day wear as well.Two sprays at night and one day should do job.</li>
            <li> It is ok that is it.I am neither surprised or disappointed by the smell.It is just average,don&#x27;t know if I would recommend it or not.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite cologne. I wear it everyday. Recommended.</li>
            <li> It was a great price and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> i like this cologne and use it daily that is the reason i keep ordering it  whenever i get low i reorder it</li>
            <li> A lot of my female friends say it&#x27;s a nice smell. Not the absolute best scent ever, but it is definitely something that they would recommend. The smell is pleasant and is not too strong. Solid purchase overall. Excellent for the price.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised. Item is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I think the smell is nice but to be honest no women have come up to me and say &amp;#34; you smell great&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;what is that your wearing&amp;#34; and my wife thinks its not so great. So you can roll the dice on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Fine with the purchases made with this the other cologne I brought.</li>
            <li> This looks really fake. OMG</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like your grandmother mixed with cinnamon, this scent is for you.  It has a musky aroma that some might find appealing, but not I.  It is a potently old scent reminiscent of your local Goodwill.  All in all, it is too feminine for me to even consider wearing.</li>
            <li> Wow, Liz outdid herself when she came up with this men&#x27;s cologne.  Four ounces doesn&#x27;t sound like much, but this bottle goes a long way.  You know how some men&#x27;s cologne is so STRONG that when you are wearing it and shopping for groceries, when you pass other customers, they PASS OUT and fall into their shopping carts, because there wasn&#x27;t enough oxygen in the store because of your damn overpowering cologne!!!  I know a lot of men like that STRONG skunk smell that you can&#x27;t even wash off in the bathtub.  Well, Passion isn&#x27;t that way,,,it is a nice faint scent and people aren&#x27;t going to scream and run outside to get oxygen when they pass you in the grocery store.  This is real good stuff and I highly recommend it to all Men, because it smells like Liz Taylor was just at your house and sprayed just the right amount on you.</li>
            <li> Such great smell for cologne in this price range! I bought many cologne at this price range but was never satisfied like this one! i love the way my husband smells and he said this is the best smelling perfume I ever got him! Try it and you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> Dog s*** smells better</li>
            <li> The Cologne smelled old. Like this was a bottle of cologne had been on the self for 1 or 2  years. I have brought this sense for my Dad for years. I know what it is suppose to smell like and this wasn&#x27;t it. This was my first purchase on line. I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;Marlene Roach</li>
            <li> AN OLDIE BUT GOODIE BOUGHT FOR MY BOYFRIEND HE USED TO WEAR 20 YEARS AGO HARD TO FIND FOUND HERE HE WAS VERY HAPPY WITH IT</li>
            <li> oldie but goodie.  Great price!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a family member and the product matched the description perfectly without any signs of leakage!</li>
            <li> Smells great. Husband likes it well.</li>
            <li> The package arrived on the expected day, 1 day after the DVDs I ordered. I didn&#x27;t look at the size, but ordered it based on price. I had thought it was a 2 ounce bottle based on the price of the women&#x27;s perfume. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a massive 4 ounce spray bottle. I love the scent and women I know seem to enjoy it more than other colognes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
