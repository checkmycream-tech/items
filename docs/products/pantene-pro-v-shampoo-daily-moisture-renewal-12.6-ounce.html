            <li>Love you!</li>
            <li>This shampoo was a great find for me, even though I got it as a free review product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I really liked the Kerastase shampoo I used for about a year</li>
            <li>That is nice in this age of &amp;#34;over-selling&amp;#34; what something can do.</li>
            <li>It hydrates my hair without making my scalp oily, as it tends to be in warm weather.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, but it is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>so I am super happy with</li>
            <li>I loved the thicker shampoo and fact that it rinsed easy.</li>
            <li>And I like the scent, light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s readily available everywhere, has a good price over salon shampoos and it works well.</li>
            <li>It adds nice body to my fine hair, as well.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t using a professional or salon product, Pantene is a very good choice for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>smell is okay;</li>
            <li>Pantene&#x27;s Daily Moisture Renewal Hydrating Shampoo is a wonderful shampoo.  </li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten to become more and more of a codger, my hair seems to be even stiffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos - Everything from Suave to Kerastase.  </li>
            <li>I love what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li>Pantene is my all-time favorite for hair products.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>For my hair, this is a winning shampoo.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Pantene products</li>
            <li>and I swear they just keep getting better and better.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Pantene shampoos are some of my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love how silky my hair feels after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love Pantene and have never tried a product I didn&#x27;t adore.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and heartily recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very rich and produces mega amounts of lather</li>
            <li>On top of that I felt the scent was a bit too strong, so I won&#x27;t be getting this formula again.</li>
            <li>My comb had never gone more easily through my hair.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, fresh clean scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very strong and healthy, and I rarely see more than one or two fallen strands in the bathroom sink after drying/styling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pantene has been a part of my life for many years, and I&#x27;ve settled on this fine product as my go to shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Given the modest price of this product, I would say this is a great deal.</li>
            <li>and I had forgotten how good it really was.  </li>
            <li>Followed up by conditioner, my hair looks lustrous and shiny and is easy to style.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel smooth without becoming oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a lot of full body and seems to promote a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy, with a light fragrance I can&#x27;t identify.  </li>
            <li>So I need a shampoo that moisturizes enough that my hair doesn&#x27;t have a load of fly away and frizz.  </li>
            <li>is a great basic buy.</li>
            <li>Today on Amazon it costs $6.97 (12.6 oz bottle) with free shipping</li>
            <li>Pantene makes a great product and this Pro-V Daily Moisture Renewal shampoo is no exception!</li>
            <li>This stuff really keeps a woman&#x27;s hair looking AND smelling nice.</li>
            <li>its so cheap that I cant image.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>It was great when I was experiencing overall dryness and damage, but now that I have restored my hair, this shampoo ends up making my hair look as if I haven&#x27;t washed it at all.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to try this because of the low price, but it is great!  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is really nice (although I liked the previous generation of this shampoo&#x27;s fragrance even more).  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use most shampoos because I&#x27;m sensitive to aromas and many chemicals.</li>
            <li>It brings to mind a tropical rail forest with scents of tropical flowers, fruits and a rain drenched clean air smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would not go so far as to say this is the best shampoo ever; I also very much like Tea Tree Oil shampoo, which also soothes a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>But more importantly it rinses out easily and leaves my hair feeling clean and manageable and not dried out like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Silky, healthy, smells fruity and clean and Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V gently cleans without drying your hair out.</li>
            <li>It has a subtly sweet and fruity scent and it works well for both sexes.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>What more do you really need to know?</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro-V Daily Moisture Renewal Hydrating Shampoo is a very good shampoo that can be used daily without damaging one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>The aroma of the shampoo is amazing when you open the bottle to use it.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has a fresh floral and fruity scent.</li>
            <li>Great lather, nice smell and after 14+ hours after use, my hair feels soft and I have less frizz than normal.</li>
            <li>I used this for 2 weeks straight and while it suds and cleans great, I didn&#x27;t notice anything &amp;#34;above&amp;#34; other shampoos.</li>
            <li>I feel like it coated every strand and even made tangles fall right out with a rinse.</li>
            <li>This shampoo moisturizes and detangles our hair while leaving it soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I have been using a higher priced shampoo which I like</li>
            <li>Thanks, Pantene!</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers up and rinses out nicely, no need to use too much to get a good clean head of hair.  </li>
            <li>But that can be extremely expensive, and so when I can get Pantene at a reasonable price (or for free, as it is through Amazon Vine), I&#x27;m always happy to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean, soft and very manageable.  </li>
            <li>Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V Daily Moisture Renewal Hydrating Shampoo lathers up very well and rinses out easily.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo itself lathers up and unlike many other shampoos that aim to condition and moisturize your hair - it rinses out easily too without leaving your back feeling oily.</li>
            <li>and I really like</li>
            <li>It was fast packaged well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m embarassed to admit how much effort and expense I&#x27;ve put into finding the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; shampoo over the years.  </li>
            <li>and this infuses much needed shine and moisture into her hair.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m a teacher, the ponytail is somewhat of a calling card for me - I&#x27;m often called Mr. Ponytail - and as such, my hair is kind of a big deal for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, though -- and I will definitely purchase it in the future, as I&#x27;m a fan of Pantene products.</li>
            <li>The product dispenses nicely without any waste.</li>
            <li>Well, apparently this new version is similar to the old one because I absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>but I did not find it to be any more moisturizing than any other pantene shampoo.</li>
            <li>Just glad it doesn&#x27;t stink like some other brands.</li>
            <li>This creamy, white shampoo works into a thick rich lather that rinses out easily and leaves your hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>As an older lady my hair, and everything else, is getting so dry.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My hair feels full and soft and is easily manageable which is not the usual case with my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice thick consistency and lathers up well.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, my scalp is very sensitive to many shampoo ingredients, causing my scalp to itch uncontrollably, and resulting in heavy dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does take a little more rinsing  to get to the squeaky-clean stage than my usual clear shampoo, but it&#x27;s still fine.  </li>
            <li>I love the flat lid, so that you can place it upside down in the shower and get to all the product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great at keeping my crazy hair under control.  </li>
            <li>This did leave my hair smelling clean and slightly floral.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>My hair comes out feeling lavish, and it&#x27;s natural color looks nicer.  </li>
            <li>shampoo leaves my hair soft and shiny with no signs of dryness.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Even easing off of the conditioner or eliminating it entirely the product is just too much.</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like so much is the bottle - I&#x27;m a fan of the kind that you depress the nozzle and the shampoo shoots out - this bottle is slick in the shower.</li>
            <li>After every unsuccessful attempt at switching shampoos, I always wind up right back at Pantene Daily Moisture</li>
            <li>You get exactly what you want, lavish, well-hydrated hair that does not frizz or dry out.</li>
            <li>It is dry; but also gets oily quick enough that I don&#x27;t like to miss a day of showering.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t leave my hair dry or frizzy like many shampoos would, but I still needed conditioner and a little serum to keep everything under control.  </li>
            <li>Pantene has long been my go-to choice for shampoos and conditioners, and this product goes to show just why I like them so much.  </li>
            <li>When I tried this, I only used a rinsing conditiner and my hair feels normal.  </li>
            <li>I normally wash my short hair every other day and with the Pantene, it is able to go to the second day without being limp or greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>shampoo is VERY gentle on my scalp, never irritating in the least.  </li>
            <li>but Dollar General sells it for $5.00 (21.1 oz bottle).  </li>
            <li>This one actually tamed down the frizz so much better than my other various shampoos I had been using.  </li>
            <li>But the shampoo works and I do highly recommend it to control that frizz if you are prone to dry hair!</li>
            <li>makes the hair clean but not spectacularly volumized or textured like competitor&#x27;s shampoo&#x27;s.&lt;br</li>
            <li>like the flat lid so that you can keep it upside down on your shower shelf and are able to use all the shampoo down to the last drop.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally not a huge fan of P&amp;G&#x27;s environmental/animal rights positions, but I do understand they are moving in the right direction (finally) with respect to these issues.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has a slight, faint but pleasant aroma.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t weigh down my straight hair, but does moisturizes the ends.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> It was great when I was experiencing overall dryness and damage, but now that I have restored my hair, this shampoo ends up making my hair look as if I haven&#x27;t washed it at all.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to try this because of the low price, but it is great!  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is really nice (although I liked the previous generation of this shampoo&#x27;s fragrance even more).  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use most shampoos because I&#x27;m sensitive to aromas and many chemicals.</li>
            <li> It brings to mind a tropical rail forest with scents of tropical flowers, fruits and a rain drenched clean air smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would not go so far as to say this is the best shampoo ever; I also very much like Tea Tree Oil shampoo, which also soothes a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> But more importantly it rinses out easily and leaves my hair feeling clean and manageable and not dried out like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Silky, healthy, smells fruity and clean and Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V gently cleans without drying your hair out.</li>
            <li> It has a subtly sweet and fruity scent and it works well for both sexes.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> What more do you really need to know?</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Daily Moisture Renewal Hydrating Shampoo is a very good shampoo that can be used daily without damaging one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> The aroma of the shampoo is amazing when you open the bottle to use it.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has a fresh floral and fruity scent.</li>
            <li> Great lather, nice smell and after 14+ hours after use, my hair feels soft and I have less frizz than normal.</li>
            <li> I used this for 2 weeks straight and while it suds and cleans great, I didn&#x27;t notice anything &amp;#34;above&amp;#34; other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I feel like it coated every strand and even made tangles fall right out with a rinse.</li>
            <li> This shampoo moisturizes and detangles our hair while leaving it soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I have been using a higher priced shampoo which I like</li>
            <li> Thanks, Pantene!</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers up and rinses out nicely, no need to use too much to get a good clean head of hair.  </li>
            <li> But that can be extremely expensive, and so when I can get Pantene at a reasonable price (or for free, as it is through Amazon Vine), I&#x27;m always happy to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling clean, soft and very manageable.  </li>
            <li> Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V Daily Moisture Renewal Hydrating Shampoo lathers up very well and rinses out easily.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo itself lathers up and unlike many other shampoos that aim to condition and moisturize your hair - it rinses out easily too without leaving your back feeling oily.</li>
            <li> and I really like</li>
            <li> It was fast packaged well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m embarassed to admit how much effort and expense I&#x27;ve put into finding the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; shampoo over the years.  </li>
            <li> and this infuses much needed shine and moisture into her hair.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m a teacher, the ponytail is somewhat of a calling card for me - I&#x27;m often called Mr. Ponytail - and as such, my hair is kind of a big deal for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, though -- and I will definitely purchase it in the future, as I&#x27;m a fan of Pantene products.</li>
            <li> The product dispenses nicely without any waste.</li>
            <li> Well, apparently this new version is similar to the old one because I absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> but I did not find it to be any more moisturizing than any other pantene shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just glad it doesn&#x27;t stink like some other brands.</li>
            <li> This creamy, white shampoo works into a thick rich lather that rinses out easily and leaves your hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> As an older lady my hair, and everything else, is getting so dry.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My hair feels full and soft and is easily manageable which is not the usual case with my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice thick consistency and lathers up well.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, my scalp is very sensitive to many shampoo ingredients, causing my scalp to itch uncontrollably, and resulting in heavy dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does take a little more rinsing  to get to the squeaky-clean stage than my usual clear shampoo, but it&#x27;s still fine.  </li>
            <li> I love the flat lid, so that you can place it upside down in the shower and get to all the product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great at keeping my crazy hair under control.  </li>
            <li> This did leave my hair smelling clean and slightly floral.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> My hair comes out feeling lavish, and it&#x27;s natural color looks nicer.  </li>
            <li> shampoo leaves my hair soft and shiny with no signs of dryness.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Even easing off of the conditioner or eliminating it entirely the product is just too much.</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like so much is the bottle - I&#x27;m a fan of the kind that you depress the nozzle and the shampoo shoots out - this bottle is slick in the shower.</li>
            <li> After every unsuccessful attempt at switching shampoos, I always wind up right back at Pantene Daily Moisture</li>
            <li> You get exactly what you want, lavish, well-hydrated hair that does not frizz or dry out.</li>
            <li> It is dry; but also gets oily quick enough that I don&#x27;t like to miss a day of showering.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t leave my hair dry or frizzy like many shampoos would, but I still needed conditioner and a little serum to keep everything under control.  </li>
            <li> Pantene has long been my go-to choice for shampoos and conditioners, and this product goes to show just why I like them so much.  </li>
            <li> When I tried this, I only used a rinsing conditiner and my hair feels normal.  </li>
            <li> I normally wash my short hair every other day and with the Pantene, it is able to go to the second day without being limp or greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> shampoo is VERY gentle on my scalp, never irritating in the least.  </li>
            <li> but Dollar General sells it for $5.00 (21.1 oz bottle).  </li>
            <li> This one actually tamed down the frizz so much better than my other various shampoos I had been using.  </li>
            <li> But the shampoo works and I do highly recommend it to control that frizz if you are prone to dry hair!</li>
            <li> makes the hair clean but not spectacularly volumized or textured like competitor&#x27;s shampoo&#x27;s.&lt;br</li>
            <li> like the flat lid so that you can keep it upside down on your shower shelf and are able to use all the shampoo down to the last drop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally not a huge fan of P&amp;G&#x27;s environmental/animal rights positions, but I do understand they are moving in the right direction (finally) with respect to these issues.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has a slight, faint but pleasant aroma.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t weigh down my straight hair, but does moisturizes the ends.</li>
            <li> so you really need to use only a small amount.  </li>
            <li> While it leaves my hair soft, it also keeps in manageable and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down so that I can style it the way I like.  </li>
            <li> I have waist length, dirty blonde hair that is mostly straight but can wave a bit; which translates into frizz if I don&#x27;t use the right shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using hair color several months ago, and I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, lest it dry out</li>
            <li> /&gt;Living in the desert, and using a blow drier daily, my hair does get very dry, this shampoo leaves my hair looking healthier, and manageable.</li>
            <li> Patene products have come a long way where ethnic hair care is concerned.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair bouncy and fluffy and naturally enhances the curls.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long, dry hair</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, color treated hair, so my hair can get really dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> If you have dry scalp or frizzy dry hair often this one&#x27;s not really going to do anything for you.</li>
            <li> The Daily Moisture Renewal Hydrating Shampoo does not leave my hair limp or greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> but I began noticing that my hair was falling out at an alarming rate.  </li>
            <li> further use of this product, it really has proven to be too heavy for my hair which tends to be thin.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much, as a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Pantene  the regular 2-1 shampoo and conditioner, this one I do not need to use conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that because of that, my hair would get dirty looking even quicker; but I haven&#x27;t found this to be true</li>
            <li> I use both the shampoo and conditioner and other products by this company.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t find this any better or worse than other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Name brand shampoos are getting so expensive and this Pantene is still reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, naturally wavy hair that is very difficult to keep under control, even in low humidity.  </li>
            <li> I feel a little bit dry,coarse.</li>
            <li> This Pantene leaves my hair feeling soft and looking shiny, while cutting down a bit on frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s psychosomatic or not,</li>
            <li> : I have thick wavy hair that is about 6&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My daughters use this on shoulder length, thick hair and no conditioner is needed (at least not now that it is spring/early summer).  </li>
            <li> I dont describe with my poor Chinglish.</li>
            <li> Fats and oil will tame hair, but leaves it feeling as dirty as it was before you washed it.  </li>
            <li> Lathers well, but not impressed.</li>
            <li> It just seems they never go wrong and what they sell works well and just not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I hated it.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product does jjust what it&#x27;s name says it will do.  It adds moisture to your hair and makes it feel awesome.  It is very rich and produces mega amounts of lather so you really need to use only a small amount.  I will definitely purchase this item again.  I have been using a higher priced shampoo which I like but this produces the same results.</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Daily Moisture Renewal shampoo lives up to it&#x27;s name. This creamy, white shampoo works into a thick rich lather that rinses out easily and leaves your hair squeaky clean. It has a pleasant, fresh clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;Living in the desert, and using a blow drier daily, my hair does get very dry, this shampoo leaves my hair looking healthier, and manageable.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo as soon as I got it and I am pleased with the results.  It leaves my hair feeling clean, soft and very manageable.  I usually use Pantene  the regular 2-1 shampoo and conditioner, this one I do not need to use conditioner.  My hair feels great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hydrating shampoo but I did not find it to be any more moisturizing than any other pantene shampoo. If you have dry scalp or frizzy dry hair often this one&#x27;s not really going to do anything for you. On top of that I felt the scent was a bit too strong, so I won&#x27;t be getting this formula again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy, with a light fragrance I can&#x27;t identify.  All winter my hair has felt like straw unless I used a leave-in conditioner.  When I tried this, I only used a rinsing conditiner and my hair feels normal.  Wow.  It&#x27;s been awhile.  Thanks, Pantene!</li>
            <li> Five years ago I used only Pantene; but when they switched their formula I hated it.  Well, apparently this new version is similar to the old one because I absolutely loved it. I have waist length, dirty blonde hair that is mostly straight but can wave a bit; which translates into frizz if I don&#x27;t use the right shampoo.  It is dry; but also gets oily quick enough that I don&#x27;t like to miss a day of showering. So I need a shampoo that moisturizes enough that my hair doesn&#x27;t have a load of fly away and frizz.  This one actually tamed down the frizz so much better than my other various shampoos I had been using.  I was worried that because of that, my hair would get dirty looking even quicker; but I haven&#x27;t found this to be true so I am super happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is okay; nothing to write home about.  I wish they had chosen a different perfume.  But the shampoo works and I do highly recommend it to control that frizz if you are prone to dry hair!</li>
            <li> Pantene&#x27;s Daily Moisture Renewal Hydrating Shampoo is a wonderful shampoo.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice thick consistency and lathers up well.  You don&#x27;t need to use much, as a little goes a long way.  The fragrance is very nice.  It has a subtly sweet and fruity scent and it works well for both sexes.  This Pantene leaves my hair feeling soft and looking shiny, while cutting down a bit on frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I have thick wavy hair that is about 6&amp;#34; long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... smells great and works great.</li>
            <li> Lathers well, but not impressed.</li>
            <li> It was fast packaged well. Not the best deal. But awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;love the product.</li>
            <li> Cleansing, hydrating shampoo. Personally I find it a bit drying to use without a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It makes the hair clean but not spectacularly volumized or textured like competitor&#x27;s shampoo&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great basic buy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t find this any better or worse than other shampoos. I used this for 2 weeks straight and while it suds and cleans great, I didn&#x27;t notice anything &amp;#34;above&amp;#34; other shampoos. This did leave my hair smelling clean and slightly floral. I loved the thicker shampoo and fact that it rinsed easy. Overall for a daily shampoo I&#x27;d choose this again!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is perfect for my rather bristly hair. As I&#x27;ve gotten to become more and more of a codger, my hair seems to be even stiffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene has been a part of my life for many years, and I&#x27;ve settled on this fine product as my go to shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy hair to manage, especially when using the Pantene conditioner recommended for this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert C. Ross&lt;br /&gt;May 2015</li>
            <li> This a product that we regularly use for our hair. Patene products have come a long way where ethnic hair care is concerned. This shampoo moisturizes and detangles our hair while leaving it soft and easy to manage. I use both the shampoo and conditioner and other products by this company.</li>
            <li> Silky, healthy, smells fruity and clean and Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V gently cleans without drying your hair out. Loaded with &amp;#34;antioxidants&amp;#34; it won&#x27;t do damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use most shampoos because I&#x27;m sensitive to aromas and many chemicals. I can, and the Mrs. can, use this. Happy marriage!</li>
            <li> This a good hydrating shampoo for my colored hair. I also like the hydrating conditioner. This product doesn&#x27;t weigh down my straight hair, but does moisturizes the ends. My reason for four stars is the scent is too perfumed for me.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to try this because of the low price, but it is great!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  The smell is incredible, and it works well!  I found an inexpensive product that works - you can&#x27;t beat that - very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wonderful to my hair and to my sense of smell.  My hair feels full and soft and is easily manageable which is not the usual case with my hair.  The Daily Moisture Renewal Hydrating Shampoo does not leave my hair limp or greasy feeling.  Some shampoos &amp;#34;hydrate&amp;#34; by using a moisturizer that has anything in it except moisturizing ingredients.  Fats and oil will tame hair, but leaves it feeling as dirty as it was before you washed it.  This is not the case with this shampoo.  I normally wash my short hair every other day and with the Pantene, it is able to go to the second day without being limp or greasy feeling.  The aroma of the shampoo is amazing when you open the bottle to use it.  It brings to mind a tropical rail forest with scents of tropical flowers, fruits and a rain drenched clean air smell.  This is a wonderful addition to the Pantene Shampoo line of products.</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Daily Moisture Renewal Hydrating Shampoo is a very good shampoo that can be used daily without damaging one&#x27;s hair. In fact, Pantene says that their shampoo will erase damage to the hair caused by blow-drying. It does seem to add moisture to the hair. Of course, Pantene recommends using the product along with their Daily Moisture Renewal conditioner, but it seems to do well enough on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m a guy, I have a shoulder-length ponytail that I&#x27;ve worn since I&#x27;ve been 18.  Since I&#x27;m a teacher, the ponytail is somewhat of a calling card for me - I&#x27;m often called Mr. Ponytail - and as such, my hair is kind of a big deal for me.  Pantene has long been my go-to choice for shampoos and conditioners, and this product goes to show just why I like them so much.  My hair comes out feeling lavish, and it&#x27;s natural color looks nicer.  Not sure if that&#x27;s psychosomatic or not, but it could be I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like so much is the bottle - I&#x27;m a fan of the kind that you depress the nozzle and the shampoo shoots out - this bottle is slick in the shower.</li>
            <li> Pantene is the third largest selling shampoo in the world and there&#x27;s a reason for it. It&#x27;s readily available everywhere, has a good price over salon shampoos and it works well. This is the shampoo my wife buys regularly. Today on Amazon it costs $6.97 (12.6 oz bottle) with free shipping but Dollar General sells it for $5.00 (21.1 oz bottle).  If you life in an area of the country were the nearest store is a days drive away then by all means buy it here. It cleans well, smells great and adds body.  If you&#x27;re bald then ignore this review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m embarassed to admit how much effort and expense I&#x27;ve put into finding the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; shampoo over the years.  I have thick, coarse, naturally wavy hair that is very difficult to keep under control, even in low humidity.  Additionally, my scalp is very sensitive to many shampoo ingredients, causing my scalp to itch uncontrollably, and resulting in heavy dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos - Everything from Suave to Kerastase.  I really liked the Kerastase shampoo I used for about a year (Bain Satin 2), but I began noticing that my hair was falling out at an alarming rate.  After every unsuccessful attempt at switching shampoos, I always wind up right back at Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is VERY gentle on my scalp, never irritating in the least.  The fragrance is really nice (although I liked the previous generation of this shampoo&#x27;s fragrance even more).  It makes my hair very strong and healthy, and I rarely see more than one or two fallen strands in the bathroom sink after drying/styling.  It&#x27;s also great at keeping my crazy hair under control.  I&#x27;m generally not a huge fan of P&amp;G&#x27;s environmental/animal rights positions, but I do understand they are moving in the right direction (finally) with respect to these issues.  The bottom line is this is always the shampoo I find myself going back to - I love what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li> Pantene is my all-time favorite for hair products. It just seems they never go wrong and what they sell works well and just not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo follows in that line. It has a wonderful light floral fragrance. It makes my hair feel smooth without becoming oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the flat lid so that you can keep it upside down on your shower shelf and are able to use all the shampoo down to the last drop. The shampoo itself lathers up and unlike many other shampoos that aim to condition and moisturize your hair - it rinses out easily too without leaving your back feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Pantene makes a great product and this Pro-V Daily Moisture Renewal shampoo is no exception! My daughter has very long, dry hair and this infuses much needed shine and moisture into her hair. I have seen a great change since she started using it. I too used it and was impressed by the thickness of the liquid and the way it cleaned my hair without leaving it greasy. Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Great lather, nice smell and after 14+ hours after use, my hair feels soft and I have less frizz than normal. Given the modest price of this product, I would say this is a great deal. For my hair, this is a winning shampoo.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Pantene products and I swear they just keep getting better and better.  This shampoo is my absolute favorite.  As an older lady my hair, and everything else, is getting so dry.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo leaves my hair soft and shiny with no signs of dryness.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Yes, this products works as advertised! That is nice in this age of &amp;#34;over-selling&amp;#34; what something can do. You get exactly what you want, lavish, well-hydrated hair that does not frizz or dry out. It gives a lot of full body and seems to promote a healthy glow. What more do you really need to know? Pantene is a great product that delivers on what it claims. Recommended!</li>
            <li> This stuff really keeps a woman&#x27;s hair looking AND smelling nice. No complaints here. Just glad it doesn&#x27;t stink like some other brands.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was a great find for me, even though I got it as a free review product. It hydrates my hair without making my scalp oily, as it tends to be in warm weather. It adds nice body to my fine hair, as well. Win! And I like the scent, light and pleasant. Love it. I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> but I still needed conditioner.  I tried this without conditioner -- just to see how moisturizing it was.  I didn&#x27;t leave my hair dry or frizzy like many shampoos would, but I still needed conditioner and a little serum to keep everything under control.  It&#x27;s nice, though -- and I will definitely purchase it in the future, as I&#x27;m a fan of Pantene products.</li>
            <li> its so cheap that I cant image. good stuff. I have used once. I feel a little bit dry,coarse. I dont describe with my poor Chinglish.</li>
            <li> Pantene shampoos are some of my favorite. I regularly use this hydrating shampoo, as it keeps my hair from drying out.While it leaves my hair soft, it also keeps in manageable and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down so that I can style it the way I like.  This shampoo has a fresh floral and fruity scent. A great, reliable product.</li>
            <li> My family and I are big fans of Pantene products.  And this shampoo lives up to our expectations.  The scent is nice, but it is not overpowering.  It can be used by the men and the women in the house.  The shampoo lathers up and rinses out nicely, no need to use too much to get a good clean head of hair.  My daughters use this on shoulder length, thick hair and no conditioner is needed (at least not now that it is spring/early summer).  The price is perfect.  I love the flat lid, so that you can place it upside down in the shower and get to all the product.  It does help with frizz, even in the humid weather.  It&#x27;s a great product, especially for the price.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I stopped using hair color several months ago, and I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, lest it dry out completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, Pantene is an incredible brand, and this is a particularly nice variety of the shampoo. It makes my hair bouncy and fluffy and naturally enhances the curls. It also seems, despite the hydration, to prevent any oil buildup from taking hold in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not go so far as to say this is the best shampoo ever; I also very much like Tea Tree Oil shampoo, which also soothes a sensitive scalp. But that can be extremely expensive, and so when I can get Pantene at a reasonable price (or for free, as it is through Amazon Vine), I&#x27;m always happy to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> I love how silky my hair feels after using this shampoo. I feel like it coated every strand and even made tangles fall right out with a rinse. My comb had never gone more easily through my hair. The product dispenses nicely without any waste. It has a great consistency and a luxury feel. A great every day shampoo pick.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shampoo; it lathers nicely, doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable scent, and leaves my hair easy to comb out with no tangles.  It does take a little more rinsing  to get to the squeaky-clean stage than my usual clear shampoo, but it&#x27;s still fine.  The best part is the price:  Name brand shampoos are getting so expensive and this Pantene is still reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Makes my hair soft and manageable. I love Pantene and have never tried a product I didn&#x27;t adore.  This stuff smells good and lathers up nice.  But more importantly it rinses out easily and leaves my hair feeling clean and manageable and not dried out like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Pantene!!  Love you!</li>
            <li> I admit that I indulge my hair.  There, I said it.  I admit it.  Pantene products help me to continue to indulge it in its quest for shine and softness. This shampoo has a slight, faint but pleasant aroma.  It does not have a pungent smell which would be a drawback.  It is like a gym for your hair - it builds up strength and helps revitalize hair.  I love this shampoo and heartily recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indulge your hair with this.</li>
            <li> I had stopped using Pantene for a while and I had forgotten how good it really was.  From the moment I opened the box, the scent really impressed me.  I have shoulder length, color treated hair, so my hair can get really dry and brittle. Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V Daily Moisture Renewal Hydrating Shampoo lathers up very well and rinses out easily.  Followed up by conditioner, my hair looks lustrous and shiny and is easy to style.  If you aren&#x27;t using a professional or salon product, Pantene is a very good choice for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT-  12/1782015:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On further use of this product, it really has proven to be too heavy for my hair which tends to be thin.  It was great when I was experiencing overall dryness and damage, but now that I have restored my hair, this shampoo ends up making my hair look as if I haven&#x27;t washed it at all. Even easing off of the conditioner or eliminating it entirely the product is just too much.</li>
