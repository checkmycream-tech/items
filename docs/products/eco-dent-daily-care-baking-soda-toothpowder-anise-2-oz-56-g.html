            <li>Great product...</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s good about this stuff:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>My dentist gave this the seal of approval, and it tastes surprisingly good for a tooth powder.</li>
            <li>I loved this tooth powder until I read about the unsafe ingredients on the EWG SkinDeep website.</li>
            <li>It works exceptionally well with the sonicare toothbrush.  </li>

            <li>I love the product, it is lest agresive and leave a nice flavor of anis in my mouth.</li>
            <li>My wife loves to travel with this stuff, it fizzes your teeth clean, has a pleasant flavor, &amp; is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a suggestion that&#x27;s even better than gingermint:     </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love the anise flavor as well.</li>
            <li>I use this mostly for carry-on plane travel.</li>
            <li>Anise flavored is my favorite of the eco-dent toothpowder&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Love the toothpowder.  </li>
            <li>Love the sea salt taste and how it foams even better than store-bought toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Power is more hygienic than paste.  </li>
            <li>[I was at a party, used the bathroom, and like most bathrooms the toothbrushes were in plane sight--</li>
            <li>The two flavors of Eco-Dent that I USED to love were Anise and Cinnamon.</li>
            <li>This anise toothpaste powder cleans teeth in a refreshing way, is ecomical to use and easy to transport in my handbag.</li>
            <li>this powder gives you and is super handy for travel...</li>
            <li>so clean!</li>
            <li>This product is a great alternative to mainstream pastes and really seems to get my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>The aftertaste is really mild and nice, and my teeth look clean.</li>
            <li>Clean your teef, precious, or you&#x27;ll wind up looking like Golem and someone will throw your skinny ass into a volcano.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling of clean</li>
            <li>My mouth really feels clean and refreshed after using it and the taste is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>The service from the vendor was prompt, and the packaging was secure as well.</li>
            <li>Same great product we are used to.</li>
            <li>Talk about a good, natural product for your teeth.</li>
            <li>If you first add this anise toothpowder to wetted brush, then a dab of orange-mango toothpaste on top of the anise powder, I guarantee you, it will even surpass the now-defunct gingermint.</li>
            <li>It cleans well and leaves your breath fresh without chemicals!  </li>
            <li>Nice foaming action.  </li>
            <li>The anise flavoring was a bit strong at first</li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I personally love the Anise flavor (even though I am not generally a fan of licorice) - it&#x27;s just so refreshing.</li>
            <li>Strong taste of anise was just too much for me.</li>
            <li>As for a fellow Amazoner&#x27;s comments re: cinnamon &amp; lemon, my experience is otherwise, cuz Anise is my absolute favorite, followed by mint (which I don&#x27;t really like), followed by lemon (which was \\&quot;blah\\&quot;), followed by cinnamon (which for me was a no go).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to try something new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have replaced toothpaste with this toothpowder and it is rare for me to have any sensitivity issues with my teeth at all.</li>
            <li>well worth t he price.</li>
            <li>It is sure to become my favorite from now on, swiching to more serious toothpastes before going to bed like the perio-brite</li>
            <li>Very useful for clear correct or Invisaline braces to get them clean.</li>
            <li>Expensive for baking soda, however, it has a nice flavor and does a good cleaning job with out a bunch of fillers.</li>
            <li>but I wish they&#x27;d bring back the good old Anise.</li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying all the flavors too!  </li>
            <li>I order this all the time - much better price than I can find in our local health food store.</li>
            <li>After getting more and more conscious (and knowledgeable) about my health, it was a natural progression to give up on commercial tooth pastes.</li>
            <li>Tooth powder doesn&#x27;t foam like commercial toothpaste, but still leaves a very clean feeling on the teeth.</li>
            <li>This product is better for your teeth--no SUGAR/SWEETENERS (kind of an oxymoron brushing your teeth with sugar/sweet paste), you teeth is cleaned with less strokes reducing wear against your enamels, the anise helps keep breath fresh, no weird chemicals with names you can&#x27;t pronouce, and bottle could be reused for other purposes.  </li>
            <li>BTW, it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t love a different brand of lemon-lime mouthwash (which rocks), rather that, among these toothpowders, my only true preference among their flavors is EcoDent&#x27;s Anise flavored one.</li>
            <li>Have used this brand of toothpowder for a few years now and highly recommend it--my teeth &amp; gums are stronger and my mouth feels very healthy.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Thanks,</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>After using this the very first time, my sensitivity (which was major) went away and has never returned.  </li>
            <li>Have tried other baking soda toothpastes and was bowled over by the saltiness, but for some reason this tooth powder is a lot better for me.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought it after reading an article that suggested that regular toothpaste contributed to sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>All the other flavors are strong but the anise is my favorite for my taste buds; the cinnamon is my second favorite; the lime is too harsh for me.  </li>
            <li>-it&#x27;s way better than out of the box, but most people, house guests, find it strange and icky.</li>
            <li>Of course, first be sure you are a lover of the anise flavor, which common sense dictates..    </li>
            <li>I love how clean my mouth feels at first after brushing, but the fresh feeling goes away more quickly than I&#x27;d like (a few hours or less)  &amp; my teeth feel dirty again, even if I don&#x27;t eat or drink anything but water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and will last for really long.</li>
            <li>No messy tube, either!</li>
            <li>At the end love it, it is clean to use, I don&#x27;t have any more a mess in the bathroom because the past past.</li>
            <li>Because this product doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride, it shouldn&#x27;t be used for every brushing, but maybe half the time if you use this product, your teeth will be so much brighter, you&#x27;ll be AMAZED!!!  </li>
            <li>I use to brush my teeth with toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Yea, I know, most people could care less, but I was curious what was in it, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different than the normal &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; flavors.</li>
            <li>I want to say I love it and give it 5 stars but unfortunately, I have sensitive teeth and alternate between this and Sensodyne.</li>
            <li>For such a small size, you&#x27;d expect they&#x27;d get it right, perhaps give the customer 2.1 oz instead of 1.9 or 1.8.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Personally, I hate the taste of menthol -- it completely masks the pleasant anise flavor -- and menthol doesn&#x27;t like me, either.</li>

            <li> I alternate with other pastes and powders so it does not get old.</li>
            <li> Use it properly: wet brush and sprinkle the tooth powder on brush head, after your first run over teeth, sip a little water keep in mouth and continue brushing.  </li>
            <li> Seems pricey but goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of toothpowder but found them to be gritty and/or clumpy--Eco-Dent is not.  </li>
            <li> With such a small size, a little bit wasted means this doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus I noticed that my son doesn&#x27;t have those dry spots on the corner of his mouth since using this product!</li>
            <li> Now if only I can find that black licorice ice cream I had all those years ago......</li>
            <li> This little container goes a long long way.</li>
            <li> another minus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
            <li> and when you&#x27;re sick after each use--you can&#x27;t be healthy by putting a dirty germ filled toothbrush into your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I later heard people in that family were getting sick left and right--</li>
            <li> I usually get it from the local health food store, but it&#x27;s no longer on my way anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Very small container, barely 2 oz.</li>
            <li> The typical toothpaste today gives me a stomach ache.  </li>
            <li> Maybe less than that stated weight.</li>
            <li> As you&#x27;d expect, this means close to half of the powder ends up on the floor or in the sink, rather than on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The negative points are all minor.</li>
            <li> I weighed it on the scale and it registered as being a little less than 2 oz.</li>
            <li> If they made this so you could dip your toothbrush in it (like some &amp;#34;Monkey&amp;#34; brand jet black tooth powder I also tried for the novelty), less would be wasted.</li>
            <li> I did share my little H2O2 tip with the family, who knows if they took my advice.</li>
            <li> In the beging the salty flavor surprised me and the Anis flavor was a little weird.</li>
            <li> in adition I can see that there will be lest waste of product.</li>
            <li> Kind of nasty.</li>
            <li> but after a few days, I got to have my Sensodyne on hands.</li>
            <li> PEOPLE use common sense--disinfect your toothbrush so you don&#x27;t infect yourself!  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Because this product doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride, it shouldn&#x27;t be used for every brushing, but maybe half the time if you use this product, your teeth will be so much brighter, you&#x27;ll be AMAZED!!!  Can tell difference after only using once.  Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a suggestion that&#x27;s even better than gingermint:     If you first add this anise toothpowder to wetted brush, then a dab of orange-mango toothpaste on top of the anise powder, I guarantee you, it will even surpass the now-defunct gingermint. So if any of y&#x27;all miss gingermint, give my described combo a try. You won&#x27;t be sorry! Of course, first be sure you are a lover of the anise flavor, which common sense dictates..    As for a fellow Amazoner&#x27;s comments re: cinnamon &amp; lemon, my experience is otherwise, cuz Anise is my absolute favorite, followed by mint (which I don&#x27;t really like), followed by lemon (which was \\&quot;blah\\&quot;), followed by cinnamon (which for me was a no go). BTW, it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t love a different brand of lemon-lime mouthwash (which rocks), rather that, among these toothpowders, my only true preference among their flavors is EcoDent&#x27;s Anise flavored one.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff.  I usually get it from the local health food store, but it&#x27;s no longer on my way anywhere.  Thanks for carrying all the flavors too!  The typical toothpaste today gives me a stomach ache.  This just cleans my teeth.  It works exceptionally well with the sonicare toothbrush.  I must add I&#x27;ve been brushing with baking soda since childhood-it&#x27;s way better than out of the box, but most people, house guests, find it strange and icky.</li>
            <li> After getting more and more conscious (and knowledgeable) about my health, it was a natural progression to give up on commercial tooth pastes. I found this powder excellent. I love the anise flavor as well. It&#x27;s easy to use and will last for really long.</li>
            <li> In homeopathy mint is considered a very potent medicine not to be abused. Toothpastes with mint are too harsh for me, amost hurting my gum if I put a dash too much. This anise toothpaste powder cleans teeth in a refreshing way, is ecomical to use and easy to transport in my handbag. It is sure to become my favorite from now on, swiching to more serious toothpastes before going to bed like the perio-brite so my gum are well taken care of.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly for carry-on plane travel. I like the sensation it gives, and the feel of my mouth afterwards. Seems pricey but goes a long way. I am commenting on the anise flavored version.</li>
            <li> Clean your teef, precious, or you&#x27;ll wind up looking like Golem and someone will throw your skinny ass into a volcano.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and leaves your breath fresh without chemicals!  Plus I noticed that my son doesn&#x27;t have those dry spots on the corner of his mouth since using this product!</li>
            <li> The anise flavoring was a bit strong at first but now I&#x27;m used to it. I alternate with other pastes and powders so it does not get old. This product is a great alternative to mainstream pastes and really seems to get my teeth clean. I would definitely recommend this product. Just remember to alternate as the flavor is distinctive.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s good about this stuff:&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s different than the normal &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; flavors. I&#x27;ve never seen licorice/anise flavored toothpaste before. It&#x27;s fun to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;2) It bubbles. As the powder mixes in your mouth, it foams and bubbles. If you remember the candy &amp;#34;Zotz&amp;#34;, it foams up like that stuff did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not so good:&lt;br /&gt;1) Very small container, barely 2 oz. Maybe less than that stated weight. I weighed it on the scale and it registered as being a little less than 2 oz. For such a small size, you&#x27;d expect they&#x27;d get it right, perhaps give the customer 2.1 oz instead of 1.9 or 1.8.&lt;br /&gt;2) The powder gets squeezed through the hole in the cap, like talcum powder, onto your toothbrush . As you&#x27;d expect, this means close to half of the powder ends up on the floor or in the sink, rather than on the toothbrush. If they made this so you could dip your toothbrush in it (like some &amp;#34;Monkey&amp;#34; brand jet black tooth powder I also tried for the novelty), less would be wasted. With such a small size, a little bit wasted means this doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;3) Might be only my package, but someone had stuck a gummy label over the regular label, so I couldn&#x27;t read all about the product. Yea, I know, most people could care less, but I was curious what was in it, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this item. The negative points are all minor. Now if only I can find that black licorice ice cream I had all those years ago......</li>
            <li> Expensive for baking soda, however, it has a nice flavor and does a good cleaning job with out a bunch of fillers.</li>
            <li> I love the product, it is lest agresive and leave a nice flavor of anis in my mouth. In the beging the salty flavor surprised me and the Anis flavor was a little weird. At the end love it, it is clean to use, I don&#x27;t have any more a mess in the bathroom because the past past. I am learning too that I will be avaible to carry it easirly in my pocket when I travel, in adition I can see that there will be lest waste of product. I think this is a very good ecologic alternative for the cleaning of my tooth.</li>
            <li> Have used this brand of toothpowder for a few years now and highly recommend it--my teeth &amp; gums are stronger and my mouth feels very healthy. I use to brush my teeth with toothpaste for sensitive teeth. I have replaced toothpaste with this toothpowder and it is rare for me to have any sensitivity issues with my teeth at all. I&#x27;ve tried other brands of toothpowder but found them to be gritty and/or clumpy--Eco-Dent is not.  Anise flavored is my favorite of the eco-dent toothpowder&#x27;s. I also do a daily coconut oil pull in the morning before i brush my teeth and this has also added to strengthening my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Love the toothpowder.  Thank you!  Great transaction!</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling so clean and fresh. Love the sea salt taste and how it foams even better than store-bought toothpaste. Best of all-fluoride free! :D</li>
            <li> Talk about a good, natural product for your teeth. My dentist gave this the seal of approval, and it tastes surprisingly good for a tooth powder. I wish they had a version with flouride.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now.  I originally bought it after reading an article that suggested that regular toothpaste contributed to sensitivity.  After using this the very first time, my sensitivity (which was major) went away and has never returned.  EcoDent Toothpowder works in a way that allows re-mineralization of the tooth.  My teeth feel as if I&#x27;ve been to the dentist for cleaning on an every day basis.  The product is inexpensive and lasts for months.  I could not be happier!</li>
            <li> This product is great for those of us who don&#x27;t like mint. The taste is pleasant and refreshing. Tooth powder doesn&#x27;t foam like commercial toothpaste, but still leaves a very clean feeling on the teeth. No messy tube, either!</li>
            <li> Power is more hygienic than paste.  All the other flavors are strong but the anise is my favorite for my taste buds; the cinnamon is my second favorite; the lime is too harsh for me.  Use it properly: wet brush and sprinkle the tooth powder on brush head, after your first run over teeth, sip a little water keep in mouth and continue brushing.  This product is better for your teeth--no SUGAR/SWEETENERS (kind of an oxymoron brushing your teeth with sugar/sweet paste), you teeth is cleaned with less strokes reducing wear against your enamels, the anise helps keep breath fresh, no weird chemicals with names you can&#x27;t pronouce, and bottle could be reused for other purposes.  I recommend using finer tooth brushes with this product.  (Please disinfect your toothbrush by soaking it in H2O2 (hydrogenperoxide) once a month and when you&#x27;re sick after each use--you can&#x27;t be healthy by putting a dirty germ filled toothbrush into your mouth.  [I was at a party, used the bathroom, and like most bathrooms the toothbrushes were in plane sight--OGM, there were fungus and various color of moles growing on the family toothbrushes--WTF--PLEASE PEOPLE use common sense--disinfect your toothbrush so you don&#x27;t infect yourself!  I later heard people in that family were getting sick left and right--gee I wonder why.  I did share my little H2O2 tip with the family, who knows if they took my advice.</li>
            <li> I order this all the time - much better price than I can find in our local health food store. I personally love the Anise flavor (even though I am not generally a fan of licorice) - it&#x27;s just so refreshing. The service from the vendor was prompt, and the packaging was secure as well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I loved this tooth powder until I read about the unsafe ingredients on the EWG SkinDeep website. I&#x27;m currently using Solay tooth powders, which are somewhat salty for my tastes, but I like to know that the salt is \\&quot;\\&quot;rë-mineralizing\\&quot; my teeth. I am getting used to it. I also use Miessence toothpaste from Australia, which is salty but yummy, too.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  This is my second order.  My mouth really feels clean and refreshed after using it and the taste is pleasant.  Will keep buying.  This little container goes a long long way.</li>
            <li> Some may like it but it&#x27;s definitely not for me. Strong taste of anise was just too much for me. Kind of nasty.</li>
            <li> Same great product we are used to.</li>
            <li> My wife loves to travel with this stuff, it fizzes your teeth clean, has a pleasant flavor, &amp; is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The two flavors of Eco-Dent that I USED to love were Anise and Cinnamon. Then, for reasons I don&#x27;t understand, the manufacturer decided to \\&quot;improve\\&quot; them by adding menthol. Personally, I hate the taste of menthol -- it completely masks the pleasant anise flavor -- and menthol doesn&#x27;t like me, either. It&#x27;s an irritant that makes my eyes water and my nose run, even from the tiny amount sprinkled on a toothbrush. Anyone using homeopathics needs to avoid mint/menthol: another minus. So, now I buy the weird-tasting \\&quot;lemon-lime\\&quot; but I wish they&#x27;d bring back the good old Anise.</li>
            <li> I love how clean my mouth feels at first after brushing, but the fresh feeling goes away more quickly than I&#x27;d like (a few hours or less)  &amp; my teeth feel dirty again, even if I don&#x27;t eat or drink anything but water.</li>
            <li> I want to say I love it and give it 5 stars but unfortunately, I have sensitive teeth and alternate between this and Sensodyne. I love the feeling of clean this powder gives you and is super handy for travel...flavor is awsome too...but after a few days, I got to have my Sensodyne on hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected. It does the job of cleaning teeth with knowing that it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride in it.</li>
            <li> Great taste, excellent product. Mouth feels so clean!......I will buy it again! Thanks, Amazon!......Rich Bessom.</li>
            <li> Great product...we keep reordering.</li>
            <li> Works really well. well worth t he price.</li>
