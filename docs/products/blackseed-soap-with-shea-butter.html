            <li> It works well for dry skin</li>
            <li> This Black Seed Soap is controlling my husband&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> I use this morning and night, along with Black Seed Cream, and the lines in my face are drastically smoothed...</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and exfoliates with the little scrubbing beads.</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m allergic to anything with fragrance, but not this.  </li>
