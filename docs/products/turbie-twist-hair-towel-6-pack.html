            <li>I was so happy to find these on Amazon for a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>but I think it would have been nice to have two of each color...</li>
            <li>They are getting kind of worn by now</li>
            <li>I use these all the time, and it&#x27;s nice to have a bunch</li>
            <li>My Turbie Twist Hair Towel 6 Pack arrived early and in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;There was a nice variety of color</li>
            <li>Turbie Twist is by far the greatest.</li>
            <li>A must have for a family full of girls!!</li>
            <li>My first Turbie Twist was great...</li>
            <li>I got the 6 pack because I figured that she would need more than one.</li>
            <li>Company needs to better inspect the product.    </li>
            <li>I love, love, love these.</li>
            <li>It is made up of a towel like material with an elastic bow at the top to twist the towel into.</li>
            <li>But it is not as lovely as it sounds.</li>
            <li>Have been using these for years - needed more for self and a gift.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I hope this helps! :)</li>
            <li>I love it because it&#x27;s not bulky</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok substitute.</li>
            <li>I just love Turbie Twist Hair Towels.  </li>
            <li>I have used these for years and got more to replace my oldies; also gave them to my friends for Christmas</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than trying to use a bath towel around your head.</li>
            <li>to do love it</li>
            <li>I also wish they had more absorbancy and thickness.  </li>
            <li>Was just thinking it might be time to get more of them.  </li>
            <li>and I could find myself a better deal, and found this set of 6.  </li>
            <li>I just love these.  </li>
            <li>All the ladies in my house love these.</li>
            <li>I really love them...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these towels.</li>
            <li>My mom and sister love theirs.  </li>
            <li>and now I wish I had ordered more *Grin*</li>
            <li>These were popular when they originally came out</li>
            <li>The original one from the store is super light and absorbs the water out of my hair after the shower, this one not so great.  </li>
            <li>I bought a two pack of turbo twists in a store and loved them so much I came on Amazon to buy more.</li>
            <li>And the pull-through loop does make it more secure...</li>
            <li>It just seems more of a cheap towel material to me</li>
            <li>Just perfect for a wet head.</li>
            <li>I have one of the original Turbie Twists, and I love it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to use, &amp; launder easily.   </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use and it stays in place.</li>
            <li>and I strongly recommend you don&#x27;t purchase it.</li>
            <li>she says the elastic band that the towel tucks in to while on your head is strong and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>The new ones are not as good.</li>
            <li>Those colors are fine</li>
            <li>I wish that this product had a button and hook closure instead of a fabric loop, but it works fine.</li>
            <li>Rather, they are a cheap, scratchy terry that is not ultra absorbent.</li>
            <li>so I decided to but several from Amazon at a great price.  </li>
            <li>I loathe heavy towels around my hair so this is perfect.</li>
            <li>i love how much more comfortable this is than a real (large, bulky) towel on my head, but it doesn&#x27;t do much to absorb moisture.</li>
            <li>I love the turbie twist it works great on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair less bulky then a towel.</li>
            <li>I love my Turbie Twist (which is why I&#x27;m getting ready to buy the six pack!)</li>
            <li>I prefer the Original Turbie Twist made of terry cloth not micro fiber</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the original Turbie Twist as advertised and shown don&#x27;t order these.  </li>
            <li>I purposely bought this brand because i loved the one I had and assumed being the same TT</li>
            <li>I bought the true \\&quot;original\\</li>
            <li>I love these so much, I gave them to my mother and girlfriends.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these at a local store and loved it, however, it was taken from our hotel bathroom with the towels.  </li>
            <li>These towels are soft and plushy, combine that with their super absorbance and nice array of colors</li>
            <li>I was looking for the original regular terry cloth purchased years ago but very pleased woth these.</li>
            <li>They are great to use instead of a large towel daily!</li>
            <li>I love these things and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>The colors I received were very pretty.  </li>
            <li>My first one had stood up to daily use for a good 3 years, I was pleased, so I decided to go buy a new pack.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lite weight and doesn&#x27;t slip off which makes it easy to do anything until you&#x27;re ready to fix your hair.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy for her to use and not too much towel for her hair.  </li>
            <li>The Turbie Twist does a great job of absorbing the water from my hair and I love that it is relatively small -so</li>
            <li>Bought this six pack, should last her for many years!</li>
            <li>They are well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to mend them when they fray right along the seams and leave holes, or the elastic pops off.  </li>
            <li>the right size and design to stay on my head</li>
            <li>I have yet to use one of these new turbies as my current one is still in good shape</li>
            <li>And as for the elastic band...after about 1 year&#x27;s use, it&#x27;s already more stretched out than my original was after 3.  </li>
            <li>They are super absorbant and stay in place until you are ready to style your hair.  </li>
            <li>The new ones (and I made the mistake of buying a six-pack) are nothing like the original, even though they say &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; on the package.</li>
            <li>I have used Turbie Twist since the first came out on the market.</li>
            <li>I had another hair-towel prior to buying these, by Scunci, and it was MUCH better.  </li>
            <li>and you have a winner in my book!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re great for short, medium, and long hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love anything that makes my laundry loads smaller!</li>
            <li>Since I had ordered several items together and received free Super Saver Shipping, this package did come in a bigger box with more items.  </li>
            <li>They are super absorbent, comfortable and you don&#x27;t have to balance a giant towel on your head anymore.  </li>
            <li>at the same time, absorbs a good bit of the water from your hair, depending on how long you use it!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Long hair has to be doubled over to fit into the towel, which does the trick but is then harder for kids to use on their own.  </li>
            <li>These *used to be* a really great product, but now they&#x27;re very, VERY low quality and a waste of money.</li>
            <li>Ordered and was surprised at how much water these absorbed.</li>
            <li>Only problem I have with it is that of the six, 3 are a bright pink, and</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Absorbs very well.</li>
            <li>Did not notice until ready to use product.    </li>
            <li>I keep it on for when I&#x27;m getting dressed and putting makeup on which helps a lot of you want to get ready in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves these things.</li>
            <li>Who wants to buy something that&#x27;s</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s super-lightweight, very absorbent, and dries like a champ (besides being the softest travel towel I&#x27;ve found).  </li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready for blow drying.</li>
            <li>This is a must-have for all women it really works</li>
            <li>I like that they fit my head and don&#x27;t make my neck feel so weighted like a giant bath towel</li>
            <li>I have had these before and used them so much , that I wre them out.</li>
            <li>I already have some and ordered more as i use them after every shower, keeps my clothes from getting wet, while it dries my hair</li>
            <li>Bring the original back please!</li>
            <li>I had went to a local drugstore and purchased the original turbie</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for someone who has thinner hair because I&#x27;m sure they would have to wear it for half the time i would have to wear it</li>
            <li>the older one did.  </li>
            <li>It could be my imagination, but I remember my older towel being longer.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my wife, and the material is not as sturdy as the original, and they are not as long.  </li>
            <li>My daughter says that it is great for hotel stays, and now there is no more water all over their bathroom floor from their long hair!  </li>
            <li>My hair goes down my back about mid way, &amp; the Turbie Twist Hair Towels do a great job at drying my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Turbie Twists are particularly handy if the weight of big towels makes your neck sore or if you&#x27;re looking to cut down on laundry volume because of their sleek and efficient design.</li>
            <li>Have had some for 10+ years and wanted new ones.</li>
            <li>and I had to get some new ones.  </li>
            <li>The terry fabric of the first towel began literally, from the very first use, to unravel along the seam that joins the 2 pieces of fabric, and after just 1 week nearly half of the towel had unraveled</li>
            <li>The Turbie Twist is supposed to dry you hair quickly and conveniently.</li>
            <li>The fabric is plush and, I think, not as absorbent, the head part is longer and has to be turned up to fit, and the &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34; is so short it constantly comes undone.</li>
            <li>Only the real thing works for me!</li>
            <li>I bought my first Turbie Twists back in 2004.  </li>
            <li>&quot; turbie twists back when they first came out years ago.</li>
            <li>(Also because I frequently leave them places or give them to friends!)</li>
            <li>They are not the ultra thin, velvety soft microfiber that is so light weight and more absorbent than a regular bath towel.</li>
            <li>My daughter wore her old Turbie Twist Towels out - so I bought her a new 6-pack.&lt;br /&gt;She loves them.</li>
            <li>Useful product, but not recommended for very long hair.  </li>
            <li>But as an adult, I find it&#x27;s still plenty of towel for my head, too.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not wearing that, then I was hooked and I completely wore them out.</li>
            <li>First, the Turbie Twist doesn&#x27;t even dry your hair.</li>
            <li>Also - if your hair is semi-long (like mid back length), it will be too long to fit into the towel.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my wife because some of the older ones she had were starting to wear out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for someone who has arthritis or is running short on time in the morning.</li>
            <li>I like to put it on after my shower and let it dry a bit while I get ready.</li>
            <li>and I can move around and do whatever I want until I am ready to take it off and dry and style my hair.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s less bulky than a normal towel (and is much lighter to pack in a suitcase).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using the turbie twist and so far I do like what I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
            <li>As far as the actual towels...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty average product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Keeps wet hair out of the way, until you are ready to style it,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>It is pretty much instantly saturated once it hits wet hair, and it *</li>
            <li>the turbie twists are so useful and take up much less room than a towel!</li>
            <li>These towels are thick, sturdy, large and very absorbent.</li>
            <li>I use it on my 5 year old and it stays without pulling, but is still big enough for me to use.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to wrap one of these around my wet hair than to just use a regular towel,</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am not very fond of that particular color.</li>

            <li> I really love them...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these towels.</li>
            <li> My mom and sister love theirs.  </li>
            <li> and now I wish I had ordered more *Grin*</li>
            <li> These were popular when they originally came out</li>
            <li> The original one from the store is super light and absorbs the water out of my hair after the shower, this one not so great.  </li>
            <li> I bought a two pack of turbo twists in a store and loved them so much I came on Amazon to buy more.</li>
            <li> And the pull-through loop does make it more secure...</li>
            <li> It just seems more of a cheap towel material to me</li>
            <li> Just perfect for a wet head.</li>
            <li> I have one of the original Turbie Twists, and I love it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to use, &amp; launder easily.   </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to use and it stays in place.</li>
            <li> and I strongly recommend you don&#x27;t purchase it.</li>
            <li> she says the elastic band that the towel tucks in to while on your head is strong and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> The new ones are not as good.</li>
            <li> Those colors are fine</li>
            <li> I wish that this product had a button and hook closure instead of a fabric loop, but it works fine.</li>
            <li> Rather, they are a cheap, scratchy terry that is not ultra absorbent.</li>
            <li> so I decided to but several from Amazon at a great price.  </li>
            <li> I loathe heavy towels around my hair so this is perfect.</li>
            <li> i love how much more comfortable this is than a real (large, bulky) towel on my head, but it doesn&#x27;t do much to absorb moisture.</li>
            <li> I love the turbie twist it works great on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair less bulky then a towel.</li>
            <li> I love my Turbie Twist (which is why I&#x27;m getting ready to buy the six pack!)</li>
            <li> I prefer the Original Turbie Twist made of terry cloth not micro fiber</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the original Turbie Twist as advertised and shown don&#x27;t order these.  </li>
            <li> I purposely bought this brand because i loved the one I had and assumed being the same TT</li>
            <li> I bought the true \\&quot;original\\</li>
            <li> I love these so much, I gave them to my mother and girlfriends.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these at a local store and loved it, however, it was taken from our hotel bathroom with the towels.  </li>
            <li> These towels are soft and plushy, combine that with their super absorbance and nice array of colors</li>
            <li> I was looking for the original regular terry cloth purchased years ago but very pleased woth these.</li>
            <li> They are great to use instead of a large towel daily!</li>
            <li> I love these things and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> The colors I received were very pretty.  </li>
            <li> My first one had stood up to daily use for a good 3 years, I was pleased, so I decided to go buy a new pack.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lite weight and doesn&#x27;t slip off which makes it easy to do anything until you&#x27;re ready to fix your hair.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy for her to use and not too much towel for her hair.  </li>
            <li> The Turbie Twist does a great job of absorbing the water from my hair and I love that it is relatively small -so</li>
            <li> Bought this six pack, should last her for many years!</li>
            <li> They are well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to mend them when they fray right along the seams and leave holes, or the elastic pops off.  </li>
            <li> the right size and design to stay on my head</li>
            <li> I have yet to use one of these new turbies as my current one is still in good shape</li>
            <li> And as for the elastic band...after about 1 year&#x27;s use, it&#x27;s already more stretched out than my original was after 3.  </li>
            <li> They are super absorbant and stay in place until you are ready to style your hair.  </li>
            <li> The new ones (and I made the mistake of buying a six-pack) are nothing like the original, even though they say &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; on the package.</li>
            <li> I have used Turbie Twist since the first came out on the market.</li>
            <li> I had another hair-towel prior to buying these, by Scunci, and it was MUCH better.  </li>
            <li> and you have a winner in my book!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re great for short, medium, and long hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love anything that makes my laundry loads smaller!</li>
            <li> Since I had ordered several items together and received free Super Saver Shipping, this package did come in a bigger box with more items.  </li>
            <li> They are super absorbent, comfortable and you don&#x27;t have to balance a giant towel on your head anymore.  </li>
            <li> at the same time, absorbs a good bit of the water from your hair, depending on how long you use it!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Long hair has to be doubled over to fit into the towel, which does the trick but is then harder for kids to use on their own.  </li>
            <li> These *used to be* a really great product, but now they&#x27;re very, VERY low quality and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Ordered and was surprised at how much water these absorbed.</li>
            <li> Only problem I have with it is that of the six, 3 are a bright pink, and</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> Did not notice until ready to use product.    </li>
            <li> I keep it on for when I&#x27;m getting dressed and putting makeup on which helps a lot of you want to get ready in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves these things.</li>
            <li> Who wants to buy something that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s super-lightweight, very absorbent, and dries like a champ (besides being the softest travel towel I&#x27;ve found).  </li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready for blow drying.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have for all women it really works</li>
            <li> I like that they fit my head and don&#x27;t make my neck feel so weighted like a giant bath towel</li>
            <li> I have had these before and used them so much , that I wre them out.</li>
            <li> I already have some and ordered more as i use them after every shower, keeps my clothes from getting wet, while it dries my hair</li>
            <li> Bring the original back please!</li>
            <li> I had went to a local drugstore and purchased the original turbie</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for someone who has thinner hair because I&#x27;m sure they would have to wear it for half the time i would have to wear it</li>
            <li> the older one did.  </li>
            <li> It could be my imagination, but I remember my older towel being longer.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife, and the material is not as sturdy as the original, and they are not as long.  </li>
            <li> My daughter says that it is great for hotel stays, and now there is no more water all over their bathroom floor from their long hair!  </li>
            <li> My hair goes down my back about mid way, &amp; the Turbie Twist Hair Towels do a great job at drying my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Turbie Twists are particularly handy if the weight of big towels makes your neck sore or if you&#x27;re looking to cut down on laundry volume because of their sleek and efficient design.</li>
            <li> Have had some for 10+ years and wanted new ones.</li>
            <li> and I had to get some new ones.  </li>
            <li> The terry fabric of the first towel began literally, from the very first use, to unravel along the seam that joins the 2 pieces of fabric, and after just 1 week nearly half of the towel had unraveled</li>
            <li> The Turbie Twist is supposed to dry you hair quickly and conveniently.</li>
            <li> The fabric is plush and, I think, not as absorbent, the head part is longer and has to be turned up to fit, and the &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34; is so short it constantly comes undone.</li>
            <li> Only the real thing works for me!</li>
            <li> I bought my first Turbie Twists back in 2004.  </li>
            <li> &quot; turbie twists back when they first came out years ago.</li>
            <li> (Also because I frequently leave them places or give them to friends!)</li>
            <li> They are not the ultra thin, velvety soft microfiber that is so light weight and more absorbent than a regular bath towel.</li>
            <li> My daughter wore her old Turbie Twist Towels out - so I bought her a new 6-pack.&lt;br /&gt;She loves them.</li>
            <li> Useful product, but not recommended for very long hair.  </li>
            <li> But as an adult, I find it&#x27;s still plenty of towel for my head, too.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not wearing that, then I was hooked and I completely wore them out.</li>
            <li> First, the Turbie Twist doesn&#x27;t even dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Also - if your hair is semi-long (like mid back length), it will be too long to fit into the towel.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife because some of the older ones she had were starting to wear out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for someone who has arthritis or is running short on time in the morning.</li>
            <li> I like to put it on after my shower and let it dry a bit while I get ready.</li>
            <li> and I can move around and do whatever I want until I am ready to take it off and dry and style my hair.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s less bulky than a normal towel (and is much lighter to pack in a suitcase).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using the turbie twist and so far I do like what I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
            <li> As far as the actual towels...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty average product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Keeps wet hair out of the way, until you are ready to style it,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> It is pretty much instantly saturated once it hits wet hair, and it *</li>
            <li> the turbie twists are so useful and take up much less room than a towel!</li>
            <li> These towels are thick, sturdy, large and very absorbent.</li>
            <li> I use it on my 5 year old and it stays without pulling, but is still big enough for me to use.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to wrap one of these around my wet hair than to just use a regular towel,</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am not very fond of that particular color.</li>
            <li> material is a soft, thick terry, feels very luxurious</li>
            <li> I cannot twist the towel very tightly, so maybe that&#x27;s why it does not remove much moisture??  </li>
            <li> My hair definitely takes longer to dry after using this than it does after wrapping my head in a regular towel.</li>
            <li> Each towel was individually wrapped in plastic but the complete package was a mess.  </li>
            <li> They are much easier on her neck than having a big, heavy, wet towel on her head.</li>
            <li> It comes in various colors such as white and pink.</li>
            <li> others but they are even smaller and not nearly as absorbent as they claim.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absorbent, it fits my head, and it&#x27;s long enough to wind around my hair and tuck in the end.</li>
            <li> I always had trouble making a normal sized towel stay on my head after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty thick towel, so</li>
            <li> I wish they made these in extra long for long hair.  </li>
            <li> Hair that is longer than mid-back will be too long for the towel.  </li>
            <li> Mine is getting almost too long.  </li>
            <li> It also takes a VERY long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> She loves them, and uses them every night to dry her hair.  </li>
            <li> and it holds all of it and gets it quite dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, despite what the packaging implies, they&#x27;re not going to exactly dry your hair for you.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair the way it says.</li>
            <li> It pulls your hair back so tight that you feel like it&#x27;s going to rip your hair off.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s roughly 30-45 min.</li>
            <li> but thankfully they were not ALL pink.  </li>
            <li> The brad could not keep the envelope closed and it was ripped in some places.  </li>
            <li> It twists and holds in your hair well, but it&#x27;s not very absorbant.  </li>
            <li> When I remove it, my hair still seems quite wet.  </li>
            <li> I had one for a few years and it finally wore out</li>
            <li> It was too big and too heavy and would continually fall off.  </li>
            <li> If you use a regular towel it always falls off or is heavy on your head.  </li>
            <li> There were three pink, two white, and one green.  </li>
            <li> just thick enough without being too thick, and it really stayed put.    </li>
            <li> But then late last year the elastic band that holds the towel in place on the crown of your head started getting really stretched out.  </li>
            <li> so I can still style without the drips, heavy towel falling everywhere and long time with the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> so I will review other topics.  </li>
            <li> ...kept one towel for myself, gave the other to a friend.  </li>
            <li> With a regular towel, the weight of the back is what keeps it on your head, but with Turbie Twists you simply slide the much smaller, lighter twist into the rubber band loop at the base of your neck and it stays put as long as you need -- through getting dressed or doing your makeup!&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I ordered in the late evening and one day passed, then the next day I received it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to dirty a whole towel to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> It took less than 2 days from placing the order to having the product.  </li>
            <li> less space in the laundry.</li>
            <li> (These were problems with previous towels.)  </li>
            <li> Then I just have to blowdry my hair a little.</li>
            <li> Catches on rings etc &amp;strongly disliked.</li>
            <li> Have worn a few out and purchased another brand before and there is just no comparison.</li>
            <li> The material is so thin that it can soak up only some of the water from your hair after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> and it was, needless to say, completely unusable.  </li>
            <li> I am still using the second one, though I&#x27;m not happy with it.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely not more absorbent than your average towel.  </li>
            <li> I bought these to have a few on hand for vacations after a swim, and around the house.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me a few of these years ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that will mean anything in the long run</li>
            <li> Lastly, the Turbie Twist is extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a towel to wrap your head, I suggest the Eagle Creek travel towel instead (in sizes from Small to XL).  </li>
            <li> I purchased these for a friend of mine who wanted to give them as small Christmas gifts.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly thick and wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li> I have waist length thick hair</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thick, absorbent, stay in place, and for the money, can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Not sure how I ever lived without my turbie twist!</li>
            <li> No more bulky towels that just fall off your head and a lot less laundry!!!!</li>
            <li> , maybe they were from a bad batch or something, because the last thing I&#x27;d call these is thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> iIwas disappointed in these because I did not like the fabric....not enough absorbency.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally I was disappointed to receive 3 white towels in the 6pack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing a couple of reviews talking about how thin these towels are, and I don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> I have purchased some that were flimsy, thin and didn&#x27;t absorb water well.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the new turbie twists.  </li>
            <li> They cannot keep her hair twisted up.  </li>
            <li> The fabric is very thin.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t break, it just got to be in really bad shape.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

            <li> My daughter tried micro-fiber. Catches on rings etc &amp;strongly disliked. Since we could not find 100% cotton locally, I ordered several &amp; gave them to friends. Would have never tried this product wo daughter&#x27;s gift.</li>
            <li> Did as excellent as I knew it would. Have had some for 10+ years and wanted new ones. All cotton ones are the best. Thanks</li>
            <li> Got these for my wife.  She loves them, and uses them every night to dry her hair.  A good value with 6 of them.  Good quality towel material.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mother for her birthday. I got the 6 pack because I figured that she would need more than one. To my surprise, she only needed 3. They wash easily and are very good at what they advertise. My mother was certainly happy. It&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> This product is great for all ages. I use it on my 5 year old and it stays without pulling, but is still big enough for me to use. Absorbs very well. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I never knew I needed something like this until I tried one.  Now I even take them traveling for the convenience.</li>
            <li> Received the product within specified ship date timeline.  However, three of six items were ripped.  Did not notice until ready to use product.    Company needs to better inspect the product.    No refund or exchange has been requested yet.</li>
            <li> These were popular when they originally came out and I&#x27;ve always loved them.  The turban is very effective to adults and kids alike.  My granddaughter loves to have her hair wrapped up after her shower because she likes looking glamorous.  My daughter even used a twistie turban recently during a 48 hour EEG to hold the the cap of electrodes up on her head.  I love, love, love these.</li>
            <li> The Turbie Twist is great.  No more bulky towels that just fall off your head and a lot less laundry!!!! A must have for a family full of girls!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using the turbie twist and so far I do like what I&#x27;m seeing. I have fairly thick and wavy/curly hair and this helps get a lot of water out of my hair. I keep it on for when I&#x27;m getting dressed and putting makeup on which helps a lot of you want to get ready in a hurry.  I would recommend it for someone who has thinner hair because I&#x27;m sure they would have to wear it for half the time i would have to wear it and that&#x27;s roughly 30-45 min.</li>
            <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s lite weight and doesn&#x27;t slip off which makes it easy to do anything until you&#x27;re ready to fix your hair.  Gave one to each of our five daughters.</li>
            <li> I have waist length thick hair and it holds all of it and gets it quite dry.  Just damp enough for the rest of my routine.  I bought six to give as gifts to my daughters and granddaughter.</li>
            <li> I have used Turbie Twist since the first came out on the market. Have worn a few out and purchased another brand before and there is just no comparison. Only the real thing works for me!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife because some of the older ones she had were starting to wear out. She absolutely loves these things. They are much easier on her neck than having a big, heavy, wet towel on her head. Plus, they twist and lock into place with such ease, every time.     Good product, good price. Product is as described.</li>
            <li> Who wants to buy something that&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t even work? The Turbie Twist is supposed to dry you hair quickly and conveniently. It is made up of a towel like material with an elastic bow at the top to twist the towel into. It comes in various colors such as white and pink. But it is not as lovely as it sounds. First, the Turbie Twist doesn&#x27;t even dry your hair. The material is so thin that it can soak up only some of the water from your hair after taking a shower. Second, you can forget walking around while wearing the Turbie Twist. It slides if you your head when you just staying still. Lastly, the Turbie Twist is extremely uncomfortable. It pulls your hair back so tight that you feel like it&#x27;s going to rip your hair off. In conclusion, the Turbie Twist will only cause you pain and inconvience and I strongly recommend you don&#x27;t purchase it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my daughter to use at the pool and she loves the colors and the ease of use.  She&#x27;s only 7 so it&#x27;s easy for her to use and not too much towel for her hair.  But as an adult, I find it&#x27;s still plenty of towel for my head, too.      I received this item practically overnight.  I ordered in the late evening and one day passed, then the next day I received it.  It took less than 2 days from placing the order to having the product.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with this seller.</li>
            <li> i love how much more comfortable this is than a real (large, bulky) towel on my head, but it doesn&#x27;t do much to absorb moisture. My hair definitely takes longer to dry after using this than it does after wrapping my head in a regular towel.</li>
            <li> Have been using these for years - needed more for self and a gift.  They absorb all I need them to so I can still style without the drips, heavy towel falling everywhere and long time with the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is so much easier to wrap one of these around my wet hair than to just use a regular towel, which is what I have been doing for years.  The Turbie Twist does a great job of absorbing the water from my hair and I love that it is relatively small -so less space in the laundry.</li>
            <li> My step-daughter and I have mixed reviews on these Turby Twists.  As far as the actual towels...she says the elastic band that the towel tucks in to while on your head is strong and sturdy.  She also likes that the towel has a curved end instead of a tapered and pointed end.  Her hair is about waist length and the turby holds all of it...even the ends.  (These were problems with previous towels.)  I have yet to use one of these new turbies as my current one is still in good shape so I will review other topics.  I ordered the six pack not knowing what colors might be included.  There were three pink, two white, and one green.  Those colors are fine but I think it would have been nice to have two of each color...but thankfully they were not ALL pink.  Just keep in mind you don&#x27;t get to pick the colors you want or even a color scheme or combination.  Each towel was individually wrapped in plastic but the complete package was a mess.  All six towels were shoved into a 9\\&quot; X 12\\&quot; manilla envelope.  The brad could not keep the envelope closed and it was ripped in some places.  Since I had ordered several items together and received free Super Saver Shipping, this package did come in a bigger box with more items.  I guarantee it would not have made it through the mail by itself.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Turbie Twists back in 2004.  I got a 2-pack...kept one towel for myself, gave the other to a friend.  My first Turbie Twist was great...just thick enough without being too thick, and it really stayed put.    But then late last year the elastic band that holds the towel in place on the crown of your head started getting really stretched out.  It didn&#x27;t break, it just got to be in really bad shape.  My first one had stood up to daily use for a good 3 years, I was pleased, so I decided to go buy a new pack.    This time I kept both towels for myself, and it&#x27;s a good thing I did.  The terry fabric of the first towel began literally, from the very first use, to unravel along the seam that joins the 2 pieces of fabric, and after just 1 week nearly half of the towel had unraveled and it was, needless to say, completely unusable.  I am still using the second one, though I&#x27;m not happy with it.  The fabric is very thin.  You can *see* through it, literally.  It is pretty much instantly saturated once it hits wet hair, and it *definitely* doesn&#x27;t stay put like the older one did.  It could be my imagination, but I remember my older towel being longer.  And as for the elastic band...after about 1 year&#x27;s use, it&#x27;s already more stretched out than my original was after 3.  These *used to be* a really great product, but now they&#x27;re very, VERY low quality and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I always wrap my hair in an extra towel- so I thought this product would be perfect for me.  All in all, I was not wowed.  It&#x27;s a pretty average product.  I like that it&#x27;s less bulky than a normal towel (and is much lighter to pack in a suitcase).  And the pull-through loop does make it more secure...although the result is a bizarre/goofy-looking head wrap that I won&#x27;t be flaunting.  Also, it does NOT fulfill the advertisement.  It is definitely not more absorbent than your average towel.  It also takes a VERY long time to dry.  I wanted to test this so I wet the towel, wrung it out completely, and hung it in my 70 degree apartment---after 8 hours it was still damp!!  Not what I was hoping for.  If you&#x27;re looking for a towel to wrap your head, I suggest the Eagle Creek travel towel instead (in sizes from Small to XL).  It&#x27;s made for camping/backpacking/traveling so it&#x27;s super-lightweight, very absorbent, and dries like a champ (besides being the softest travel towel I&#x27;ve found).  I prefer the Eagle Creek travel towel to any Turbie Twist.  However, the Turbie Twist is still semi-functional so I give it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> These hair towels are great.  They&#x27;re thick, absorbent, stay in place, and for the money, can&#x27;t be beat.  I&#x27;m seeing a couple of reviews talking about how thin these towels are, and I don&#x27;t know, maybe they were from a bad batch or something, because the last thing I&#x27;d call these is thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, despite what the packaging implies, they&#x27;re not going to exactly dry your hair for you.  They&#x27;re just a towel.  A twisty towel that won&#x27;t pull your hair and stretch it out and do all the damage that using a bath towel on your hair will.</li>
            <li> Turbie Twist Hair Towels are great for drying hair. My hair goes down my back about mid way, &amp; the Turbie Twist Hair Towels do a great job at drying my hair. They&#x27;re easy to use, &amp; launder easily.   They are well worth the money.  I hope this helps! :)</li>
            <li> I love the turbie twist it works great on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair less bulky then a towel. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> I love my Turbie Twist (which is why I&#x27;m getting ready to buy the six pack!) but it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair the way it says. I love it because it&#x27;s not bulky, it&#x27;s easy to use and it stays in place. I like to put it on after my shower and let it dry a bit while I get ready. Then I just have to blowdry my hair a little. I highly recommend this product for someone who has arthritis or is running short on time in the morning.</li>
            <li> It twists and holds in your hair well, but it&#x27;s not very absorbant.  I squeeze out all the water, and put the towel in my hair for like 15 minutes.  When I remove it, my hair still seems quite wet.  It&#x27;s a pretty thick towel, so I cannot twist the towel very tightly, so maybe that&#x27;s why it does not remove much moisture??  Also - if your hair is semi-long (like mid back length), it will be too long to fit into the towel.  I had another hair-towel prior to buying these, by Scunci, and it was MUCH better.  I coudn&#x27;t find that one again, so I got the Turbie Twist.  It&#x27;s an ok substitute.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the new turbie twists.  I bought these for my wife, and the material is not as sturdy as the original, and they are not as long.  They cannot keep her hair twisted up.  Bring the original back please!</li>
            <li> Item was shipped promptly and was as described.  Turbie Twists save water as I don&#x27;t have to wash them as often as I would a towel.</li>
            <li> These towels are soft and plushy, combine that with their super absorbance and nice array of colors and you have a winner in my book!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re great for short, medium, and long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Turbie Twists are particularly handy if the weight of big towels makes your neck sore or if you&#x27;re looking to cut down on laundry volume because of their sleek and efficient design. With a regular towel, the weight of the back is what keeps it on your head, but with Turbie Twists you simply slide the much smaller, lighter twist into the rubber band loop at the base of your neck and it stays put as long as you need -- through getting dressed or doing your makeup!&lt;br /&gt;Great value too, you get six and they last years!</li>
            <li> iIwas disappointed in these because I did not like the fabric....not enough absorbency. I purposely bought this brand because i loved the one I had and assumed being the same TT I would like these also, but NOT...I gave them away.</li>
            <li> I bought these to have a few on hand for vacations after a swim, and around the house. Very convenient.</li>
            <li> I just love Turbie Twist Hair Towels.  I had one for a few years and it finally wore out and then I came to Amazon.com and found them.  I ordered the 6 pack.  I have tried the others that were made of microfibre - but there is no comparison.  Turbie Twist is by far the greatest.</li>
            <li> My Wife Has had one for years, and Loves it. Bought this six pack, should last her for many years! Great Product!</li>
            <li> My Turbie Twist Hair Towel 6 Pack arrived early and in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;There was a nice variety of color</li>
            <li> Very nice quality. I have purchased some that were flimsy, thin and didn&#x27;t absorb water well. These towels are thick, sturdy, large and very absorbent. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and got more to replace my oldies; also gave them to my friends for Christmas and they love too! It&#x27;s better than trying to use a bath towel around your head.</li>
            <li> My girls (12 and 15) use these every day! They are great to use instead of a large towel daily! We love them!</li>
            <li> Useful product, but not recommended for very long hair.  Hair that is longer than mid-back will be too long for the towel.  Long hair has to be doubled over to fit into the towel, which does the trick but is then harder for kids to use on their own.  Towel is just a basic terry towel material.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me a few of these years ago and I thought &amp;#34;what&amp;#34; I&#x27;m not wearing that, then I was hooked and I completely wore them out. I was so happy to find these on Amazon for a fantastic price. They are super absorbent, comfortable and you don&#x27;t have to balance a giant towel on your head anymore.  When you remove the turbine  your hair isn&#x27;t dripping and it&#x27;s ready for blow drying. I love these things and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Original Turbie Twist made of terry cloth not micro fiber</li>
            <li> I bought the true \\&quot;original\\&quot; turbie twists back when they first came out years ago. They are getting kind of worn by now so I decided to replace them and also get some for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These towels are acceptable to use but obviously of lesser quality. The aren&#x27;t all of uniform shape either. I&#x27;m not sure if that will mean anything in the long run but it just emphasizes the quality detioration to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I was disappointed to receive 3 white towels in the 6pack. It states that 2 of the same color might be received but having 3 white is not the variety I had hoped for. In hindsight I should&#x27;ve just purchased them at Bed, Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have for all women it really works well you can just set it such a arrogant wrap it up and put on your makeup to do what you have to do love it</li>
            <li> I purchased these for a friend of mine who wanted to give them as small Christmas gifts.  Everyone seemed to love them!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these hair towels.  The colors I received were very pretty.  They are super absorbant and stay in place until you are ready to style your hair.  The price was good.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the original Turbie Twist as advertised and shown don&#x27;t order these.  I got micro fiber instead of the terry / cotton.  If I had wanted micro fiber I would have ordered cheaper ones.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought a two pack of turbo twists in a store and loved them so much I came on Amazon to buy more. I bought the 6 pack. The towels have the same turbo twist brand tag on them, but they are made of a different material than the ones I have. They are not the ultra thin, velvety soft microfiber that is so light weight and more absorbent than a regular bath towel. Rather, they are a cheap, scratchy terry that is not ultra absorbent. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wish they made these in extra long for long hair.  Mine is getting almost too long.  I also wish they had more absorbancy and thickness.  I like that they fit my head and don&#x27;t make my neck feel so weighted like a giant bath towel does.  I&#x27;ve had to mend them when they fray right along the seams and leave holes, or the elastic pops off.  Was just thinking it might be time to get more of them.  I&#x27;ve tried some &amp;#34;microfiber&amp;#34; others but they are even smaller and not nearly as absorbent as they claim.  Maybe they need to combine the Turbie Twist with the Sham-Wow!  I also try to remember to take these with me when I travel, since there often isn&#x27;t an extra bath towel in the room for me to wrap my hair in.</li>
            <li> I love these so much, I gave them to my mother and girlfriends. I even leave on in my car for after a surf session. They are so easy to use and great when you have lots of hair like I do.</li>
            <li> I had went to a local drugstore and purchased the original turbie and I loved it.  I like amazon and I could find myself a better deal, and found this set of 6.  The original one from the store is super light and absorbs the water out of my hair after the shower, this one not so great.  It just seems more of a cheap towel material to me</li>
            <li> Most amazing invention since sliced bread! I&#x27;m Not sure how I ever lived without my turbie twist! Love, love, love!!!</li>
            <li> I just love these.  I don&#x27;t have to dirty a whole towel to dry my hair.  I have been using turbie twist for a decade.  Mine finally just bit the dust and I had to get some new ones.  So they are made to last.</li>
            <li> All the ladies in my house love these. My wife and two daughter&#x27;s have their hair wrapped up in these as soon as they get out of the shower. Saves some time using a blow dryer. Will last for about a year before they are frayed and need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Just perfect for a wet head. I have had these before and used them so much , that I wre them out. I really love them...Thank You</li>
            <li> I wish that this product had a button and hook closure instead of a fabric loop, but it works fine. I use these all the time, and it&#x27;s nice to have a bunch so that I&#x27;m never short. (Also because I frequently leave them places or give them to friends!)</li>
            <li> Ordered and was surprised at how much water these absorbed. I was looking for the original regular terry cloth purchased years ago but very pleased woth these.</li>
            <li> This last purchase of a packet of 6 Turbie Twists are for Christmas stocking stuffers for my grandchildren. I have been using Turbie Twist for years.  I always had trouble making a normal sized towel stay on my head after washing my hair. It was too big and too heavy and would continually fall off.  The Turbie twist is just perfect...the right size and design to stay on my head and I can move around and do whatever I want until I am ready to take it off and dry and style my hair.</li>
            <li> These are terrific.  the turbie twists are so useful and take up much less room than a towel! I love anything that makes my laundry loads smaller!</li>
            <li> These are legitimately the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; turbie twists! The new ones are not as good. They met my expectations! Great Product!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these at a local store and loved it, however, it was taken from our hotel bathroom with the towels.  The hotel never located it in the laundry so I decided to but several from Amazon at a great price.  I loathe heavy towels around my hair so this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these towels. I have several.  I keep one in my gym bag, one in my army bag, I even leave one for when I visit my dads and I always travel with one.  If you use a regular towel it always falls off or is heavy on your head.  This is absolutely perfect!!</li>
            <li> I already have some and ordered more as i use them after every shower, keeps my clothes from getting wet, while it dries my hair</li>
            <li> Bought these as gifts for christmas and all asked where I got them so they could purchase more! They were a hit!</li>
            <li> I bought one for me and my two daughters, and we all love it!  My daughter says that it is great for hotel stays, and now there is no more water all over their bathroom floor from their long hair!  Great stocking stuffer or Easter Basket gift too!</li>
            <li> material is a soft, thick terry, feels very luxurious&lt;br /&gt;Keeps wet hair out of the way, until you are ready to style it,&lt;br /&gt;and at the same time, absorbs a good bit of the water from your hair, depending on how long you use it!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.  Only problem I have with it is that of the six, 3 are a bright pink, and&lt;br /&gt;I am not very fond of that particular color.</li>
            <li> I have one of the original Turbie Twists, and I love it. It&#x27;s absorbent, it fits my head, and it&#x27;s long enough to wind around my hair and tuck in the end. The new ones (and I made the mistake of buying a six-pack) are nothing like the original, even though they say &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; on the package. The fabric is plush and, I think, not as absorbent, the head part is longer and has to be turned up to fit, and the &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34; is so short it constantly comes undone. Ugh.</li>
            <li> I bought these for all the ladies in my life for Christmas.  My mom and sister love theirs.  I had one left over so I got to try it out and now I wish I had ordered more *Grin*</li>
            <li> My daughter wore her old Turbie Twist Towels out - so I bought her a new 6-pack.&lt;br /&gt;She loves them.</li>
