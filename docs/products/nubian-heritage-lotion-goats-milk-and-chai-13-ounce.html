            <li>the chia fragrance is not too strong good product..</li>
            <li>The smell has like a light baby powder scent to it, so it&#x27;s not overpowering and quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>I love the goat milk chai soap, but although this smells great and is rich and creamy, I find I am itchy after using it.  </li>
            <li>I researched creams and found that this is as nearly a natural product with mostly excellent ingredients and no chemicals as can be found.</li>
            <li>This lotion is perfect for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is nice (goes on smooth and isn&#x27;t too greasy), but the scent is WAY too strong!  </li>
            <li>My mother gave me a bottle of this, and I am in love.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes well, but the scent is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the scent, it&#x27;s a fantastic lotion though!</li>
            <li>I love everything about Nubian products from their fragrances to their moisturizing abilities.  </li>
            <li>This has a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>What I love the most about it is how it healed my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love the soap in the Goat&#x27;s Milk Chai line but this lotion is way too strongly scented.  </li>
            <li>Even if I miss a day my dry skin still feels great!</li>
            <li>It smells very sweet and feminine.</li>
            <li>I take good care of my skin as it is, but this leaves my skin in such good condition if I use my toner(andalou naturals) or not that I&#x27;m just fine with powder(Aubrey silken earth) and mascara.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and blends easily and the smell is divine.</li>
            <li>It smells like really cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>My spouse even likes the way it helps make your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I also have been using the same brand of liquid shower soap along with the lotion, which is also very nice and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>i love this lotion so much!....</li>
            <li>this lotion has a light, girly, sweet smell.  </li>
            <li>Great for any type of skin but particularly dry skin.</li>
            <li>If I do a full body scrub, I&#x27;ll spoil myself and use this lotion all over.</li>
            <li>A lot of the &amp;#34;trusted&amp;#34; name brands have added chemicals and don&#x27;t use any better ingredients than this cream but charge way too much.</li>
            <li>Sweet, the smells and textures and way</li>
            <li>This has a very mellow but pleasant and natural smell to it.</li>
            <li>It is a nice smell, and to me it is similar to Nag Champa, but not as strong.  </li>
            <li>Absorbed into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>not sure if i used much helpful details, but honestly, this product is so good it speaks for itself.</li>
            <li>I can tell you that my wife has a sensitive nose and doesn&#x27;t like overly sweet, flowery, or strong scents.</li>
            <li>It is over-powering and gives me a major headache and makes me nauseous if I use more than a pea-sized amount.</li>
            <li>My sister gave me this lotion initially and I love it.</li>
            <li>That being said the formula is incredible thick and moisturizing and leaves my skin very soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>pure sensual healing for your skin.</li>
            <li>for this reason u dont need much to feel moisturized.</li>
            <li>Plus I know that the ingredients are real.</li>
            <li>I think the scent smells really manly.  </li>
            <li>It is not a heavy scent, but it does last most of the day.  </li>
            <li>I also love the Black Seed &amp; Honey as well as the Carrot Pomegranate.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and anything by this company.</li>
            <li>Shared with a friend in New Orleans, LA</li>
            <li>ive become very  conscious about using products with natural ingredients and anyone who wants to do the same</li>
            <li>should definitely not only check out this lotion but the whole nubian heritage/shea moisture line.    </li>
            <li>be weary if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This goat&#x27;s milk lotion makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li>If I could compare it to anything else I&#x27;ve smelled, I would say that it smells similar to the perfume &amp;#34;flower bomb.&amp;#34; Love how thick this lotion is as well, gets rid of my dry and itchy skin fast!</li>
            <li>Of all the Nubian body lotions, this is my favorite with raw shea butter and lemongrass as my second and third.</li>
            <li>It applies really well -- not too heavy or light -- and leaves my skin feeling seriously silky.</li>
            <li>but you need so little for your whole body .....</li>

            <li> Keeps me moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is sheer heaven on your skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hands to combat the dry winter air, my wife puts in on her face for the same reason, and her mom--for whom we researched it in the first place--puts it on her 75-year-old face to protect her very thin and fragile skin.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion but this last bottle the lotion is so thick it is difficult to get out of bottle!</li>
            <li> My nails are smoother, much less dry.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> The cost is less than brands using &amp;#34;clinically tested&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;doctor approved&amp;#34; so some other manipulative marketing nonsense.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that it needs a pump or something.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick, so a bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It goes away in a few hours, but i didn&#x27;t care for it.  </li>
            <li> Even the guy at the drive through when I rolled down the window to pay for my order!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick that it&#x27;s a pain to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> and I really mean All.</li>
            <li> 1st, its very thick like a body cream or butter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry if others didn&#x27;t like this, but there must have been something wrong because the product I have is one I recommend often.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the reviews concerning the smell of the lotion.  </li>
            <li> that is is almost impossible to get it out of the bottle.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  I get compliments.</li>
            <li> My mother gave me a bottle of this, and I am in love. I take good care of my skin as it is, but this leaves my skin in such good condition if I use my toner(andalou naturals) or not that I&#x27;m just fine with powder(Aubrey silken earth) and mascara. If I do a full body scrub, I&#x27;ll spoil myself and use this lotion all over. It&#x27;s the only lotion I will ever use on my face. It smells wonderful and leaves my skin feeling clean. The only complaint is that it needs a pump or something. It&#x27;s so thick that it&#x27;s a pain to get out of the bottle. Other than that, it is sheer heaven on your skin. I&#x27;m sorry if others didn&#x27;t like this, but there must have been something wrong because the product I have is one I recommend often.</li>
            <li> i love this lotion so much!.... 1st, its very thick like a body cream or butter.  for this reason u dont need much to feel moisturized. 2nd....this lotion smells amazingggg. the color of the bottle matches the scent perfectly bc this lotion has a light, girly, sweet smell.  3rd.... the INGREDIENTS. ive become very  conscious about using products with natural ingredients and anyone who wants to do the same should definitely not only check out this lotion but the whole nubian heritage/shea moisture line.    not sure if i used much helpful details, but honestly, this product is so good it speaks for itself. lol</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Feels like silk. Absorbed into the skin quickly. Love it. Plus I know that the ingredients are real.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for the last couple of years. It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful! It applies really well -- not too heavy or light -- and leaves my skin feeling seriously silky. I receive compliments all the time on how nice I smell ... and I really mean All. The. Time. I also love the Black Seed &amp; Honey as well as the Carrot Pomegranate.</li>
            <li> The best body cream I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I wish I could give ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ rating! Iove this product!!</li>
            <li> Best lotion I have found. Smells great. Not greasy. Absorbs well and lasts.</li>
            <li> great product good moisture for dry skin excellent fragrance would recommend this product anytime keep this comming the chia fragrance is not too strong good product..</li>
            <li> smells great; works great</li>
            <li> This lotion has made such a difference in my hands. My nails are smoother, much less dry. And the product smells wonderful!  I&#x27;ve had several people mention it. Even the guy at the drive through when I rolled down the window to pay for my order!!</li>
            <li> Love the soap in the Goat&#x27;s Milk Chai line but this lotion is way too strongly scented.  It is over-powering and gives me a major headache and makes me nauseous if I use more than a pea-sized amount. It rubs off onto my sheets and clothes and the smell lasts forever.  That being said the formula is incredible thick and moisturizing and leaves my skin very soft and hydrated.  However, it&#x27;s so thick that is is almost impossible to get it out of the bottle.  If the the packaging was different I could store the bottle upside-down so I could actually dispense the product or if it was in a jar I could scoop it out.  Overall, this product needs to be re-worked.</li>
            <li> I love the goat milk chai soap, but although this smells great and is rich and creamy, I find I am itchy after using it.  be weary if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It may seem pricey for the amount but you need so little for your whole body .....I never have any ashy skin after starting to use this. Even if I miss a day my dry skin still feels great!</li>
            <li> I care about the quality of the ingredients, my wife cares about that and how well it works, and her mom cares about the smell and how it feels. I researched creams and found that this is as nearly a natural product with mostly excellent ingredients and no chemicals as can be found. The cost is less than brands using &amp;#34;clinically tested&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;doctor approved&amp;#34; so some other manipulative marketing nonsense. A lot of the &amp;#34;trusted&amp;#34; name brands have added chemicals and don&#x27;t use any better ingredients than this cream but charge way too much. This product is an excellent balance of cost, quality, and pleasant appeal. I think the ingredients in the various blends of Nubian lotion are the same--we got the Goats Milk and Chai and all like the smell, but that&#x27;s going to be personal, isn&#x27;t it? I can tell you that my wife has a sensitive nose and doesn&#x27;t like overly sweet, flowery, or strong scents. This has a very mellow but pleasant and natural smell to it. Nice for her to put on her face and for me to kiss. It&#x27;s a little thick, so a bit goes a long way. I use it on my hands to combat the dry winter air, my wife puts in on her face for the same reason, and her mom--for whom we researched it in the first place--puts it on her 75-year-old face to protect her very thin and fragile skin. Works for all three of us.</li>
            <li> Smell so good, skin is silky, it is wonderful after a shower and ready for bed.  Shared with a friend in New Orleans, LA and she liked it also. Highly recommend this product and anything by this company.</li>
            <li> The lotion works great for me.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well, but the scent is overwhelming. It smells sort of like musky incense. It goes away in a few hours, but i didn&#x27;t care for it.  If you don&#x27;t mind the scent, it&#x27;s a fantastic lotion though!</li>
            <li> This scent is intoxicating! If I could compare it to anything else I&#x27;ve smelled, I would say that it smells similar to the perfume &amp;#34;flower bomb.&amp;#34; Love how thick this lotion is as well, gets rid of my dry and itchy skin fast!</li>
            <li> My sister gave me this lotion initially and I love it. Great for any type of skin but particularly dry skin. Not greasy and blends easily and the smell is divine.</li>
            <li> This goat&#x27;s milk lotion makes my skin so soft. It smells very sweet and feminine. A little bit goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion but this last bottle the lotion is so thick it is difficult to get out of bottle!</li>
            <li> The lotion is nice (goes on smooth and isn&#x27;t too greasy), but the scent is WAY too strong!  It smells like really cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> Nubian Heritage has a winner with this lotion. It is thick and creamy, but not greasy. Keeps me moisturized all day long. The smell has like a light baby powder scent to it, so it&#x27;s not overpowering and quite pleasant. My spouse even likes the way it helps make your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I love everything about Nubian products from their fragrances to their moisturizing abilities.  I continue to purchase these over and over again.</li>
            <li> This has a lovely scent.  Love it!</li>
            <li> love it... it smells amazing</li>
            <li> I think the scent smells really manly.  I did not like it at all.</li>
            <li> Sweet, the smells and textures and way it makes me feel...pure sensual healing for your skin. I buy it in the largest bottles they make, 4 at a time. I will never tire of this lotion. Of all the Nubian body lotions, this is my favorite with raw shea butter and lemongrass as my second and third.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product!. It leaves my skin so soft and does not leave an oily residue. Smells heavenly!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is perfect for my sensitive skin.  My skin suddenly could not handle the bath and body works lotions and I broke out in a rash around my eyes and forehead.  I read about this lotion in Dr. Oz&#x27;s magazine and thought I would try it.  I was skeptical because of the reviews concerning the smell of the lotion.  It is a nice smell, and to me it is similar to Nag Champa, but not as strong.  It is not a heavy scent, but it does last most of the day.  What I love the most about it is how it healed my skin.  I would say I have combination skin, and did not have any problems with this lotion.  I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle today.  I also have been using the same brand of liquid shower soap along with the lotion, which is also very nice and moisturizing.</li>
