            <li>One of my favorite perfumes ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The ad on the product is over-hyped&lt;br /&gt;The shipping and everything was ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s among my top 3 favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>Get so many compliments when I wear this and mostly fron men &#x3D;)</li>

            <li>Smells exactly like the one in the store!!!</li>
            <li>Really smells very elegant, a nice addition to her perfume collection.</li>
            <li>arrived early and in great condition.</li>

            <li>The scent lasts all day and it isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>I got excited when I first sprayed this because I really liked the scent.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way this is genuine.</li>
            <li>I enjoy a scent that will remain.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know, it&#x27; s just a fantastic feminine blend.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use more than one spritz because it is powerful.</li>
            <li>she loves it soo much!!!</li>
            <li>so I was able to enjoy my purchase on my first vacation of the summer.</li>
            <li>The one from Amazon, does not have that light, sweet smell that I am used to.</li>
            <li>The box containing the perfume was not sealed and the box itself looked like it was not an original Gucci box with washed out ink and color.</li>
            <li>I looked amazing in my new bottle of fragrance...</li>
            <li>-:&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very nice and strong when u first spritzed it, but scent doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li>It also wears very nicely -- still on after a long day.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>It was bold but not overpowering, floral but not &amp;#</li>
            <li>My older one has more of an alcohol smell than this one does and it&#x27;s from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It does not stay on for a long time as good perfume should, so don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>sure, My toilet water feels better.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a nice smell though.</li>
            <li>Arrived earlier than expected  in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>By far, one of my favorite perfumes I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>the item was just as describe which was exciting.</li>
            <li>Just right.  </li>
            <li>It is all right.</li>
            <li>I am so very pleased to have found this high dollar designer fragrance at such an affordable price on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use as much!</li>
            <li>Fragrance is lovely and last all day.</li>
            <li>Is a polite and pretty scent for a woman.</li>
            <li>Thanks Gucci!</li>
            <li>It is exactly like view.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the same boat as many others commenting, here...</li>
            <li>The scent softens several seconds after applying it to my skin and admittedly is even more to my liking.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews but, as always, ordering directly from Amazon results in a great experience.</li>
            <li>The bottle was new and very pretty.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and although I don&#x27;t smell it for long after I have put it on, others say they still can.  </li>
            <li>Love the parfume vs. the eau de toilet, it lasts so much longer</li>
            <li>It smells good for awhile, but isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; long enough.</li>
            <li>I have used this perfume for many years and this is not the original long lasting smell.  </li>
            <li>the notes of pink pepper make the scent striking.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>This product does not smell like the Gucci Intense in the store.</li>
            <li>It came on time, the perfume is Real</li>
            <li>Fast delivery time.</li>
            <li>Very disappoiinted</li>
            <li>This fragrance has garnered many compliments especially from my discriminating young Niece.</li>
            <li>I only wear it on special events.</li>
            <li>1st of all, this perfume captivated me from the recent trip to the mall and the scent stayed with me the entire day, I&#x27;m glad I found it here</li>
            <li>Product high quality and favorable price</li>
            <li>and yes this is for people such as myself who were sceptical to buy it online and especially for such an amazing price.</li>
            <li>They do smell different, and I noticed that right away.</li>
            <li>it smells exactly the same in Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The other ladies in the office were excited to see what I purchased.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little strong, if you don&#x27;t like that type of scent.</li>
            <li>I like soft femine scents and this one is my new fave.  </li>
            <li>Product may be old.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy, not too light.  </li>
            <li>Very upsetting that I have to send it back</li>
            <li>I actually bought the original bottle one year ago because the perfume she previously preferred was not in.</li>
            <li>It is my new scent to replace my Narcisso Rodriguez scent that I wear to work daily.</li>
            <li>this one barely had any sent to it at all!  </li>
            <li>Slightly musky (which I personally love), slightly floral...</li>
            <li>I am not sure it smells the same as I bought once from a tax free store in Francfurt.</li>
            <li>I got this perfume for my birthday, wear it regularly and get a lot of compliments from complete strangers for it.</li>
            <li>I spent so much money on it.</li>
            <li>When i bought her this perfume she was surprised a Female perfume could be stronger than a Male&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>a little powdery (not particularly my bag, but it seems to diminish rather quickly).</li>
            <li>as the Gucci Guilty Intense EDP I received from Sephora the very first time I had the pleasure of wearing it.</li>

            <li> It is my new scent to replace my Narcisso Rodriguez scent that I wear to work daily.</li>
            <li> this one barely had any sent to it at all!  </li>
            <li> Slightly musky (which I personally love), slightly floral...</li>
            <li> I am not sure it smells the same as I bought once from a tax free store in Francfurt.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume for my birthday, wear it regularly and get a lot of compliments from complete strangers for it.</li>
            <li> I spent so much money on it.</li>
            <li> When i bought her this perfume she was surprised a Female perfume could be stronger than a Male&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> a little powdery (not particularly my bag, but it seems to diminish rather quickly).</li>
            <li> as the Gucci Guilty Intense EDP I received from Sephora the very first time I had the pleasure of wearing it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s real or not.</li>
            <li> This smells differently and doesn&#x27;t hold long.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
            <li> However, it is a long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> Did a comparison to a bottle from Sephora and Amazon&#x27;s is clearly a watered down designer imposters.</li>
            <li> This is the real Gucci guilty intense perfume.</li>
            <li> The Gucci Guilty Intense 2.5 OZ Spray EDP which I purchased from Amazon.com is the real deal.</li>
            <li> my wife loves strong perfumes so she took my Gucci Guilty for Men.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for Gucci Guilty Intense....</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little pricey in my opinion even though I know it&#x27;s wayy more expensive in department stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gucci Guilty Intense for over a year now and still had a little left in my bottle to compare to the new one-</li>
            <li> I simply express, \\&quot;Gucci Guilty Intense,</li>
            <li> It is a soft oriental floral fragrance and IMO it is not the least bit over powering.</li>
            <li> I have gone to bed for the night wearing Gucci Guilty Intense EDP having applied it earlier in the evening</li>
            <li> I read that the original Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette was too muted and decided to go with Guilty Intense Eau De Parfum.</li>
            <li> My package was not open, was not tampered with and there is no strong alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> Often times, other people ask about my scent and its name.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase again and shipping was expeditious as usual.</li>
            <li> I was recently given a small bottle of Guilty Intense from Sephora.</li>
            <li> JUST LOVES THE INTENSE SCENT OF GUCCI GUILTY</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after getting a fragrance card in a flyer for the Eau de toilette Guilty for women, after reading the reviews this and on the Intense Eau De parfum, I purchased the parfum.</li>

            <li> [[ASIN:B006OMJ0FE Gucci Guilty Intense Eau De Parfum Spray for Women, 2.5 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why it is called Guilty Intense</li>
            <li> I tried it as soon as I received it yesterday and again today and both instances, after about 30 minutes, probably less....</li>
            <li> I wonder if that is why it was so much less than the store price.</li>
            <li> they poured half of it out and replaced with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> The seal on the bottle was not original.</li>
            <li> I sprayed a little on my wrist.</li>
            <li> After I took the bottle out of the package the bottle cap had some finger prints and the bottom sticker was not securely attached.</li>
            <li> BUT I must agree with the few that doubt the authenticity of this perfume.</li>
            <li> She received a tester scent and the perfume didn&#x27;t let her down!!</li>
            <li> when you realize you wasted hard earned money....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> i went to return the perfume today to only find I unable to retun this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this perfume is expired or what</li>
            <li> If you like Alien</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference between real and fake since I&#x27;ve seen and smelled the fake ones.</li>
            <li> The smell is very weak.</li>
            <li> Guilty</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I was purchasing the wrong version.</li>
            <li> She already had Gucci Guilty</li>
            <li> Gucci guilty is everything</li>
            <li> I brought Gucci Guilty as a gift for my fianc&amp;eacute; during the holidays.</li>
            <li> I thought it was my imagination, and even bought it again unfortunately —</li>
            <li> and I am sad</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re afraid of smelling &amp;#34;too old&amp;#34;, you may not be attracted to this scent.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product high quality and favorable price</li>
            <li> my wife loves strong perfumes so she took my Gucci Guilty for Men. When i bought her this perfume she was surprised a Female perfume could be stronger than a Male&#x27;s. she loves it soo much!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice scent. It&#x27;s a little strong, if you don&#x27;t like that type of scent. Overall, it&#x27;s a nice smell though. I use this more in the evening or when I&#x27;m going out.</li>
            <li> I went shopping with a friend and sprayed on a sample. It smelled so good he purchased it. I love the Eau De Parfum it lingers longer.</li>
            <li> I got excited when I first sprayed this because I really liked the scent.  However beware, the scent doesn&#x27;t last.  There&#x27;s no way this is genuine.</li>
            <li> Love the parfume vs. the eau de toilet, it lasts so much longer and I don&#x27;t have to use as much! Very sexy scent my hubba hubba loves it!!.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; received a test sample of Gucci Guilty thru a mail catalog and instantly fell in love with the fragrance. It was bold but not overpowering, floral but not &amp;#34;too girly&amp;#34; and the notes of pink pepper make the scent striking. I decided to get it as a surprise gift for her. I read that the original Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette was too muted and decided to go with Guilty Intense Eau De Parfum. Guilty Intense strikes a great balance and definitely is a great value.</li>
            <li> I never get compliments on my perfume choices... This one has gotten MANY compliments!  I would highly recommend!  I love it!!! :)</li>
            <li> Bang for the buck, this is very good perfume, my wife loves it ! especially for the price can&#x27;t beat this!</li>
            <li> This is the real Gucci guilty intense perfume. Smells exactly like the one in the store!!! My package was not open, was not tampered with and there is no strong alcohol smell. My older one has more of an alcohol smell than this one does and it&#x27;s from Macy&#x27;s. I love love love this scent. It&#x27;s so sexy! Every time I wear it, men always ask me, &amp;#34;what are you wearing?&amp;#34;  I recommend you try this one in the store and if you love it, buy it here at a fraction of the department store price. Thank you amazon!</li>
            <li> The perfume arrived on time, was not tampered with, and had no degradation in smell. I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews but, as always, ordering directly from Amazon results in a great experience.</li>
            <li> JUST LOVES THE INTENSE SCENT OF GUCCI GUILTY AND FOR THE PRICE I SHOULD HAVE JUST STOCKED UP FOR NEXT YEAR XMAS GIFTS</li>
            <li> I was recently given a small bottle of Guilty Intense from Sephora. On me it smells just like overpowering, pungent bug spray. Obviously it doesn&#x27;t work well with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> This product does not smell like the Gucci Intense in the store. The smell is very weak. Product may be old.</li>
            <li> The scent does not stay on my body.  I enjoy a scent that will remain.  However, I do like the aroma  pleasant  of this perfume.</li>
            <li> Great product! it smells exactly the same in Macy&#x27;s. i love these smell and my friends love ne more than before.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after getting a fragrance card in a flyer for the Eau de toilette Guilty for women, after reading the reviews this and on the Intense Eau De parfum, I purchased the parfum. Fragrance is lovely and last all day. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This parfum spray is a great scent for those who love to smell fresh. Often times, other people ask about my scent and its name. I simply express, \\&quot;Gucci Guilty Intense, you gotta-have-it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> 1st of all, this perfume captivated me from the recent trip to the mall and the scent stayed with me the entire day, I&#x27;m glad I found it here and from this seller. It came on time, the perfume is Real and yes this is for people such as myself who were sceptical to buy it online and especially for such an amazing price. I can tell the difference between real and fake since I&#x27;ve seen and smelled the fake ones. Then again, I can only speak for myself, but don&#x27;t make negetive reviews alter your desicion. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and this is my Fall/Winter scent, its absolutely delighful, very sexy and sensual, see for yourselves, happy shopping! ;) thank you, great business!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife, and she loves it!!! She received a tester scent and the perfume didn&#x27;t let her down!! I love the smell on her myself!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It is my new scent to replace my Narcisso Rodriguez scent that I wear to work daily.</li>
            <li> Perfect condition and love the smell of it! Its amazing! The bottle was new and very pretty. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells it&#x27;s  very personal . I love the smell of this perfume and the price I bought was great. Good buy.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas. I didn&#x27;t realize I was purchasing the wrong version. She already had Gucci Guilty so I thought it was the same thing. Turns out she loved it and now prefers it to the original.</li>
            <li> I am big fan of Gucci, but this is not what I have from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> arrived early and in great condition. love this scent. bought a sample size assortment set of Gucci and this was my favorite.</li>
            <li> I only wear two scents, this and one from Avon believe it or not.  I love this scent and although I don&#x27;t smell it for long after I have put it on, others say they still can.  This larger size is a steal compared to places such as Ulta, etc.  I would definitely purchase again and shipping was expeditious as usual.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s real or not.After I took the bottle out of the package the bottle cap had some finger prints and the bottom sticker was not securely attached. It does not stay on for a long time as good perfume should, so don&#x27;t know. I guess you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. My Mother had given me a bottle for Christmas the year before last and it was only 1 oz. I purchased this 2oz. bottle cheaper!!! Great deal, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> My most luxurious scent. I love it so much. I only wear it on special events. I would wear it every day but it&#x27;s a little pricey in my opinion even though I know it&#x27;s wayy more expensive in department stores.</li>
            <li> Yummy fragrance.  Not too heavy, not too light.  Just right.  Arrived earlier than expected  in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;I will use it all year.</li>
            <li> This perfume is one of my favorites to wear, but when I noticed it seemed to be different, I went ahead and gone to the mall to get another bottle of it. I did a comparison, wearing the one purchased on Amazon one day, and the one from the mall, the next day. They do smell different, and I noticed that right away. The one from Amazon, does not have that light, sweet smell that I am used to. It does not last all day, where as the one from the mall does. They are somewhat similar, but not the same. Needless to say, I am disappointed, and will never purchase this product from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and truly hoped that my experience would be different BUT I must agree with the few that doubt the authenticity of this perfume. I tried it as soon as I received it yesterday and again today and both instances, after about 30 minutes, probably less....scent was gone. )-:&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very nice and strong when u first spritzed it, but scent doesn&#x27;t last at all. nothing like the sample I tried on in Macy&#x27;s...stayed on ALL day, which is why I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Good quality perfume.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I did something silly and bought a fragrance based on reviews and description alone. I had never actually smelled this product before I purchased it. But, i&#x27;ll have to admit that it is a really great perfume. It has a &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; smell to it... sort of akin to some of the Chanel scents -- Slightly musky (which I personally love), slightly floral... a little powdery (not particularly my bag, but it seems to diminish rather quickly). If you&#x27;re afraid of smelling &amp;#34;too old&amp;#34;, you may not be attracted to this scent. It also wears very nicely -- still on after a long day.</li>
            <li> Not at all like the product I smelled in mall stores. Did a comparison to a bottle from Sephora and Amazon&#x27;s is clearly a watered down designer imposters. I love Amazon however, now I know perfume is not their forte!</li>
            <li> By far, one of my favorite perfumes I&#x27;ve ever had. This perfume lasts all day and I get complements on it all the time.</li>
            <li> I have received numerous complimants on this fragrance.  Loved it so much that I bought it for my sister and mom as well.</li>
            <li> love it and it arrived in record time.  will order again!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my girlfriend for Christmas she loved it and it smells amazing on her. Great Buy. Great value.</li>
            <li> Gucci guilty is everything</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me for Christmas and I love it. The scent lasts all day and it isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> Is a polite and pretty scent for a woman. My wife wears often for almost any occassion, even work. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t let her wear to work....</li>
            <li> I love this scent!  I get so many compliments when I wear Gucci.  I always tell them the name of the scent and sell my friends on the product.  Thanks Gucci!</li>
            <li> Bought as a present for my girlfriend. What can I say: she is happy and likes it very much and I&#x27;m happy too. Very nice scent. I like it too.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes ever. Gucci never disappoints me.  I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for the past 2 years. I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it!  I actually bought the original bottle one year ago because the perfume she previously preferred was not in.</li>
            <li> Gucci? sure, My toilet water feels better. I hate to say this, but my girlfriend thinks I am a stupid for paying for this.</li>
            <li> Great gift for your loved one. Fast delivery time.</li>
            <li> I had package sent to my employment. The other ladies in the office were excited to see what I purchased.  The box containing the perfume was not sealed and the box itself looked like it was not an original Gucci box with washed out ink and color. The seal on the bottle was not original. I sprayed a little on my wrist. The ladies in my office all agreed I should retrun the perfume as the bottle looked tampered with and the odor was not orignal.  i went to return the perfume today to only find I unable to retun this product.&lt;br /&gt;There should be a warning when placing the order.  I have used this perfume for many years and this is not the original long lasting smell.  Very disappoiinted and I have learned a lessom.</li>
            <li> perfect just like i ordered.</li>
            <li> I brought Gucci Guilty as a gift for my fianc&amp;eacute; during the holidays. She loved it, so I have to say that it gets 5 stars. Really smells very elegant, a nice addition to her perfume collection.</li>
            <li> &amp;Oacute;timo perfume, o produto chegou em perfeito estado de conservação e dentro do prazo combinado. Recomendo a meus amigos. Obrigado.,</li>
            <li> I love perfume especially Gucci Guilty</li>
            <li> It is all right. It is great. It is exactly like view. It is a very good Parfum Spray for women.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it smells the same as I bought once from a tax free store in Francfurt. This smells differently and doesn&#x27;t hold long.</li>
            <li> I want to return this. I know it&#x27;s a flammable substance but why does it say its &#x27;non-returnable&#x27; even when it will be transported by road?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the same boat as many others commenting, here... I&#x27;ve been using this scent for *years*, and it&#x27;s definitely, beyond a doubt, diluted. I thought it was my imagination, and even bought it again unfortunately — it&#x27;s good that so many are able to comment regarding the seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this perfume is expired or what but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long. I wonder if that is why it was so much less than the store price. It smells good for awhile, but isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; long enough. :(. Probably won&#x27;t buy perfume online again.</li>
            <li> I like soft femine scents and this one is my new fave.  Lasts all day and I get compliments all the time. If you like Alien you&#x27;ll like Gucci  Guilty Intense.</li>
            <li> The item did not meet my expectation. I am giving it away.&lt;br /&gt;The ad on the product is over-hyped&lt;br /&gt;The shipping and everything was ok.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume for my birthday, wear it regularly and get a lot of compliments from complete strangers for it. The smell is &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34;, a bit mysterious and somehow it reminds me of summer/ fruity and the orient. Don&#x27;t know, it&#x27; s just a fantastic feminine blend. It&#x27;s among my top 3 favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> the item was just as describe which was exciting. I looked amazing in my new bottle of fragrance...I knew I would. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy from this Seller again. The item came on time if not sooner so I was able to enjoy my purchase on my first vacation of the summer.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and absolutely love it! Smell isnt overpowering but stays with you all day.  Get so many compliments when I wear this and mostly fron men &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is a good fragrance, why we can&#x27;t find it in a 4oz bottle? It would be nice for my wife.</li>
            <li> great product - thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Great Service and item</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gucci Guilty Intense for over a year now and still had a little left in my bottle to compare to the new one- this one barely had any sent to it at all!  Very upsetting that I have to send it back becasue they poured half of it out and replaced with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B006OMJ0FE Gucci Guilty Intense Eau De Parfum Spray for Women, 2.5 Ounce]] The Gucci Guilty Intense 2.5 OZ Spray EDP which I purchased from Amazon.com is the real deal. I love this scent. It is a soft oriental floral fragrance and IMO it is not the least bit over powering. The scent softens several seconds after applying it to my skin and admittedly is even more to my liking. However, it is a long lasting fragrance. I have gone to bed for the night wearing Gucci Guilty Intense EDP having applied it earlier in the evening and it&#x27;s fragrance continues to linger the very next morning. This fragrance has garnered many compliments especially from my discriminating young Niece. This is the very same scent, container, packaging, labeling, etc. as the Gucci Guilty Intense EDP I received from Sephora the very first time I had the pleasure of wearing it. I am so very pleased to have found this high dollar designer fragrance at such an affordable price on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for Gucci Guilty Intense....You can&#x27;t use more than one spritz because it is powerful. I read so many reviews where everyone raves and gets compliments. I think I smell like lady of the night....Sort of reminds me of the Opium my aunt wore in the 80s....or even Eternity. I can&#x27;t say anything great about it and I am sad I spent so much money on it. That&#x27;s why it is called Guilty Intense I suppose ...that&#x27;s the feeling you have when you realize you wasted hard earned money....</li>
