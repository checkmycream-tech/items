            <li> I tried a regular magnifying glass (the old hand held round type) and that was a pain to use as it only showed part of a sentence at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed is that it works well for me on short time views but becomes uncomforatble for long time views, probably due to its flexibility.</li>
            <li> Appears to be a hard straight piece of material</li>

            <li> If placed directly on page there is no magnification, so you have to hold it at a distance above page making it difficult to hold book/paper and the lens at the same time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin plastic lens which makes it hard to lay over a full page and read.</li>
            <li> Due to packaging it was creased in a circle but serves the purpose I need it for.</li>
            <li> It probably works well, but difficult to use when you have a book in your hands - it just wobbles about too much.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for someone almost blind, gave her a head ache</li>
            <li> Lay this down on any book, and be amazed that you can read any book.  </li>
            <li> sheet is made of plastic, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking or being heavy, as glass would be.</li>
            <li> Not a comfortable way to read books while you hold this flimsy thing.</li>

            <li> Due to packaging it was creased in a circle but serves the purpose I need it for.</li>
            <li> This sheet only magnifies 2x, which is not a huge amount, but in most cases I find that to be sufficient, such as for reading a telephone book, TV Guide, paperback novel, or tiny-print manual for an electronic device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions clearly state to hold it 4 inches away from whatever you want to read, which I have no trouble with. I find it convenient to have a magnifying sheet in a frame with an extended side that functions as a handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sheet is made of plastic, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking or being heavy, as glass would be. It is a convenient size, about the size of standard printer paper, that is, 8-1/2 x 11 inches. It will easily fit into a briefcase, on a clipboard, or in a notebook.</li>
            <li> Hello ... the product is excellent and very beautiful .. thank you .. and happy day</li>
            <li> it is magnifying much. You still need another magnifier</li>
            <li> This product arrived with a crack across the middle, rendering it unuseable.  I called the seller, American RX, and was told that the only way they could approve a return was if I took a photo of the item showing the damaged part and sent it by e-mail to them.  I do not have the facilities to do this.  Now I am out $7.81, which doesn&#x27;t seem like much.  But considering we live strictly on Social Security every little bit counts.  By the way, the man I spoke to regarding this problem was rather nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joan M. Weber</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not what I expected.  Bought two sorry I did,</li>
            <li> I was happy with it, the recipient was delighted.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t say that you had to hold it 4&amp;#34; away from the book to use it. Not a comfortable way to read books while you hold this flimsy thing.</li>
            <li> Lay this down on any book, and be amazed that you can read any book.  It&#x27;s light and flexible, and unbreakable.</li>
            <li> works great, enables me to see more of the page so I can read faster</li>
            <li> This is not as good as it sounds and really is not worth the amount of money I spent on it.[[ASIN:B000WOU38I Full Page Reading Book Magnifying Glass]] truthfully It should only be about 50 cents.. It&#x27;s cheap vinyl It is hard to use and it is not as soild as it look in the picture. basicly it is useless.</li>
            <li> Love it. Now I don&#x27;t have to special order &amp;#34;large print&amp;#34; books. I can read paper backs also including reguar text</li>
            <li> This is a flimsy piece of material. I got it for my father to read with, but his hands are shaky so this will not work. You can&#x27;t lay it on the paper because it&#x27;s not magnifying that way. You need to hold it up above the paper. Appears to be a hard straight piece of material</li>
            <li> the product description states this is a magnifying GLASS.  it is not glass, it is plastic.  plastic magnifiers distort the printed material which defeats the purpose of magnification.  I have vision problems and this product does not help.</li>
            <li> I can see what  reading  it&#x27;s amazing and light weight  prices great I recommend to anyone who likes to read</li>
            <li> This product is nothing like it was promoted to be. In the ad it looked to be able to stand over what you read of have a strap around your neck so you could read in any position you chose.</li>
            <li> Very good item a great help for reading fine print I would buy this item with no problems thanks for a great item</li>
            <li> This does not magnify at all when placed over a page; for example, telephone book. I do not recommend. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I buy books by the lot sometimes. Some are so old that the print is faded and really small. I tried a regular magnifying glass (the old hand held round type) and that was a pain to use as it only showed part of a sentence at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I found this magnifying lens and thought I would try it out. What a great buy!!! It&#x27;s light weight shows almost 1/4 page at a time and shows the whole sentence at one time.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who loves to read for hours at a time.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because this was a special gift to someone. I would like to commend this to those who have problems seeing small items.</li>
            <li> The lens isn&#x27;t of good quality but it still allows me to read the small writing on prescription bottles well.</li>
            <li> Evidently so did my husband, it seems to have relocated to his work binder.</li>
            <li> It was cheap made then I expected...I haven&#x27;t even used it...</li>
            <li> It did not work it was the worst \\&quot;magnafieing glass\\&quot; I hate it so much it&#x27;s a peas of s***</li>
            <li> Excellent choice for reading fine print</li>
            <li> Love this magnifying lens.Comes in handy for small print reading.plus my vision isn&#x27;t like it used to be before.&lt;br /&gt;MR.TULLO</li>
            <li> as promised&lt;br /&gt; it was given to my neighbor and she seems happy</li>
            <li> Almost useless to try to read print with it.</li>
            <li> I had a dozen emails which led me to believe this place hacked me</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Mom. She loves it! Great help with her eyesight as she gets older! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> product was not as good as it appeared</li>
            <li> Excellent!  It helps a lot.</li>
            <li> waste of money. wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was</li>
            <li> It does magnify. Are the letterings too small for the eyes and you do not use reading glasses? No problem. The only thing I noticed is that it works well for me on short time views but becomes uncomforatble for long time views, probably due to its flexibility.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend and she said it is a wonderful thing to use.  She uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was magnifying anything or not.  You had to hold it with one hand high over whatever you were trying to look at.  I arranged to send it back, so I hope I get a refund.</li>
            <li> It was folded in between when I received so it&#x27;s irritating to straighten , otherwise it is a nice product</li>
            <li> Works well, we built a stand for it, nice and easy to use for whole page of a book</li>
            <li> I just do not feel this item is as good as it should be. It&#x27;s still very difficult to read the pages underneath the magnifying glass. Seems to be easier to use a hand held magnifying glass than this.</li>
            <li> i bought this for a student of mine who has trouble reading small print. it was very inexpensive but serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for a make shift screen projector by the youtuber &#x3D;king of random</li>
            <li> It probably works well, but difficult to use when you have a book in your hands - it just wobbles about too much.  Not worth sending back, but not used now at all.</li>
            <li> I needed something when I couldn&#x27;t  find my reading glasses, great for books, newspapers, magazines, etc.  The plastic protective cover and the extended handle keeps your hands office the magnifying sheet. It can also work on a computer screen. Easy to clean.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really  see the pages</li>
            <li> I bought this full page magnifying lens thinking it was a solid plexi or glass lens, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a thin plastic lens which makes it hard to lay over a full page and read.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for someone almost blind, gave her a head ache, maybe the size should be pocket novel size</li>
            <li> If placed directly on page there is no magnification, so you have to hold it at a distance above page making it difficult to hold book/paper and the lens at the same time</li>
            <li> Hi quality item. Good price and quick shipping. My husband uses it at work on his iPad and it helps with less eyestrain and easy to read font.</li>
            <li> was not clear in its magnifying , worked okay but nothing great to write home to mom about.</li>
            <li> This is a very good item and I would buy it again if I need to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unhappy with this Item, It&#x27;s not what i expeted, The Item i ordered&lt;br /&gt;was alot smaller  on the order page and there&#x27;s no led light.</li>
            <li> this is ok, don&#x27;t use it much though</li>
            <li> This product does not provide adequate and clear visual reading ability. It is not a good product and was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my parents - as far as magnifying text it works but it is very flimsy and hard to use.</li>
