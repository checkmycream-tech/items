            <li>Will be buying more for the rest of my family.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;pen&amp;#34; holder worked perfectly for holding all my bigger makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Perfect to hold my makeup brushes even though it is actually a pen holder.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed and know it will last me for the rest of my life</li>
            <li>(it will never, ever EVER break, never mind dent, that&#x27;s for sure)</li>

            <li>I really do love it, but it just doesn&#x27;t fit on the layout of the counter around my sink.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>, my MAC Fix Plus bottle fits PERFECTLY into the round holder, I keep my beauty blenders in the front and</li>
            <li>But if you have the right space for it, you will love it.</li>

            <li>my lip pencils/brushes in the larger portion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it however you like, of course, but the fact is, it far outshines all the holders on my table, better than my Bed, Bath and Beyond ones, my Nordstrom Rack ones, Target ones, you name it.</li>
            <li>A little on the small side, but the smaller cup is perfect for eyeshadow/liner brushes.</li>
            <li>I can only fit 7 or 8 of my larger face brushes into the larger cup, but I have a LOT of brushes.</li>

            <li> I can fit 5-6 large brushes in the tallest cubby with room for smaller ones, I keep 10-12 pencils or small brushes in the round cubby, and the shortest cubby fits my stubby travel brushes and false eyelash</li>
            <li> surprisingly heavy for the size (not heavy, but it has weight for it&#x27;s size &amp;#60;1pound)</li>
            <li> We bought several of these for our mom who has minimal space in assisted living.  </li>
            <li> The interior dimensions of the individual cubbies from tallest to shortest are 1.6&amp;#34; by 3&amp;#34; (almost oval), 1.75&amp;#34; diameter (round), and 3.75&amp;#34; by 1.5&amp;#34; (rectangular).</li>
            <li> It stays firm and solid.</li>
            <li> Highest quality cosmetics holder I&#x27;ve ever purchased, hands down.</li>
            <li> Purchased with the hopes of using it for makeup brushes...too small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a pretty small base for everything it holds.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Measurements are 5&amp;#34; by 4&amp;#34; base, 4.5&amp;#34; height.</li>

            <li> Purchased with the hopes of using it for makeup brushes...too small but I&#x27;ll use it in my home office</li>
            <li> I got this for make up brushes and pencils and it is just right for me. It&#x27;s got a pretty small base for everything it holds. I can fit 5-6 large brushes in the tallest cubby with room for smaller ones, I keep 10-12 pencils or small brushes in the round cubby, and the shortest cubby fits my stubby travel brushes and false eyelash glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Measurements are 5&amp;#34; by 4&amp;#34; base, 4.5&amp;#34; height.

            <li> Highest quality cosmetics holder I&#x27;ve ever purchased, hands down. Picture does it injustice, actually. The acrylic is thicker, more clear and with softer edges than the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my MAC Fix Plus bottle fits PERFECTLY into the round holder, I keep my beauty blenders in the front and my lip pencils/brushes in the larger portion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it however you like, of course, but the fact is, it far outshines all the holders on my table, better than my Bed, Bath and Beyond ones, my Nordstrom Rack ones, Target ones, you name it.

            <li> I loved it&lt;br /&gt;And it holds a lot more than you&#x27;d think</li>
            <li> Perfect! It fits over 20 brushes depending of the size! I have 2 kabuki sets and the both fit confortable in it! A must have!</li>
            <li> I WISH THIS WORKED on my bathroom vanity!! I really do love it, but it just doesn&#x27;t fit on the layout of the counter around my sink. Very disappointing. But if you have the right space for it, you will love it. It IS a bit smaller than you might think -- just FYI.</li>
            <li> Wish it was cheaper, but happy to have it</li>
            <li> Exactly what you think you&#x27;re getting and it works great. I use it when I&#x27;m working as a makeup artist. It holds well and was a lot thicker and sturdier than I even thought. That is great because when you drop a brush or product into a compartment it doesn&#x27;t wiggle. It stays firm and solid. Great buy and great price.</li>
