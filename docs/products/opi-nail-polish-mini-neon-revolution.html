            <li>They match the ad perfectly!</li>
            <li>Over all happy with the item.</li>
            <li>Even with 2 coats of nail polish it did not look great...</li>
            <li>She was happy, I was happy :-)</li>
            <li>Granddaughter loved it.</li>
            <li>I really love the colors in this collection!</li>
            <li>I love it ..!</li>
            <li>Love the colors!</li>
            <li>I Absolutely love OPI!</li>
            <li>Takes too many coats to get good color</li>
            <li>These colors are super bright, good for the summer.  </li>
            <li>While a sample set may sound like a good way to get a color you want to try out, OPI&#x27;s signature brush style and polish thickness is what sets it apart from cheaper brands.</li>
            <li>but ok.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love them.</li>
            <li>They are bright and fun for the summer.</li>
            <li>Transaction was very easy, and delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li>This mini set doesn&#x27;t have either of those signature items, so you may as well buy the cheap brand at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>It worth it..!</li>
            <li>The blue is my most favorite though.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because the polish is a bit more opaque than normal for OPI colors.</li>
            <li>Would definitely order again. :)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting to have to use the white and then layer the colors on top</li>
            <li>Given as a gift and was very well received.</li>
            <li>very dissapointing...</li>
            <li>I love OPI polishes because they last a long time and are of higher quality than the cheaper brands.</li>
            <li>Even with a top coat, the polish was so cheap and thin, it chipped within hours of application.</li>
            <li>so it gets a bit thick on the nails, but otherwise it is a nice product.</li>
            <li>I like minis because I like to wear different colors and it seems like a full size bottle will dry out before I really get to use it all.</li>
            <li>i liked the colors plus the small sizes of the bottles not much waste left when you are finished with the colors.</li>
            <li>Better to spend a few extra bucks for a new set at the store.</li>
            <li>Old nail polish, runny and clumpy.</li>
            <li>I love that these come in small bottles so that I can wear them this summer and not end up with a big bottle of neon pink nail polish that I won&#x27;t touch again.</li>

            <li> I purchased this item for my 4 year old little girl.</li>
            <li> the white is not smooth and the yellow is not opaque as it looks it also leaves a yellow stain on nail</li>
            <li> NOT NEON PINK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read this same complaint about other mini polishes from OPI.</li>
            <li> less then a week</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why it is so hard to get nail salon neon pink.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s because the brush is so small, but it takes half a bottle to get any coverage.</li>
            <li> One was broken and I go it replace in  </li>
            <li> the white base coat was still showing through the color..</li>

            <li> NOT NEON PINK. I don&#x27;t understand why it is so hard to get nail salon neon pink. It&#x27;s a summer color staple. Shame on OPI for calling this &amp;#34;barbie pink&amp;#34; color &amp;#34;neon&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift and was very well received.</li>
            <li> Takes too many coats to get good color but ok.</li>

            <li> These colors are super bright, good for the summer.  The bottles are super-micor-mini though.  My daughter and I love them.</li>

            <li> I love OPI polishes because they last a long time and are of higher quality than the cheaper brands. That said--this sample set is not of OPI quality.

            <li> Colors were very sheer and didn&#x27;t go on well.</li>

            <li> bought as gift no complaints</li>
            <li> the white is not smooth and the yellow is not opaque as it looks it also leaves a yellow stain on nail</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loved it.</li>
