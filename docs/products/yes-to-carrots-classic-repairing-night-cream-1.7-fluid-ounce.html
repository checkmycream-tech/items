            <li>absorbs nicely into skin.</li>
            <li>that were much more hydrating than this one, but this stuff is just TOO good not to use.</li>
            <li>Rather than throw away, I repurposed it as a foot cream and have really liked it in that capacity.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect amount of thickness so that it&#x27;s not hard to spread but also not greasy.</li>
            <li>Like 40 carrots better, but this is a nice lotion.</li>
            <li>Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>Very nice night time moisturizer, I put it on right after I get out of the shower</li>
            <li>love this stuff...</li>
            <li>I just wish that it was MORE moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cruelty free! :)</li>
            <li>Am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love all the yes to products, and this keeps my face well hydrated through the night without breaking out when I use it.</li>
            <li>I love this night cream.</li>
            <li>which is mostly during the summer.</li>
            <li>but I guess I&#x27;m more of a</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance-free Yes to Carrots product line.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is so fantastic that I went to amazon to order more soon after.</li>
            <li>and it smells good; this one-not so much.</li>
            <li>Other than that, a great product!</li>
            <li>Not greasy, very good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>By the time I wake up, my face is GLOWING and looks SUPER HEALTHY.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a rich and substantial thickness which can easily be spread out across the face and throat.</li>
            <li>It was okay -not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for extra moisture.</li>
            <li>I have the light moisturizer as well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as 50 Carrots, my favorite, but it&#x27;s the closest second.</li>
            <li>It was fine, nothing special.</li>
            <li>It will last longer if you&#x27;re just applying at night) and I just love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Worth adding to your winter regimen!</li>
            <li>, I use this night cream when my normal moisturizer can&#x27;t do the job on it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a great moisturizer for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I am trying to phase more organic/natural products into my beauty routine and have really noticed a change.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I give out containers to my friends if they complain about their skin.</li>
            <li>and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Blends in quickly and works all night.</li>
            <li>What is interesting is that I paid $5 more for the same jar at Walmart.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it&#x27;s mostly all natural instead of slathering chemicals all over my face.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin, and this product is still a favorite.</li>
            <li>The price was better through Amazon than it would have been if purchased directly from the manufacturer and the shipping cost was lower through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>night use to place something on your face, but as far as enhancing skin texture, shrinking or diminishing wrinkles, laugh lines, crows feet, or helping to even out skin tones, it is not any better than anything else out there on the market.</li>
            <li>It is light and gets absorbed really fast.</li>
            <li>After years of buying inferior products, it&#x27;s nice to finally find one that is worth the money and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I love that this is natural and fragrance free for my sensitive nose and skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good hydrating moisturizer for a long time, buying all kind of products (more expensive than this one)</li>
            <li>My skin is definitely more hydrated, and the red, itchy patch on my forehead is gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this &amp; the entire &amp;#34;YES&amp;#34; line of products.  </li>
            <li>where&#x27;s it&#x27;s always hot and humid.</li>
            <li>I mostly use this night cream and the daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy, and although it does not absorb into the face completely, it absorbs enough to help moisturize it and the way it feels on the face is nice; its very comforting.</li>
            <li>I use this nightly after the Very Clear Dermae products on my forehead and eye area for extra moisture and love it.</li>
            <li>I used to live in an area that was somewhat mild and warm during the winter and when I moved to an area that gets below freezing at night sometimes, my face got dry, flaky, itchy, and just overall yucky.</li>
            <li>I can tell a real difference between nights where I remember to put it on and nights when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many face lotions that are supposed to be for sensitive skin and acne-prone (like from neutrogena and simple), and this is the only one that makes my skin so smooth and will not break me out.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t particularly enjoyed other</li>
            <li>I love other Yes</li>
            <li>But I will continue to buy and use this as my main nightcream.</li>
            <li>and it is not irritating to my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very rich cream, long lasting</li>
            <li>I struggle with psoriasis symptoms and I live in Texas</li>
            <li>my skin is very soft and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>After using this at night, it makes my skin look so alive and refreshed in the morning!</li>
            <li>i have super dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s helping to clear up my acne (which isn&#x27;t a benefit listed).</li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s a clear difference between using it at 10pm and using it at 10am.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin that is sensitive and acne-prone.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well, does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff does not irritate my sensitive skin or my allergies either.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase or suggest to someone that has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended for anyone with sensitive or dry skin looking for an all-natural cream that really works!</li>
            <li>I typically switch off between this night cream and a heavier night cream on some nights to provide more moisture to my face, but if your skin isn&#x27;t too dry, this is all you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Since my skin is actually a combination of oily and normal, I needed a moisturizer that would hydrate my skin, NOT oil it.</li>
            <li>It took about a month of aggressive treatments to get it to appear normal and this was the only thing that would keep my skin moisturized and prevent flakes from breaking out all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To CC cream in the morning and after only a few weeks am noticing a huge change in my skin.</li>
            <li>This last winter has definitely made a mark on my skin, leaving it completely dehydrated.</li>
            <li>It definitely moisturizes nicely, but it has a weird scent.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft &amp; hydrated, it is fragrance free, which surprisingly, is pretty hard to find, and you only have to use a small amount, so even though it&#x27;s only 1.7 oz</li>
            <li>i use it during the day because it&#x27;s thick but blends in quickly.</li>
            <li>Perhaps, for a normal and younger skin the product works well, mine is very dehydrated and needs a serious cream to keep it moist.</li>
            <li>I can definitely vouch that this product really helps with my dull and sensitive skin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> About a week before I get my period, I end up getting bad zits, mostly on my chin, but since I&#x27;ve been using this, it has helped to clear up my skin and this month I have had NO ZITS.</li>
            <li> However, for dry skin it could be not enough in winter.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed it fighting wrinkles or anything other than by helping moisturizer, but I have only been using it a couple weeks, and wasn&#x27;t expecting it too anyways.</li>
            <li> do recommend it for anyone struggling with psoriasis or stubborn, dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin used to be so dry and flaky from acne creams that I dramatically changed my skin care regime to be exclusively all-natural and fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> Without it, dry flaky patches annoy me to no end!</li>
            <li> Not really.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy, oily feel on your face like all the other brands and it leaves your face feeling revived</li>
            <li> it will last you at least 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> (it took me about a month and a half -</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s hardly any smell and it sinks into my skin almost immediately upon application.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t caused any additional skin issues and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or heavy.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it can feel a bit thick on your face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the bunny logo (Yes to Carrots products usually have the bunny logo).</li>
            <li> No breakouts or negative consequences.</li>
            <li> When I do remember to apply it before bed, I notice my skin isn&#x27;t as dull in the morning!</li>
            <li> Not to mention, my face breaks out very badly when it gets extremely dry.</li>
            <li> Since I used it at night time, it would go away by the morning, but it was uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> My skin reacted badly to another</li>
            <li> And there&#x27;s nothing bad in this product.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> When I do remember to apply it before bed, I notice my skin isn&#x27;t as dull in the morning! I can definitely vouch that this product really helps with my dull and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> love this stuff...i have super dry sensitive skin and i&#x27;ve tried everything. this is awesome. i use it during the day because it&#x27;s thick but blends in quickly.</li>
            <li> absorbs nicely into skin. my skin is very soft and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> Very rich cream, long lasting, I put it on a night and wake up feeling hydrated. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS NIGHT CREAM! After using this at night, it makes my skin look so alive and refreshed in the morning! There&#x27;s hardly any smell and it sinks into my skin almost immediately upon application. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy either, so you could even wear it during the day if you wanted! I have just gone through an entire tub (it took me about a month and a half - but I used this product during the day whenever I wasn&#x27;t going anywhere... It will last longer if you&#x27;re just applying at night) and I just love, love, love this stuff. My skin reacted badly to another Yes To night cream product, but this one makes my skin so radiant and I think it&#x27;s helping to clear up my acne (which isn&#x27;t a benefit listed). About a week before I get my period, I end up getting bad zits, mostly on my chin, but since I&#x27;ve been using this, it has helped to clear up my skin and this month I have had NO ZITS. NONE! It&#x27;s glorious! I just wish that it was MORE moisturizing. I wouldn&#x27;t classify this product as &amp;#34;intense hydration&amp;#34; because I&#x27;ve used night creams before that were much more hydrating than this one, but this stuff is just TOO good not to use. I typically switch off between this night cream and a heavier night cream on some nights to provide more moisture to my face, but if your skin isn&#x27;t too dry, this is all you&#x27;ll ever need. And there&#x27;s nothing bad in this product. I LOVE YES TO PRODUCTS!!!!! I&#x27;m off to buy another one! And I will keep on buying this until something changes or the product isn&#x27;t made anymore!</li>
            <li> Meh. It was fine, nothing special.</li>
            <li> This last winter has definitely made a mark on my skin, leaving it completely dehydrated. Since my skin is actually a combination of oily and normal, I needed a moisturizer that would hydrate my skin, NOT oil it. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good hydrating moisturizer for a long time, buying all kind of products (more expensive than this one) that didn&#x27;t relieve my red, itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy this product because it has Sodium Hyaluronate in its list of ingredients, which is known for its ability to bound water. I felt the difference in my skin 1-2 days after starting using it. My skin is definitely more hydrated, and the red, itchy patch on my forehead is gone.&lt;br /&gt;My only reservation is that this product is probably not cruelty-free. It doesn&#x27;t have the bunny logo (Yes to Carrots products usually have the bunny logo). According to the EWG website, Sodium Hyaluronate is derived from animals, so that&#x27;s probably the reason.</li>
            <li> Very nice night time moisturizer, I put it on right after I get out of the shower and it absorbs quickly. I can tell a real difference between nights where I remember to put it on and nights when I don&#x27;t. The next day, makeup goes on noticeably smoother. Without it, dry flaky patches annoy me to no end! I am trying to phase more organic/natural products into my beauty routine and have really noticed a change. Worth adding to your winter regimen!</li>
            <li> Just ordered my 4th jar!  Love this &amp; the entire &amp;#34;YES&amp;#34; line of products.  I used Philosophy for years &amp; this is every bit as good at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for sensitive skin. It is intense but not too heavy and it&#x27;s cruelty free! :)</li>
            <li> Am satisfied. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only night facial lotions that does not break me out. I have oily skin that is sensitive and acne-prone. I&#x27;ve used so many face lotions that are supposed to be for sensitive skin and acne-prone (like from neutrogena and simple), and this is the only one that makes my skin so smooth and will not break me out. I also like the fact that it&#x27;s mostly all natural instead of slathering chemicals all over my face.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin, and this product is still a favorite. I haven&#x27;t particularly enjoyed other yes to carrots products, but this one is a staple. It&#x27;s the perfect amount of thickness so that it&#x27;s not hard to spread but also not greasy. It does work best as a night product - even without putting makeup on over it or something, there&#x27;s a clear difference between using it at 10pm and using it at 10am. It just feels different. But I will continue to buy and use this as my main nightcream.</li>
            <li> I use Yes To Carrots every night and I have to say I LOVE it! It leaves my skin so soft &amp; hydrated, it is fragrance free, which surprisingly, is pretty hard to find, and you only have to use a small amount, so even though it&#x27;s only 1.7 oz it will last you at least 2-3 months. I highly recommend this product, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love all the yes to products, and this keeps my face well hydrated through the night without breaking out when I use it.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, deep moisturizing.  Like it!</li>
            <li> I love this night cream. I am in my mid twenties with combination skin and fairly regular (once a month) breakouts. This hasn&#x27;t caused any additional skin issues and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or heavy. I use this product at night and the Yes To CC cream in the morning and after only a few weeks am noticing a huge change in my skin. It is brighter and softer. I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> The hype sounded so great I thought I would try this face cream.&lt;br /&gt;Did it produce the desired results?  Not really.  Diminish lines?  No. Plump out wrinkles? No.&lt;br /&gt;What I do like about the product is that it has no fragrance and it is not irritating to my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;It has a rich and substantial thickness which can easily be spread out across the face and throat. It is non greasy with a pleasant feel.  The price was better through Amazon than it would have been if purchased directly from the manufacturer and the shipping cost was lower through Amazon.  It&#x27;s useable for every day and/or night use to place something on your face, but as far as enhancing skin texture, shrinking or diminishing wrinkles, laugh lines, crows feet, or helping to even out skin tones, it is not any better than anything else out there on the market. I did not find it to be as labeled &amp;#34;Intense Hydration&amp;#34; in any way.</li>
            <li> Like 40 carrots better, but this is a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well, does not irritate my sensitive skin. The night time residue lasts to the morning, which has pros and cons. No breakouts or negative consequences. Good winter moisture. It&#x27;s not as good as 50 Carrots, my favorite, but it&#x27;s the closest second.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Only complaint is that it can feel a bit thick on your face. Other than that, a great product! Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this cream, great moisturizer! Never burns my skin.</li>
            <li> It was okay -not crazy about it. I bought it with the intention to experiment with a product did not have reviews yet. I rubbed it onto my face, daily, at night, it did not help any way. Perhaps, for a normal and younger skin the product works well, mine is very dehydrated and needs a serious cream to keep it moist.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a great moisturizer for a very long time. I used to live in an area that was somewhat mild and warm during the winter and when I moved to an area that gets below freezing at night sometimes, my face got dry, flaky, itchy, and just overall yucky. Not to mention, my face breaks out very badly when it gets extremely dry. So, it took me two years to find this product and I will never leave it. It is non-greasy, and although it does not absorb into the face completely, it absorbs enough to help moisturize it and the way it feels on the face is nice; its very comforting. By the time I wake up, my face is GLOWING and looks SUPER HEALTHY. It has been years since I have been happy about looking at myself in the mirror after waking. My face is moisturized, clear, looks and feels great again! This stuff does not irritate my sensitive skin or my allergies either. I just love the way it feels!</li>
            <li> This cream works well for my ultra-sensitive skin. It is light and gets absorbed really fast. However, for dry skin it could be not enough in winter. I use it at night to supplement cocoa-based moisturizer that I use during the day.</li>
            <li> I love that this is natural and fragrance free for my sensitive nose and skin. I use this nightly after the Very Clear Dermae products on my forehead and eye area for extra moisture and love it. Blends in quickly and works all night. It&#x27;s great for extra moisture. I haven&#x27;t noticed it fighting wrinkles or anything other than by helping moisturizer, but I have only been using it a couple weeks, and wasn&#x27;t expecting it too anyways. I use a retinol for that.</li>
            <li> I struggle with psoriasis symptoms and I live in Texas where&#x27;s it&#x27;s always hot and humid. This product is what helped me get the psoriasis under control. It took about a month of aggressive treatments to get it to appear normal and this was the only thing that would keep my skin moisturized and prevent flakes from breaking out all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I use this night cream when my normal moisturizer can&#x27;t do the job on it&#x27;s own which is mostly during the summer. I feel like it instantly gives my skin what it needs to prevent flaking and I have to have some in the house at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it for anyone struggling with psoriasis or stubborn, dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local walmart to try. It is so fantastic that I went to amazon to order more soon after. What is interesting is that I paid $5 more for the same jar at Walmart. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy, oily feel on your face like all the other brands and it leaves your face feeling revived just like it says on the packaging. After years of buying inferior products, it&#x27;s nice to finally find one that is worth the money and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizing cream.  Not greasy, very good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It definitely moisturizes nicely, but it has a weird scent. I have the light moisturizer as well and it smells good; this one-not so much.</li>
            <li> After using for a week, it started giving me a red, itchy rash. Since I used it at night time, it would go away by the morning, but it was uncomfortable.  Rather than throw away, I repurposed it as a foot cream and have really liked it in that capacity.  I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase or suggest to someone that has sensitive skin.  I love other Yes To...products, but I guess I&#x27;m more of a Yes To Cucumbers girl.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance-free Yes to Carrots product line. I mostly use this night cream and the daily moisturizer. The night cream, especially, is amazing for my skin. It&#x27;s so hydrating and it did wonders for my acne. My skin used to be so dry and flaky from acne creams that I dramatically changed my skin care regime to be exclusively all-natural and fragrance-free. It&#x27;s amazing how well my skin has healed! I still get some acne here and there but it&#x27;s nothing compared to how my skin used to be. I love it so much that I give out containers to my friends if they complain about their skin. They always come back raving about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for anyone with sensitive or dry skin looking for an all-natural cream that really works!</li>
            <li> Great Service and wonderful cream.</li>
