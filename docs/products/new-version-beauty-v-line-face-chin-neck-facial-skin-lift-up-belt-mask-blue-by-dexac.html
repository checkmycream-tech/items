    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very good post for skin laser for neck.</li>
            <li>yes good very happy with it</li>
            <li>Once you get used to it, it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very cheaply made in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Jaw Bra that my doctor gave me after the procedure.</li>
            <li>i.stead of sleeping on one side always and having one side look slightly more worn on the other&lt;br /&gt;..pillow creases gravity</li>
            <li>My jaw line is getting more defined.</li>
            <li>so many people ask me if I have lost weight.</li>
            <li>Love it, it&#x27;s just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Love the idea but hurts my ears.</li>
            <li>Very good quality and provides necessary support</li>
            <li>Not agrewing the other good reviews.</li>
            <li>This item is made in Japan and think it&#x27;s made for more petite Asian women.  </li>
            <li>However, I cannot use it more than 15 minutes because it causes pain in the back of neck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot, way too hot for me to sleep in, works though.</li>
            <li>The material is not so good, but I think the product works if you keep using the facial mask on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I feel like the velcro should be a bit long so that it can be adjusted a bit more.</li>
            <li>Pretty much works like one of those workout waist cinches.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s done much.</li>
            <li>When wearing it for any length of time you have to contend with not hearing very well. . .</li>
            <li>I like this particular item because I believe I am getting results.</li>
            <li>So maybe this is helping with this particular activity.  </li>
            <li>VERY comfortable, but seems to run a bit small.</li>
            <li>I have not and the only difference has been my very &amp;#34;Faithful&amp;#34; use of this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay, not great</li>
            <li>It feels a bit odd at first.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It feels a bit odd at first.  </li>
            <li> Only used it a few times so far, but it seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> that is a minor issue but seemed to bother me a lot.</li>
            <li> If its tight on you, it will stretch out just enough by the third wearing.  </li>
            <li> For the price, its hard to go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - had a slight packaging smell; which went away after the first night.</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable to wear, but it works.</li>
            <li> I find the lower neck part feel too tight.  </li>
            <li> The neck part could be a little longer, however.</li>
            <li> It is a little tight, and not comfortable to wear as it does not have any ear cutouts.</li>
            <li> It was way too small.</li>
            <li> Also I.get bad jaw pain the next day after using it.</li>
            <li> not a good quality product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never know if it works or not because the first time I wore it (for just 20 minutes), I got a terrible heat rash.</li>
            <li> This item is VERY uncomfortable however, and it&#x27;s suggested to be used less than one hour a day.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> it is awful.</li>

            <li> fits well, seeing some improvement after 1 month of continuous wear, approx 2-4 hrs each night.</li>
            <li> VERY comfortable, but seems to run a bit small. Much better than the Jaw Bra that my doctor gave me after the procedure.</li>
            <li> not a good quality product</li>
            <li> It seems to work as planned.  The neck part could be a little longer, however.</li>
            <li> I find the lower neck part feel too tight.  I feel like the velcro should be a bit long so that it can be adjusted a bit more.</li>

            <li> Very good quality and provides necessary support</li>
            <li> Actually helps my tmj....keeps face lifted while u sleep  i.stead of sleeping on one side always and having one side look slightly more worn on the other&lt;br /&gt;..pillow creases gravity</li>
            <li> It is a little tight, and not comfortable to wear as it does not have any ear cutouts.</li>

            <li> it is awful.Itdoes nothing that it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I like this particular item because I believe I am getting results. Since I have been using the product I have had so many people ask me if I have lost weight. I have not and the only difference has been my very &amp;#34;Faithful&amp;#34; use of this product. I always use it when I run on the tread mill and it has been said that running loosens facial muscle and skin. So maybe this is helping with this particular activity.  The reason I am giving it only 4 star instead of five is that it has no ear holes. When wearing it for any length of time you have to contend with not hearing very well. . . .although that is a minor issue but seemed to bother me a lot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this at all.  I&#x27;ve had chin liposuction, and afterward, the plastic surgeon had me wear a similar item.  This item is VERY uncomfortable however, and it&#x27;s suggested to be used less than one hour a day.  However, I cannot use it more than 15 minutes because it causes pain in the back of neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hot, way too hot for me to sleep in, works though.</li>
            <li> yes good very happy with it</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  It&#x27;s just okay, not great</li>
            <li> Love the idea but hurts my ears. Maybe I&#x27;ll trim it</li>
