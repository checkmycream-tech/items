            <li> Its like white powder on my face. Does not fit, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This powder is awesome and inexpensive!! This amount lasts a long time, too. I usually apply twice each day.</li>
            <li> A mi esposa le encanta, no es la primera vez que compra este producto de clinique. La entrega fue super puntual.</li>
            <li> excellent quality, excellent brand I&#x27;ve used for several years and did not change enough skin covers, does not cause allergies and is the face you doll! was received quite quickly in its original box and is 100% reliable seller, would recommend! Hope to buy soon!</li>
            <li> I was at first hesitant with Clinique. I really love the coverage with this powder. It doesn&#x27;t go on cakey and it can have low to moderate (borderline full coverage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth and does not cause me to breakout. I also have used their moisturizer (lotion and gel), and I recommend using that before adding the powder. It helps set it a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other brands (MAC, Pur Minerals, and Estee Lauder), but this is still one of my favorites. I need to buy more of this and love how sometimes Clinique has promotions (free gift promotions).</li>
            <li> Being using this product for 10 years now and still love it!</li>
            <li> It is Clinique Superpowder, enough said!</li>
            <li> is an excellent opportunity price and product quality. rated 5 stars for that</li>
            <li> Todo bien!! realizo como se esperaba! sin detalles, todo en buen estado! sin embargo  recomendado con toda confianza! esperemos hacer negocios  futuro otra vez! saludos desde Venezuela.</li>
            <li> Nice and comfortable. However, its matifying effect doesn&#x27;t last for more than 2 hours on me, even though I have combo, not crazily oily skin, and it&#x27;s winter now</li>
            <li> Simple to use when I don&#x27;t want to use liquid foundation. Great to use especially during summer when I sweat and get a little greasy in my t zone.</li>
            <li> very good product. so far it has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> El articulo tal cual como describia el vendedor, el paquete arrivo en el tiempo previsto y el embalaje era el adecuado. No tengo ninguna queja.</li>
