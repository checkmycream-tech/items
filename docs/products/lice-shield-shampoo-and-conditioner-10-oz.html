            <li>This is great stuff!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome at repelling lice!</li>
            <li>It is awesome.</li>
            <li>If we do get lice again this year, I will be updating my review, so until then..no news is GOOD NEWS!</li>
            <li>Works wonders plus smells good :D</li>
            <li>we got rid of them and thought this would be a great way to prevent.</li>
            <li>I am still trying to determine if this is effective or not.</li>
            <li>Works very good thanks alot</li>
            <li>It does leave a noble scent, but honestly more could have been brought</li>
            <li>The product description led me to think this shampoo would be very mild however after we used it, my kids hair smelled just like Rid - the popular lice pesticide shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I also purchased their spray but was not as pleased with its ease of use.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, we use it for preventative measures.</li>
            <li>Great product fast delivery</li>
            <li>so when i found this product i just had to try it, and to my amazement she has not gotten lice since she started using this shampoo i love it and will continue using it until she is out of school</li>
            <li>When it has came down to hair conditions, we often want the best in protection.</li>
            <li>I ended up tossing it and just putting the kids hair in tight braids and hoping for the best.</li>
            <li>, my 4 yr old says it smells good..</li>
            <li>So far so good for me.  </li>
            <li>Smells strong but not bad.</li>
            <li>, the head just smells clean..</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a pleasant lemony aroma and I use it regularly.  </li>
            <li>Its been 2 weeks rounding out the first month of school, and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I happily obliged to spend $10+ on this miracle shampoo which would help us not go thru what other moms clearly were having to do.  </li>
            <li>Sometime, lice and bedbugs can be a very serious medical condition, and it sometimes takes much more than meets the eye to really hit the nail on the head at wanting the best in protection.</li>
            <li>Retired in Mexico, lots of lice at children&#x27;s school, very effective on my young daughter, other mothers are asking us to get them some also.</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it says, it repels Lice but doesn&#x27;t kill it.</li>
            <li>I love it and recommend it to all of my patients with lice to finally stop getting reinfested.</li>
            <li>after the first use, I was very pleased how shiney it left their hair the next morning.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is a good shampoo and conditioner for short to medium length but does not condition well enough for fine long hair</li>
            <li>Lice Shield is a specialty shampoo and conditioner in one pack that claims to be worth its money, but in long term, it actually doesn&#x27;t do the job at bringing out the best in protection after a few uses.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for only minor lice cases, but honestly you are just better off going somewhere else for extra protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:</li>
            <li>It really does smell like a citronella candle, however, as soon as you rinse, the smell is gone</li>
            <li>it smells like those candles that you light outside to kill mosquitos.</li>
            <li>I agreed to bring her to the pharmacy in hopes to talk with the pharmacist and find something we could use as a preventative to help avoid the whole lice thing.  </li>
            <li>Any info anyone has would be greatly appreciated.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The whole point of using Lice Shield was to avoid exposing my kids to Rid</li>
            <li>I tell my patients to treat with the Lice Free Spray and then use this at the next treatment.</li>
            <li>As of right now our plan is a early morning trip to the hairdresser in hopes of doing some type of bangs.  </li>
            <li>to make it more long lasting.</li>
            <li>but they have used it, the only thing it smells a little funny wasn&#x27;t sure about that, But if it works I don&#x27;t care how it smells.</li>
            <li>my daughter had gotten lice twice in one month at her new school</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sold on it, but it does seem to work - no lice so far....</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time and money on this product.</li>
            <li>my 6 yr old gags when I wash her hair in it</li>
            <li>My daughter is 10 years old.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo really works, at last my daughter got rid of her lice in just two weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>Hopefully these products work and in the mean time enjoying the shampoo.</li>
            <li>It might be good only in small cases, but if you have had long and difficult cases at getting rid of those pesky problems, it can be better if stronger.</li>

            <li> It smells like an elf vomited a candle, but it seems to keep other kids away and thus the lice.</li>
            <li> My kid&#x27;s have been lice free and it&#x27;s going around schools really bad....</li>
            <li> I used just 3-4 sprays of the leave in treatment, the smell also fades completely in a few minutes after application unless you compeletely saturate every strand of hair.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works yet, by the time we got it we had already treated there heads</li>
            <li> When I got up to the bathroom she was crying because part of her eyebrows had fallen out!  </li>
            <li> Of course hard to tell if it works</li>
            <li> we got rid of it with my 3 hours a day of nit picking; I&#x27;m adamant that we are NEVER getting this horrible bug again!</li>
            <li> As a young girl this is devastating!  </li>
            <li> I ordered this and the detangler when my daughter and grandaughter had a bad case.</li>
            <li> The smell is not so bad once you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed</li>
            <li> absolutely awful.</li>
            <li> My daughter was up in the shower when I heard her god awful</li>

            <li> Smells strong but not bad. Seems to repell bugs but if your child is still infested, you need to treat it before using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My kid smells like a citronella candle with this, but it&#x27;s kept the lice off!</li>
            <li> &#x27;tis the season - My daughter loves the citronella scent...I&#x27;m not sold on it, but it does seem to work - no lice so far....</li>
            <li> This stuff does NOT work!! My daughter got head lice at school and we treated her and competley got rid of nits and lice. I saw this product in the store and thought we would give it a try. We have been using this product for three weeks now at every bath and just tonight found lice on her again. Do not waste your time and money on this product. Highly disappointed</li>
            <li> My kindergartner got lice last year...we got rid of it with my 3 hours a day of nit picking; I&#x27;m adamant that we are NEVER getting this horrible bug again! EVER!  I got this shampoo and leave in spray at our local drug store for this price plus an attached $1 off coupon for each...my 6 yr old gags when I wash her hair in it, my 4 yr old says it smells good..go figure. It really does smell like a citronella candle, however, as soon as you rinse, the smell is gone, the head just smells clean..after the first use, I was very pleased how shiney it left their hair the next morning.  I used just 3-4 sprays of the leave in treatment, the smell also fades completely in a few minutes after application unless you compeletely saturate every strand of hair.  Its been 2 weeks rounding out the first month of school, and so far so good.  If we do get lice again this year, I will be updating my review, so until then..no news is GOOD NEWS!</li>
            <li> Of course hard to tell if it works unless it doesnt.  So far so good for me.  I work in a school where head lice goes around regularly.  The shampoo has a pleasant lemony aroma and I use it regularly.  I also purchased their spray but was not as pleased with its ease of use.  Hopefully these products work and in the mean time enjoying the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Have been using the product after my daughter caught lice at school we got rid of them and thought this would be a great way to prevent. Not so...  She got lice again after using the product for a month.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> When it has came down to hair conditions, we often want the best in protection. Sometime, lice and bedbugs can be a very serious medical condition, and it sometimes takes much more than meets the eye to really hit the nail on the head at wanting the best in protection. Lice Shield is a specialty shampoo and conditioner in one pack that claims to be worth its money, but in long term, it actually doesn&#x27;t do the job at bringing out the best in protection after a few uses. It might be good only in small cases, but if you have had long and difficult cases at getting rid of those pesky problems, it can be better if stronger. It does leave a noble scent, but honestly more could have been brought n to make it more long lasting. I would recommend it for only minor lice cases, but honestly you are just better off going somewhere else for extra protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality: C+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: C 1/2+</li>
            <li> I ordered this and the detangler when my daughter and grandaughter had a bad case.Not sure if it works yet, by the time we got it we had already treated there heads but they have used it, the only thing it smells a little funny wasn&#x27;t sure about that, But if it works I don&#x27;t care how it smells.</li>
            <li> Helps keep them pesky bugs off the kids.</li>
            <li> absolutely awful. it smells like those candles that you light outside to kill mosquitos.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says, it repels Lice but doesn&#x27;t kill it. I love this product, we use it for preventative measures. The smell is not so bad once you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Retired in Mexico, lots of lice at children&#x27;s school, very effective on my young daughter, other mothers are asking us to get them some also. But prior to using it, gotta lice comb the child.</li>
            <li> Works wonders plus smells good :D it also help soothed the irritation I felt.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 10 years old.  Recently she came home with a note stating lice was found at the club she goes to after school.  The thought of lice had her so freaked out.  I agreed to bring her to the pharmacy in hopes to talk with the pharmacist and find something we could use as a preventative to help avoid the whole lice thing.  The pharmacist recommended Lice Shield Shampoo.  I happily obliged to spend $10+ on this miracle shampoo which would help us not go thru what other moms clearly were having to do.  My daughter was up in the shower when I heard her god awful screams about 20 minutes after I had scrubbed her head with this shampoo.  When I got up to the bathroom she was crying because part of her eyebrows had fallen out!  I can not find any place on the internet that anyone has had the same issue.  She has a spot about an inch or so with no hairs.  As a young girl this is devastating!  School is going to be a task tomorrow.  As of right now our plan is a early morning trip to the hairdresser in hopes of doing some type of bangs.  Im curious if anyone else has run into this?  I plan on writing to the company as they have no information about side effects on bottle.  Any info anyone has would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I am still trying to determine if this is effective or not.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really works, at last my daughter got rid of her lice in just two weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!  It worked within two months of daily use.  It smells like an elf vomited a candle, but it seems to keep other kids away and thus the lice.</li>
            <li> My kid&#x27;s have been lice free and it&#x27;s going around schools really bad....</li>
            <li> Lice seems to circulate through my kids school regularly so I bought this product to be proactive and ward off the lice.  The product description led me to think this shampoo would be very mild however after we used it, my kids hair smelled just like Rid - the popular lice pesticide shampoo.  The whole point of using Lice Shield was to avoid exposing my kids to Rid but I feel like its practically the same thing.  I ended up tossing it and just putting the kids hair in tight braids and hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> The kids like the smell and use it daily.  I like that if there is a break-out of lice at the school, this may help!</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
            <li> my daughter had gotten lice twice in one month at her new school so when i found this product i just had to try it, and to my amazement she has not gotten lice since she started using this shampoo i love it and will continue using it until she is out of school</li>
            <li> this product works well as a deterrent&lt;br /&gt;it is a good shampoo and conditioner for short to medium length but does not condition well enough for fine long hair</li>
            <li> Works very good thanks alot</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome at repelling lice! I love it and recommend it to all of my patients with lice to finally stop getting reinfested. It is just tea tree oil shampoo but it works and you don&#x27;t have to make it yourself. I tell my patients to treat with the Lice Free Spray and then use this at the next treatment. It is awesome.</li>
