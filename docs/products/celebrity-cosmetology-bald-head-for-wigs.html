            <li>They are amazing.</li>
            <li>Great fit for me.  </li>
            <li>Our daughter used it for a school project and it was amazing.  </li>
            <li>I bought this products to style and comb my wigs on, then maybe one day attempt to start making my own wigs.</li>
            <li>I am capable of modifying it so it will be perfect for me, but if you need this for styling I would recommend http://amzn.com/B00A3XC098</li>
            <li>Looks nice.</li>
            <li>The bust is really nice.  </li>
            <li>I put a wig on her, give her a hat, crop the picture to hide the neck, and get a really nice display.</li>
            <li>I bought it Saturday and got it Monday nice package</li>
            <li>This is nice.</li>
            <li>This well priced head form has all the features of forms costing three times as much and is an excellent and versatile head form - I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Very good quality fits a clump and the delivery was fast</li>
            <li>I liked it very useful for my wigs !</li>
            <li>just what I wanted ,nice hand very good,just like it for my wigs.nice very nice .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine -- well made, sturdy, nice face.</li>
            <li>The price was very fair for such a nice item.</li>
            <li>I Love the wig stand.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Therefore, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll still be able to use it for wig-making intended purposes.</li>
            <li>I do not use adhesives, so I have to make sewing adjustments within the wig to make it smaller &amp; this head is perfect!</li>
            <li>Maybe a child sized wig would work better.</li>
            <li>This is much better than using the styrofoam heads .</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love how this looks</li>
            <li>OK I don&#x27;t use this head for it intended purpose.</li>
            <li>and this was perfect for a visual idea of how the design would look.</li>
            <li>I love my mannequin head.</li>
            <li>but she is cute.</li>
            <li>Looks better than in the picture.</li>
            <li>I did order more, do wish the cost wasn&#x27;t so much.&lt;br /&gt;Tracie Bobb, Philadelphia, Pa.</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>So much better than trying to get someone to model.</li>
            <li>head form is excellent - the bottom hole fits any standard head form mounting rod and makes working on wigs a breeze.</li>
            <li>Having a face also makes it easier to style and get a better sense of the astetic and perspective</li>
            <li>The head is lovely and is sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will quit borrowing my daughter&#x27;s head to fix my weave.</li>
            <li>It looks good just have to find the right stand</li>
            <li>We added a wig and a pair of glasses, and she looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>shipping is free, making this great product that much of a sweeter deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes making my wigs so much easier and gives me a good idea as to how the wig may look when put on since the face is made up.  </li>
            <li>The head form takes T-PINS easily and does so without any damage to the head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall quality of material is good and it does look realistic.</li>
            <li>Got decent make up and a fairly good skin tone.    </li>
            <li>This is really a pretty head with nice features.</li>
            <li>so it was priced fine.</li>
            <li>So I just had to readjust the process and it works fine</li>
            <li>very well made, love it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I open up the package and saw this beautiful face.  </li>
            <li>I got it for my little sister, who is into cosmetology and its perfect size for her wigs.</li>
            <li>that the head fit my holder piece</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a cheap halloween wig for her.</li>
            <li>Fit prefect for my wigs</li>
            <li>If you have any additional questions feel free to message me.  </li>
            <li>the head that will fit a 5/8&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I measured my head from and just kept wrapping the head with clear tape until I was able to get the same measurement on the head and know it&#x27;s a perfect fit.  </li>
            <li>She really has come in handy.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a cheap one but the mannequin</li>
            <li>- she makes an absolutely perfect subject!  </li>
            <li>Other wise im happy, reasonable pricing.</li>
            <li>nice quality....very realistic</li>
            <li>Stands nicely and is made with high quality plastic.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It is more close to a natural head shape and your wigs will fit snuggly :)</li>
            <li>It is a bit small to create your wig on but it is perfect for storage of your wigs.</li>
            <li>he is perfect but small</li>
            <li>I bought this so I would be able to take nice photos of the chemo caps I make for the local hospital and then post them on Ravelry.  </li>
            <li>have returned the items for full refund.</li>
            <li>Good product and the same supply pictureÂ </li>
            <li>but he came in such good condition</li>
            <li>This is a good quality product and was shipped on the same day ordered.  </li>
            <li>and I was hoping to show true size of a woman&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li>I suppose if you needed it for other purposes it would be great</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a great wig head.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a bit more realistic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do hair or make-up, but I use these for artistic purposes.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>I use this head, along with a wig I purchased, to test camera and light setups for photography - much easier than finding a model when</li>
            <li>* disclaimer : this item was purchased for personal use with my own money.</li>
            <li>use it for education for nurses on how to suction patients and how to complete trache care love</li>
            <li>This looks incredibly lifelike with or without a wig.</li>
            <li>not for cosmetology reasons, but for designing hats or just having some fun with them like at Halloween.  </li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>so you buy the right size.  </li>
            <li>Good price, nice quality, fits well enough on the little mount that they recommend.</li>
            <li>Great as pictured only thing maybe smaller than 21 inches</li>
            <li>, I like it because it isn&#x27;t just a plain \\&quot;white\\&quot; blank style, but it has \\&quot;makeup\\&quot; on and is perfect for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>Looks exactly as it is pretrade on the website.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to make my wigs.</li>
            <li>Painted features are pretty.</li>
            <li>Whoever packed it needs to put in more more protection as the small amount of packing bubbles didn&#x27;t protect it and</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Really like this product!</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured and described.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need to work on hairpieces or wigs when I need a waterproof environment.</li>
            <li>But I got the one above I&#x27;m thinking about ordering two more before there out of stock</li>
            <li>I got this in less days then expected, in perfect shape, not damaged in any way.  </li>
            <li>so I can place the wig straight and know that it is on right.</li>
            <li>You also have to be careful because the head and face stain very easily.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and she is pretty can&#x27;t wait to make me a wig on Dallas...</li>
            <li>Not a bad thing, It surprised me.</li>
            <li>The construction of the head looks very realistic.</li>
            <li>BUT, lace wigs are made too large to be worn (undetectably) without adhesives.</li>
            <li>Considering a canvas head can cost easily cost around $60 this one is a true bargain at less than $20 - not mention it&#x27;s Prime</li>
            <li>The cost was reasonable for what you get.</li>
            <li>IT LOOKS REAL.</li>
            <li>This has really been a life savior for me.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>She was so amazed over how detailed the facial features were!</li>
            <li>and it came so fast</li>
            <li>She is so much prettier in person.  </li>
            <li>Haha, and it&#x27;s really sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Better then I expected!</li>
            <li>The bald head did not show the items off to their full potential</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a realistic size and works well.  </li>
            <li>Decent quality</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I love this haed its a little smell</li>
            <li>It is a lot easier to use a wig head than make family members sit while I set up my light and due test shoot.</li>
            <li>Returning it and ordering a new one.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i get a whim to try something new.</li>
            <li>This head is okay, but too small for my purposes.</li>
            <li>I wanted a wig stand that could sit prettily on my dresser instead of one of those unattractive white foam jobs.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing to really say but It is what I expected nothing more and nothing less</li>
            <li>My holder was too large and thankfully i still had a smaller piece to use, but its still bigger and doesn&#x27;t sit as well as i would like, but one can certainly make it work.</li>
            <li>A little freaky to look at, but fantastic for placing a wig and styling hair</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, It fits my attachment to my old head from another brand.</li>
            <li>The wig doesn&#x27;t stay very well but whatever, the hats or headbands hold it on well enough for a &amp;#34;for sale&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Have an old wig that I put on her and voila</li>
            <li>I was like wow.</li>
            <li>But after reading some of these reviews, I am learning that the wig head is most likely smaller than the average woman&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>If you are useing this to style wigs on please be aware it is considerably smaller then an average adult head.</li>
            <li>The eyes and lips look natural enough.</li>
            <li>The head is just a bit smaller than a human head and just a not that much definition in the back but its not flat.  </li>
            <li>Mine got stained the first day just from dye just from having a black weaving cap on it.  </li>
            <li>Since I have started using the head, which I named Ilia I have been able to fine tune my portrait lighting without annoying my family.</li>
            <li>It is very esay to support wigs with T-pins due to whatever materials the head is made of.</li>
            <li>1st off let me say the only thing I like is the fast shipment but other</li>
            <li>I spent an hour styling an updo only to find it was to small to fit a human head after.</li>
            <li>But I learned something new from the experience, I will now be washing all of my weaving caps before making my wigs, I didn&#x27;t have a clue that they had so much dye on them which mean all of that dye is getting in my hair.  </li>

            <li> works great &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The price can not be better!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> The head would be even better if it came with a wig!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the image and is perfect.</li>
            <li> They are amazing.</li>
            <li> Great fit for me.  </li>
            <li> Our daughter used it for a school project and it was amazing.  </li>
            <li> I bought this products to style and comb my wigs on, then maybe one day attempt to start making my own wigs.</li>
            <li> I am capable of modifying it so it will be perfect for me, but if you need this for styling I would recommend http://amzn.com/B00A3XC098</li>
            <li> Looks nice.</li>
            <li> The bust is really nice.  </li>
            <li> I put a wig on her, give her a hat, crop the picture to hide the neck, and get a really nice display.</li>
            <li> I bought it Saturday and got it Monday nice package</li>
            <li> This is nice.</li>
            <li> This well priced head form has all the features of forms costing three times as much and is an excellent and versatile head form - I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Very good quality fits a clump and the delivery was fast</li>
            <li> I liked it very useful for my wigs !</li>
            <li> just what I wanted ,nice hand very good,just like it for my wigs.nice very nice .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine -- well made, sturdy, nice face.</li>
            <li> The price was very fair for such a nice item.</li>
            <li> I Love the wig stand.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Therefore, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll still be able to use it for wig-making intended purposes.</li>
            <li> I do not use adhesives, so I have to make sewing adjustments within the wig to make it smaller &amp; this head is perfect!</li>
            <li> Maybe a child sized wig would work better.</li>
            <li> This is much better than using the styrofoam heads .</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love how this looks</li>
            <li> OK I don&#x27;t use this head for it intended purpose.</li>
            <li> and this was perfect for a visual idea of how the design would look.</li>
            <li> I love my mannequin head.</li>
            <li> but she is cute.</li>
            <li> Looks better than in the picture.</li>
            <li> I did order more, do wish the cost wasn&#x27;t so much.&lt;br /&gt;Tracie Bobb, Philadelphia, Pa.</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> So much better than trying to get someone to model.</li>
            <li> head form is excellent - the bottom hole fits any standard head form mounting rod and makes working on wigs a breeze.</li>
            <li> Having a face also makes it easier to style and get a better sense of the astetic and perspective</li>
            <li> The head is lovely and is sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will quit borrowing my daughter&#x27;s head to fix my weave.</li>
            <li> It looks good just have to find the right stand</li>
            <li> We added a wig and a pair of glasses, and she looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> shipping is free, making this great product that much of a sweeter deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes making my wigs so much easier and gives me a good idea as to how the wig may look when put on since the face is made up.  </li>
            <li> The head form takes T-PINS easily and does so without any damage to the head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall quality of material is good and it does look realistic.</li>
            <li> Got decent make up and a fairly good skin tone.    </li>
            <li> This is really a pretty head with nice features.</li>
            <li> so it was priced fine.</li>
            <li> So I just had to readjust the process and it works fine</li>
            <li> very well made, love it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I open up the package and saw this beautiful face.  </li>
            <li> I got it for my little sister, who is into cosmetology and its perfect size for her wigs.</li>
            <li> that the head fit my holder piece</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a cheap halloween wig for her.</li>
            <li> Fit prefect for my wigs</li>
            <li> If you have any additional questions feel free to message me.  </li>
            <li> the head that will fit a 5/8&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I measured my head from and just kept wrapping the head with clear tape until I was able to get the same measurement on the head and know it&#x27;s a perfect fit.  </li>
            <li> She really has come in handy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a cheap one but the mannequin</li>
            <li> - she makes an absolutely perfect subject!  </li>
            <li> Other wise im happy, reasonable pricing.</li>
            <li> nice quality....very realistic</li>
            <li> Stands nicely and is made with high quality plastic.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is more close to a natural head shape and your wigs will fit snuggly :)</li>
            <li> It is a bit small to create your wig on but it is perfect for storage of your wigs.</li>
            <li> he is perfect but small</li>
            <li> I bought this so I would be able to take nice photos of the chemo caps I make for the local hospital and then post them on Ravelry.  </li>
            <li> have returned the items for full refund.</li>
            <li> Good product and the same supply pictureÂ </li>
            <li> but he came in such good condition</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product and was shipped on the same day ordered.  </li>
            <li> and I was hoping to show true size of a woman&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> I suppose if you needed it for other purposes it would be great</li>
            <li> Other than that this is a great wig head.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a bit more realistic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do hair or make-up, but I use these for artistic purposes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I use this head, along with a wig I purchased, to test camera and light setups for photography - much easier than finding a model when</li>
            <li> * disclaimer : this item was purchased for personal use with my own money.</li>
            <li> use it for education for nurses on how to suction patients and how to complete trache care love</li>
            <li> This looks incredibly lifelike with or without a wig.</li>
            <li> not for cosmetology reasons, but for designing hats or just having some fun with them like at Halloween.  </li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> so you buy the right size.  </li>
            <li> Good price, nice quality, fits well enough on the little mount that they recommend.</li>
            <li> Great as pictured only thing maybe smaller than 21 inches</li>
            <li> , I like it because it isn&#x27;t just a plain \\&quot;white\\&quot; blank style, but it has \\&quot;makeup\\&quot; on and is perfect for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> Looks exactly as it is pretrade on the website.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to make my wigs.</li>
            <li> Painted features are pretty.</li>
            <li> Whoever packed it needs to put in more more protection as the small amount of packing bubbles didn&#x27;t protect it and</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Really like this product!</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured and described.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need to work on hairpieces or wigs when I need a waterproof environment.</li>
            <li> But I got the one above I&#x27;m thinking about ordering two more before there out of stock</li>
            <li> I got this in less days then expected, in perfect shape, not damaged in any way.  </li>
            <li> so I can place the wig straight and know that it is on right.</li>
            <li> You also have to be careful because the head and face stain very easily.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and she is pretty can&#x27;t wait to make me a wig on Dallas...</li>
            <li> Not a bad thing, It surprised me.</li>
            <li> The construction of the head looks very realistic.</li>
            <li> BUT, lace wigs are made too large to be worn (undetectably) without adhesives.</li>
            <li> Considering a canvas head can cost easily cost around $60 this one is a true bargain at less than $20 - not mention it&#x27;s Prime</li>
            <li> The cost was reasonable for what you get.</li>
            <li> IT LOOKS REAL.</li>
            <li> This has really been a life savior for me.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> She was so amazed over how detailed the facial features were!</li>
            <li> and it came so fast</li>
            <li> She is so much prettier in person.  </li>
            <li> Haha, and it&#x27;s really sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Better then I expected!</li>
            <li> The bald head did not show the items off to their full potential</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a realistic size and works well.  </li>
            <li> Decent quality</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love this haed its a little smell</li>
            <li> It is a lot easier to use a wig head than make family members sit while I set up my light and due test shoot.</li>
            <li> Returning it and ordering a new one.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i get a whim to try something new.</li>
            <li> This head is okay, but too small for my purposes.</li>
            <li> I wanted a wig stand that could sit prettily on my dresser instead of one of those unattractive white foam jobs.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing to really say but It is what I expected nothing more and nothing less</li>
            <li> My holder was too large and thankfully i still had a smaller piece to use, but its still bigger and doesn&#x27;t sit as well as i would like, but one can certainly make it work.</li>
            <li> A little freaky to look at, but fantastic for placing a wig and styling hair</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, It fits my attachment to my old head from another brand.</li>
            <li> The wig doesn&#x27;t stay very well but whatever, the hats or headbands hold it on well enough for a &amp;#34;for sale&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Have an old wig that I put on her and voila</li>
            <li> I was like wow.</li>
            <li> But after reading some of these reviews, I am learning that the wig head is most likely smaller than the average woman&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> If you are useing this to style wigs on please be aware it is considerably smaller then an average adult head.</li>
            <li> The eyes and lips look natural enough.</li>
            <li> The head is just a bit smaller than a human head and just a not that much definition in the back but its not flat.  </li>
            <li> Mine got stained the first day just from dye just from having a black weaving cap on it.  </li>
            <li> Since I have started using the head, which I named Ilia I have been able to fine tune my portrait lighting without annoying my family.</li>
            <li> It is very esay to support wigs with T-pins due to whatever materials the head is made of.</li>
            <li> 1st off let me say the only thing I like is the fast shipment but other</li>
            <li> I spent an hour styling an updo only to find it was to small to fit a human head after.</li>
            <li> But I learned something new from the experience, I will now be washing all of my weaving caps before making my wigs, I didn&#x27;t have a clue that they had so much dye on them which mean all of that dye is getting in my hair.  </li>
            <li> is certainly smaller than a typical caucasian female adult&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> So far only a couple clamps found seem to work, leaves little room for finding a discounted clamp.  </li>
            <li> The back of the head is not flat as someone else said and the plastic is thick and holds shape, but soft enough to stick T pins in to hold a wig in place.</li>
            <li> it looks natural with a little added color.</li>
            <li> This head is a little smaller than a regular human head</li>
            <li> Shipment didn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> As I said in the title, it is a nice quality product - I was just disappointed by the flat</li>
            <li> The other head that I had was slightly larger than this .</li>
            <li> The only con I would say is it is somehow dyed on the inner parts of the head and when you take the pins out the color bleeds a little.</li>
            <li> No flat space as mentioned by a previous reviewer.</li>
            <li> She is not flat on the back, either, as someone else said, and the material is hard, not soft.</li>
            <li> This head is not the same size as a typical woman&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> The wig is a little big for her</li>
            <li> As far as the size, it may be a tad bit small in circumference than the standard size small lace wig.</li>
            <li> I received my items sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> - The product is made of rubber and is hollow, making the head &amp;#34;squishy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The head is much smaller than I expected it to be and the hole at the bottom does not fit my wig clamp at all!  </li>
            <li> every other respect</li>
            <li> My wig doesn&#x27;t slip off of it like with some other kinds of wig heads.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> My complaint is with the big arched eyebrows.</li>
            <li> the bottom black part look like its falling off</li>
            <li> which is why I think it slides around a little.</li>
            <li> Please be advised this mannequin head will not fit on the stand.</li>
            <li> I have one downfall it does not fit on a salon care C clamp</li>
            <li> and theres a hole in the base that fits a light stand</li>
            <li> They are quite heavy and stay in place while combing the wig or storing it.</li>
            <li> This product is just what I had thought was not available.</li>
            <li> just plain ugly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Way too small.</li>
            <li> A head model that is this small isn&#x27;t up to the job.</li>
            <li> The head is a bit small.</li>
            <li> I must say I do love the quality and weight of this wig head, however I must interject that this is a terrible head for styling wigs.</li>
            <li> Should give just enough creepy factor when the eyes are staring at you through the mask.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the head is kinda small.</li>
            <li> this head is too small.</li>
            <li> Kinda small for a woman&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> Head is small tho</li>
            <li> Very firm plastic/foam ?  </li>
            <li> It is a hard plastic not rubber</li>
            <li> I did not find it to be a very small head as others indicated.</li>
            <li> The makeup she had was too subtle for my tastes</li>
            <li> this  product has a thin rubber outer layer over a styrafoam head.</li>
            <li> This product has a thin rubber outer layer over a styrafoam head.  </li>
            <li> Glued on false eyelashes</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I Love the wig stand. I bought 4 !!  They are amazing.</li>
            <li> 1st off let me say the only thing I like is the fast shipment but other n that the head fit my holder piece I already had it just wnt turn wit it then...the bottom black part look like its falling off but they glue it back on it okay</li>
            <li> Very good quality fits a clump and the delivery was fast</li>
            <li> I bought this products to style and comb my wigs on, then maybe one day attempt to start making my own wigs. But after reading some of these reviews, I am learning that the wig head is most likely smaller than the average woman&#x27;s head. Therefore, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll still be able to use it for wig-making intended purposes.</li>
            <li> This head is okay, but too small for my purposes. It&#x27;s advertised as being 20&amp;#34; around, which is still smallish for a female head. I measure it at about 18.5&amp;#34;. Way too small. I need to model for photos hats I have designed and knit for actual human heads. A head model that is this small isn&#x27;t up to the job. The hats just look ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In every other respect it&#x27;s fine -- well made, sturdy, nice face. But the size is hopeless.</li>
            <li> This head arrived on time and in great condition. As far as the size, it may be a tad bit small in circumference than the standard size small lace wig. BUT, lace wigs are made too large to be worn (undetectably) without adhesives. I do not use adhesives, so I have to make sewing adjustments within the wig to make it smaller &amp; this head is perfect! It is very esay to support wigs with T-pins due to whatever materials the head is made of. Oh yeah, It fits my attachment to my old head from another brand.</li>
            <li> I got this in less days then expected, in perfect shape, not damaged in any way.  It&#x27;s working out great for my photography course practices for portaiture.  I suppose if you needed it for other purposes it would be great, I like it because it isn&#x27;t just a plain \\&quot;white\\&quot; blank style, but it has \\&quot;makeup\\&quot; on and is perfect for my purposes.  I put a wig on it so it&#x27;s a bit more realistic.</li>
            <li> This head is great for displaying wigs or hats.  It&#x27;s a realistic size and works well.  Excellent for displaying sunglasses as well.</li>
            <li> Great for holding wigs</li>
            <li> This head is a little smaller than a regular human head but I find it works good for my purposes. I crochet so I use this head to model hats and headbands for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a cheap halloween wig for her. The wig doesn&#x27;t stay very well but whatever, the hats or headbands hold it on well enough for a &amp;#34;for sale&amp;#34; picture. I don&#x27;t know about using pins to keep it in place because I don&#x27;t want to put holes in her head. The wig is a little big for her which is why I think it slides around a little. Maybe a child sized wig would work better.</li>
            <li> Shipment didn&#x27;t take long. The head is a bit small.</li>
            <li> great for making wigs</li>
            <li> This was a beautiful face wig head. I did not find it to be a very small head as others indicated. I bought a chin strap that holds to the side of the wig that helps you to style the wig.  The cost was reasonable for what you get. I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This wig stand was perfect match for the Wizard of OZ Glenda wig I purchased. Looks exactly as it is pretrade on the website. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> WITH A WIG  IT LOOKS REAL. GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to make my wigs. It has the ideal weight for steadiness while your sewing. This is much better than using the styrofoam heads . I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Better then I expected!</li>
            <li> Love it. Fit prefect for my wigs</li>
            <li> I must say I do love the quality and weight of this wig head, however I must interject that this is a terrible head for styling wigs. I am capable of modifying it so it will be perfect for me, but if you need this for styling I would recommend http://amzn.com/B00A3XC098 It is more close to a natural head shape and your wigs will fit snuggly :)</li>
            <li> Was a great tool for my girlfriends state board test,  and she passed by the way</li>
            <li> This is a great stand, good size and push pins work well with it also. My holder was too large and thankfully i still had a smaller piece to use, but its still bigger and doesn&#x27;t sit as well as i would like, but one can certainly make it work.</li>
            <li> Looks nice. Painted features are pretty. It is a hard plastic not rubber so it was priced fine. Whoever packed it needs to put in more more protection as the small amount of packing bubbles didn&#x27;t protect it and the nose arrived smashed in.  Returning it and ordering a new one.</li>
            <li> I love how this looks and it does it&#x27;s job.  My wig doesn&#x27;t slip off of it like with some other kinds of wig heads.  works great &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Definitely works for me!</li>
            <li> Bought this to take my practical for the Esthetician license, it served the purpose. The only thing is I had to take acetone nail polish remover to remove the make-up that was on the doll head&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Sturdy piece.  Attractive to have your wig sit on rather then a plastic stand.  Good price for what you receive.</li>
            <li> The bust is really nice.  It will work well for practicing makeup, displaying wigs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price can not be better!</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for to add to my Halloween decorations. It is a good size and the fact that this one is bald will work well with the gas mask that I will be putting on it. Should give just enough creepy factor when the eyes are staring at you through the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall quality of material is good and it does look realistic.</li>
            <li> I use this head to store my homemade wigs.  It is a bit small to create your wig on but it is perfect for storage of your wigs. If you would like to create a wig on this head I would suggest building it up to match the measurements of your head.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> fits well for my head</li>
            <li> Hello My name is Breana Williams, I was looking for something I could make my personal wigs on. This head is not the same size as a typical woman&#x27;s head. So I would not recommend for those uses. However, if you own a store or if you would just like to use this head to store your wigs that are already made this item would work perfectly. In addition I purchased a mannequin stand to go with this item. Please be advised this mannequin head will not fit on the stand. If you have any additional questions feel free to message me.  ** disclaimer : this item was purchased for personal use with my own money. thank you.</li>
            <li> I received my mannequin head in the timeline provided by the seller.  The head is much smaller than I expected it to be and the hole at the bottom does not fit my wig clamp at all!  The hole is much smaller than the styrofoam heads.  I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted a wig stand that could sit prettily on my dresser instead of one of those unattractive white foam jobs.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for displaying my custom wigs.</li>
            <li> OK I don&#x27;t use this head for it intended purpose. Rather I use this head to test portrait lighting setups. It is a lot easier to use a wig head than make family members sit while I set up my light and due test shoot. Since I have started using the head, which I named Ilia I have been able to fine tune my portrait lighting without annoying my family. Also if you thinking about doing the same thing I can tell you the there is an opening in the bottom the head that will fit a 5/8&amp;#34; light stand head perfectly.</li>
            <li> I use this head, along with a wig I purchased, to test camera and light setups for photography - much easier than finding a model when&lt;br /&gt;i get a whim to try something new.</li>
            <li> Best head for practice dues this  product has a thin rubber outer layer over a styrafoam head. Our daughter used it for  decorating her wigs which she use to  learn different hair styles it is a amazing mannequin Packaging and shipping was great. Received it in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I wanted to design some headwraps  and this was perfect for a visual idea of how the design would look. Good quality.</li>
            <li> I love my mannequin head. It came very quickly and in awesome condition. I like the materal that it is made out of. Not sure exactly what it is called but I like it anyway.  It holds my wig and I will also be using it to make custom wig units for display. I will have an updated review to talk about how it works with the &amp;#34;Budget Manikin Holder&amp;#34; that I also purchased to clamp it onto the table once I put it together and figure it out. Great product. Serves its purpose. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my daughter to display wedding veils and headdresses on .  Only problem will be securing the wigs onto the head !  Very firm plastic/foam ?  It is for photo advertising on line.  So I figure she will have to maybe glue the wig on !</li>
            <li> If you are useing this to style wigs on please be aware it is considerably smaller then an average adult head. I spent an hour styling an updo only to find it was to small to fit a human head after. I now wrap it in a small towle first to add circumfrance. Other wise im happy, reasonable pricing.</li>
            <li> We added a wig and a pair of glasses, and she looks pretty good. My complaint is with the big arched eyebrows. But for the price, she will do what I need, which is be still and quiet while I practice portrait lighting. She is not flat on the back, either, as someone else said, and the material is hard, not soft. The eyes and lips look natural enough.</li>
            <li> Beautiful head for wig. Did not come with stand though.</li>
            <li> This has really been a life savior for me.  It makes making my wigs so much easier and gives me a good idea as to how the wig may look when put on since the face is made up.  I think that it was a good buy for the price.  The head is just a bit smaller than a human head and just a not that much definition in the back but its not flat.  I measured my head from and just kept wrapping the head with clear tape until I was able to get the same measurement on the head and know it&#x27;s a perfect fit.  You also have to be careful because the head and face stain very easily. Mine got stained the first day just from dye just from having a black weaving cap on it.  But I learned something new from the experience, I will now be washing all of my weaving caps before making my wigs, I didn&#x27;t have a clue that they had so much dye on them which mean all of that dye is getting in my hair.  Over all I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I would be able to take nice photos of the chemo caps I make for the local hospital and then post them on Ravelry.  This is really a pretty head with nice features.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time. Product as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great as pictured only thing maybe smaller than 21 inches</li>
            <li> The product was not the pictured item. They seemed like seconds, pits in the face, bulging heads, just plain ugly.&lt;br /&gt;I have returned the items for full refund.</li>
            <li> I purchased this head to practice portrait photography.  There is a hole in the neck and I have placed it on a tripod to stabilize it and get it at the correct height.  Poked some holes in her ears and inserted earings.  Glued on false eyelashes (because she doesn&#x27;t come with eyelashes - just painted on).  Have an old wig that I put on her and voila - she makes an absolutely perfect subject!  Really like this product!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and she is pretty can&#x27;t wait to make me a wig on Dallas...that is what I named her! ð</li>
            <li> Excellent quality head with very nice makeup detail makes this a great value!  I would recommend this to anyone who needs this type of head for either styling or display.</li>
            <li> Good price, nice quality, fits well enough on the little mount that they recommend. I got a different head than pictured. The one I got looks younger and has smaller lips, eyes, nose - but she is cute. The makeup she had was too subtle for my tastes so I colored on her face with Sharpies. The colors held up and did well so far.&lt;br /&gt;I got this head to make it easier to maintain my wigs and it works well for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Head is certainly smaller than a typical caucasian female adult&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Bought these for work I  am a RN BSN staff educator I drill holes in the neck place a tracheostomy in the neck place trache ties in the head use it for education for nurses on how to suction patients and how to complete trache care love these heads have ordered multiple multiple heads</li>
            <li> I bought this head to display my crocheted hats and scarves.  The bald head did not show the items off to their full potential so I added a wig and everything looks beautiful.  Because of the head I have been asked to have my photos used as demonstrations of the patterns used.  The head would be even better if it came with a wig!</li>
            <li> nice quality....very realistic</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> Great wig holder- with weighted bottom.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured and described. The back of the head is not flat as someone else said and the plastic is thick and holds shape, but soft enough to stick T pins in to hold a wig in place. Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Good product and the same supply pictureÂ &lt;br /&gt; ... .... .... ... ... ... ... .. .. .. .. ..&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou</li>
            <li> I bought this to practice headshot photography along with a wig. It is good. Got decent make up and a fairly good skin tone.    click to see  farm8.staticflickr.com/7021/13730300275_87e19a7371.jpg</li>
            <li> Looks better than in the picture. I got it for my little sister, who is into cosmetology and its perfect size for her wigs. She was so amazed over how detailed the facial features were!</li>
            <li> Pefect &amp; great price for my skin care class</li>
            <li> The construction of the head looks very realistic. With a wig and some makeup you have a perfect prop for Halloween.</li>
            <li> I have a styrofoam maniquin that I had to keep replacing but I make my wigs on this one and have not had to replace it yet! I can reuse and use her again and again. I can also use it to take pics of wigs made! She really has come in handy. The other head that I had was slightly larger than this . So I just had to readjust the process and it works fine</li>
            <li> As described. No flat space as mentioned by a previous reviewer. Exactly what I need to work on hairpieces or wigs when I need a waterproof environment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do hair or make-up, but I use these for artistic purposes. Great price for an artist, as heads can get pricey.</li>
            <li> just what I wanted ,nice hand very good,just like it for my wigs.nice very nice . good quality and good.</li>
            <li> This looks incredibly lifelike with or without a wig. Stands nicely and is made with high quality plastic. Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> the head is kinda small.</li>
            <li> very well made, love it! I did order more, do wish the cost wasn&#x27;t so much.&lt;br /&gt;Tracie Bobb, Philadelphia, Pa.</li>
            <li> I liked it very useful for my wigs !</li>
            <li> I love this haed its a little smell but he came in such good condition I have one downfall it does not fit on a salon care C clamp but if its on the one I have but it&#x27;s a cheap one but the mannequin he is perfect but small</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing to really say but It is what I expected nothing more and nothing less and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I just received my mannequin head and the only problem I see is that there is a big yellow smudge across the side of the neck. I purchased this product to display my crochet hats, so I guess I can just cover it with a crochet scarf.</li>
            <li> It looks good just have to find the right stand and it came so fast I was like wow.</li>
            <li> I ordered this head for wig making.  Great fit for me.  You can use T pins to hold your wig in place since this is a sturdy plastic head.  The only con I would say is it is somehow dyed on the inner parts of the head and when you take the pins out the color bleeds a little. Other than that this is a great wig head.</li>
            <li> I use this for photography testing. It works great.</li>
            <li> A little freaky to look at, but fantastic for placing a wig and styling hair</li>
            <li> I use this in photography class and it&#x27;s just what I needed. Decent quality and theres a hole in the base that fits a light stand just right.</li>
            <li> Who ever designed the head piece, did a excellent job of painting in the features.  She is very beautiful.  I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> You can see how this looks on my design blog at [...]  I put a wig on her, give her a hat, crop the picture to hide the neck, and get a really nice display. So much better than trying to get someone to model.</li>
            <li> It is almost &amp;#34;too real&amp;#34; looking. I&#x27;m so used to my foam head that when this beauty came in I was astonished at how &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; it looks. I like how it has seams so I can place the wig straight and know that it is on right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to buy a mannequin head....not for cosmetology reasons, but for designing hats or just having some fun with them like at Halloween.  This is a good quality product and was shipped on the same day ordered.  2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> As a sideline I&#x27;ve been a puppeteer for over 30 years. The figures I use are life size and wear custom designed wigs. On some of my reviews you can see a video of the puppets and I&#x27;ll make it a point to add a clip to this review as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This head form is excellent - the bottom hole fits any standard head form mounting rod and makes working on wigs a breeze. Having a face also makes it easier to style and get a better sense of the astetic and perspective you want. The head form takes T-PINS easily and does so without any damage to the head. Considering a canvas head can cost easily cost around $60 this one is a true bargain at less than $20 - not mention it&#x27;s Prime eligible so two day shipping is free, making this great product that much of a sweeter deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hole on the bottom fits any standard standard head mount - making the wigs easier to style and work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is excellent, the form was delivered wrapped in sealed plastic and shipped in a strong carboard box. If you&#x27;re looking for a head form I can assure you won&#x27;t be disapointed. This well priced head form has all the features of forms costing three times as much and is an excellent and versatile head form - I&#x27;ll be ordering more. This is an excellent deal for a well made product that should for most meet if not exceed your expectations.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 of these and am very happy with them.  They are quite heavy and stay in place while combing the wig or storing it.</li>
            <li> It works for what I have to do with it. I purchase it as a wig stand. To style my wigs.</li>
            <li> I bought it Saturday and got it Monday nice package I got the same one I thought it was going to be a different one after reading the comments. But I got the one above I&#x27;m thinking about ordering two more before there out of stock, I have plenty of wigs that need a mannequin face to put with the wigs</li>
            <li> BEST THING I EVER BROUGHT TO MAKE MY WIGS</li>
            <li> really really nice - great price - great quality</li>
            <li> Love it! it is sturdy and of good quality for the price that it is listed.</li>
            <li> The head is lovely and is sturdy.  The hole at the bottom should be measured before you buy a clamp so you buy the right size.  So far only a couple clamps found seem to work, leaves little room for finding a discounted clamp.  The make up on the head is not over done~ it looks natural with a little added color.</li>
            <li> This product has a thin rubber outer layer over a styrafoam head.  Our daughter used it for a school project and it was amazing.  Packaging and shipping were great.  Received it in 2 days.</li>
            <li> this head is too small.</li>
            <li> works fine-exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Now where can you get this at this price at a local store no where not like this one best quality out their</li>
            <li> I received my items sooner than expected.  I was so excited when I open up the package and saw this beautiful face.  She is so much prettier in person.  I even posted her on my facebook page with a caption: Isnt she beautiful?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is her head is only 19 inches.  Kinda small for a woman&#x27;s head.  I bought it to display hat sets that I make and I was hoping to show true size of a woman&#x27;s head.  Other than that Im very happy with the product.  Maybe vendors should be required to give size of the mannequins head.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these expecting an entire head, but the back side is flattened out to allow it to be placed on a table surface.  As I said in the title, it is a nice quality product - I was just disappointed by the flat backside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note I&#x27;d like to add that you do not get by looking at the photo - The product is made of rubber and is hollow, making the head &amp;#34;squishy&amp;#34;.  Not a bad thing, It surprised me.</li>
            <li> It does was its supposed to do, Sturdy. Head is small tho</li>
            <li> Just got this Item.  Have not used it yet.  But the product was received in three days.&lt;br /&gt;Can not wait to use.</li>
            <li> Bought this for an anatomy project and when i was done i gave it to my daughter for her cos-play wigs. It looks exactly like the image and is perfect.</li>
            <li> This product is just what I had thought was not available.You made me very very very happy. They are WONDERFUL!Thank You.</li>
            <li> This is nice. I use it to put eyelashes on.</li>
            <li> with hair I can change the size of hat , very happy to keep company with this face</li>
            <li> Killer mannequin head, she&#x27;s gorgeous!  Haha, and it&#x27;s really sturdy.  We used it for a halloween costume and it was perfect!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and well made so anything you put on her looks great!  The price was very fair for such a nice item.</li>
            <li> I love it and will quit borrowing my daughter&#x27;s head to fix my weave. I haven&#x27;t used yet. Great price.</li>
