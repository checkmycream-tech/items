            <li>The smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>A pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>The lather is phenomenal, and the scent is very very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Good scent.  </li>
            <li>Good lather.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and builds a good lather.</li>
            <li>This is a fairly good shave soap for the price.</li>
            <li>I gave this shave stick a 4 because a friend said that it is quite good.  </li>
            <li>Makes good lather.  </li>
            <li>This will be just the thing for travel as the container is a good compact size.  </li>
            <li>Very nice product, lathers up easily and smells great, not too overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this shave stick.</li>
            <li>Nice lather; the smell is good.</li>
            <li>Buy more than one!</li>
            <li>Lushous lather, great scent, and a smooth shave</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice lather and smell.</li>
            <li>Nice sent</li>
            <li>Of course shaving soap scents are never as strong as the after shave scents, but its pleasant to shave with.</li>
            <li>It lathers fairly well; I&#x27;ve had better lather for the price, but it&#x27;s certainly more than passable.</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant, mild scent that reminds me of the ocean.</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild and pleasant, and doesn&#x27;t linger after shaving, so you&#x27;re free to use whatever aftershave, cologne, and/or pomade you like without fear of scents conflicting.</li>
            <li>Smells better than Arko (which I like that smell too).</li>
            <li>Its better and easier to use than anything else I have used out of a tube, tin, or bowl.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using a badger hair shaving brush as it helps the soap lather better.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m sure there are people who like the scent.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Someday you will be glad you got it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I like it better than porasso.</li>
            <li>I found it to work better than conl.</li>
            <li>Perfect spanish shaving cream, amaxing odor, lasts forever.</li>
            <li>It could have a better smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to shave, but I have enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li>Favorite shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Top quality soap however to me, it had no scent.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and does the job</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>Great for travel since it&#x27;s a solid stick.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Labeling is attractive and Spanish origin provides a measure of exclusivity.</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild, clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely portable, smells nice, and produces a good lather.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Its every bit as rich as my Proraso croap (creamy soap).  </li>
            <li>good stuff nice and slick easy lather</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used many shaving soaps, but this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s low cost and provides a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Rub this on your wet face and start lathering with a warm, damp brush and Wham!  </li>
            <li>Fast becoming one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>A bit pricey for shave soap, but I bought it for travel and liked the smaller size.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be lasting nicely.  </li>
            <li>It had nice lather, was slick and it smelled ok to me.</li>
            <li>Only gripe I have is that it requires noticeably more water to prevent the lather from drying out.</li>
            <li>La Toja worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I like the Palmolive stick much better and it does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>I rub the stick on my face and grab hot soaked brush.  </li>
            <li>Priced right and ready to travel.</li>
            <li>Its fast to apply, its easy to wash off, and a stick should last for months.  </li>
            <li>Lathers very well.</li>
            <li>but I really can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li>Much warmer lather than bowl lathering.  </li>
            <li>LaToja is a bit harder than Arko, but seems to have a bit more glide.</li>
            <li>Classic.  </li>
            <li>Classic manly smell.</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply it liberally over a wet beard that has been properly prepped for shaving.</li>
            <li>Gobs of gorgeous, thick lather, easily enough for three passes.</li>
            <li>Nice slick lather all the same.</li>
            <li>My use for shave stick shaving soaps is a little different than most.</li>
            <li>Maybe it will work for you if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I do apparently have sensitive skin, the Arko stick also irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>and I have no regrets about this purchase.</li>
            <li>Does not drag the razor.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t mean to suggest that it isn&#x27;t good enough for an everyday shave</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with a shaving stick (been using a safety razor for about a year and a half now though).</li>
            <li>but hey, it provides a rich, thick lather.  </li>
            <li>Lather is very thick and smooth.</li>

            <li> This was my first experience with a shaving stick (been using a safety razor for about a year and a half now though).</li>
            <li> but hey, it provides a rich, thick lather.  </li>
            <li> Lather is very thick and smooth.</li>
            <li> This makes a rich fluffy lather when used with a stiff brush.</li>
            <li> Will last a long time under daily use.</li>
            <li> - it certainly is, but it is so small and so well packaged with travel in mind that it just cries out to be a traveling companion.</li>
            <li> The only other stick I&#x27;ve used is Arko.</li>
            <li> I have never used a stick before, but it actually works quite well to wet my face and rub the stick all over, then use a wet brush to work up a lather on my face.  </li>
            <li> There are other sticks on the market that I really like, but this one, to me, just feels hard.</li>
            <li> and I assume it will come in handy for travel, but keep in mind that the soap stick is basically loose inside the container, and has a bit of foil around the base</li>
            <li> those that complain it&#x27;s too small, this thing will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Even wet, I had to drag it across my whiskers to the point of discomfort.</li>
            <li> It had been thrown into a box with two cast iron pans and absolutely no packing materials.  </li>
            <li> Price is higher than the Arko sticks, but its still less expensive than equally performing croaps.  </li>
            <li> Oh La Toja, you are like a hidden secret, where have you been my whole life?</li>
            <li> I use it in rotation with four other shaving soaps.  </li>
            <li> Also, my La Toja stick came in three pieces just as a previous reviewer stated.  </li>
            <li> It almost has to be a little runny.</li>
            <li> I like the little plastic container that it comes with</li>
            <li> I, however, never actually got to use the one I ordered because Amazon packed it so poorly that it arrived in three pieces.</li>
            <li> You could use this as an everyday soap.</li>
            <li> Very dry, very small, and I don&#x27;t care at all for the scent.</li>
            <li> After my experiences as of late with sticks, I plan on using them exclusively for their ease.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and did not give my sensitive skin any grief.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, it did not survive.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> However when I received the product it was in 3 pieces, the outer case, the stick of soap and the base that the soap is supposed to be connected to.</li>

            <li> very good! I would return to buy</li>
            <li> This is a great summer shave stick. Priced right and ready to travel. Has a pleasant, mild scent that reminds me of the ocean. Will last a long time under daily use. Only gripe I have is that it requires noticeably more water to prevent the lather from drying out. It almost has to be a little runny. Nice slick lather all the same. Despite the extra water it needs, I still keep it in my rotation. For the price, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very good stuff. I bought this along with some Arko sticks. Smells better than Arko (which I like that smell too). Lathers very well. Almost as well as Arko. Its better and easier to use than anything else I have used out of a tube, tin, or bowl. After my experiences as of late with sticks, I plan on using them exclusively for their ease.</li>
            <li> La Toja worked pretty well.  It had nice lather, was slick and it smelled ok to me. But it did irritate my skin and I had to stop using it.  I do apparently have sensitive skin, the Arko stick also irritates my skin. Maybe it will work for you if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  Personally, I like the Palmolive stick much better and it does not irritate my skin.  Also, my La Toja stick came in three pieces just as a previous reviewer stated.  If you do want to try this I recommend looking elsewhere to buy, maybe a web store dedicated to shaving items so that it is shipped properly.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, lathers up easily and smells great, not too overpowering at all. Would make a great travel stick as well</li>
            <li> good stuff nice and slick easy lather</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. I have been using it since I found it in Spain back in 2006. It&#x27;s no muss, no fuss, no cans to throw in the trash. Plus it gives a great shave and lasts forever. It&#x27;s also great for travel!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and did not give my sensitive skin any grief.  I would recommend using a badger hair shaving brush as it helps the soap lather better.</li>
            <li> Very dry, very small, and I don&#x27;t care at all for the scent. Rubbing this on my face was like rubbing chalk on my face. There are other sticks on the market that I really like, but this one, to me, just feels hard. Even wet, I had to drag it across my whiskers to the point of discomfort. Also, I&#x27;m sure there are people who like the scent. If I had to describe it, the only words that come to mind would be &amp;#34;70&#x27;s gigolo.&amp;#34; If you&#x27;re a fan of Tabac, you might like this.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely. Has the &#x27;La Toja&#x27; scent. Of course shaving soap scents are never as strong as the after shave scents, but its pleasant to shave with. Every once in a while I like to use a shave stick instead of a puck.Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. It comes in a 2-piece plastic capsule and is absolutely perfect as a travel shaving soap. The lather is phenomenal, and the scent is very very pleasant. Throw one in your suitcase and forget about it. Someday you will be glad you got it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mean to suggest that it isn&#x27;t good enough for an everyday shave - it certainly is, but it is so small and so well packaged with travel in mind that it just cries out to be a traveling companion.</li>
            <li> Good scent.  Classic.  Easy to use. Good lather.  I keep it in my arsenal, along with a couple of others. Great for travel since it&#x27;s a solid stick.</li>
            <li> Lather monster. I only used once and I like it better than porasso. Came to me intact.</li>
            <li> This makes a rich fluffy lather when used with a stiff brush. The smell is pleasant. Sort of spicy pine like.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used many shaving soaps, but this is my favorite so far. It smells good and builds a good lather.</li>
            <li> This is a very good shave soap. It lathers well and I have no regrets about this purchase. I may buy a bowl of the same soap after I use this up.</li>
            <li> Classic manly smell. Quick and easy to use. I found it to work better than conl. Conk&#x27;s.  I plan to try coco oil, but I feel like this is my soap.</li>
            <li> Perfect spanish shaving cream, amaxing odor, lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Nice lather and smell.</li>
            <li> Great smell and great lather. A bit pricey for shave soap, but I bought it for travel and liked the smaller size.</li>
            <li> Awesome lather. Does not drag the razor. Leaves the skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly good shave soap for the price. Goes on easy and does the job well. It could have a better smell. However when I received the product it was in 3 pieces, the outer case, the stick of soap and the base that the soap is supposed to be connected to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to shave, but I have enjoyed this product.  I have never used a stick before, but it actually works quite well to wet my face and rub the stick all over, then use a wet brush to work up a lather on my face.  Nice sent and it seems to be lasting nicely.  I use it in rotation with four other shaving soaps.  (Proraso, Geo. F Trumper&#x27;s Violet, Taylor of Bond St. Grapefruit, and Col Conk Lime)</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a shaving stick (been using a safety razor for about a year and a half now though). I&#x27;m very pleased with this shave stick. I travelled with it in my carry on and TSA had no issues with it. It&#x27;s extremely portable, smells nice, and produces a good lather. Won&#x27;t be my last time buying it.</li>
            <li> Favorite shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Bought this for travel. It is a stick but unlike deodorant the stick does not stay in the red container so it is not convenient in that form. As far as the smell goes, not really much there except basic soap smell.</li>
            <li> Lather is very thick and smooth. Gives great protection from razor burn. Top quality soap however to me, it had no scent. Maybe it&#x27;s scented but I really can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> I like to face lather.  I rub the stick on my face and grab hot soaked brush.  Much warmer lather than bowl lathering.  Anyhow, the La Toja stick works great for face lathering.  Its aroma is almost non-existent, which is not for me - but hey, it provides a rich, thick lather.  Its every bit as rich as my Proraso croap (creamy soap).  Its fast to apply, its easy to wash off, and a stick should last for months.  Price is higher than the Arko sticks, but its still less expensive than equally performing croaps.  Give it a try - if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you can give it away and not lose any sleep over it.</li>
            <li> Great product for travel and face lathering. For those that shave with a blade, this product is invaluable for travel. It&#x27;s low cost and provides a nice smooth shave. Has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that complain it&#x27;s too small, this thing will last a long time. Be sure to apply it liberally over a wet beard that has been properly prepped for shaving.</li>
            <li> I gave this shave stick a 4 because a friend said that it is quite good.  I, however, never actually got to use the one I ordered because Amazon packed it so poorly that it arrived in three pieces. It had been thrown into a box with two cast iron pans and absolutely no packing materials.  Needless to say, it did not survive.  Amazon was gracious enough to refund my money.  Maybe one day I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great for travel. Lathers well even without a brush.</li>
            <li> A pleasant scent.  Makes good lather.  This will be just the thing for travel as the container is a good compact size.  Labeling is attractive and Spanish origin provides a measure of exclusivity.</li>
            <li> My use for shave stick shaving soaps is a little different than most. I use it as sort of a pre-shave: rub on and let it soften beard while I whip up my regular shaving creme in a cup with brush. The only other stick I&#x27;ve used is Arko. LaToja is a bit harder than Arko, but seems to have a bit more glide. The scent of this soap reminds me of dryer softener sheets. I like the little plastic container that it comes with and I assume it will come in handy for travel, but keep in mind that the soap stick is basically loose inside the container, and has a bit of foil around the base so you can handle it without getting your fingers soapy.</li>
            <li> Nice lather; the smell is good. It is very handy if you travel a lot, not to carry a bowl.</li>
            <li> Oh La Toja, you are like a hidden secret, where have you been my whole life? Anyways, enough of that gushy stuff, this stick has a permanent home in my shave kit. Lushous lather, great scent, and a smooth shave I call this a holy trinity in my book. Become a believer order it at the price what do you have to lose?</li>
            <li> I bought this shave stick for my travel kit.  The only problem; I may use it up before going on vacation!  Rub this on your wet face and start lathering with a warm, damp brush and Wham!  Gobs of gorgeous, thick lather, easily enough for three passes. The scent is very mild, clean smelling.  Fast becoming one of my favorites.  Buy more than one!</li>
            <li> The scent is very mild and pleasant, and doesn&#x27;t linger after shaving, so you&#x27;re free to use whatever aftershave, cologne, and/or pomade you like without fear of scents conflicting. The size is convenient for travel. It lathers fairly well; I&#x27;ve had better lather for the price, but it&#x27;s certainly more than passable. You could use this as an everyday soap.</li>
