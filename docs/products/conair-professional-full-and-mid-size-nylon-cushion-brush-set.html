            <li>ok i guess.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t add a lot of static to your hair.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Most of us have used this type of brush at some time.</li>
            <li>It is still good, dependable, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>For those simple uses, this was the best deal I have ever</li>
            <li>my home brush I have paid a lot more</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Although the brush does get the knots out it makes your hair frizzy and full of static!</li>

            <li>They are made of a very sturdy material and have great gripped handles which make them easy to use.</li>

            <li>The handle is sturdy and comfortable to hold, the bristles are great and I highly recommend this style (as does my granddaughter :).</li>
            <li>Both arrived on time, were new and they both are of fine quality and work great.</li>
            <li>So far, has been a great brush.</li>
            <li>So far, this has been a great replacement.</li>

            <li>They got to my house very quick.</li>
            <li>as is easy to stuff in a pocket and use whenever you need</li>
            <li>The build quality is really strong.</li>
            <li>It is pack of two , ine is big brush which is good at home and another one is smaller perfect for purse on travel.</li>
            <li>I have naturally thick wavy hair, and when I brush mine with this kind of brush it makes it a bit more voluminous, which may be ideal for some one with hair</li>
            <li>The balls on the tips of the brushes keep them from scratching the scalp, and the separation between the bristles is perfect - they are close enough together to sort out my curls, and far enough apart to move through my hair easily, perfect balance.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and would not buy this brand again.  </li>
            <li>The brushes easily run through your hair and does feel comfortable.</li>

            <li>These could be really nice brushed, but with the type of hair that my wife has it created more static rather than helping with it.</li>
            <li>For the price, it is a fantastic value.</li>
            <li>They are tangle free too.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the fact that there are two brushes in the set.</li>

            <li>Perfect brush for my thick hair!</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>With this brush, I&#x27;m able to comb my hair when I need to  much more comfortably and with less damage to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>OK but noticed the handle is not round</li>
            <li>but I still have and use both brushes and they stiff work great.</li>
            <li>They also seem to create more static then other brushes we have owned.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically comb my hair but this was a comfortable brush at first use and effectively helped me accomplish the the clean look I was going for.</li>
            <li>The price is right for this combo deal.</li>
            <li>but I started to notice lots of tangles right away</li>
            <li>Finally I saw this set, the exact kind she has at home, and bought them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to smooth my hair down before leaving the house or once I arrive at work.&lt;br</li>

            <li>i have very long hair,works well to me,good one brushes hair so nicely ....worth the money,but not up to the mark.</li>
            <li>I preferred the larger one but the smaller one is great for styling my bangs.</li>
            <li>the smaller one worked great on my hair just as the big one did.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li>They both likes it very much.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very gentle.</li>
            <li>Great price for decent little brushes.</li>
            <li>The larger brush is my favorite brush ever.  </li>
            <li>My teenage daughter love these...</li>
            <li>I love it all the same though.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll shop around more next time.</li>
            <li>I have really long hair and the bigger brush is great for my hair.</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more soon.</li>
            <li>I love the two different sizes.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>works pretty well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the bristle area break once in many years of use.</li>
            <li>I tried many brushes before but every time had to come back on comb .</li>
            <li>Love these brushes and they last FOREVER</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to use in wet or dry hair and gets the tangles out fairly easy.</li>
            <li>I lost my round paddle brush at a circus the other night with my niece, so I was glad I was able to get this in two days!!</li>
            <li>Really, I love the big one so much that the color doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li>The bristles haven&#x27;t fallen out (YET) and it is pretty gentle on the scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>Might be good for short hair but not for long hair.</li>
            <li>Product  arrived in excellent shape and performs well in getting rid of tangles in long hair, especially when hair is wet.</li>
            <li>I have waist-length, color treated hair that I wear straight.  </li>
            <li>In the end, I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase and would definitely consider another set or brush from the same line in the future.</li>
            <li>But wasn&#x27;t expecting too  much given the price.</li>
            <li>Nothing to really complain about -</li>
            <li>The brushes brush really well</li>
            <li>thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>The shipping was lightning fast, though.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>They seem well constructed however I don&#x27;t really like the sizes.</li>
            <li>De-tangle my hair so gently.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair and they do their job of helping untangle.</li>
            <li>However, much to my surprise, they do not just pull at the hair.</li>
            <li>While the shape of the brush makes it very easy to use, the brush heads themselves are not adequately sturdy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t magically untangle her hair without a bit of work and a bit of pulling, but it&#x27;s a HECK of a lot easier than any other brush we have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are great for his hair but is a little flimsy for my long hair.</li>
            <li>Works well with long fine hair.</li>
            <li>Not sure what to say about it as I don&#x27;t have much hair, but it feels nice to hold and has the con air quality to it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the little polished beads at the end of each...comber thing; the little beads do a good job of preventing scalp scratching.</li>
            <li>easily detangles my hair when wet and my hair gets really stringy.  </li>
            <li>This brush is comfortable to use and can handle my long tangled hair.</li>
            <li>The small brush is nice to have as well.</li>
            <li>only thing I&#x27;ll say is that my pair came in purple as opposed to the cool color here in the picture.</li>
            <li>Two brushes - full and mid size - work well.  </li>
            <li>This set is decent for the price, it comes with two brushes.  </li>
            <li>Replaced 2 of my older brushes from a cheapo store.</li>
            <li>These brushes are sturdy for my thick hair, I love them!</li>
            <li>I fine that these brushes, although still a bit rough to get through hair first thing in the morning, do not pull as much as I expected and actually remove most tangles in one try.</li>
            <li>This is a durable and sturdy brush that is high quality with a rubber grip handle.</li>
            <li>Not really, but they are fine for my needs.  </li>
            <li>I have not yet had this brush two months and already five brush heads have come out from the main brush during normal use.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer this kind of hair brush over all other types.</li>
            <li>It is soft and gentle on the scalp leaving it refreshed and stimulated.</li>
            <li>but it is able to get through all my hair and helps me manage my messy bed head</li>
            <li>Product arrived with the smaller brush crushed, but even with it being trash, the price was still good for the bigger brush.</li>
            <li>The smaller brush fell apart after a weeks worth of use.</li>
            <li>small one is good for carrying around, but I basically just use the big one.</li>
            <li>They are just normal hairbrushes</li>
            <li>Not great just good.</li>
            <li>The bristle tips are not hard on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Brush is soft and pushes in easy, but comb works well as a comb as expected</li>
            <li>The picture has a black trimmed with a blueish colored brushes, but mine came black and pink which I absolutely love!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Paired it with other items to receive free shipping.  </li>
            <li>and when I&#x27;ve used these brushes on only dry hair they hold up just fine, but if used on wet hair, they come unglued very quickly.</li>
            <li>I needed a new brush.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new brush for home because my boyfriend sat on my brush and it snapped and I needed I new brush for work because the brush bristles fell out.</li>
            <li>The smaller brush broke during my first usage.</li>
            <li>Bristles fell out of the larger brush after first use.</li>
            <li>Perhaps she feels pretty after she gets brushed with it.  </li>
            <li>First from the local drug store and now from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When the first one fell apart after 3 months, I thought it was just a fluke, but this is my second</li>
            <li>I like the small cushion brush better then the larger&lt;br /&gt;one.</li>
            <li>bigger one though - is higher quality.</li>
            <li>You can reserve one of them for when you get out of the shower (to keep it clean) and the other for all-day use.</li>
            <li>dont think this is very strong, but this is only 5bucks, and I dont use hardly.&lt;br /&gt;Not bad quality, but compare to price, good enough.</li>
            <li>I like that there is a big one for home use and a smaller one I can leave in the van for a quick touch up on windy days.</li>
            <li>use the large one daily.</li>
            <li>It is professional grade quality</li>
            <li>These two brushes have survived two months of daily use very well.</li>
            <li>My old brush had the bristle section come apart from the handle</li>
            <li>So far it has worked just as a hair brush should.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about the products I use on my hair and am usually very critical of the ones I use.</li>
            <li>Bought these to replace some old brushes.  </li>
            <li>I got this set to use for both myself and my two year old daughter (she has a ton of hair).  </li>
            <li>Soft, well constructed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s combs, do you really need a second opinion?&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>They are soft</li>
            <li>They do okay with getting tangles out though I would not recommend them for thick hair.</li>
            <li>The other remains working fine, but I have no doubt it&#x27;ll break soon enough.</li>
            <li>My daughter has long, fine hair, that&#x27;s not particularly tangled after a shower</li>
            <li>My old Conair brush finally just got too grungy to live after about 8 years!</li>
            <li>All the bristles have stayed in over a couple of weeks&#x27; worth of use, and my hair can be something of a challenge to brush due to the length and tendency for forming tangles.  </li>
            <li>The smaller brush seems to be a bit more sturdy (but too small for her head of hair).</li>
            <li>I feel like I can never have too many brushes and I like these because there is a small one for my purse or briefcase and a larger one for the house or car.</li>
            <li>Low price but high quality.</li>
            <li>The tips of the bristles have a small ball on them which make using these brushes pain free.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>This easily detangle hairs with out pullung hairs , bristles look hard</li>
            <li>The bristles are less stiff compared to the smaller one, and more gentle on longer hair.</li>
            <li>I do use a third bristle brush for actually doing ponytails, but that is because I like it to look smooth and get it totally tight for work.  </li>
            <li>comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair and these brushes were able to help me manage it with ease.</li>
            <li>One of these products needs to be applied to wet hair, and I really needed a brush to help get the product</li>
            <li>The brush is soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are rather thick and tipped with smooth balls on the ends.  </li>
            <li>The little brush broke right away.</li>
            <li>They are able to move and tip in the rubbery cushion base when they meet strong resistance like a snarl, rather than pulling the hair.  </li>
            <li>I use the big brush dry in the morning to get normal tangles out.  </li>
            <li>still prefer the style of brushes that I used to get but have become hard to find in a smaller town like where I live but, as long as you know what to expect from this kind of hard stiff bristle brush, these seem to be worth the money.</li>
            <li>The small brush is just the right size and my wife can use the larger as a backup or travel brush.</li>
            <li>thanks conair for  producing different brushes for different usage, for wet or dry hair..</li>
            <li>Very rubbery compared to my old hard plastic brushes.</li>
            <li>They do a good job on my thin, static-prone hair (I have to avoid brushes that don&#x27;t have these hard prongs) and they are priced well.</li>

            <li> Tangle free shiny hair!</li>
            <li> I love this duo product.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, that will dissipate with more use.</li>

            <li> more can you say.</li>
            <li> there not they best set of brushes but they definitely do the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Conair hairbrushes now and this one has been the best.  </li>
            <li> ok i guess.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t add a lot of static to your hair.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Most of us have used this type of brush at some time.</li>
            <li> It is still good, dependable, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> For those simple uses, this was the best deal I have ever</li>
            <li> my home brush I have paid a lot more</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Although the brush does get the knots out it makes your hair frizzy and full of static!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> They are made of a very sturdy material and have great gripped handles which make them easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of brushes with one full size and one mid-size brush.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good set.</li>
            <li> These were a good price and exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s glides through easily and doesn&#x27;t get tangled up to make static in my hair</li>
            <li> The handle is sturdy and comfortable to hold, the bristles are great and I highly recommend this style (as does my granddaughter :).</li>
            <li> Both arrived on time, were new and they both are of fine quality and work great.</li>
            <li> So far, has been a great brush.</li>
            <li> So far, this has been a great replacement.</li>

            <li> It is pack of two , ine is big brush which is good at home and another one is smaller perfect for purse on travel.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick wavy hair, and when I brush mine with this kind of brush it makes it a bit more voluminous, which may be ideal for some one with hair</li>
            <li> The balls on the tips of the brushes keep them from scratching the scalp, and the separation between the bristles is perfect - they are close enough together to sort out my curls, and far enough apart to move through my hair easily, perfect balance.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and would not buy this brand again.  </li>
            <li> The brushes easily run through your hair and does feel comfortable.</li>

            <li> Mine came in purple which was fine.</li>
            <li> It is easier to clean hair out of and clean and you can not beat this price!</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean, easy to use and don&#x27;t hurt my scalp.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean with a comb.</li>
            <li> Great bundle with the smaller brush.</li>
            <li> I find it to be comfortable to use and it feels like a scalp massage while I use it.  </li>
            <li> The smaller brush is great for styling, too.</li>
            <li> Great brushes with solid build and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> These could be really nice brushed, but with the type of hair that my wife has it created more static rather than helping with it.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> They are tangle free too.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the fact that there are two brushes in the set.</li>
            <li> work at detangling and clean easily.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a smaller, travel-sized brush which makes this a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth more than the price.</li>
            <li> Actually surprisingly cheap for the quality.</li>
            <li> Great hair brushes, i &#x27;d even given the bigger one to my mother-in-law</li>
            <li> she liked it so much &amp;</li>
            <li> These brushes broke my daughters beautiful long hair  </li>
            <li> Spend a little bit more on a good brush that will hold up instead of trying to save money on this one!</li>
            <li> The big one&#x27;s the perfect size for brushing out your hair after washing, and the little one&#x27;s good for touch ups.</li>
            <li> Also great to smooth hair when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for untangling and then styling my long, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Great brush for anyone with tangles of long hair.</li>
            <li> Works great for my long think hair.</li>
            <li> but it is pretty smooth !</li>
            <li> The large brush is perfect for working hair products through my wet hair</li>
            <li> Nothing special about a brush.</li>
            <li> Brilliant at untangling little girl&#x27;s knotty hair.</li>
            <li> Good brushes worked well for daily use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll probably last a fair amount of time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes the tried and true is the way to go.</li>
            <li> The big one is good for keeping in the bathroom, the smaller one of course is good for when you&#x27;re out and</li>
            <li> Love my new hairbrush.</li>
            <li> My new favorite brush.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just cheap, but I&#x27;ll positive spin it as frugal.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for my thick hair!</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> With this brush, I&#x27;m able to comb my hair when I need to  much more comfortably and with less damage to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a surprise to discover they really are far more comfortable to use than my others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for the price, worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a golden and a mutt.</li>
            <li> I love the soft cushion of the brush and the sturdy bristles.  </li>
            <li> OK but noticed the handle is not round</li>
            <li> but I still have and use both brushes and they stiff work great.</li>
            <li> They also seem to create more static then other brushes we have owned.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically comb my hair but this was a comfortable brush at first use and effectively helped me accomplish the the clean look I was going for.</li>
            <li> The price is right for this combo deal.</li>
            <li> but I started to notice lots of tangles right away</li>
            <li> Finally I saw this set, the exact kind she has at home, and bought them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to smooth my hair down before leaving the house or once I arrive at work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes seem to be durable and after 2 weeks of constant use they are good as new.</li>
            <li> They are great; small one lives in my travel/gym bag.</li>
            <li> i have very long hair,works well to me,good one brushes hair so nicely ....worth the money,but not up to the mark.</li>
            <li> I preferred the larger one but the smaller one is great for styling my bangs.</li>
            <li> the smaller one worked great on my hair just as the big one did.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li> They both likes it very much.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very gentle.</li>
            <li> Great price for decent little brushes.</li>
            <li> The larger brush is my favorite brush ever.  </li>
            <li> My teenage daughter love these...</li>
            <li> I love it all the same though.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll shop around more next time.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and the bigger brush is great for my hair.</li>
            <li> Will definitely order more soon.</li>
            <li> I love the two different sizes.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> works pretty well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the bristle area break once in many years of use.</li>
            <li> I tried many brushes before but every time had to come back on comb .</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and they last FOREVER</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to use in wet or dry hair and gets the tangles out fairly easy.</li>
            <li> I lost my round paddle brush at a circus the other night with my niece, so I was glad I was able to get this in two days!!</li>
            <li> Really, I love the big one so much that the color doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li> The bristles haven&#x27;t fallen out (YET) and it is pretty gentle on the scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> Might be good for short hair but not for long hair.</li>
            <li> Product  arrived in excellent shape and performs well in getting rid of tangles in long hair, especially when hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I have waist-length, color treated hair that I wear straight.  </li>
            <li> In the end, I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase and would definitely consider another set or brush from the same line in the future.</li>
            <li> But wasn&#x27;t expecting too  much given the price.</li>
            <li> Nothing to really complain about -</li>
            <li> The brushes brush really well</li>
            <li> thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> The shipping was lightning fast, though.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> They seem well constructed however I don&#x27;t really like the sizes.</li>
            <li> De-tangle my hair so gently.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair and they do their job of helping untangle.</li>
            <li> However, much to my surprise, they do not just pull at the hair.</li>
            <li> While the shape of the brush makes it very easy to use, the brush heads themselves are not adequately sturdy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t magically untangle her hair without a bit of work and a bit of pulling, but it&#x27;s a HECK of a lot easier than any other brush we have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are great for his hair but is a little flimsy for my long hair.</li>
            <li> Works well with long fine hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say about it as I don&#x27;t have much hair, but it feels nice to hold and has the con air quality to it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the little polished beads at the end of each...comber thing; the little beads do a good job of preventing scalp scratching.</li>
            <li> easily detangles my hair when wet and my hair gets really stringy.  </li>
            <li> This brush is comfortable to use and can handle my long tangled hair.</li>
            <li> The small brush is nice to have as well.</li>
            <li> only thing I&#x27;ll say is that my pair came in purple as opposed to the cool color here in the picture.</li>
            <li> Two brushes - full and mid size - work well.  </li>
            <li> This set is decent for the price, it comes with two brushes.  </li>
            <li> Replaced 2 of my older brushes from a cheapo store.</li>
            <li> These brushes are sturdy for my thick hair, I love them!</li>
            <li> I fine that these brushes, although still a bit rough to get through hair first thing in the morning, do not pull as much as I expected and actually remove most tangles in one try.</li>
            <li> This is a durable and sturdy brush that is high quality with a rubber grip handle.</li>
            <li> Not really, but they are fine for my needs.  </li>
            <li> I have not yet had this brush two months and already five brush heads have come out from the main brush during normal use.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer this kind of hair brush over all other types.</li>
            <li> It is soft and gentle on the scalp leaving it refreshed and stimulated.</li>
            <li> but it is able to get through all my hair and helps me manage my messy bed head</li>
            <li> Product arrived with the smaller brush crushed, but even with it being trash, the price was still good for the bigger brush.</li>
            <li> The smaller brush fell apart after a weeks worth of use.</li>
            <li> small one is good for carrying around, but I basically just use the big one.</li>
            <li> They are just normal hairbrushes</li>
            <li> Not great just good.</li>
            <li> The bristle tips are not hard on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Brush is soft and pushes in easy, but comb works well as a comb as expected</li>
            <li> The picture has a black trimmed with a blueish colored brushes, but mine came black and pink which I absolutely love!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Paired it with other items to receive free shipping.  </li>
            <li> and when I&#x27;ve used these brushes on only dry hair they hold up just fine, but if used on wet hair, they come unglued very quickly.</li>
            <li> I needed a new brush.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new brush for home because my boyfriend sat on my brush and it snapped and I needed I new brush for work because the brush bristles fell out.</li>
            <li> The smaller brush broke during my first usage.</li>
            <li> Bristles fell out of the larger brush after first use.</li>
            <li> Perhaps she feels pretty after she gets brushed with it.  </li>
            <li> First from the local drug store and now from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the first one fell apart after 3 months, I thought it was just a fluke, but this is my second</li>
            <li> I like the small cushion brush better then the larger&lt;br /&gt;one.</li>
            <li> bigger one though - is higher quality.</li>
            <li> You can reserve one of them for when you get out of the shower (to keep it clean) and the other for all-day use.</li>
            <li> dont think this is very strong, but this is only 5bucks, and I dont use hardly.&lt;br /&gt;Not bad quality, but compare to price, good enough.</li>
            <li> I like that there is a big one for home use and a smaller one I can leave in the van for a quick touch up on windy days.</li>
            <li> use the large one daily.</li>
            <li> It is professional grade quality</li>
            <li> These two brushes have survived two months of daily use very well.</li>
            <li> My old brush had the bristle section come apart from the handle</li>
            <li> So far it has worked just as a hair brush should.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about the products I use on my hair and am usually very critical of the ones I use.</li>
            <li> Bought these to replace some old brushes.  </li>
            <li> I got this set to use for both myself and my two year old daughter (she has a ton of hair).  </li>
            <li> Soft, well constructed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s combs, do you really need a second opinion?&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> They are soft</li>
            <li> They do okay with getting tangles out though I would not recommend them for thick hair.</li>
            <li> The other remains working fine, but I have no doubt it&#x27;ll break soon enough.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, fine hair, that&#x27;s not particularly tangled after a shower</li>
            <li> My old Conair brush finally just got too grungy to live after about 8 years!</li>
            <li> All the bristles have stayed in over a couple of weeks&#x27; worth of use, and my hair can be something of a challenge to brush due to the length and tendency for forming tangles.  </li>
            <li> The smaller brush seems to be a bit more sturdy (but too small for her head of hair).</li>
            <li> I feel like I can never have too many brushes and I like these because there is a small one for my purse or briefcase and a larger one for the house or car.</li>
            <li> Low price but high quality.</li>
            <li> The tips of the bristles have a small ball on them which make using these brushes pain free.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> This easily detangle hairs with out pullung hairs , bristles look hard</li>
            <li> The bristles are less stiff compared to the smaller one, and more gentle on longer hair.</li>
            <li> I do use a third bristle brush for actually doing ponytails, but that is because I like it to look smooth and get it totally tight for work.  </li>
            <li> comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair and these brushes were able to help me manage it with ease.</li>
            <li> One of these products needs to be applied to wet hair, and I really needed a brush to help get the product</li>
            <li> The brush is soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are rather thick and tipped with smooth balls on the ends.  </li>
            <li> The little brush broke right away.</li>
            <li> They are able to move and tip in the rubbery cushion base when they meet strong resistance like a snarl, rather than pulling the hair.  </li>
            <li> I use the big brush dry in the morning to get normal tangles out.  </li>
            <li> still prefer the style of brushes that I used to get but have become hard to find in a smaller town like where I live but, as long as you know what to expect from this kind of hard stiff bristle brush, these seem to be worth the money.</li>
            <li> The small brush is just the right size and my wife can use the larger as a backup or travel brush.</li>
            <li> thanks conair for  producing different brushes for different usage, for wet or dry hair..</li>
            <li> Very rubbery compared to my old hard plastic brushes.</li>
            <li> They do a good job on my thin, static-prone hair (I have to avoid brushes that don&#x27;t have these hard prongs) and they are priced well.</li>
            <li> For some reason, the people I rent the puppets to LOVE to forget to return the brushes (and other items), and I got tired of driving to Rite-Aid or CVS for over-priced replacements.</li>
            <li> brushes&#x27; comfort is partly due to the soft cushion into which the bristles are set.  </li>
            <li> I get a lot of frizz and flyaways, and I have to use various products to get my hair to stay flat.  </li>
            <li> I took the large one for me, and gave Amber the small one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using the large brush (and occasionally the small one) as a regular brush when my hair is dry, as well.  </li>
            <li> I never knew how much I needed a small brush until I bought this.</li>
            <li> Tangles usually don&#x27;t bother me much</li>
            <li> My granddaughter will only use this brush on her long tangle-prone hair because it doesn&#x27;t hurt her.  </li>
            <li> Both have long coats, and need regular brushing.</li>
            <li> One big and one medium sized weird roboty kinda brush that is good for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I had several types including one with very wide-set &#x27;bristles&#x27;, but she still complained.  </li>
            <li> One is really too big for my purpose and the other is too small.</li>
            <li> The smaller brush might be a little big for carrying in a smaller purse.</li>
            <li> I had went to different stores in my area to find a specific type of hair brush that none of these stores had, so i came back to amazon after a little looking</li>
            <li> May come in a color different from the one on the picture (I have got a pink one, which is now the only pink thing in my possession).</li>
            <li> Looking forward to seeing how long it lasts...</li>
            <li> This one had good tip covers on each of the bristles and no bristles have come out of the base yet.  </li>
            <li> This one comes with a travel sized brush and it is less expensive then most others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The finish on the handle does come off after a couple years use and gets sticky and that is what usually makes me get a new set, even though they still work</li>
            <li> I find the brush to be like other brushes of the same design.  </li>
            <li> She loves to use the little travel one at the same time that I use the big one.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is color-treated, it is dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no high demand person for hair care products.</li>
            <li> The brushes have nylon bristles that comb and detangle your wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the bigger one at home and take the smaller one with me as a space saver when I&#x27;m travelling, so they&#x27;re both convenient to have.</li>
            <li> I would be lost without it.&lt;br /&gt;The little brush is no big deal</li>
            <li> I like the big one but bought it so I can keep the little one in my purse</li>
            <li> I miss the days of commonly finding brushes that offer the sturdy bristles such as the ones found here along with the softer brush underneath on the same brush head.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> Got Pink.</li>
            <li> Brush order was shipped as expected.</li>
            <li> The bristles are still in, but the rubber padding that holds them comes unglued if you use this brush on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Well made, bristles are stiff enough without being abrasive to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break your air when you brush it wet!</li>
            <li> One for home and the other for the gym bag.</li>
            <li> One brush is big and one is small.  </li>
            <li> do not buy this brush - it will just be a waste of money you - I have really long hair</li>
            <li> My other brushes get caught all the times and I practically have to yank at my scalp to work the brush through.</li>
            <li> I am going to leave one in the car for emergency and the other in my gym bag.  </li>
            <li> keep the small one in my purse and the bigger one in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> While my hair isn&#x27;t long like my granddaughter&#x27;s, I use stiff hairspray to hold it in a style.  </li>
            <li> I order this item for my friend thinking it will be black, and the send me a pink one.</li>
            <li> bristles (and plastic imitation boar bristles) were not up to the task.  </li>
            <li> Even with Amber taking hers and giving it a really hard back leg thrashing at times.</li>
            <li> Not close together and thin like old fashioned brushes.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it works especially well on it.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair about half way down my back.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is all the way down her waist</li>
            <li> I cannot I considered getting any other brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy because u brought the color brush pink instead of blue</li>
            <li> These came as a set, all black except for a purple ring and purple tips.  </li>
            <li> They pull on my slightly wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> The brush came in black with purple accent.</li>
            <li> Also, less hair breakage.</li>
            <li> My little one has long thick hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Neither brush hurts to use; I think the cushions provide a little bit of \\&quot;give\\&quot; so the bristles move and don&#x27;t rip my hair out.  </li>
            <li> I keep the little one in my purse.  </li>
            <li> little balls on the bristle..hurts</li>
            <li> Plastic handles seem a little flimsy, but hopefully won&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend because it came with the little brush that he could also take to work for convenience.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge purple fan (hate pink and purple), but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> expected, the hard bristles grab onto any tangles and give quite a pull.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend trying to get it through your hair without holding the hair between the head and the brush as it would be painful, but the tangle will come out with minimal effort and hair breakage if taken gently yet</li>
            <li> Wanted the Green brush.  </li>
            <li> Does the job well,  it manages to untangle my really messy hair</li>
            <li> It will work well for few months</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and can be hard on brushes.</li>
            <li> A bit stiff though.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, moderately long hair</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted&lt;br /&gt;Can not say one bad thing</li>
            <li> One of the bristles on the small size was already missing.</li>
            <li> I use the small one just after getting out of the shower to tame the mane.  </li>
            <li> It has function of massage when brush hair and pursh a little hard on your head.</li>
            <li> Each bristle is tipped in a small ball which prevents snagging and hair pulling but also protects your scalp from being scratched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but there was no static.</li>
            <li> I use the small one on business trips and for the gym...</li>
            <li> The small one I keep at work or in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> so she could put the small one in her backpack to use at school.</li>
            <li> After going through a bunch of different expensive brushes trying to find one that could detangle her hair with a minimum of pain (detangling spray just makes her hair oily)</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is.</li>
            <li> so I even use the small one on my 2-year-old and he doesn&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this goes through and wonder for to have a small one for my handbag.</li>
            <li> Very stiff bristles.  </li>
            <li> Also spread out on a convex cushioned base.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair you might like these.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and it has not given out on me yet</li>
            <li> I have three girls with thick hair that tends to break hairbrushes over time.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> This is for thick hair.</li>
            <li> And by that I mean that they will comb your hair.</li>
            <li> Especially the small brush it has been glued really badly</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m just disappointed about the colour.</li>
            <li> Very hard to brush hair with a broken brush.  </li>
            <li> I never knew how expensive brushes can be until I looked int</li>
            <li> Poor quality, within a month, the rubber unglues from the base.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s virtually impossible to comb through this spray without pulling hairs out and with my thin hair, I hate to do that.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and need something that can straighten it out when I get up in the morning with a dreadful case of bed head.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this brush set.</li>
            <li> Just over a month after buying it, the tips are falling off, leaving me with a painful brushing experience.  </li>
            <li> The rubber surface that the bristles come out of, prevent snagging and painful tangles.</li>
            <li> like that the base the bristles are mounted in is a flexible cushion that protects your hair but also lets the bristles follow the contour of your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So this duo saved me a gruesome trip to Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Conair Hair products are the worst.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a hair brush. Not much else to say. It works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy because u brought the color brush pink instead of blue</li>
            <li> One big and one medium sized weird roboty kinda brush that is good for my thick hair.Individual bristles stick up, each capped so they don&#x27;t stick. Not close together and thin like old fashioned brushes.Also spread out on a convex cushioned base. Easy to clean with a comb.</li>
            <li> Love this hairbrush! It doesn&#x27;t break your air when you brush it wet! And such a great price!!! Totally worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better. I now feel like I am out of one of those shampoo commercials. Great bundle with the smaller brush. One for home and the other for the gym bag. Works great and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Feels good against my scalp and brushes my hair fine.</li>
            <li> i loved the fact that i got two brushes for the price of one :) i still use them, and they&#x27;re great brushes. i love conair!!</li>
            <li> I needed a new brush.  This set is wonderful.  I have thick hair about half way down my back.  I use the big brush dry in the morning to get normal tangles out.  I use the small one just after getting out of the shower to tame the mane.  I do use a third bristle brush for actually doing ponytails, but that is because I like it to look smooth and get it totally tight for work.  When around the house, I just use the big one and it does the job to keep hair managed and out of my face.  These came as a set, all black except for a purple ring and purple tips.  I&#x27;m not a huge purple fan (hate pink and purple), but it&#x27;s not bad.  Really, I love the big one so much that the color doesn&#x27;t matter.  I&#x27;ve been using for about a month.  I hope they last.</li>
            <li> Great size hair brushes!</li>
            <li> Good price for a very good set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I wish Amazon made product history a bit more transparent. While combing my hair I have to wonder if the factory that made this brush was polluting the drinking water.</li>
            <li> i ordered this after for me i have very long hair,works well to me,good one brushes hair so nicely ....worth the money,but not up to the mark.</li>
            <li> This is a durable and sturdy brush that is high quality with a rubber grip handle. It is soft and gentle on the scalp leaving it refreshed and stimulated. Detangles and leaves your hair with luster, shine and body.</li>
            <li> I order this item for my friend thinking it will be black, and the send me a pink one. Go Conair !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Anyways HE hates it and he asked me to return it but for $5 I don&#x27;t feel like going through the proccess. Overall I&#x27;m just disappointed about the colour. Also the quality of the brush is good ! Not great just good.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for my thick hair!</li>
            <li> I thought this was a great deal for the cost.  Paired it with other items to receive free shipping.  The brushes are the quality you would expect.  I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Wish I had option to choose the color. I got a violet color</li>
            <li> Just over a month after buying it, the tips are falling off, leaving me with a painful brushing experience.  Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Very stiff bristles.  If you have thick hair you might like these.  I have fine hair and would not buy this brand again.  Roger</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of brushes with one full size and one mid-size brush.  I use the smaller one as a travel brush.  The brushes have nylon bristles that comb and detangle your wet or dry hair.  Each bristle is tipped in a small ball which prevents snagging and hair pulling but also protects your scalp from being scratched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the base the bristles are mounted in is a flexible cushion that protects your hair but also lets the bristles follow the contour of your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is molded with ridges and it is easy to hold and does not slip.  I find it to be comfortable to use and it feels like a scalp massage while I use it.  It is professional grade quality and I recommend it to you.  I have thick hair and it works especially well on it.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this brush set a try since it came with both a full-size brush and travel size. The brushes easily run through your hair and does feel comfortable. Although the brush does get the knots out it makes your hair frizzy and full of static! Yikes! I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these brushes in a store for my last hair de-tangler, and it lasted for a decade. They&#x27;re not fancy, but they get the tangles out. If you are low maintenance, then they will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Gets the job done. The smaller brush broke during my first usage.</li>
            <li> So far so good!! I have thick curly hair and it has not given out on me yet lol 😊</li>
            <li> These brushes broke my daughters beautiful long hair  She is five and has only had her hair cut once before.  Her hair is all the way down her waist and when I would brush with these brushes they would break the hair and make more knots.  Might be good for short hair but not for long hair.</li>
            <li> Good brushes worked well for daily use</li>
            <li> I had been pricing Conair brushes since mine broke a while back.  Very hard to brush hair with a broken brush.  I saw these on line and had plan to place an order so I added it and was very glad I did.  I have the big one for daily use and the smaller one for touch ups.  Would recommend it and if I ever needed to purchase another brush, I would definitely purchase these.</li>
            <li> I used only couple of times and bristle came off!  I will never buy Conair brushes for myself. Especially the small brush it has been glued really badly it came off on the second day!!</li>
            <li> I have waist-length, color treated hair that I wear straight.  Because my hair is color-treated, it is dry.  I get a lot of frizz and flyaways, and I have to use various products to get my hair to stay flat.  One of these products needs to be applied to wet hair, and I really needed a brush to help get the product evenly distributed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boar bristles (and plastic imitation boar bristles) were not up to the task.  I had a nylon bristle brush from another manufacturer that hurt to work through my hair (I do tend to get a lot of tangles).  I bought this set and am thrilled with it.  The large brush is perfect for working hair products through my wet hair and I think that the even distribution of the products, assisted by this brush, is helping to make my hair stay flatter and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither brush hurts to use; I think the cushions provide a little bit of \\&quot;give\\&quot; so the bristles move and don&#x27;t rip my hair out.  I&#x27;ve started using the large brush (and occasionally the small one) as a regular brush when my hair is dry, as well.  It&#x27;s nice to smooth my hair down before leaving the house or once I arrive at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any problems with the manufacture of this brush.  All the bristles have stayed in over a couple of weeks&#x27; worth of use, and my hair can be something of a challenge to brush due to the length and tendency for forming tangles.  In the end, I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase and would definitely consider another set or brush from the same line in the future.</li>
            <li> Wanted the Green brush.  Got Pink.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes... one for the bathroom and one for the car or for traveling.</li>
            <li> Nice quality hairbrushes for the price! I have three girls with thick hair that tends to break hairbrushes over time. These two brushes have survived two months of daily use very well.</li>
            <li> The picture has a black trimmed with a blueish colored brushes, but mine came black and pink which I absolutely love!!!!!! :D I keep the smaller one in my handbag and the larger one at home.</li>
            <li> Love that I can bring my favorite brush on vacations because a have a matching travel sized one. I have thick hair but it is able to get through all my hair and helps me manage my messy bed head</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this goes through and wonder for to have a small one for my handbag. Great</li>
            <li> My granddaughter will only use this brush on her long tangle-prone hair because it doesn&#x27;t hurt her.  I&#x27;ve found I like it too for several reasons.  I&#x27;m so pleased to have found a two-pack, one for me and one for her.  She&#x27;s fussed that the brushes at my house hurt her.  I had several types including one with very wide-set &#x27;bristles&#x27;, but she still complained.  Finally I saw this set, the exact kind she has at home, and bought them.  What a surprise to discover they really are far more comfortable to use than my others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes&#x27; comfort is partly due to the soft cushion into which the bristles are set.  The bristles are rather thick and tipped with smooth balls on the ends.  They are able to move and tip in the rubbery cushion base when they meet strong resistance like a snarl, rather than pulling the hair.  While my hair isn&#x27;t long like my granddaughter&#x27;s, I use stiff hairspray to hold it in a style.  It&#x27;s virtually impossible to comb through this spray without pulling hairs out and with my thin hair, I hate to do that.  With this brush, I&#x27;m able to comb my hair when I need to  much more comfortably and with less damage to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like some reviewers got duds, but the brushes I received are great and I&#x27;ve had no problems.  The handle is sturdy and comfortable to hold, the bristles are great and I highly recommend this style (as does my granddaughter :).</li>
            <li> Just what the picture shows. Great brush and a great value. I keep one at home and one in my bag. Well made brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for untangling and then styling my long, curly hair.  The balls on the tips of the brushes keep them from scratching the scalp, and the separation between the bristles is perfect - they are close enough together to sort out my curls, and far enough apart to move through my hair easily, perfect balance.  The smaller brush is great for styling, too.</li>
            <li> Love Conair hair products!</li>
            <li> The larger brush is my favorite brush ever.  Even though it isn&#x27;t a &#x27;styling brush&#x27; it gives more lift and straightening to my hair than anything else I have tried while blow drying. It is very gentle on your hair. The bristles have protective coating. Holds up to heat just fine.  Five stars from me. I would be lost without it.&lt;br /&gt;The little brush is no big deal but it is handy to throw in for on the go. Its a nice size for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;While I still think this is a great brush I have found another that works great to straighten hair when blow drying that works great:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0002YE8V6 Vidal Sassoon VS7963 Ionic Thermal All Purpose Brush]]</li>
            <li> Tangle free shiny hair! I have had these brushes a while. They are great; small one lives in my travel/gym bag.</li>
            <li> One of the bristles on the small size was already missing. A bit stiff though. But wasn&#x27;t expecting too  much given the price. It&#x27;ll probably last a fair amount of time. Nothing to really complain about - so I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this duo product. I needed a new brush for home because my boyfriend sat on my brush and it snapped and I needed I new brush for work because the brush bristles fell out. So this duo saved me a gruesome trip to Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> These brushes were for a set of puppets I made for Avenue Q. For some reason, the people I rent the puppets to LOVE to forget to return the brushes (and other items), and I got tired of driving to Rite-Aid or CVS for over-priced replacements. With this, I can get it in a day or so from Amazon Prime, and not have to worry about it.</li>
            <li> May come in a color different from the one on the picture (I have got a pink one, which is now the only pink thing in my possession). Aside from the color, the hairbrush does its job well, though.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> The brushes brush really well but there is so much static electricity with each brush stroke! The brush I had before this was this style of brush but there was no static. Hopefully, that will dissipate with more use.</li>
            <li> They are pretty great brushes. Nothing special about a brush. They get the job done and they done hurt my scalp.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes. Exactly what I expected. The small brush is nice to have as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically comb my hair but this was a comfortable brush at first use and effectively helped me accomplish the the clean look I was going for. Getting two separate brushes is a great deal as well. I preferred the larger one but the smaller one is great for styling my bangs. Product is durable and has a rubber grip which is convenient. Great brush for travel or just to have at home.</li>
            <li> Awesome, my wife said it works great, she keeps one at her desk and the smaller one in her purse at all times.</li>
            <li> I bought it for mt wife and daughter. They both likes it very much. Good value for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> Good, sturdy hair brush!  Works beautifully and is well made.  I have fine hair and this brush is perfect for blowdrying.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush and a great deal for just $2. The smaller brush is a bonus as I would buy it just for the big one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a conair user since 80s. there product was good. thanks conair for  producing different brushes for different usage, for wet or dry hair.. its pretty perfect for all kinds of hair type.</li>
            <li> Compare to price, this product is good enough!&lt;br /&gt;Nice packing.&lt;br /&gt;I dont think this is very strong, but this is only 5bucks, and I dont use hardly.&lt;br /&gt;Not bad quality, but compare to price, good enough.</li>
            <li> Very good and comfortable brush. Low price but high quality. It has function of massage when brush hair and pursh a little hard on your head.</li>
            <li> So far, has been a great brush. I use the small one on business trips and for the gym...I never knew how much I needed a small brush until I bought this. The bristles haven&#x27;t fallen out (YET) and it is pretty gentle on the scalp and hair. Looking forward to seeing how long it lasts...for the price, worth it.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, within a month, the rubber unglues from the base.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter love these...</li>
            <li> To be honest i ordered this brush by mistake, but after received it, i like it, so i decide to keep it</li>
            <li> Product arrived with the smaller brush crushed, but even with it being trash, the price was still good for the bigger brush.</li>
            <li> Nice price and feels good on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Arrived just in time! I thought I had ordered a mint green-colored brush set, but I got a purple set instead. I love it all the same though. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great brushes with solid build and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Very Nice good price ❤️</li>
            <li> Good quality plastic bristle brush.  Comes with a convenient smaller brush.  Both are lightweight and work well.  Good price as well.</li>
            <li> I like this brush.  I&#x27;ve had it once before.  My old brush had the bristle section come apart from the handle so hopefully that doesn&#x27;t happen again.  The brush is soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp.  Great brush!</li>
            <li> These are a great deal for the money.  I always like to try out the Amazon add-on items, so I did.  Happy customer!</li>
            <li> Nice quality brushes at a good price.  I like that there is a big one for home use and a smaller one I can leave in the van for a quick touch up on windy days.</li>
            <li> These could be really nice brushed, but with the type of hair that my wife has it created more static rather than helping with it. The brushes are otherwise really nice build wise</li>
            <li> Got these as an add on item... And for the price they are great...</li>
            <li> The little brush broke right away. I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again. I like the big one but bought it so I can keep the little one in my purse but it broke within a week.</li>
            <li> I have owned a different Conair brush that I bought when I was on vacation one year because I forgot my brush. I love it! It is easier to clean hair out of and clean and you can not beat this price! The one I bought on vacation was the same type except it was square and it was $15! I do have short hair but I love this brush feels.</li>
            <li> Enjoying these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I use the large one daily. The small one I keep at work or in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> Its a hair brush.  So far it has worked just as a hair brush should.</li>
            <li> Great brush for a great price!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good set. The big one I use at home.....I keep the little one in my purse.  Sometimes I find myself continuously just brushing my head because the bristles feel so good on my scalp.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! The build quality is really strong. They are made of a very sturdy material and have great gripped handles which make them easy to use. The tips of the bristles have a small ball on them which make using these brushes pain free. The air cushion creates a soothing effect and allows  for maximum control and comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair and these brushes were able to help me manage it with ease. At no time did I feel any discomfort, pulling, or snagging. I am very picky about the products I use on my hair and am usually very critical of the ones I use. Nevertheless, I was very impressed by this set of brushes. For the price, it is a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this brush set a try since it came with both a full-size brush and travel size. The brushes easily run through your hair and does feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very good deal!! The brushes arent the best from conair&#x27;s line, but still very usable!</li>
            <li> These brushes are sturdy for my thick hair, I love them! I bring the smaller one everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> I have a golden and a mutt. Both have long coats, and need regular brushing. The rubber surface that the bristles come out of, prevent snagging and painful tangles. Both my kids will sit for an hour and let me brush them. They love it, so I do too. My dogs are my heart.</li>
            <li> This set is decent for the price, it comes with two brushes.  One brush is big and one is small.  My daughter liked the idea of this so she could put the small one in her backpack to use at school. They do okay with getting tangles out though I would not recommend them for thick hair. They also seem to create more static then other brushes we have owned.</li>
            <li> My daughter is growing her out hair but, of course, it has a zillion tangles. After going through a bunch of different expensive brushes trying to find one that could detangle her hair with a minimum of pain (detangling spray just makes her hair oily), I finally got her the same brush I use for my wavy, short hair- the Conair with the Nylon bristles. It doesn&#x27;t magically untangle her hair without a bit of work and a bit of pulling, but it&#x27;s a HECK of a lot easier than any other brush we have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the tried and true is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Does the job well,  it manages to untangle my really messy hair</li>
            <li> My favorite brush for the past few years! I will never use anything else again. I have found my perfect hair brush!!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. The big one&#x27;s the perfect size for brushing out your hair after washing, and the little one&#x27;s good for touch ups. Good quality. My old Conair brush finally just got too grungy to live after about 8 years!</li>
            <li> I bought this when I bought my conair hair dryer. It is really nice and value for money. thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> It does the job. Love the fact that there&#x27;s two of them. You can keep one for on the go, and one at home.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed! This brush is comfortable to use and can handle my long tangled hair. I always buy this brush, the mini brush is perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> Good hair brush.  Does the job.  What I was seeking.  I have long thick hair and can be hard on brushes.</li>
            <li> Bristles fell out of the larger brush after first use. My daughter has long, fine hair, that&#x27;s not particularly tangled after a shower so I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is. The smaller brush seems to be a bit more sturdy (but too small for her head of hair). I&#x27;d rather have one \\&quot;better\\&quot; brush than two crappy brushes. I&#x27;ll shop around more next time. The shipping was lightning fast, though.</li>
            <li> little balls on the bristle..hurts</li>
            <li> I bought this quite a while ago and decided to wait to write my review in case the brush set didn&#x27;t work out later on but I still have and use both brushes and they stiff work great. They are easy to clean, easy to use and don&#x27;t hurt my scalp. I have really long hair and the bigger brush is great for my hair. It&#x27;s glides through easily and doesn&#x27;t get tangled up to make static in my hair so it&#x27;s fly away. I have nothing bad to say about this brush set.</li>
            <li> The thing has worked fine for my hair. I have no complaints. I&#x27;m no high demand person for hair care products.</li>
            <li> Perfect sizes for home and my purse</li>
            <li> Good quality @ a cheap price</li>
            <li> These were a add on I love them both one for my purse one for bathroom they don&#x27;t pull my hair</li>
            <li> Love love  this brush...buy again</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described. Good Job!!</li>
            <li> That large brush held up great still working.  The smaller brush fell apart after a weeks worth of use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like these brushes at all. They pull on my slightly wavy hair.  Had never had this happen with a brush before.</li>
            <li> Bought this for me and my daughter as she loves to have her own brush. The brushes seem to be durable and after 2 weeks of constant use they are good as new. The price is right for this combo deal.</li>
            <li> very nice brush set. My daughter took the smaller one and she loves it. Price was great and arrived on time</li>
            <li> I have 2 daughters and they loved them. Sturdy. My little one has long thick hair and I use the larger one on her. Will definitely order more soon. Thanks</li>
            <li> do not buy this brush - it will just be a waste of money you - I have really long hair and it pulls on it and I just don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> Saved a trip to the store. Good product.</li>
            <li> Very nice items.  Both brushes are a handy size.  The larger I use in house, the smaller fits in a medium purse.  The smaller brush might be a little big for carrying in a smaller purse. Well made, bristles are stiff enough without being abrasive to the scalp.  Works well with long fine hair.</li>
            <li> Brush is soft and pushes in easy, but comb works well as a comb as expected</li>
            <li> cheap nice brush. i like it</li>
            <li> Great brushes! I always keep the smaller one inn my bag. They&#x27;re very gentle.</li>
            <li> USE THEM ALL THE TIME</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and need something that can straighten it out when I get up in the morning with a dreadful case of bed head.  These brushes do it, without pain or loss of hair.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing else to be said except this. When I lost my hairbrush on a road trip, the name I typed into amazon to replace it was Conair. Great brush for anyone with tangles of long hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. I have been using it for months with no issues. Not even one bristle falling off to my knowledge. Would definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small one is good for carrying around, but I basically just use the big one.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Purchased for grooming my cat because she kept coming up and rubbing against mine when I was brushing my hair with a similar one.  Now she has one and I can have mine.  Something about this type of brush she adores.  Perhaps she feels pretty after she gets brushed with it.  I took the large one for me, and gave Amber the small one.  I find the brush to be like other brushes of the same design.  This one had good tip covers on each of the bristles and no bristles have come out of the base yet.  Even with Amber taking hers and giving it a really hard back leg thrashing at times.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, good sturdy construction/materials, good price.  The smaller added brush was a definite bonus. No complaints.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. I love the two different sizes. One for home, one for travel. They are tangle free too.</li>
            <li> Bought these to replace some old brushes.  Works perfectly fine.  Goes through hair easily. Mine came in purple which was fine.</li>
            <li> I feel like I can never have too many brushes and I like these because there is a small one for my purse or briefcase and a larger one for the house or car. They do a good job on my thin, static-prone hair (I have to avoid brushes that don&#x27;t have these hard prongs) and they are priced well. I think this is the best value for good brushes I have found and I recommend them.</li>
            <li> These were a good price and exactly what I needed. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like the handle and the way the brush is made overall but it pulls my hair.  Tangles usually don&#x27;t bother me much but I started to notice lots of tangles right away b/c they hurt more using this brush.</li>
            <li> After just using these brushes for a very short time they fell apart.</li>
            <li> Brush order was shipped as expected. Both arrived on time, were new and they both are of fine quality and work great.</li>
            <li> Well, these brushes do serve their purpose. And by that I mean that they will comb your hair. These are well made, durable and I literally have nothing to complain about. I enjoy the little polished beads at the end of each...comber thing; the little beads do a good job of preventing scalp scratching. I also enjoy the fact that there are two brushes in the set. You can reserve one of them for when you get out of the shower (to keep it clean) and the other for all-day use.</li>
            <li> Quality brush, low price!</li>
            <li> what more can you say. it works like it should and that&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;what more can you say. it works like it should and that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> works pretty well. Plastic handles seem a little flimsy, but hopefully won&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> I buy this brush set about every 5 years.  First from the local drug store and now from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work at detangling and clean easily.  The brush area is flexible and the bristles don&#x27;t scratch your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish on the handle does come off after a couple years use and gets sticky and that is what usually makes me get a new set, even though they still work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the bristle area break once in many years of use.</li>
            <li> Great product, great value.  I got this set to use for both myself and my two year old daughter (she has a ton of hair).  She loves to use the little travel one at the same time that I use the big one.</li>
            <li> I had to buy these after my dog chewed up my last one. They got to my house very quick. there not they best set of brushes but they definitely do the trick.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say about it as I don&#x27;t have much hair, but it feels nice to hold and has the con air quality to it.</li>
            <li> Love my new hairbrush. Soft, well constructed. Works great for my long think hair. Great price, great product. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this set after my brush of over ten years finally fell apart on me. So far, this has been a great replacement. The brush came in black with purple accent. So far so good!</li>
            <li> good quality and resonable price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of these brushes. When the first one fell apart after 3 months, I thought it was just a fluke, but this is my second, I&#x27;ve had it 2 1/2 months and it&#x27;s falling apart. The bristles are still in, but the rubber padding that holds them comes unglued if you use this brush on wet hair. I have very thick, moderately long hair and when I&#x27;ve used these brushes on only dry hair they hold up just fine, but if used on wet hair, they come unglued very quickly. Save your money. Spend a little bit more on a good brush that will hold up instead of trying to save money on this one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s combs, do you really need a second opinion?&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;ll say is that my pair came in purple as opposed to the cool color here in the picture. But I&#x27;m not picky and it does the job. Would recommend at this price for sure!</li>
            <li> Great brush and two sizes which is awesome. Brilliant at untangling little girl&#x27;s knotty hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Conair hairbrushes now and this one has been the best.  I love the soft cushion of the brush and the sturdy bristles.  It comes with a smaller, travel-sized brush which makes this a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> i got this for my wife. it works ok i guess. its a brush. i liked that it came with 2 since she is always loosing her brushes. between her and my daughter i think im going to attach it to wall with some string.</li>
            <li> Great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this deal.  I keep one in my backpack and one at home.  Work great.</li>
            <li> They seem well constructed however I don&#x27;t really like the sizes. One is really too big for my purpose and the other is too small. Wish they offered one in the middle.</li>
            <li> I like that I could get two brushes together. My daughter uses the smaller one and I don&#x27;t have to worry about her constantly losing my brush. It doesn&#x27;t add a lot of static to your hair. I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Most of us have used this type of brush at some time. It is still good, dependable, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money. I like the small cushion brush better then the larger&lt;br /&gt;one. Easier to carry and store away.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Love these brushes. De-tangle my hair so gently. My other brushes get caught all the times and I practically have to yank at my scalp to work the brush through. Not with these. They de-tangle hair like a dream. Will buy a pair for my mum.</li>
            <li> What you get are two excellent brushes for the price of one. The big one is good for keeping in the bathroom, the smaller one of course is good for when you&#x27;re out and about - as is easy to stuff in a pocket and use whenever you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bigger one though - is higher quality. The bristles are less stiff compared to the smaller one, and more gentle on longer hair. Still, both brushes are excellent and I use them both every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5</li>
            <li> I have straight hair and they do their job of helping untangle. They are soft so I even use the small one on my 2-year-old and he doesn&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Replaced 2 of my older brushes from a cheapo store. These are perfect, and I even wash them and they hold up well. Grip is nice , too. Would definitely buy again and will for my daughter.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great and soft on the scalp. It is nice to have brushes that do not hurt the head when you are doing your hair!</li>
            <li> Hair brush is really nice. The bristle tips are not hard on my scalp. Also, less hair breakage. All in all great product for an amazing price. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I got this pack for my daughter to help those tangles. The small brush is just the right size and my wife can use the larger as a backup or travel brush. Great price for decent little brushes. I never knew how expensive brushes can be until I looked int he store... Maybe I&#x27;m just cheap, but I&#x27;ll positive spin it as frugal.</li>
            <li> I saw these two brushes in sale for under 2 bucks and I could not pass that up.&lt;br /&gt;Are they amazing quality brushes?  Not really, but they are fine for my needs.  I am going to leave one in the car for emergency and the other in my gym bag.  For those simple uses, this was the best deal I have ever found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my home brush I have paid a lot more and I suggest you do too.  :)</li>
            <li> Nice quality brushes.</li>
            <li> GOOD BRUSHES, GREAT ADD-ON PRICE.</li>
            <li> OK but noticed the handle is not round</li>
            <li> It is a great deal for the price! The travel one comes in handy on trips. They are just normal hairbrushes and I&#x27;ve had no problems with them. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I loved this hair brush ! It is pack of two , ine is big brush which is good at home and another one is smaller perfect for purse on travel. I tried many brushes before but every time had to come back on comb . This easily detangle hairs with out pullung hairs , bristles look hard but it is pretty smooth ! Surely would recommend it best price !</li>
            <li> Great product! Love these brushes and they last FOREVER</li>
            <li> great price. mom and daughter pair was nice.</li>
            <li> The midsize brush already fell apart. The other remains working fine, but I have no doubt it&#x27;ll break soon enough.</li>
            <li> I miss the days of commonly finding brushes that offer the sturdy bristles such as the ones found here along with the softer brush underneath on the same brush head. The last one I found that I like finally broke after years of service. I had to go with what is popular so I purchased this brush set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As expected, the hard bristles grab onto any tangles and give quite a pull. However, much to my surprise, they do not just pull at the hair. I fine that these brushes, although still a bit rough to get through hair first thing in the morning, do not pull as much as I expected and actually remove most tangles in one try. I would not recommend trying to get it through your hair without holding the hair between the head and the brush as it would be painful, but the tangle will come out with minimal effort and hair breakage if taken gently yet firmly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still prefer the style of brushes that I used to get but have become hard to find in a smaller town like where I live but, as long as you know what to expect from this kind of hard stiff bristle brush, these seem to be worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth more than the price. Just buy it!</li>
            <li> Great brushes and even greater price! Actually surprisingly cheap for the quality.</li>
            <li> Product  arrived in excellent shape and performs well in getting rid of tangles in long hair, especially when hair is wet.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest, but will do the job.  Price was excellent but probably would not purchase if I seen them in store.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes!  Very rubbery compared to my old hard plastic brushes. Solid (in terms of quality) brushes. Good price. 2-thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Love this brush! My new favorite brush. Doesn&#x27;t yank, pull, or break hair.</li>
            <li> easily detangles my hair when wet and my hair gets really stringy.  Also great to smooth hair when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> While the shape of the brush makes it very easy to use, the brush heads themselves are not adequately sturdy. I have not yet had this brush two months and already five brush heads have come out from the main brush during normal use.</li>
            <li> Conair Hair products are the worst. It will work well for few months and then it will stop working. When i asked couple of friends they had the same experience. Recently I bought a hair dryer and after 8 months it stopped working. When i called conair for warranty they asked me to send it to AZ with $7 in the pack. Please dont trust Conair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend because it came with the little brush that he could also take to work for convenience.  These are great for his hair but is a little flimsy for my long hair.</li>
            <li> Two brushes - full and mid size - work well.  Items as described.</li>
            <li> I cannot I considered getting any other brush! This one comes with a travel sized brush and it is less expensive then most others. Conair makes a go-to brush!</li>
            <li> Does what it needs too. Comb your rats nests out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hair brush. It properly brushes my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep the small one in my purse and the bigger one in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> I lost my round paddle brush at a circus the other night with my niece, so I was glad I was able to get this in two days!! I could&#x27;ve just went to the grocery store, but this was easier. plus, I gave the mini one to her</li>
            <li> I personally prefer this kind of hair brush over all other types. It&#x27;s good to use in wet or dry hair and gets the tangles out fairly easy. I have naturally thick wavy hair, and when I brush mine with this kind of brush it makes it a bit more voluminous, which may be ideal for some one with hair that&#x27;s a bit thinner too. I usually use the bigger one at home and take the smaller one with me as a space saver when I&#x27;m travelling, so they&#x27;re both convenient to have.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted&lt;br /&gt;Can not say one bad thing</li>
            <li> I had went to different stores in my area to find a specific type of hair brush that none of these stores had, so i came back to amazon after a little looking i found exactually what i needed &amp; price was well w/ in my budget. Great hair brushes, i &#x27;d even given the bigger one to my mother-in-law she liked it so much &amp; the smaller one worked great on my hair just as the big one did.</li>
            <li> This is for thick hair. It hurt my head.</li>
