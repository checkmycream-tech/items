            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>no comments any more ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Talking $27.00 or more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I now understand the meaning of love and equality for all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better products on the market than this</li>
            <li>I especially love the big pusher that I use when performing pedicures.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to use pusher yet.</li>
            <li>and I got better complements on my Mani then the salon.</li>
            <li>,I like to buy more things</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and look forward to using them for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>This set was wonderful the first time I ordered - sharp, sturdy, good quality.</li>
            <li>Perfect, as expected.</li>
            <li>It was a cheap product, I should have known better.  </li>
            <li>They are excellent at least so far they have exceeded my expectations and still work perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is perfect and sharp!</li>
            <li>I thought it was fine.</li>
            <li>so you can get a precise manicure.</li>
            <li>cheap quality.</li>
            <li>Nice tools and very affordable</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy my own utensils for the nail salon and these work very well.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see how something so cheap would work.</li>
            <li>and i have been using these so far so good.</li>
            <li>AND IT SEEMS GOOD SO FAR.</li>
            <li>I was most interested in the clipper</li>
            <li>They are sharp and precise doing a great job to get your nails in tip-top shape - like you just came from a salon.  </li>
            <li>Not too sure what to do with the other tools, but they are good quality.  </li>
            <li>After looking at beauty supply stores and finding the same tools for three times the cost, each tool, I was happy to get this whole set for the price (price included shipping, as well!)</li>
            <li>Great for the price but a bit rough on the finish work.</li>
            <li>Good value actually still used</li>
            <li>Fantastic job worth the time to get and investment..</li>
            <li>but I quickly found that out after purchasing these.</li>
            <li>It is a very effecient and comfortable tool to use.</li>
            <li>The metal is lighter and much cheaper looking, the tools are not curved as well to fit the nail shape, and the connecting piece between the handles of the clipper was bent.</li>
            <li>I liked them so well that I decided to buy a second set for my spouse.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>These nail instruments are so worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>love them alot so far</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth 4d price</li>
            <li>For the price they are worth it</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;its was worth the wait</li>
            <li>The cuticle pushers come in little foldover mini plastic bags to be stored in, which is very nice.</li>
            <li>So happy I am buying several more as gifts for other people.</li>
            <li>very nice quality feeling  heavy metal design.</li>
            <li>The other two instruments are good, but I didn&#x27;t order this for them</li>
            <li>One was pretty sharp, but maybe someone more skilled in beauty instruments would know what to do with it.</li>
            <li>polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that I was sent two different cuticle pushers, as some reviewers stated they received two of the same.  </li>
            <li>used my friend&#x27;s cuticle clipper with much more success, i will be purchasing a different clipper because this one just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the cuticle nippers, they are sharp and work well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most likely end up using it for scraping off gel</li>
            <li>Overall, for $3.44, I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>does exactly what its suppose to.</li>
            <li>Took a long time to arrive but so far so good...</li>
            <li>Much better than the quality of those at my local drug store.  </li>
            <li>So much for trying to save a buck!</li>
            <li>The clippers are nice and sharp and the handles of the cuticle scrapers is textured well enough to be easy to grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimmer is very sharp, making it easy and smooth to use.</li>
            <li>This little 3 piece set is better than anything I&#x27;ve paid more for at your local beauty supply store or drug store.  </li>
            <li>After returning a Tweezerman nipper that didn&#x27;t work, I bought this and really like it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as much as I imagined</li>
            <li>This took 3 weeks to a month to arrive, but it&#x27;s because it is shipped straight out of Hong Kong.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>This product is the real thing that is used in the salons.</li>
            <li>idk how much of a review you can do for nail clippers</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend, you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li>It cuts really well.  </li>
            <li>they work really well.</li>
            <li>Also takes forever for deleting very...</li>
            <li>3 stars for producing something solid and sending them all the way here for free.</li>
            <li>The nipper not so much.</li>
            <li>The cutters are really sharp and work great, just be careful because being a brand</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the cuticle nipper to be very sharp and to cut quickly and cleanly without any pulling.</li>
            <li>they are very sharp and I can clip the tiniest piece of cuticle very precisely</li>
            <li>What used to be a great deal turned into a complete waste - next time</li>
            <li>Nippers are absolutely blunt, other two items are not bad!</li>
            <li>the trimmers pusher is great, but the cuticle clipper is not near sharp enough...</li>
            <li>It cost a fortune normally.</li>
            <li>new pair</li>
            <li>NEW REVIEW (2015)</li>
            <li>The connecting element in the cuticle nipper got disassembled in the first minute and does not come back together again.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to everyone because it doesn&#x27;t cost much and you&#x27;re getting high quality tools for it; however, if you are in a hurry to get these tools, I suggest for you to order from another seller where you could get it faster.</li>
            <li>Very  sharp precise nippers.</li>
            <li>The small pusher I use most often is starting to dull slightly, but for the most part these tools are far better than what you will buy in stores for 3x the price.</li>
            <li>My life has completely changed and my hands totally appreciate me so much.</li>
            <li>IT IS PROFESSIONAL QUALITY</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this kit.</li>
            <li>These tools are very well made and will last for years!  </li>
            <li>They are professional quality.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really want the extra items</li>
            <li>The other pieces are fine and I&#x27;ve been using them regularly.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;d work better for carving troll&#x27;s toe nails, not my already-thin weak finger nails.</li>
            <li>received earlier than expected, exactly as illustrated</li>
            <li>I bought these a few months ago, and they took a while to arrive, but it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>And by polished I mean precise &amp; even (not shiny polished).  </li>
            <li>The large end of the one cuticle pusher is very big compared to other cuticle pushers I&#x27;ve seen/used.  </li>
            <li>I read on more than one review that they recieved a product made in china that was of poor quality but the ones I recieved were german and very solid.</li>
            <li>These are very sharp and very high quality tools.</li>

            <li> Good value actually still used</li>
            <li> Fantastic job worth the time to get and investment..</li>
            <li> but I quickly found that out after purchasing these.</li>
            <li> It is a very effecient and comfortable tool to use.</li>
            <li> The metal is lighter and much cheaper looking, the tools are not curved as well to fit the nail shape, and the connecting piece between the handles of the clipper was bent.</li>
            <li> I liked them so well that I decided to buy a second set for my spouse.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> These nail instruments are so worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> love them alot so far</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth 4d price</li>
            <li> For the price they are worth it</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;its was worth the wait</li>
            <li> The cuticle pushers come in little foldover mini plastic bags to be stored in, which is very nice.</li>
            <li> So happy I am buying several more as gifts for other people.</li>
            <li> very nice quality feeling  heavy metal design.</li>
            <li> The other two instruments are good, but I didn&#x27;t order this for them</li>
            <li> One was pretty sharp, but maybe someone more skilled in beauty instruments would know what to do with it.</li>
            <li> polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that I was sent two different cuticle pushers, as some reviewers stated they received two of the same.  </li>
            <li> used my friend&#x27;s cuticle clipper with much more success, i will be purchasing a different clipper because this one just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the cuticle nippers, they are sharp and work well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll most likely end up using it for scraping off gel</li>
            <li> Overall, for $3.44, I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> does exactly what its suppose to.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to arrive but so far so good...</li>
            <li> Much better than the quality of those at my local drug store.  </li>
            <li> So much for trying to save a buck!</li>
            <li> The clippers are nice and sharp and the handles of the cuticle scrapers is textured well enough to be easy to grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very sharp, making it easy and smooth to use.</li>
            <li> This little 3 piece set is better than anything I&#x27;ve paid more for at your local beauty supply store or drug store.  </li>
            <li> After returning a Tweezerman nipper that didn&#x27;t work, I bought this and really like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as much as I imagined</li>
            <li> This took 3 weeks to a month to arrive, but it&#x27;s because it is shipped straight out of Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> fast delivery</li>
            <li> This product is the real thing that is used in the salons.</li>
            <li> idk how much of a review you can do for nail clippers</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend, you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li> It cuts really well.  </li>
            <li> they work really well.</li>
            <li> Also takes forever for deleting very...</li>
            <li> 3 stars for producing something solid and sending them all the way here for free.</li>
            <li> The nipper not so much.</li>
            <li> The cutters are really sharp and work great, just be careful because being a brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the cuticle nipper to be very sharp and to cut quickly and cleanly without any pulling.</li>
            <li> they are very sharp and I can clip the tiniest piece of cuticle very precisely</li>
            <li> What used to be a great deal turned into a complete waste - next time</li>
            <li> Nippers are absolutely blunt, other two items are not bad!</li>
            <li> the trimmers pusher is great, but the cuticle clipper is not near sharp enough...</li>
            <li> It cost a fortune normally.</li>
            <li> new pair</li>
            <li> NEW REVIEW (2015)</li>
            <li> The connecting element in the cuticle nipper got disassembled in the first minute and does not come back together again.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to everyone because it doesn&#x27;t cost much and you&#x27;re getting high quality tools for it; however, if you are in a hurry to get these tools, I suggest for you to order from another seller where you could get it faster.</li>
            <li> Very  sharp precise nippers.</li>
            <li> The small pusher I use most often is starting to dull slightly, but for the most part these tools are far better than what you will buy in stores for 3x the price.</li>
            <li> My life has completely changed and my hands totally appreciate me so much.</li>
            <li> IT IS PROFESSIONAL QUALITY</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this kit.</li>
            <li> These tools are very well made and will last for years!  </li>
            <li> They are professional quality.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really want the extra items</li>
            <li> The other pieces are fine and I&#x27;ve been using them regularly.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;d work better for carving troll&#x27;s toe nails, not my already-thin weak finger nails.</li>
            <li> received earlier than expected, exactly as illustrated</li>
            <li> I bought these a few months ago, and they took a while to arrive, but it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> And by polished I mean precise &amp; even (not shiny polished).  </li>
            <li> The large end of the one cuticle pusher is very big compared to other cuticle pushers I&#x27;ve seen/used.  </li>
            <li> I read on more than one review that they recieved a product made in china that was of poor quality but the ones I recieved were german and very solid.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp and very high quality tools.</li>
            <li> These are high quality tools and heavy duty metal.</li>
            <li> When I order these I knew that it would take long because it was coming from Hong Kong  </li>
            <li> but they actually got here quicker than expected</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t feel like a long time anyway.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to take a long time to get.  </li>
            <li> I emailed the company after the last expected day of shipment and they immediately shipped out another set for no charge.</li>
            <li> and I am not a professional by any means.</li>
            <li> After a few years of pretty heavy use I felt it was time to replace.</li>
            <li> and they are VERY sharp but get the work done the only thing that I would advise you</li>
            <li> I purchased it on the 26th and, less than three weeks later, I had it.  </li>
            <li> The second shipment came in less than a week.</li>
            <li> The edges of the cuticle pushers look dull and uneven, not uniform and sharp like my first</li>
            <li> Came quicker then expected.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not really convenience.</li>
            <li> I went to a salon spent two hrs for a mani.</li>
            <li> It took a little long for the shipping</li>
            <li> I use the other tools as well.</li>
            <li> Extremely well made nail tools.</li>
            <li> The cuticle trimmer is WAY too sharp...</li>
            <li> I use the smoll for hand and the other for feed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The nail clipper is not worth using.  </li>
            <li> trimmed my nails down to size.</li>
            <li> the clippers are a little small and sharp but i bought the set for the other tools  </li>
            <li> The package came in a plastic bag without any packing (last time I received them in a bubble envelope to at least protect sharp corners) and took over a month and a half (!!!) to arrive.</li>
            <li> With free shipping, even if you are not satisfied, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Obviously they have taken to cutting corners wherever possible.</li>
            <li> i like these tools but the cuticle nipper after a few aplications doesnt work that</li>
            <li> They are fairly heavy and made of metal.  </li>
            <li> they feel heavy and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> The cuticle clipper is so clunky and stiff, it&#x27;s unusable.</li>
            <li> Also, the nipper came in a fake &amp;#34;Solingen&amp;#34; package with differently sized and spaced letters.</li>
            <li> But the purpose of this purchase was nippers, so I&#x27;m completely not satisfied...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to say - they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> It is very heavy and well made.</li>
            <li> well anymore it is hard to cut a cuticle</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I recieved this set due to all of the horrible reviews of it.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed, the nippers are not sharp at all.</li>
            <li> .it can cut  not good why put forsale</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very hard to see what your getting.</li>
            <li> The pusher is heavy and the groove for the nail bed is an awkward angle-</li>
            <li> The cuticle cutters are very dull!</li>
            <li> They are totally useless except for making cuticles hurt</li>
            <li> therefor useless to me.</li>
            <li> Not cheap crap at all.</li>
            <li> extremely frustrating and painful.</li>
            <li> i am basically RIPPING off my cuticles instead of cutting or trimming them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> Bad investment.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this a while back and I love them! they work very well and they are very good quality for the price. I&#x27;ve seen cuticle nippers for up to $10 and that wasn&#x27;t even including the trimmer or the pusher! as a nail tech I recommend these for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on tools like this.</li>
            <li> Received this and I fell in love with them. Used them as soon as I got them and they are VERY sharp but get the work done the only thing that I would advise you is to NOT leave at the reach of children because they may cut themselves.</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t know how to use all parts of the tools, the parts I do know work well. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these tools and they are such a good price! I liked them so well that I decided to buy a second set for my spouse.</li>
            <li> Good value actually still used</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed, the nippers are not sharp at all. They are totally useless except for making cuticles hurt</li>
            <li> After returning a Tweezerman nipper that didn&#x27;t work, I bought this and really like it. I use the other tools as well.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  These work but they&#x27;re not as polished of a set as you would expect from a drugstore brand. And by polished I mean precise &amp; even (not shiny polished).  I am very pleased with the cuticle nippers, they are sharp and work well.  The large end of the one cuticle pusher is very big compared to other cuticle pushers I&#x27;ve seen/used.  I&#x27;ll most likely end up using it for scraping off gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that I was sent two different cuticle pushers, as some reviewers stated they received two of the same.  Overall, for $3.44, I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: E for world&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: E for world&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 16 days after order date</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I recieved this set due to all of the horrible reviews of it. I read on more than one review that they recieved a product made in china that was of poor quality but the ones I recieved were german and very solid. I don&#x27;t use it as much as I imagined I would but it&#x27;s nice to know I can give myself a pedicure at will. A+</li>
            <li> Came quicker then expected. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> i like these tools but the cuticle nipper after a few aplications doesnt work that well anymore it is hard to cut a cuticle</li>
            <li> trimmed my nails down to size. really great!</li>
            <li> I received my items on time in June and they are perfect and just what was advertised, they will be a welcomed asset to my nails care kit thank you.</li>
            <li> Awesome.… all ive got to say!! 👌🏻</li>
            <li> I bought these for gifts and my friends loved them!  A good buy which I would place another order if need be.</li>
            <li> Great items, I would recommend them</li>
            <li> The pusher is heavy and the groove for the nail bed is an awkward angle- you end up scratching the nail. The nippers were rusting almost immediately after sitting in barbacide. The smaller pushers have no job to do- therefor useless to me. Bad investment.</li>
            <li> Love how they work! Better than any I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;Came sooner than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing about them I dislike is how the middle part is made. It doesn&#x27;t stay together.</li>
            <li> I received these in the mail and was ecstatic. These are high quality tools and heavy duty metal. Not some cheapy items that I was expecting because of the low price. So happy I am buying several more as gifts for other people. Great Buy!</li>
            <li> Great price and great product.got 2 for the price of 1 at walmart</li>
            <li> This set is good quality for the price. It took a little long for the shipping but I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
            <li> These nail instruments are so worth the investment.  They are sharp and precise doing a great job to get your nails in tip-top shape - like you just came from a salon.  Great tools!</li>
            <li> does exactly what its suppose to. Keep in mind folks I never EVER did my own manicure, always going to the nail salon. Wanted to see if I can learn to do my own manicure. As a beginner, this product is easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li> The nail clipper is not worth using.  The other pieces are fine and I&#x27;ve been using them regularly.  I would not recommend the nail clippers at all.</li>
            <li> i am a nail tech and i have been using these so far so good. love them alot so far</li>
            <li> The connecting element in the cuticle nipper got disassembled in the first minute and does not come back together again. The nipper is blunt and does not cut at all, only rips the skin off. Also, the nipper came in a fake &amp;#34;Solingen&amp;#34; package with differently sized and spaced letters.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my shipment.  Those cuticle clippers are the best I&#x27;ve ever had...they are very sharp and I can clip the tiniest piece of cuticle very precisely</li>
            <li> Incredible value and I purchased 12 for a women&#x27;s manicure class.</li>
            <li> Perfect, as expected.</li>
            <li> I bought these a few months ago, and they took a while to arrive, but it was well worth the wait. The products are of great quality and are very sturdy. I would definitely recommend this to everyone because it doesn&#x27;t cost much and you&#x27;re getting high quality tools for it; however, if you are in a hurry to get these tools, I suggest for you to order from another seller where you could get it faster. This took 3 weeks to a month to arrive, but it&#x27;s because it is shipped straight out of Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and needed.</li>
            <li> Extremely well made nail tools. I love them. I am thinking of buying another set to keep on hand if these ever wear out. Fat chance!</li>
            <li> The cuticle nippers I received had packaging indicated it was manufactured in Germany. I thought it was fine. Didn&#x27;t try the others  as I found the one I was trying to replace.</li>
            <li> received earlier than expected, exactly as illustrated</li>
            <li> This is perfect and sharp! I love it</li>
            <li> Very  sharp precise nippers. There are 2 different size cuticle pushers with a different end on each one so you can get a precise manicure. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Better quality then I thought!</li>
            <li> The cuticle trimmer is WAY too sharp... yikes. Guess some people might like that...</li>
            <li> I use the pusher is so  good  I love it. I use the smoll for hand and the other for feed.&lt;br /&gt;The Nipper I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> I like it. I did not buy for my nails, but it seems good products. no comments any more ..</li>
            <li> IT DOES EVERYTHING I NEED. IT IS PROFESSIONAL QUALITY AND I HAVE USED IT ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND IT SEEMS GOOD SO FAR. I WILL DEFINITELY BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN. THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> cheap quality. fast delivery</li>
            <li> This product is the real thing that is used in the salons. It cost a fortune normally. I&#x27;m Talking $27.00 or more. I paid $4. I love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these during christmas and got the in january. The cutters are really sharp and work great, just be careful because being a brand new pair the cut very easily. The pushers are awesome, great pack for a great price. Not cheap crap at all.</li>
            <li> When I order these I knew that it would take long because it was coming from Hong Kong  but they actually got here quicker than expected didn&#x27;t feel like a long time anyway. Would definitely recommend works great and a great price</li>
            <li> idk how much of a review you can do for nail clippers but I quickly found that out after purchasing these. My life has completely changed and my hands totally appreciate me so much. I now understand the meaning of love and equality for all. I will no longer go into a path of darkness now that I have my beautifully manicured hands to lead the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naw j/k they work though LOL :)</li>
            <li> This little 3 piece set is better than anything I&#x27;ve paid more for at your local beauty supply store or drug store.  I&#x27;m sure there are better products on the market than this but you are not going to find it for cheaper than $25.00.  With free shipping, even if you are not satisfied, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this kit. It is very heavy and well made. I would highly recommend, you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li> Took a long time to arrive but so far so good... Nothing out of this world, it is what it is, but I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent set!  I especially love the big pusher that I use when performing pedicures.  It is a very effecient and comfortable tool to use.</li>
            <li> These products are great, I absolutely love them. They work great and came quickly!</li>
            <li> Great tools. Use them all the time.</li>
            <li> I use these tools weekly to trim my cuticles and push them back whenever necessary - these tools work like a charm. I&#x27;ve found the cuticle nipper to be very sharp and to cut quickly and cleanly without any pulling. The cuticle pushers come in little foldover mini plastic bags to be stored in, which is very nice. I keep the cuticle nipper in the case it came in, it&#x27;s easier to store that way, for me, and to ensure that it is not so exposed to bacteria. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and look forward to using them for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Nippers are absolutely blunt, other two items are not bad! But the purpose of this purchase was nippers, so I&#x27;m completely not satisfied...(</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say. These are sturdy tools that work well. The clippers are nice and sharp and the handles of the cuticle scrapers is textured well enough to be easy to grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re all sterilizable, too, which is great.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to take a long time to get.  I purchased it on the 26th and, less than three weeks later, I had it.  For the price (cheap - even including shipping), I am very happy with this set.  They are fairly heavy and made of metal.  I was most interested in the clipper and it is excellent.  It cuts really well.  Much better than the quality of those at my local drug store.  Not too sure what to do with the other tools, but they are good quality.  One was pretty sharp, but maybe someone more skilled in beauty instruments would know what to do with it.</li>
            <li> It was as described I like it but I&#x27;m not really convenience. But it&#x27;s worth 4d price</li>
            <li> very nice quality feeling  heavy metal design. the clippers are a little small and sharp but i bought the set for the other tools  i would buy these again  if they ever break</li>
            <li> These work amazing!! I would buy these again, recommend them!! For the price they are worth it they work really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to say - they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  No issues and they feel heavy and sturdy.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these items for my nail art course, and they&#x27;re perfect. Quick delivery and good quality of the items! I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> This was a very nice set. After looking at beauty supply stores and finding the same tools for three times the cost, each tool, I was happy to get this whole set for the price (price included shipping, as well!) The only reason I did not give 5 stars is I did not receive the set during my &amp;#34;shipping window&amp;#34; (approx. one month). I emailed the company after the last expected day of shipment and they immediately shipped out another set for no charge. The second shipment came in less than a week. Not sure what happened with the first shipment.</li>
            <li> Nice tools and very affordable,  I was a bit nervous to purchase these after I had read the reviews but to my surprise they were GREAT!</li>
            <li> The cuticle clipper is so clunky and stiff, it&#x27;s unusable.</li>
            <li> Cuticle Nippers are great! Haven&#x27;t been able to use pusher yet. Took awhile for items to get here. Didn&#x27;t realize they where they were coming from. But overall, I would order again</li>
            <li> the trimmers pusher is great, but the cuticle clipper is not near sharp enough... i am basically RIPPING off my cuticles instead of cutting or trimming them. extremely frustrating and painful. used my friend&#x27;s cuticle clipper with much more success, i will be purchasing a different clipper because this one just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The cuticle cutters are very dull! Also takes forever for deleting very... Shipped from China!!</li>
            <li> Could be smoother. Otherwise they work.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this set.  These tools are very well made and will last for years!  The price is excellent.</li>
            <li> Took for ever to get here but works great&lt;br /&gt;its was worth the wait</li>
            <li> Nail cut cuticle look like toy  .it can cut  not good why put forsale</li>
            <li> The cuticle nipper&#x27;s edges do not meet properly except at the deepest part of the curve.  They don&#x27;t come together at all at the point, which means they can&#x27;t be used to clip cuticles!  The other two instruments are good, but I didn&#x27;t order this for them, I wanted a cuticle nipper.  It was a cheap product, I should have known better.  So much for trying to save a buck!</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy my own utensils for the nail salon and these work very well.  They are professional quality.</li>
            <li> ❤❤❤Best investment.. I went to a salon spent two hrs for a mani.I got these and it took me 20 min to use and I got better complements on my Mani then the salon.Fantastic job worth the time to get and investment..</li>
            <li> nice quality instruments for removing shellac after soaking in polish-off solvent for home shellac setup (thereby saving tons of money!)</li>
            <li> NEW REVIEW (2015) ** This set was wonderful the first time I ordered - sharp, sturdy, good quality. After a few years of pretty heavy use I felt it was time to replace. Obviously they have taken to cutting corners wherever possible. The package came in a plastic bag without any packing (last time I received them in a bubble envelope to at least protect sharp corners) and took over a month and a half (!!!) to arrive. The metal is lighter and much cheaper looking, the tools are not curved as well to fit the nail shape, and the connecting piece between the handles of the clipper was bent. The edges of the cuticle pushers look dull and uneven, not uniform and sharp like my first set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing. What used to be a great deal turned into a complete waste - next time I&#x27;ll invest in something decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD REVIEW (2013) ***** These are very sharp and very high quality tools. The small pusher I use most often is starting to dull slightly, but for the most part these tools are far better than what you will buy in stores for 3x the price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d work better for carving troll&#x27;s toe nails, not my already-thin weak finger nails. 3 stars for producing something solid and sending them all the way here for free.</li>
            <li> I may not be the best reviewer, since this is my first set of tools like this and I am not a professional by any means. However they work well for me. The trimmer is very sharp, making it easy and smooth to use.</li>
            <li> The cuticle pushers are amazingly awesome. The nipper not so much. The point doesn&#x27;t close so it&#x27;s very hard to see what your getting. I would buy it again for the pushers.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Great price, fast de livery!</li>
            <li> Love it! Excellent price and just like what they use in the nail salons. Now I can do my nails in between the salon trips myself</li>
            <li> Great for the price but a bit rough on the finish work.</li>
            <li> I have not got it yet,and I like to know why,please let mi know,I like to buy more things but I am waiting for this one</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical. I didn&#x27;t see how something so cheap would work. I didn&#x27;t really want the extra items but it was still cheaper than buying the cuticle clippers alone so I took the chance. Now all the girls in my family have their own kit. They are excellent at least so far they have exceeded my expectations and still work perfectly. Great find!!</li>
            <li> Awsome. Sturdy, and great for working on the nails. Came in a timely manner. Very happy.</li>
