            <li>Sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners are great for girls who want</li>
            <li>/&gt;Girlfriend still has hair, successful</li>
            <li>reason I struggle with it is that nothing in this conditioner is good for your hair.</li>
            <li>A WORD TO THE WISE</li>
            <li>In a really good way.</li>
            <li>The smell is good.</li>
            <li>No longer available in stores, I am thrilled to find it on Amazon!!</li>
            <li>And the best thing is they are SUPER affordable.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!!!</li>

            <li>AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I can feel a huge difference when I use it.</li>
            <li>Yes it is amazing</li>
            <li>amazing n</li>
            <li>It smells really good, and it&#x27;s sulfate-free, which is supposed to be better for your hair.</li>
            <li>Shampoo and conditioner combo leave my hair smelling nice and seems to be helping my issues though I still have breakage problems.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s BETTER than Kerastase, but I will say that it&#x27;s every bit as good.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found salon products that are this good, and they cost 2 to 3 times more.</li>
            <li>I am  very pleased with this product and will buy it again :)</li>
            <li>I am so pleased and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>My hair got stronger as a result of using this, and I love the refreshing rosemary/mint scent!</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE the l&#x27;oreal everstrong line!</li>
            <li>love love love!</li>
            <li>I purchased this when I could no longer find the conditioner that I had found very light, yet strengthening.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this line of L&#x27;Oreal shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>Once I started using this product, I noticed stronger, shinier, more manageable hair.</li>
            <li>But I figure it&#x27;s always better to reduce the amount of chemicals I&#x27;m exposing myself to.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I really do not have any issues with my hair, so I look for a conditioner that smells really good and helps keep the static fly aways under control in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The entire shower will smell deliciously of childhood, mint, juniper, and spring.</li>
            <li>Two weeks after using this product, my hair gained a healthy shine without the grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>And for the price, you can&#x27;t get any better.    </li>
            <li>I AM SO SO PLEASED.</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo I have ever used and will definitely continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Love how it smells.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to order more</li>
            <li>My hair is also more manageable and shiny.</li>
            <li>My review is more of a plea to loreal.</li>
            <li>I find this conditioner to be on par with or better than those products.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt the difference at the first wash, amazing!</li>
            <li>Plus, it has a crisp mint scent, which gives me a good wake up in the morning :)</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair perfectly nourished from root to tip, and not in the slightest dry nor greasy.</li>
            <li>came fast and is a really really good product.</li>
            <li>Though the fragrance is not my favorite, it provides very good nourishment for dry hair and prevents frizz.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t knot up easily like it used to and is silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>The first thing to know when buying this product is that it has a VERY strong mint scent.  </li>
            <li>I freely admit, it was the advertizing for L&#x27;Oreal Everstrong that drew me in.</li>
            <li>There is definitely a reduction in my hair fall which makes me happy, but I also use a Natrol 10,000mg biotin supplement.</li>
            <li>My hair feels fantastic after using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>After my daughter uses this product and the condition of her hair improves, she likes the L&#x27;Oreal products in this sulfate free line that add volume and body.</li>
            <li>This product has a lot of hydrating qualities for my dry swimmer&#x27;s hair and gives it a beautiful and light mint scent.  </li>
            <li>I have been using goldwell ultra rich.</li>
            <li>Loreal reconstruct conditioner is so rich.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, which is more like a professional hair care product and not a bowl of fruit salad.</li>
            <li>My scalp feels really clean.</li>
            <li>They are thick and rich and work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>My hair smelled wonderful (similar to Aveda), but more importantly, it continues to be soft, shiny, and healthy looking after several months of use.</li>
            <li>I am growing out a full head of dyed hair, and so I have half-natural, half-dyed</li>
            <li>I love that it smells so intensely refreshing and clean, and that the smell lingers, both on my hair as well as in my bathroom, for hours later!</li>
            <li>I have really healthy hair, so I rarely indulge in decent hair products, but I thought I would give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is delightful and lasts for several hours after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li>The only kind of shampoo and conditioner I will buy.  </li>
            <li>But honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with these products versus the regular stuff I used to buy.  </li>
            <li>I follow conditioning with the Loreal product with a dilute apple cider vinegar rinse, and so far, I am pleased with the performance of the Loreal conditioner and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised with how much better my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I try to wash my hair every other day, and sometimes every 3 days if it&#x27;s not too oily, but I can remember many many times where I&#x27;ve woken up the day after I used L&#x27;Oreal shampoo and conditioner and felt like a can of olive oil fell on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing special</li>
            <li>My hair feels strong and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>a side note, subscribe and save it great, especially for daily products like this.</li>
            <li>it matters, my hair is naturally baby fine and very straight.</li>
            <li>I personally like it and find it both refreshing and relaxing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>When I first saw this I noticed that it was sulfur-free (which I always try to stick to) and that it was very affordable!</li>
            <li>After the first wash I could tell a difference.</li>
            <li>Made the switch to sulfate free because I thought it might help with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I love it (especially for OTC).  </li>
            <li>I could feel an improvement in my hair (softer, smoother) after the first use.</li>
            <li>If you use a lot, especially on the roots, your hair will be weighed down and appear more oily more quickly.</li>
            <li>My hair was softer, less tangled, more manageable, and my ends seemed less brittle and more healthy.</li>
            <li>which I&#x27;m sure didn&#x27;t help with the oily problem in the long run.</li>
            <li>My hair feels super soft and conditioned after using it.  </li>
            <li>I used to break out on my scalp when I used certain shampoos that contained sulfates.  </li>
            <li>Overall I find that while this product feels great and creamy on my hair in the shower, it weighs my hair down too much for every day use.  </li>
            <li>like this product, but...I really struggle with it.</li>
            <li>I only get these shampoo/conditioner product lines because they&#x27;re sulphate free.</li>
            <li>and I can tell when using them together that it really helps my hair since I color and highlight which can be drying to hair.</li>
            <li>the scent is great and similar to a more expensive salon product.</li>
            <li>i highly recomend it!</li>
            <li>The Reconstruct shampoo and masque are absolutely magical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really hope this stays around.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>But please be aware that if you&#x27;re very sensitive to smells, then this is not the product for you.    </li>
            <li>I have long, straight hair that is kind of thin and kind of oily, and this made my hair feel softer and healthier without drying out my hair or making it too greasy.</li>
            <li>I generally tend to use a LOT of shampoo and conditioner, to make sure my hair is fully covered and that there&#x27;s enough conditioner to set in my hair.</li>
            <li>Since I really do love the scent and enjoy the feel of it in the shower, I use just a tiny bit mixed in with my regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I quickly learned to use the conditioner very sparingly only on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>I just moved into a new house and the water softener has been very out of whack.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the main reason I like the product.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>OmG it truly is a high quality reconstructor.</li>
            <li>No matter how long I spend in the shower, I can&#x27;t get it to ever rinse completely clean.</li>
            <li>I now wash my hair with a very mild shampoo, every other day (or every three days, if I can help it).</li>
            <li>However, what I don&#x27;t like about them is their tendency to make my hair oilier than normal.</li>
            <li>and I rarely venture outside the drugstore for my haircare needs.</li>
            <li>For reference: wavy hair, normal to oily.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the same review as for the matching</li>
            <li>The scent is mild, and it only requires a dime sized amount to completely treat my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without them.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to scents and get an allergic reaction to scented hair products (eyes swell shut,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very mild conditioner, and leaves my hair feeling soft, not weighed down in the slightest, and never greasy or frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have pretty low standards for my shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Over the years, I have used a number of high-end high-priced hair products, and this conditioner works just as well if not better than most of them.</li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;dirty blonde&amp;#34; hair was looking pretty dull after summer swimming and cheap shampoos.</li>
            <li>Also an amazing product, but at $38 for an 8 oz bottle, it got pretty expensive.</li>
            <li>I have no trouble whatsoever with this product.</li>
            <li>the buildup it leaves near my scalp looks like dandruff.</li>
            <li>This one has a heavier feel and doesn&#x27;t seem to completely rinse out.  </li>
            <li>I used to use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s top-of-the-line product, Kerastase (Bain de Force shampoo, and Lait Vital conditioner).</li>
            <li>shampoo and masque keep my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>However, I feel like I have been completely ovr paying.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;a natural hair again.</li>
            <li>The smell is very different (not your usual fruity smell), but it&#x27;s not very strong and , in my opinion, smells great.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this product, I was purchasing high end salon products for $20-30 per bottle.  </li>
            <li>However, it leaves my thin, straight and somewhat brittle hair shiny, sleek, bouncy and still strong.  </li>
            <li>Mineral oil is a cheap product, usually derived from petroleum, that builds up on hair.</li>
            <li>However, when I had a physical job and had to wash my hair daily, this quickly made my hair tangled, dry, and almost sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a different shampoo, but this conditioner made my hair so soft and manageable, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the change!</li>
            <li>...but when your hair is no longer damaged, it tends to make your hair very soft and flat.</li>
            <li>, I have tried the other smells and don&#x27;t like them as much.  </li>
            <li>natural looking when I flat iron.</li>

            <li> But honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with these products versus the regular stuff I used to buy.  </li>
            <li> I follow conditioning with the Loreal product with a dilute apple cider vinegar rinse, and so far, I am pleased with the performance of the Loreal conditioner and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised with how much better my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I try to wash my hair every other day, and sometimes every 3 days if it&#x27;s not too oily, but I can remember many many times where I&#x27;ve woken up the day after I used L&#x27;Oreal shampoo and conditioner and felt like a can of olive oil fell on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing special</li>
            <li> My hair feels strong and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> a side note, subscribe and save it great, especially for daily products like this.</li>
            <li> it matters, my hair is naturally baby fine and very straight.</li>
            <li> I personally like it and find it both refreshing and relaxing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> When I first saw this I noticed that it was sulfur-free (which I always try to stick to) and that it was very affordable!</li>
            <li> After the first wash I could tell a difference.</li>
            <li> Made the switch to sulfate free because I thought it might help with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I love it (especially for OTC).  </li>
            <li> I could feel an improvement in my hair (softer, smoother) after the first use.</li>
            <li> If you use a lot, especially on the roots, your hair will be weighed down and appear more oily more quickly.</li>
            <li> My hair was softer, less tangled, more manageable, and my ends seemed less brittle and more healthy.</li>
            <li> which I&#x27;m sure didn&#x27;t help with the oily problem in the long run.</li>
            <li> My hair feels super soft and conditioned after using it.  </li>
            <li> I used to break out on my scalp when I used certain shampoos that contained sulfates.  </li>
            <li> Overall I find that while this product feels great and creamy on my hair in the shower, it weighs my hair down too much for every day use.  </li>
            <li> like this product, but...I really struggle with it.</li>
            <li> I only get these shampoo/conditioner product lines because they&#x27;re sulphate free.</li>
            <li> and I can tell when using them together that it really helps my hair since I color and highlight which can be drying to hair.</li>
            <li> the scent is great and similar to a more expensive salon product.</li>
            <li> i highly recomend it!</li>
            <li> The Reconstruct shampoo and masque are absolutely magical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really hope this stays around.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> But please be aware that if you&#x27;re very sensitive to smells, then this is not the product for you.    </li>
            <li> I have long, straight hair that is kind of thin and kind of oily, and this made my hair feel softer and healthier without drying out my hair or making it too greasy.</li>
            <li> I generally tend to use a LOT of shampoo and conditioner, to make sure my hair is fully covered and that there&#x27;s enough conditioner to set in my hair.</li>
            <li> Since I really do love the scent and enjoy the feel of it in the shower, I use just a tiny bit mixed in with my regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I quickly learned to use the conditioner very sparingly only on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I just moved into a new house and the water softener has been very out of whack.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the main reason I like the product.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> OmG it truly is a high quality reconstructor.</li>
            <li> No matter how long I spend in the shower, I can&#x27;t get it to ever rinse completely clean.</li>
            <li> I now wash my hair with a very mild shampoo, every other day (or every three days, if I can help it).</li>
            <li> However, what I don&#x27;t like about them is their tendency to make my hair oilier than normal.</li>
            <li> and I rarely venture outside the drugstore for my haircare needs.</li>
            <li> For reference: wavy hair, normal to oily.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the same review as for the matching</li>
            <li> The scent is mild, and it only requires a dime sized amount to completely treat my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without them.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to scents and get an allergic reaction to scented hair products (eyes swell shut,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very mild conditioner, and leaves my hair feeling soft, not weighed down in the slightest, and never greasy or frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have pretty low standards for my shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have used a number of high-end high-priced hair products, and this conditioner works just as well if not better than most of them.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;dirty blonde&amp;#34; hair was looking pretty dull after summer swimming and cheap shampoos.</li>
            <li> Also an amazing product, but at $38 for an 8 oz bottle, it got pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> I have no trouble whatsoever with this product.</li>
            <li> the buildup it leaves near my scalp looks like dandruff.</li>
            <li> This one has a heavier feel and doesn&#x27;t seem to completely rinse out.  </li>
            <li> I used to use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s top-of-the-line product, Kerastase (Bain de Force shampoo, and Lait Vital conditioner).</li>
            <li> shampoo and masque keep my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> However, I feel like I have been completely ovr paying.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;a natural hair again.</li>
            <li> The smell is very different (not your usual fruity smell), but it&#x27;s not very strong and , in my opinion, smells great.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product, I was purchasing high end salon products for $20-30 per bottle.  </li>
            <li> However, it leaves my thin, straight and somewhat brittle hair shiny, sleek, bouncy and still strong.  </li>
            <li> Mineral oil is a cheap product, usually derived from petroleum, that builds up on hair.</li>
            <li> However, when I had a physical job and had to wash my hair daily, this quickly made my hair tangled, dry, and almost sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a different shampoo, but this conditioner made my hair so soft and manageable, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the change!</li>
            <li> ...but when your hair is no longer damaged, it tends to make your hair very soft and flat.</li>
            <li> , I have tried the other smells and don&#x27;t like them as much.  </li>
            <li> natural looking when I flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, long hair, and I had it under control at my old house, but after moving, I was struggling to keep myself from shaving my head because it was such a tangled mess!</li>
            <li> Because of this reason, I have avoided blow drying, flat ironing, and curling my hair.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed less burning and irritation of the sensitive skin on my face.</li>
            <li> is dead and cannot be repaired, \\&quot;reconstructed\\&quot; or fixed.</li>
            <li> Protein treatments may help, and so may some waxes, but remember that these are temporary fixes that may damage your hair in the long run.</li>
            <li> I blow dry and curling iron my hair.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this conditioner (and shampoo) to anyone that has damaged and/or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different products, but have always gone back to Kerastase.</li>
            <li> : a little of this product goes a long way; especially with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy/partially curly hair that I round brush straighten daily.  </li>
            <li> hair is long, making my ends at least 3 years old.  </li>
            <li> I have minimal split ends, and almost no breakage.  </li>
            <li> There are things I love about this product (both the EverStrong Shampoo and EverStrong Conditioner), and things I am blaming it for :(</li>
            <li> The other two times a week, I use both the L&#x27;Oreal shampoo and conditioner, and during those days, my hair gets oily by the time I go to bed.</li>
            <li> Seems like the wax will coat your hair, giving it a stronger feel, but they include small amounts of ingredients to dissolve that wax later on to prevent build-up.</li>
            <li> I do switch out and use other formula&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and I have abandoned all other brands.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say my ends are very dry and very fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use as directed, but I also add to dry hair to tame flyaways.</li>
            <li> I also noticed a lot less shedding.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> After using a lot of this conditioner, my hair feels heavy and weighed down.    </li>
            <li> Also a fan of how it is less harsh on your hair.</li>
            <li> I would typically switch brands a few times a year as the affects would seem to wear off after a while</li>
            <li> I am a frequent bleacher and have very thick hair; this product does wonders!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also bleached it to Hell, so maybe it&#x27;s just so porous that this conditioner is too heavy for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on and off for a few years.</li>
            <li> This one has a herb smell to it that is not really appealing, but I still use it.</li>
            <li> No better conditioner for my hair.  </li>
            <li> So, we&#x27;ve been there for about a month, and my hair has been unbelievably tangled.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a whim when I was out of my usual conditioner</li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair fill stiff and sticky, and it left a disgusting buildup near my scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about the claims made by beauty products, but this conditioner did everything it said it would.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they stopped carrying it in almost every store</li>
            <li> or I would get bored with the product.</li>
            <li> This crap was on sale</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> I seldom write reviews for anything, but this is the worst conditioner I have ever used in my life.</li>
            <li> so I bought it, but it is the worst.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This one has a herb smell to it that is not really appealing, but I still use it.</li>
            <li> The only kind of shampoo and conditioner I will buy.  This stuff works well for me.  I used to break out on my scalp when I used certain shampoos that contained sulfates.  Now I don&#x27;t break out and my hair color lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this line of L&#x27;Oreal shampoos and conditioners.  They are thick and rich and work wonderfully.  The rosemary mint smell great, I have tried the other smells and don&#x27;t like them as much.  I have been using these for about a year now and have finally found a product I want to stick with!</li>
            <li> The first thing to know when buying this product is that it has a VERY strong mint scent.  I personally like it and find it both refreshing and relaxing in the morning.  It&#x27;s the main reason I like the product.  But please be aware that if you&#x27;re very sensitive to smells, then this is not the product for you.    Overall I find that while this product feels great and creamy on my hair in the shower, it weighs my hair down too much for every day use.  I have long, wavy/partially curly hair that I round brush straighten daily.  After using a lot of this conditioner, my hair feels heavy and weighed down.    Since I really do love the scent and enjoy the feel of it in the shower, I use just a tiny bit mixed in with my regular conditioner.  That gives me the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> There are things I love about this product (both the EverStrong Shampoo and EverStrong Conditioner), and things I am blaming it for :( I love that it smells so intensely refreshing and clean, and that the smell lingers, both on my hair as well as in my bathroom, for hours later! However, what I don&#x27;t like about them is their tendency to make my hair oilier than normal. I rotate shampoos- I use Aveda Curly shampoo once a week, and then L&#x27;Oreal conditioner. The other two times a week, I use both the L&#x27;Oreal shampoo and conditioner, and during those days, my hair gets oily by the time I go to bed. I try to wash my hair every other day, and sometimes every 3 days if it&#x27;s not too oily, but I can remember many many times where I&#x27;ve woken up the day after I used L&#x27;Oreal shampoo and conditioner and felt like a can of olive oil fell on my scalp. This would force me to wash my hair daily, which I&#x27;m sure didn&#x27;t help with the oily problem in the long run. So now, I use these products once a week only, and hope that in the meantime, I will find some remedy for the constant oily hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was breaking and looked like a bird&#x27;s nest. Once I started using this product, I noticed stronger, shinier, more manageable hair. I am very sensitive to scents and get an allergic reaction to scented hair products (eyes swell shut, face looks like hamburger.) I have no trouble whatsoever with this product. Love, love, love it!!!</li>
            <li> I seldom write reviews for anything, but this is the worst conditioner I have ever used in my life. It smells really good, and it&#x27;s sulfate-free, which is supposed to be better for your hair. This stuff made my hair fill stiff and sticky, and it left a disgusting buildup near my scalp. No matter how long I spend in the shower, I can&#x27;t get it to ever rinse completely clean. I have pretty low standards for my shampoo and conditioner and I rarely venture outside the drugstore for my haircare needs. This crap was on sale so I bought it, but it is the worst. I would rather not use conditioner at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it matters, my hair is naturally baby fine and very straight. I&#x27;ve also bleached it to Hell, so maybe it&#x27;s just so porous that this conditioner is too heavy for it. But it makes my hair gummy, gunky, and gross, and the buildup it leaves near my scalp looks like dandruff. I hate it.</li>
            <li> For reference: wavy hair, normal to oily. I am growing out a full head of dyed hair, and so I have half-natural, half-dyed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product, but...I really struggle with it. I&#x27;ve used this on and off for a few years. It&#x27;s a very mild conditioner, and leaves my hair feeling soft, not weighed down in the slightest, and never greasy or frizzy. The scent is delightful and lasts for several hours after my hair is dry. I now wash my hair with a very mild shampoo, every other day (or every three days, if I can help it). However, when I had a physical job and had to wash my hair daily, this quickly made my hair tangled, dry, and almost sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I struggle with it is that nothing in this conditioner is good for your hair. Mineral oil is a cheap product, usually derived from petroleum, that builds up on hair. \\&quot;Paraffinum\\&quot; is, unsurprisingly, paraffin wax. But it also contains isopropyl myristate, which dissolves wax, so...why include both? Seems like the wax will coat your hair, giving it a stronger feel, but they include small amounts of ingredients to dissolve that wax later on to prevent build-up. This seems silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair is dead and cannot be repaired, \\&quot;reconstructed\\&quot; or fixed. Protein treatments may help, and so may some waxes, but remember that these are temporary fixes that may damage your hair in the long run. So I think I&#x27;ll skip this one for now.</li>
            <li> I only get these shampoo/conditioner product lines because they&#x27;re sulphate free. But honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with these products versus the regular stuff I used to buy.  But I figure it&#x27;s always better to reduce the amount of chemicals I&#x27;m exposing myself to.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy anything else.  This stuff tames frizz and tangles.  I use as directed, but I also add to dry hair to tame flyaways.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE the l&#x27;oreal everstrong line! I am a frequent bleacher and have very thick hair; this product does wonders! I have tried countless products, masks, and treatments to try to get my hair back to that &#x27;virgin&#x27; feel before I started bleaching. Because of this reason, I have avoided blow drying, flat ironing, and curling my hair. When I first saw this I noticed that it was sulfur-free (which I always try to stick to) and that it was very affordable! I tried out the Reconstruct shampoo and conditioner and my hair loves it! The smell is very different (not your usual fruity smell), but it&#x27;s not very strong and , in my opinion, smells great. After the first wash I could tell a difference. My hair was softer, less tangled, more manageable, and my ends seemed less brittle and more healthy. I also noticed a lot less shedding. I generally tend to use a LOT of shampoo and conditioner, to make sure my hair is fully covered and that there&#x27;s enough conditioner to set in my hair. A WORD TO THE WISE: a little of this product goes a long way; especially with the conditioner. I quickly learned to use the conditioner very sparingly only on the ends of my hair. If you use a lot, especially on the roots, your hair will be weighed down and appear more oily more quickly. Use sparingly, and the results will be amazing. Definitely stuck to this product.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Everstrong line does a great job for my hair.  To be honest, I really do not have any issues with my hair, so I look for a conditioner that smells really good and helps keep the static fly aways under control in the winter.  This does the trick.  I love the smell, which is more like a professional hair care product and not a bowl of fruit salad.</li>
            <li> No longer available in stores, I am thrilled to find it on Amazon!! No better conditioner for my hair.  I am all smiles!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. at Brazil we don´t have it and it is a chame, Because it helps a lot the hidratation of your hair, speccialy when you are a swimmer. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have really healthy hair, so I rarely indulge in decent hair products, but I thought I would give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is equivalent to aromatherapy. The entire shower will smell deliciously of childhood, mint, juniper, and spring. In addition to smelling amazingly, your hair will become noticeably healthier. My &amp;#34;dirty blonde&amp;#34; hair was looking pretty dull after summer swimming and cheap shampoos. Two weeks after using this product, my hair gained a healthy shine without the grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just moved into a new house and the water softener has been very out of whack. So, we&#x27;ve been there for about a month, and my hair has been unbelievably tangled. I have naturally curly, long hair, and I had it under control at my old house, but after moving, I was struggling to keep myself from shaving my head because it was such a tangled mess! I use a different shampoo, but this conditioner made my hair so soft and manageable, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the change! I am so pleased and absolutely love it! Plus, it has a crisp mint scent, which gives me a good wake up in the morning :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about the claims made by beauty products, but this conditioner did everything it said it would. My hair got stronger as a result of using this, and I love the refreshing rosemary/mint scent!</li>
            <li> My wife can&#x27;t have sulfate in her shampoos and she has curly hair so this and almond oil as a conditioner she has great hair days.</li>
            <li> I also use the shampoo that goes with this conditioner and I can tell when using them together that it really helps my hair since I color and highlight which can be drying to hair. I do switch out and use other formula&#x27;s but I always switch back to this for extra conditioning plus the scent is great and similar to a more expensive salon product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner.  I got the shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is coarse, curly and frizzy.  It tends to break and have split ends.  Shampoo and conditioner combo leave my hair smelling nice and seems to be helping my issues though I still have breakage problems.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when I could no longer find the conditioner that I had found very light, yet strengthening.  This one has a heavier feel and doesn&#x27;t seem to completely rinse out.  However, it leaves my thin, straight and somewhat brittle hair shiny, sleek, bouncy and still strong.  The scent is mild, and it only requires a dime sized amount to completely treat my shoulder length hair.  I follow conditioning with the Loreal product with a dilute apple cider vinegar rinse, and so far, I am pleased with the performance of the Loreal conditioner and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product has a lot of hydrating qualities for my dry swimmer&#x27;s hair and gives it a beautiful and light mint scent.  I am  very pleased with this product and will buy it again :)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I used to use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s top-of-the-line product, Kerastase (Bain de Force shampoo, and Lait Vital conditioner). Also an amazing product, but at $38 for an 8 oz bottle, it got pretty expensive. I&#x27;ve tried a few different products, but have always gone back to Kerastase. It&#x27;s the best. Or so I thought.     I freely admit, it was the advertizing for L&#x27;Oreal Everstrong that drew me in. I tried the Everstrong Bodify shampoo in combination with the Everstrong Reconstruct conditioner. AMAZING. My hair smelled wonderful (similar to Aveda), but more importantly, it continues to be soft, shiny, and healthy looking after several months of use. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s BETTER than Kerastase, but I will say that it&#x27;s every bit as good. And for the price, you can&#x27;t get any better.    GREAT product, GREAT price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help strengthen my  hair and nourish it as opposed to shampoos with sulfates. I AM SO SO PLEASED. This shampoo leaves my hair perfectly nourished from root to tip, and not in the slightest dry nor greasy. This is the best shampoo I have ever used and will definitely continue to purchase it. Thank you Loreal!!</li>
            <li> Have used L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong &amp; EverPure products for years - like that they are sulfate-free.</li>
            <li> There is definitely a reduction in my hair fall which makes me happy, but I also use a Natrol 10,000mg biotin supplement. Works well together. My scalp feels really clean.</li>
            <li> Made the switch to sulfate free because I thought it might help with my sensitive skin. I was so surprised with how much better my hair looks and feels. It doesn&#x27;t knot up easily like it used to and is silky and shiny. I have also noticed less burning and irritation of the sensitive skin on my face.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing special</li>
            <li> love love love! came fast and is a really really good product. i highly recomend it! will defenetly repurchase it</li>
            <li> Love how it smells. Also a fan of how it is less harsh on your hair. Can&#x27;t wait to order more</li>
            <li> Though the fragrance is not my favorite, it provides very good nourishment for dry hair and prevents frizz. Does not cause build-up.</li>
            <li> My hair feels fantastic after using this shampoo and conditioner. I have long, straight hair that is kind of thin and kind of oily, and this made my hair feel softer and healthier without drying out my hair or making it too greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I can feel a huge difference when I use it.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a whim when I was out of my usual conditioner and I love it (especially for OTC).  Unfortunately, they stopped carrying it in almost every store so I ordered it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The Reconstruct shampoo and masque are absolutely magical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long, making my ends at least 3 years old.  It is permed and color treated.  I blow dry and curling iron my hair.  Needless to say my ends are very dry and very fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo and masque keep my hair soft and manageable.  I have minimal split ends, and almost no breakage.  I couldn&#x27;t live without them.  And the best thing is they are SUPER affordable.  I haven&#x27;t found salon products that are this good, and they cost 2 to 3 times more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years now. My hair feels strong and soft to the touch. My hair is also more manageable and shiny. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this conditioner (and shampoo) to anyone that has damaged and/or dry hair.  I could feel an improvement in my hair (softer, smoother) after the first use.</li>
            <li> My review is more of a plea to loreal. Loreal can u please never, ever stop making this product. OmG it truly is a high quality reconstructor. I have been using goldwell ultra rich. That stuff cost me about $30 per bottle. Yes it is amazing I must admit. However, I feel like I have been completely ovr paying. I have long, thick, curly hair. Loreal reconstruct conditioner is so rich. It stretches my curls and the shine is amazing n natural looking when I flat iron. No frizz and my hair has this added thickness. In a really good way. Its like how it was whn i was a kid pre dye n heat. Wonderful product Loreal. U guys pull great prdcts sm time n I really hope this stays around. This stuff makes me feel like the girl in the herbal essence commercial except this stuff works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for along time.  Makes my hair soft</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product, I was purchasing high end salon products for $20-30 per bottle.  I would typically switch brands a few times a year as the affects would seem to wear off after a while or I would get bored with the product. I find this conditioner to be on par with or better than those products.  I have now been using this conditioner exclusively (or others from this same line) for over a year and I have abandoned all other brands.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> All the everstrong products are awesome and I refuse to use anything else. The smell is good. The texture is great.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have used a number of high-end high-priced hair products, and this conditioner works just as well if not better than most of them. I was a longtime devotee to Paul Mitchell and switched to Aveda - I found that both of these brands left gunky residue in my hair after several weeks of use. I don&#x27;t find that issue with this L&#x27;Oreal conditioner and the coordinating shampoo. It smells awesome too!</li>
            <li> My hair feels super soft and conditioned after using it.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> Great product! My hair felt the difference at the first wash, amazing! Sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners are great for girls who want&lt;br /&gt;a natural hair again.</li>
            <li> ...but when your hair is no longer damaged, it tends to make your hair very soft and flat. After my daughter uses this product and the condition of her hair improves, she likes the L&#x27;Oreal products in this sulfate free line that add volume and body.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the same review as for the matching shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girlfriend still has hair, successful purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, subscribe and save it great, especially for daily products like this.</li>
