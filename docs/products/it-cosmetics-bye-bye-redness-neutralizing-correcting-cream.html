            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This gives great coverage</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both have hyperpigmentation, so we&#x27;re always looking for products that give us great coverage, without looking like we have tons of makeup on.  </li>
            <li>works great.</li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>The most incredible coverage product I have ever found any where, why time!  </li>
            <li>I really love this product because it gives excellent coverage.</li>
            <li>So i don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with fair skin because it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you&#x27;re really fair complected</li>
            <li>Sent to my sister with rosacea and she loved it too.</li>
            <li>The tone for me is spot on, but might not work at all for anyone fair skinned.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because of all the hype about how it matches to your skin tone and so after reading so many good reviews I brought the product and all it does is make my fair skin look orange!</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin with some light redness around my nose and on my cheeks that bothers me.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading so many reviews about how great it was as a foundation, so I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>This product gives the face a fresh and flawless look!  </li>
            <li>I know many have said this product has not worked for them, but this has worked great for</li>
            <li>very much worth the money for a great product if you are looking for the solution to NO redness!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  ordering more!</li>
            <li>I just LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Never had a better match!</li>
            <li>Love It!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>My daughter convinced me to buy this product, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did!  </li>
            <li>When it first arrived, I wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed by looking at it</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>The fact that it does all of that AND treats skin with great ingredients is almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, it is tented to a light/medium</li>
            <li>This cc is amazing.</li>
            <li>amazing for spot treatment and of course covering up that redness.</li>
            <li>Amazing coverage.</li>
            <li>this is not cost effective.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice it performing any better than a good concealer at hiding freckles/spots/scars.</li>
            <li>Does apply nicely over my SPF.</li>
            <li>It really helps reduce any redness on my skin and my liquid foundation goes over it flawlessly.</li>
            <li>Candidly, I put this on side-by-side with drugstore concealers and there was no difference.</li>
            <li>I have super fair skin and the color of this stuff</li>
            <li>have given this product to the people I work with and they all love it.</li>
            <li>I love all the IT products.</li>
            <li>I do recomend it :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff..</li>
            <li>just perfect for covering up acne marks and red spots.</li>
            <li>I could have bought it from QVC, which includes a stand and a brush and will cost about $10 more with</li>
            <li>Great product works really well.</li>
            <li>It cosmetics is a phenomenal product.  </li>
            <li>However, it does stay matte throughout the day which is great because I tend to get oily in the afternoon; I was always applying powder after lunch but don&#x27;t seem to need that as much using this product.  </li>
            <li>I use this as my foundation and just love it.</li>
            <li>so I gave it a try for my warm light skin tone.</li>
            <li>; favorite thing in my make up bag.</li>
            <li>I would make sure you have a foundation type brush to spread around.</li>
            <li>I manage this in many ways.</li>
            <li>My MAC studio fix is way better...</li>
            <li>This stuff is like magic.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and am always looking for things to correct the redness with a goal of helping my skin, soothing my skin, and making my skin look better.</li>
            <li>I also viewed Megan Rossette on Youtube to be sure I wanted the product, and</li>
            <li>Love the product will continue to use.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure it does not crease or wear off, and make sure the cream is doing what it is suppose to.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>But it blends in perfectly and covers up the red areas across my nose and cheeks-</li>
            <li>LOVE this and will buy in bulk if I ever hear it&#x27;s being discontinued.</li>
            <li>I am better off with my concealer.</li>
            <li>So many people have said that, hopefully Jaime Will listen someday.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like us and have tried tons of different coverage products, I think that you will be very happy with this one.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product if you&#x27;re looking for a foundation that eliminates the need for a concealer and corrects redness very well.</li>
            <li>stays on well for most of the day.</li>
            <li>Most days I don&#x27;t wear any make up with it...</li>
            <li>With that said, I do love the product</li>
            <li>This did not cover at all any of my face redness, for $32.00 you would think this product would have done the job,  I returned the cream and they refunded my money quickly, I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>The texture is good and it does cover pretty well</li>
            <li>Fair-skinned ladies, if you are looking for something to cover redness, try a good Korean BB cream first.</li>
            <li>I have very red cheeks and this product covers that up amazingly!!</li>
            <li>it work better with light primer,..........  .&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>find that it adjusts to my skin tone perfectly, though, sometimes it can look too dark if you put too many layers on.</li>
            <li>This product does everything it says it will and looks flawless all day long!!!!</li>
            <li>The formula is thing so it spreads easily.</li>
            <li>Easy order &amp; checkout.</li>
            <li>I do like the packaging because it&#x27;s easy for me to dip my finger into the jar and blend it into my face.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend for anyone who has struggled with any sort of skin redness.</li>
            <li>so if this is true for you, give yourself a minute to let your face return to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; before deciding if you need more or if it&#x27;s time for foundation.</li>
            <li>HUGE disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Return was hassle free</li>
            <li>quite light-</li>
            <li>This is the only thing about this order that I am not too happy about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that.</li>
            <li>however, this fabulous product covers up the red/pink pigments.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great coverage and definitely takes care of any redness.</li>
            <li>, it was way too light for my complexion.  </li>
            <li>It works great for me, I don&#x27;t have very red skin</li>
            <li>They offer a discount if you sign up and it saved me about six dollars along with free shipping.</li>
            <li>and I am fairly light skinned</li>
            <li>Something that costs this much should be able to stand up to heat and humidity (Texas summers) better than that.</li>
            <li>very easy to apply, stays on really well.</li>
            <li>but then it took only a minute for it to settle in and look amazing!</li>
            <li>this stuff is great for helping with any rosyness on my face, i&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s best when putting on entire face to use the thick square brush.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I apply it to clean skin with my finger like the instructions</li>
            <li>Great ingredients and has a dry texture, if you are oily.</li>
            <li>I only need to lightly re-powder if I&#x27;m going out again at night.&lt;br /&gt;Product has always arrived promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Also, without a primer, it highlights my smile lines and fine lines along my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use if for special occasions</li>
            <li>Looks like I&#x27;m spreading mud on my face, created breakouts as it is full coverage.</li>
            <li>but blending with skin really nice and efect is natural.</li>
            <li>Very matte look, but that&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
            <li>Like true crayon-red, tomato, sunburn face.</li>
            <li>It goes on like a primer but has the coverage of a full coverage foundation yet doesn&#x27;t loom caky or like you have a ton of makeup on.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about It Cosmetics Bye Bye Redness concealer.</li>
            <li>Absolute magic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going back to my tried and true, beloved Skin79 BB cream.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this prodict but it just made my pores more visible and didn&#x27;t do a good job covering the red.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a great concealer with high coverage in one layer and are willing to work a little more when using a make up product, then feel free to purchase this product!</li>
            <li>Seriously this is the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever tried (I know its correcting creme</li>
            <li>I think this product would be great if you had red spots the size of a quarter, but not your whole cheeks</li>
            <li>Way better for skin then a regular foundation, so it helps me prevent getting more acne when trying to hide it.</li>
            <li>I applied tiny amount of this ONLY on my redness and blended, did not HAVE to put foundation over it, and my face looked GREAT!!!  </li>
            <li>I am 37 weeks pregnant and have been fighting pregnancy acne since week one.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use tinted moisturizer or more recently, Tarte CC cream just to even my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>This stuff comes in many different colors and covers just as well, so it is a better choice for me.</li>
            <li>It stays on a full day and it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have something caked on your face, it is very lightweight but still has that full coverage affect!</li>
            <li>Yeah, foundation works most of the time, but finding the right shade, depending in how much sun I&#x27;ve had or will get or not gotten...</li>
            <li>I normally use this as a foundation and set it with a translucent powder, although on rare occasions I will wear a medium coverage liquid foundation on top of this (before the powder).</li>
            <li>This is pretty much the magic eraser of cosmetics.</li>
            <li>but overall, the rest of my face looks pretty darn good.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job hiding the redness, it&#x27;s not drying but mixing with dry skin is a little cakes, however it still looked good</li>
            <li>I can not tell you enough how amazing this product is for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I will now try the product and see for it myself if it is worth all the hype!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mimi</li>
            <li>but well worth it</li>
            <li>I do apply a setting powder as well as apply this product with a foundation brush for a more even, natural application.</li>
            <li>This is worth trying and may be the solution you&#x27;ve been hoping to find.</li>
            <li>I suffer from moderate acne, and because I have fair skin, redness and acne scars really stand out.</li>
            <li>It would still be worth the price.</li>
            <li>I ran across this product on Amazon and thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Totally worth every penny</li>
            <li>It had amazing coverage and your skin looks great, The down side is that if you put too much on on accident not only do you look whited out but this stuff goes super fast.</li>
            <li>Overall, if you have somewhat tan skin and have red areas, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because it&#x27;s one color fits all</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried from It cosmetics</li>
            <li>As I sit here writing this my face still feel hot and irritated.</li>
            <li>One layer of this stuff is more than enough.</li>
            <li>This definitely covers, better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and it matches my skin tone</li>
            <li>I have fair skin (skin type 2 on the 1-6 scale) and while it looks dark in the container it does blend fairly well, especially when mixed with my lighter CC cream.  </li>
            <li>but it matches me pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis on my hairline and this product is the first I can put on in the morning and not have to worry about redness the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re gonna need some powder over it if you want it to last more like a foundation.</li>
            <li>Product does exactly as it says.  </li>
            <li>Very matte!</li>
            <li>I will not be able to try this until tomorrow (5/7/2014), but I have watched a few YouTube videos today with demonstrations and reviews of different skin tones and it looks good.  </li>
            <li>I use moisturizer first,...........  .&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>our north Ga. hot, humid summer weather, will it melt off,............</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty dark shade the more you apply, so maybe with a light hand it could be blendable.</li>
            <li>It comes covered with a white plastic insert on the top under the lid.</li>
            <li>My son is getting married in a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>I love it because it actually does what it is suppose to.</li>
            <li>It completely evens out my skin tone and covers all blemishes, yet feels so light weight like your not wearing anything.</li>
            <li>I have bought this product over and over, I love it, I just wish it would come in a different container.</li>
            <li>Especially if you have the kind of redness that most other people can&#x27;t understand.</li>
            <li>It really does cover all the red and most blemishes.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this to those who are fair skin and/or have big red areas.</li>
            <li>really wanted to love this, but I could only give it four stars.  </li>
            <li>But its amazing if you can get it right, my friend said it should last about 6 months so it is worth the price, however I am also out because if you grab to much you can&#x27;t put it back in the container.</li>
            <li>I put primer on first let dry and then put on this stuff, i love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used a super full coverage foundation just in case my skin turns red.</li>
            <li>I have very fair, red, sensitive, combination (including very dry in certain spots) skin.</li>
            <li>This really works exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>A little of this goes a long way and even though it feels and looks very natural, it evens out skin tone and provides excellent coverage.  </li>
            <li>certain areas - nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>I deal with dryness, blemishes and sensitivity from time to time and have never been able to find a product that can adequately address and cover well without looking heavy.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package I was actually surprised how thick it was and didn&#x27;t have much hope for the gloppy stuff in the jar, lol.</li>
            <li>Really its just the IT cosmetic line.</li>
            <li>Covers very well but seems to emphasize wrinkles.</li>
            <li>but it really does blend well.</li>
            <li>I found that the &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; color really didn&#x27;t work too well for me.</li>
            <li>and I actually really like using this for that function.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really even out.</li>
            <li>So I really did not know how much product I were to get with $32 until I received the shipment.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast shipment.</li>
            <li>but you really don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works wonders.</li>
            <li>I was leary when I purchased this, but it really does cover the redness.  </li>
            <li>It annoys me so much</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much at all either.</li>
            <li>Also this product is much cheaper on the IT cosmetics website.</li>
            <li>Much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>It really covers the redness very well.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of &amp;#34;it under eye cream&amp;#34; and started wearing it on my whole face to help cover my redness.</li>
            <li>I apply it with either my fingers or my Real techniques expert face brush.</li>
            <li>It seems really gentle, no clogged pores or allergies as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one really does work</li>
            <li>I have a chronic illness and between my illness and my medications, my skin really takes a beating.</li>
            <li>have light/fair skin and have found that  this product works very well to adapting to my skin tone like it says it will.</li>
            <li>The women on QVC made this really look like it worked, and maybe it did, for them.</li>
            <li>I really think this would work well as a concealer or a foundation.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much and frankly</li>
            <li>and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of redness in my face and have tried many other concealers</li>
            <li>That would be fine, even desired, except that it is not natural looking at all.</li>
            <li>and I really like how the product spreads well without getting less pigmented so that I don&#x27;t have to add more layers of product onto my face.</li>
            <li>Super soft brush (Amazon was by far the cheapest place to buy it)</li>
            <li>However, if you are not super fair skinned or dark skinned, you should be able to get away with this product, and I would definitely recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>It is very matte and when I tried to use it as foundation on my normal skin it just looked dry and accentuated fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I exfoliate gently and often enough to where it should not be an issue for a cream like this to make pores seem bigger and more noticeable, which is the case using this product.</li>
            <li>I do wish it came in more like colors.light, medium and dark.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not covering better than other foundations at all!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Live and learn!</li>
            <li>This works like magic, all the red is gone and last all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My face is almost always mild to moderately red.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented high coverage but natural looking!</li>
            <li>I bought this with high hopes</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone with skin conditions they&#x27;d like to hide, including under eye circles...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I give high marks across the board.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>At first it looked a little to dark on my fair skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had very pale sensitive skin, but this product is my favorite!</li>
            <li>Overall, this stuff is worth the hype and the money.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m strangely pale, but this is magic and it doesn&#x27;t need to make sense.</li>
            <li>This is my new &amp;#34;GO-TO&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I have tried every concealer known to mankind (literally) and this is my new HG.</li>
            <li>I LIVE by this product.</li>
            <li>It is inevitable to pick up too much product when dipping your finger or brush into the container without much thought</li>
            <li>It should last me a long time because of how little you really need so it really is a good buy.</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit and make sure to blend very well in order not to look caked on.</li>
            <li>About an hour later I my skin was still sore and feeling hot</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I suffer from oily/acne prone skin and living in a hot, humid client, makeup is the last thing you want on sweaty, oily skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely covered redness but was very cakey, even on my oily/combo skin!</li>
            <li>Without a primer, this product breaks down very quickly, especially around the oily regions of the face, and for some reason, it makes that area even more oily than normal.</li>
            <li>Overall highly recommended for people with mild to moderately red skin.</li>
            <li>It blended like a dream and then was covered easily and completely by my very light, very thin Urban Decay foundation.</li>
            <li>I use daily for a large area and the jar lasted 2+ months.</li>
            <li>it make my large pores areas look larger or cake in lines and around my nose ,..........  .</li>
            <li>The color is a little light, so plan to add bronzer and/or blush to add contouring.</li>
            <li>When I searched for other products from this company, I got lucky and found  bye bye redness.</li>
            <li>Beware if you have any type of sensitive skin or rosacea.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different brushes, my hands, and a sponge, and the only method that didn&#x27;t make me look like I had caked on make up was a sponge, but that defeated the purpose because it didn&#x27;t give as much coverage as I needed, thus making me waste even more product.</li>
            <li>only thing that I absolutely cannot stand is the packaging.</li>
            <li>It can look to be cake when not used over primer, especially if you use too much of it.</li>
            <li>I use it over a primer and just like that, my skin is soft and completely even.</li>
            <li>Start with a tiny amount because this will give you cakey skin fast.</li>
            <li>I use Real Techniques expert face brush, start at outside (reddest area) of my face and blend inward.</li>
            <li>This works very well at covering red spots.</li>
            <li>Because the product is a bit thick, it glops onto the top of that...</li>
            <li>This is a corrector for mild to average redness.</li>
            <li>sure to use a very small amount.</li>
            <li>My face is always slightly red ( not rosacea) to pretty red.  </li>
            <li>I have older skin, so my pores are bigger than they used to be, but this seems to magnify it.  </li>
            <li>With that in mind, I thought this product would be my all in one product that would give me a foundation with high coverage while also concealing my blemishes and scarring at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need foundation:)  maybe a bit dry after few hours on the skin.</li>
            <li>I had CO2 Laser done under my eyes, and after the initial healing my skin is bright PINK, PINK, PINK!  </li>
            <li>Really covers rosacea well, and wears for a long time.</li>
            <li>I use Bare Minerals products, but the concealer doesn&#x27;t completely cover all the redness and it also wears off way sooner than I feel it should.</li>
            <li>I use my fingers to apply so a quick dab into the jar to get out a little</li>
            <li>If you even apply a little too much, it can look very cakey.</li>
            <li>a little really goes a longggg way, highly pigmented but not cakey!</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona and it definitely stands up to the heat, even in our humid monsoon season.</li>
            <li>It can get dry and cakey around my nasal creases if I apply too much.  </li>
            <li>I am fair-skinned and often have trouble finding something light enough that covers the redness I have.  </li>
            <li>I have major redness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of an odd shade, so let it dry and then place your correct shade of light, acnegenic foundation over it.</li>
            <li>Mostly on my cheeks and jawline, it has left pink and purple discoloration where the lesions have dried and healed.  </li>
            <li>I barely need concealer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve barely even got through the cap yet.</li>
            <li>It was no more effective than a heavy foundation would be AND it disappeared within an hour.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cake and it provides just the right amount of coverage without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>I might need to put a little more moisturizing cream underneath because it got a little cake like in spots, but that could be due to the new skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months, and at first it was a 5/5</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a great product to hide acne and redness from my face but that doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing make up... pretty much an impossible request... until I used this product!!</li>
            <li>have dry sensitive skin, will this work with that.....  </li>
            <li>It covers red spots and lasts all day long, plus does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I will keep this to the new pink skin only.  </li>
            <li>- the container is small, it&#x27;s not cheap, and most importantly, the cream itself looked thin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> works great.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!</li>
            <li> The most incredible coverage product I have ever found any where, why time!  </li>
            <li> I really love this product because it gives excellent coverage.</li>
            <li> So i don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with fair skin because it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you&#x27;re really fair complected</li>
            <li> Sent to my sister with rosacea and she loved it too.</li>
            <li> The tone for me is spot on, but might not work at all for anyone fair skinned.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of all the hype about how it matches to your skin tone and so after reading so many good reviews I brought the product and all it does is make my fair skin look orange!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin with some light redness around my nose and on my cheeks that bothers me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading so many reviews about how great it was as a foundation, so I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> This product gives the face a fresh and flawless look!  </li>
            <li> I know many have said this product has not worked for them, but this has worked great for</li>
            <li> very much worth the money for a great product if you are looking for the solution to NO redness!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  ordering more!</li>
            <li> I just LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> Never had a better match!</li>
            <li> Love It!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> My daughter convinced me to buy this product, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did!  </li>
            <li> When it first arrived, I wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed by looking at it</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> The fact that it does all of that AND treats skin with great ingredients is almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it is tented to a light/medium</li>
            <li> This cc is amazing.</li>
            <li> amazing for spot treatment and of course covering up that redness.</li>
            <li> Amazing coverage.</li>
            <li> this is not cost effective.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice it performing any better than a good concealer at hiding freckles/spots/scars.</li>
            <li> Does apply nicely over my SPF.</li>
            <li> It really helps reduce any redness on my skin and my liquid foundation goes over it flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Candidly, I put this on side-by-side with drugstore concealers and there was no difference.</li>
            <li> I have super fair skin and the color of this stuff</li>
            <li> have given this product to the people I work with and they all love it.</li>
            <li> I love all the IT products.</li>
            <li> I do recomend it :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff..</li>
            <li> just perfect for covering up acne marks and red spots.</li>
            <li> I could have bought it from QVC, which includes a stand and a brush and will cost about $10 more with</li>
            <li> Great product works really well.</li>
            <li> It cosmetics is a phenomenal product.  </li>
            <li> However, it does stay matte throughout the day which is great because I tend to get oily in the afternoon; I was always applying powder after lunch but don&#x27;t seem to need that as much using this product.  </li>
            <li> I use this as my foundation and just love it.</li>
            <li> so I gave it a try for my warm light skin tone.</li>
            <li> ; favorite thing in my make up bag.</li>
            <li> I would make sure you have a foundation type brush to spread around.</li>
            <li> I manage this in many ways.</li>
            <li> My MAC studio fix is way better...</li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and am always looking for things to correct the redness with a goal of helping my skin, soothing my skin, and making my skin look better.</li>
            <li> I also viewed Megan Rossette on Youtube to be sure I wanted the product, and</li>
            <li> Love the product will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure it does not crease or wear off, and make sure the cream is doing what it is suppose to.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product..</li>
            <li> But it blends in perfectly and covers up the red areas across my nose and cheeks-</li>
            <li> LOVE this and will buy in bulk if I ever hear it&#x27;s being discontinued.</li>
            <li> I am better off with my concealer.</li>
            <li> So many people have said that, hopefully Jaime Will listen someday.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like us and have tried tons of different coverage products, I think that you will be very happy with this one.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product if you&#x27;re looking for a foundation that eliminates the need for a concealer and corrects redness very well.</li>
            <li> stays on well for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Most days I don&#x27;t wear any make up with it...</li>
            <li> With that said, I do love the product</li>
            <li> This did not cover at all any of my face redness, for $32.00 you would think this product would have done the job,  I returned the cream and they refunded my money quickly, I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> The texture is good and it does cover pretty well</li>
            <li> Fair-skinned ladies, if you are looking for something to cover redness, try a good Korean BB cream first.</li>
            <li> I have very red cheeks and this product covers that up amazingly!!</li>
            <li> it work better with light primer,..........  .&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> find that it adjusts to my skin tone perfectly, though, sometimes it can look too dark if you put too many layers on.</li>
            <li> This product does everything it says it will and looks flawless all day long!!!!</li>
            <li> The formula is thing so it spreads easily.</li>
            <li> Easy order &amp; checkout.</li>
            <li> I do like the packaging because it&#x27;s easy for me to dip my finger into the jar and blend it into my face.</li>
            <li> Washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend for anyone who has struggled with any sort of skin redness.</li>
            <li> so if this is true for you, give yourself a minute to let your face return to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; before deciding if you need more or if it&#x27;s time for foundation.</li>
            <li> HUGE disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Return was hassle free</li>
            <li> quite light-</li>
            <li> This is the only thing about this order that I am not too happy about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that.</li>
            <li> however, this fabulous product covers up the red/pink pigments.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s great coverage and definitely takes care of any redness.</li>
            <li> , it was way too light for my complexion.  </li>
            <li> It works great for me, I don&#x27;t have very red skin</li>
            <li> They offer a discount if you sign up and it saved me about six dollars along with free shipping.</li>
            <li> and I am fairly light skinned</li>
            <li> Something that costs this much should be able to stand up to heat and humidity (Texas summers) better than that.</li>
            <li> very easy to apply, stays on really well.</li>
            <li> but then it took only a minute for it to settle in and look amazing!</li>
            <li> this stuff is great for helping with any rosyness on my face, i&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s best when putting on entire face to use the thick square brush.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I apply it to clean skin with my finger like the instructions</li>
            <li> Great ingredients and has a dry texture, if you are oily.</li>
            <li> I only need to lightly re-powder if I&#x27;m going out again at night.&lt;br /&gt;Product has always arrived promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Also, without a primer, it highlights my smile lines and fine lines along my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use if for special occasions</li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;m spreading mud on my face, created breakouts as it is full coverage.</li>
            <li> but blending with skin really nice and efect is natural.</li>
            <li> Very matte look, but that&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
            <li> Like true crayon-red, tomato, sunburn face.</li>
            <li> It goes on like a primer but has the coverage of a full coverage foundation yet doesn&#x27;t loom caky or like you have a ton of makeup on.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about It Cosmetics Bye Bye Redness concealer.</li>
            <li> Absolute magic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going back to my tried and true, beloved Skin79 BB cream.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this prodict but it just made my pores more visible and didn&#x27;t do a good job covering the red.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a great concealer with high coverage in one layer and are willing to work a little more when using a make up product, then feel free to purchase this product!</li>
            <li> Seriously this is the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever tried (I know its correcting creme</li>
            <li> I think this product would be great if you had red spots the size of a quarter, but not your whole cheeks</li>
            <li> Way better for skin then a regular foundation, so it helps me prevent getting more acne when trying to hide it.</li>
            <li> I applied tiny amount of this ONLY on my redness and blended, did not HAVE to put foundation over it, and my face looked GREAT!!!  </li>
            <li> I am 37 weeks pregnant and have been fighting pregnancy acne since week one.  </li>
            <li> I mostly use tinted moisturizer or more recently, Tarte CC cream just to even my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> This stuff comes in many different colors and covers just as well, so it is a better choice for me.</li>
            <li> It stays on a full day and it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have something caked on your face, it is very lightweight but still has that full coverage affect!</li>
            <li> Yeah, foundation works most of the time, but finding the right shade, depending in how much sun I&#x27;ve had or will get or not gotten...</li>
            <li> I normally use this as a foundation and set it with a translucent powder, although on rare occasions I will wear a medium coverage liquid foundation on top of this (before the powder).</li>
            <li> This is pretty much the magic eraser of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> but overall, the rest of my face looks pretty darn good.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job hiding the redness, it&#x27;s not drying but mixing with dry skin is a little cakes, however it still looked good</li>
            <li> I can not tell you enough how amazing this product is for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I will now try the product and see for it myself if it is worth all the hype!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mimi</li>
            <li> but well worth it</li>
            <li> I do apply a setting powder as well as apply this product with a foundation brush for a more even, natural application.</li>
            <li> This is worth trying and may be the solution you&#x27;ve been hoping to find.</li>
            <li> I suffer from moderate acne, and because I have fair skin, redness and acne scars really stand out.</li>
            <li> It would still be worth the price.</li>
            <li> I ran across this product on Amazon and thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Totally worth every penny</li>
            <li> It had amazing coverage and your skin looks great, The down side is that if you put too much on on accident not only do you look whited out but this stuff goes super fast.</li>
            <li> Overall, if you have somewhat tan skin and have red areas, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because it&#x27;s one color fits all</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried from It cosmetics</li>
            <li> As I sit here writing this my face still feel hot and irritated.</li>
            <li> One layer of this stuff is more than enough.</li>
            <li> This definitely covers, better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and it matches my skin tone</li>
            <li> I have fair skin (skin type 2 on the 1-6 scale) and while it looks dark in the container it does blend fairly well, especially when mixed with my lighter CC cream.  </li>
            <li> but it matches me pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my hairline and this product is the first I can put on in the morning and not have to worry about redness the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re gonna need some powder over it if you want it to last more like a foundation.</li>
            <li> Product does exactly as it says.  </li>
            <li> Very matte!</li>
            <li> I will not be able to try this until tomorrow (5/7/2014), but I have watched a few YouTube videos today with demonstrations and reviews of different skin tones and it looks good.  </li>
            <li> I use moisturizer first,...........  .&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> our north Ga. hot, humid summer weather, will it melt off,............</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty dark shade the more you apply, so maybe with a light hand it could be blendable.</li>
            <li> It comes covered with a white plastic insert on the top under the lid.</li>
            <li> My son is getting married in a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I love it because it actually does what it is suppose to.</li>
            <li> It completely evens out my skin tone and covers all blemishes, yet feels so light weight like your not wearing anything.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product over and over, I love it, I just wish it would come in a different container.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have the kind of redness that most other people can&#x27;t understand.</li>
            <li> It really does cover all the red and most blemishes.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this to those who are fair skin and/or have big red areas.</li>
            <li> really wanted to love this, but I could only give it four stars.  </li>
            <li> But its amazing if you can get it right, my friend said it should last about 6 months so it is worth the price, however I am also out because if you grab to much you can&#x27;t put it back in the container.</li>
            <li> I put primer on first let dry and then put on this stuff, i love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a super full coverage foundation just in case my skin turns red.</li>
            <li> I have very fair, red, sensitive, combination (including very dry in certain spots) skin.</li>
            <li> This really works exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way and even though it feels and looks very natural, it evens out skin tone and provides excellent coverage.  </li>
            <li> certain areas - nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I deal with dryness, blemishes and sensitivity from time to time and have never been able to find a product that can adequately address and cover well without looking heavy.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package I was actually surprised how thick it was and didn&#x27;t have much hope for the gloppy stuff in the jar, lol.</li>
            <li> Really its just the IT cosmetic line.</li>
            <li> Covers very well but seems to emphasize wrinkles.</li>
            <li> but it really does blend well.</li>
            <li> I found that the &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; color really didn&#x27;t work too well for me.</li>
            <li> and I actually really like using this for that function.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t really even out.</li>
            <li> So I really did not know how much product I were to get with $32 until I received the shipment.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast shipment.</li>
            <li> but you really don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works wonders.</li>
            <li> I was leary when I purchased this, but it really does cover the redness.  </li>
            <li> It annoys me so much</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much at all either.</li>
            <li> Also this product is much cheaper on the IT cosmetics website.</li>
            <li> Much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> It really covers the redness very well.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of &amp;#34;it under eye cream&amp;#34; and started wearing it on my whole face to help cover my redness.</li>
            <li> I apply it with either my fingers or my Real techniques expert face brush.</li>
            <li> It seems really gentle, no clogged pores or allergies as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one really does work</li>
            <li> I have a chronic illness and between my illness and my medications, my skin really takes a beating.</li>
            <li> have light/fair skin and have found that  this product works very well to adapting to my skin tone like it says it will.</li>
            <li> The women on QVC made this really look like it worked, and maybe it did, for them.</li>
            <li> I really think this would work well as a concealer or a foundation.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much and frankly</li>
            <li> and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of redness in my face and have tried many other concealers</li>
            <li> That would be fine, even desired, except that it is not natural looking at all.</li>
            <li> and I really like how the product spreads well without getting less pigmented so that I don&#x27;t have to add more layers of product onto my face.</li>
            <li> Super soft brush (Amazon was by far the cheapest place to buy it)</li>
            <li> However, if you are not super fair skinned or dark skinned, you should be able to get away with this product, and I would definitely recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> It is very matte and when I tried to use it as foundation on my normal skin it just looked dry and accentuated fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I exfoliate gently and often enough to where it should not be an issue for a cream like this to make pores seem bigger and more noticeable, which is the case using this product.</li>
            <li> I do wish it came in more like colors.light, medium and dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not covering better than other foundations at all!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Live and learn!</li>
            <li> This works like magic, all the red is gone and last all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My face is almost always mild to moderately red.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented high coverage but natural looking!</li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone with skin conditions they&#x27;d like to hide, including under eye circles...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I give high marks across the board.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> At first it looked a little to dark on my fair skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very pale sensitive skin, but this product is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Overall, this stuff is worth the hype and the money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m strangely pale, but this is magic and it doesn&#x27;t need to make sense.</li>
            <li> This is my new &amp;#34;GO-TO&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have tried every concealer known to mankind (literally) and this is my new HG.</li>
            <li> I LIVE by this product.</li>
            <li> It is inevitable to pick up too much product when dipping your finger or brush into the container without much thought</li>
            <li> It should last me a long time because of how little you really need so it really is a good buy.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit and make sure to blend very well in order not to look caked on.</li>
            <li> About an hour later I my skin was still sore and feeling hot</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I suffer from oily/acne prone skin and living in a hot, humid client, makeup is the last thing you want on sweaty, oily skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely covered redness but was very cakey, even on my oily/combo skin!</li>
            <li> Without a primer, this product breaks down very quickly, especially around the oily regions of the face, and for some reason, it makes that area even more oily than normal.</li>
            <li> Overall highly recommended for people with mild to moderately red skin.</li>
            <li> It blended like a dream and then was covered easily and completely by my very light, very thin Urban Decay foundation.</li>
            <li> I use daily for a large area and the jar lasted 2+ months.</li>
            <li> it make my large pores areas look larger or cake in lines and around my nose ,..........  .</li>
            <li> The color is a little light, so plan to add bronzer and/or blush to add contouring.</li>
            <li> When I searched for other products from this company, I got lucky and found  bye bye redness.</li>
            <li> Beware if you have any type of sensitive skin or rosacea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different brushes, my hands, and a sponge, and the only method that didn&#x27;t make me look like I had caked on make up was a sponge, but that defeated the purpose because it didn&#x27;t give as much coverage as I needed, thus making me waste even more product.</li>
            <li> only thing that I absolutely cannot stand is the packaging.</li>
            <li> It can look to be cake when not used over primer, especially if you use too much of it.</li>
            <li> I use it over a primer and just like that, my skin is soft and completely even.</li>
            <li> Start with a tiny amount because this will give you cakey skin fast.</li>
            <li> I use Real Techniques expert face brush, start at outside (reddest area) of my face and blend inward.</li>
            <li> This works very well at covering red spots.</li>
            <li> Because the product is a bit thick, it glops onto the top of that...</li>
            <li> This is a corrector for mild to average redness.</li>
            <li> sure to use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> My face is always slightly red ( not rosacea) to pretty red.  </li>
            <li> I have older skin, so my pores are bigger than they used to be, but this seems to magnify it.  </li>
            <li> With that in mind, I thought this product would be my all in one product that would give me a foundation with high coverage while also concealing my blemishes and scarring at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need foundation:)  maybe a bit dry after few hours on the skin.</li>
            <li> I had CO2 Laser done under my eyes, and after the initial healing my skin is bright PINK, PINK, PINK!  </li>
            <li> Really covers rosacea well, and wears for a long time.</li>
            <li> I use Bare Minerals products, but the concealer doesn&#x27;t completely cover all the redness and it also wears off way sooner than I feel it should.</li>
            <li> I use my fingers to apply so a quick dab into the jar to get out a little</li>
            <li> If you even apply a little too much, it can look very cakey.</li>
            <li> a little really goes a longggg way, highly pigmented but not cakey!</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and it definitely stands up to the heat, even in our humid monsoon season.</li>
            <li> It can get dry and cakey around my nasal creases if I apply too much.  </li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned and often have trouble finding something light enough that covers the redness I have.  </li>
            <li> I have major redness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of an odd shade, so let it dry and then place your correct shade of light, acnegenic foundation over it.</li>
            <li> Mostly on my cheeks and jawline, it has left pink and purple discoloration where the lesions have dried and healed.  </li>
            <li> I barely need concealer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve barely even got through the cap yet.</li>
            <li> It was no more effective than a heavy foundation would be AND it disappeared within an hour.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cake and it provides just the right amount of coverage without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> I might need to put a little more moisturizing cream underneath because it got a little cake like in spots, but that could be due to the new skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months, and at first it was a 5/5</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a great product to hide acne and redness from my face but that doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing make up... pretty much an impossible request... until I used this product!!</li>
            <li> have dry sensitive skin, will this work with that.....  </li>
            <li> It covers red spots and lasts all day long, plus does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I will keep this to the new pink skin only.  </li>
            <li> - the container is small, it&#x27;s not cheap, and most importantly, the cream itself looked thin.  </li>
            <li> This has a thick consistency, is true neutral not too pink or too yellow.</li>
            <li> I have very severe red marks from past acne.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t have enough moisturizer on the driest parts of my face ahead of time it definitely will flake there, but as long as I prep my skin</li>
            <li> I use the Gold Skin79 for dry skin but there are all sorts of different kinds out there for different skin types.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware of, and lasted all day - at least not in the heat and humidity.</li>
            <li> ; a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I have not used it long enough to determine that one way or another.</li>
            <li> I can now go out and feel I&#x27;m sufficiently covered and less self conscious.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and sometimes my skin can be a little sensitive.</li>
            <li> I suggest purchasing a flat top kabuki like the Sonia one I have from target which is one of the less expensive.</li>
            <li> I think it will last at least twice as long as a normal foundation would.</li>
            <li> I think if you have average red, go for it, a jar could last you forever.</li>
            <li> Almost every foundation I have worn barely covers my redness without leaving flakes and/or being too dark.</li>
            <li> It also is too matte under my foundation, although if I am careful to keep to just the areas of red (nose and chin)</li>
            <li> It also lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> It covers without being heavy or shiny and still looks natural.  </li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> One other thing to mention is that I am a beauty junkie I&#x27;ve tried lots of different products over the years</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a makeup artist due to my red splotchy skin.</li>
            <li> It hid my redness all day long, to the point that my husband said I looked pale (hours later) because he was so accustomed to my RED face.</li>
            <li> Does not settle into my dry spots.</li>
            <li> Finish with a setting spray after powdering to help with the dry appearance.</li>
            <li> Also I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I am 34 years old and have fair skin and BAD rosacea!!</li>
            <li> , I was a little disappointed after hearing so many people did substitute this as a high coverage foundation instead of just as a concealer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommenced for all, also recommend buying a foundation brush to apply this product with, use very little also!</li>
            <li> S&amp;H.  When I got the product, I was surprised by how small the jar is.  </li>
            <li> Was surprised by how small the packaging is</li>
            <li> have early stage rosacea and didn&#x27;t find much that wasn&#x27;t heavy to cover my broken capillaries by my nose.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way, but if I still need to put on a foundation, for my amount of red</li>
            <li> a little goes a very long way on your face, use the brush to apply to entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I only give it 4 stars because it only comes in one color, which is a little too dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> is a little terra cotta which is kind of terrifying at first.</li>
            <li> was a little worried about if this product was actually gonna work.</li>
            <li> You only need a little</li>
            <li> Very thick so don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> The jar is tiny but a little product goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> This small jar will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve realized I&#x27;m not really into this product.</li>
            <li> I tried mineral powder to cover, but you still saw some pink.  </li>
            <li> Well, during the winter, my face keeps that pink look throughout the day...</li>
            <li> If you have my level red you need a green based primer or corrector, not a neutral one like this.</li>
            <li> I have a few tiny concerns I will not know</li>
            <li> It matches a wide range of skin colors, so I&#x27;d imagine some wear it as a foundation.</li>
            <li> Put a bit on and then let your face relax for a few minutes - my face gets red just from rubbing it or putting on foundation for example</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You only need a very little it so do not be put off by the price.</li>
            <li> In fact my other foundations, concealers, bb creams, and cc creams are soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other foundations and I&#x27;ve never looked so shiny as I do with this product.</li>
            <li> I have a few very dark spots, so those areas need some extra coverage</li>
            <li> You know when you get out of the shower, and your face is a little pink?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strangely dark</li>
            <li> It seem dark at first-I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s somewhat dark.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the color</li>
            <li> only complaint is the packaging.</li>
            <li> If you have an olive or dark complexion, this probably won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, but tried it anyway, and wow!!!  </li>
            <li> It even helped cover my acne scars and you only need a small amount each time!</li>
            <li> A small jar but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get very much of it, the bottle is small unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it made me look younger.  </li>
            <li> My daughter even says that it has improved the condition of her skin (less breakouts, etc)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little to dark for my fair/light skin.</li>
            <li> It gives some coverage, but not full coverage of my birthmarks.</li>
            <li> A little product goes a long way and the coverage is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> but I went to put a little cream on.</li>
            <li> but I found it just a little on the oily side</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya though.  </li>
            <li> though it would go away in a few minutes</li>
            <li> and it did tend to break up on my skin after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Whatever you do, though, don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> It looked like I&#x27;d been crying.  </li>
            <li> Bye, Bye redness does not work, dont waste your money, buy Dermablend instead.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like heavy make up</li>
            <li> After trying this concealer, i no longer need heavy coverage makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this quite a few times now.</li>
            <li> Only very expensive and in a tiny jar.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed by the price, as I later found it on QVC in a larger size bottle for half the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college student, and I used to and still sometimes get pretty bad hormonal breakouts around my chin.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I apply it all over my face as a foundation, but I usually just apply it as concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you remove the plastic cover inside, you&#x27;re in for a nightmare of wasted product stuck in the threads of the lid!</li>
            <li> I use a small concealer brush to apply over areas where I have redness and then blend out onto the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> and I mean a little.  </li>
            <li> My skin does too, my coworkers said I have been looking refreshed lately.</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick.</li>
            <li> so I continued to put on the rest of my makeup and as time went on it got worse and not better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little annoying that it only comes in one color</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe in miracles before opening this expensive little jar of god&#x27;s elixir.</li>
            <li> Expensive for small amount,</li>
            <li> This product corrects and lasts at least 8 hours !</li>
            <li> and my face began to burn horribly again from the little bit of product left over on my brush.</li>
            <li> Try Revlon Colorstay Whipped with Clinique Redness Solutions Daily Protective Base under it.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of broken capillaries around my nostrils and a lot of redness on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I dabbed a little lower than the pink area and it showed my pores horribly though.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, it can be quite difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> and I desperately wanted to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I was wrong, this stuff covers everything on my face including my freckles!</li>
            <li> If you have bad acne</li>
            <li> Immediately when I put this cc cream on my skin my skin started to burn and become painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you do, you HAVE to wear primer as a base.</li>
            <li> I prefer using it as a base, then putting foundation over it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know any people with rosacea as bad as mine!!</li>

            <li> Finally something to cover the redness. It works well under makeup. The formula is thing so it spreads easily.</li>
            <li> This works like magic, all the red is gone and last all day.&lt;br /&gt;I have given this product to the people I work with and they all love it.</li>
            <li> I love all the IT products. My skin does too, my coworkers said I have been looking refreshed lately. Really its just the IT cosmetic line.</li>
            <li> Covers very well but seems to emphasize wrinkles.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have used in years!  Makes my face look flawless. Have already recommended it to my friends and family</li>
            <li> It does not work as described.</li>
            <li> this stuff has great coverage. I was hesitant at first because it&#x27;s one color fits all but it really does blend well. Hides the redness in my cheeks great.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe in miracles before opening this expensive little jar of god&#x27;s elixir. Bye bye redness indeed! It&#x27;s strangely dark and I&#x27;m strangely pale, but this is magic and it doesn&#x27;t need to make sense. It blended like a dream and then was covered easily and completely by my very light, very thin Urban Decay foundation. I&#x27;ve been walking around feeling Photoshopped all day.</li>
            <li> I was in Ulta this week and saw this cc cream. I saw a picture of a woman with very red skin &amp; cheeks. Then it had an after picture, after using the bye bye redness cream and her skin looked completely flawless. I was sold from the picture alone. I have rosacea and sometimes my skin can be a little sensitive. Immediately when I put this cc cream on my skin my skin started to burn and become painful. I though it would go away in a few minutes so I continued to put on the rest of my makeup and as time went on it got worse and not better. My face felt like it was on fire and being pinched. I ended up having to take all of my makeup off and put on soothing lotion. About an hour later I my skin was still sore and feeling hot but I went to put a little cream on. I put it on and went to blend it with the same brush that I used to apply the bye bye redness cream and my face began to burn horribly again from the little bit of product left over on my brush. I then had to wash my face and take my makeup off for a 2nd time. In the end the entire day I had to end up not wearing any face makeup and just put soothing aloe vera gel on my face. My face looks as red as a tomato. I&#x27;m so disappointed. This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried from It cosmetics and I will never use another one of their skin products. As I sit here writing this my face still feel hot and irritated. Beware if you have any type of sensitive skin or rosacea. One other thing to mention is that I am a beauty junkie I&#x27;ve tried lots of different products over the years and I&#x27;ve never had an experience like this. In fact my other foundations, concealers, bb creams, and cc creams are soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> my wife said it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;m spreading mud on my face, created breakouts as it is full coverage. Return was hassle free</li>
            <li> It does a great job hiding the redness, it&#x27;s not drying but mixing with dry skin is a little cakes, however it still looked good</li>
            <li> A bit pricey to get in the UK but covers redness beautyfuly. I don&#x27;t need foundation:)  maybe a bit dry after few hours on the skin. You don&#x27;t need a lot of product too. It seem dark at first-I&#x27;m quite light- but blending with skin really nice and efect is natural. I do recomend it :)</li>
            <li> My face is always slightly red ( not rosacea) to pretty red.  Yeah, foundation works most of the time, but finding the right shade, depending in how much sun I&#x27;ve had or will get or not gotten...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, but tried it anyway, and wow!!!  It immediately covered the red, made me see red I wasn&#x27;t aware of, and lasted all day - at least not in the heat and humidity. I didn&#x27;t use it on my entire face because it blended so well that I only needed to spot -treat certain areas - nose and cheeks. I have no idea why the color matches instantly. Seriously, it made me look younger.  I have big pores, and use Dr Brandt&#x27;s Pore No More first, then this. Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small amount goes a long way. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I found that the &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; color really didn&#x27;t work too well for me. It&#x27;s a little to dark for my fair/light skin. The texture is good and it does cover pretty well but I found it just a little on the oily side and it did tend to break up on my skin after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading so many reviews about how great it was as a foundation, so I thought I would give it a try. I have oily to combination skin, where I get oily on my T-zone and have dryness around my jawline and chin area. I also have some acne scarring around my chin area that needs to be covered up as well. With that in mind, I thought this product would be my all in one product that would give me a foundation with high coverage while also concealing my blemishes and scarring at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after testing this out for almost a month now, I do NOT recommend using this as a foundation. If you do, you HAVE to wear primer as a base. Without a primer, this product breaks down very quickly, especially around the oily regions of the face, and for some reason, it makes that area even more oily than normal. I&#x27;ve tried other foundations and I&#x27;ve never looked so shiny as I do with this product. Also, without a primer, it highlights my smile lines and fine lines along my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it can be quite difficult to work with. If you even apply a little too much, it can look very cakey. I&#x27;ve tried different brushes, my hands, and a sponge, and the only method that didn&#x27;t make me look like I had caked on make up was a sponge, but that defeated the purpose because it didn&#x27;t give as much coverage as I needed, thus making me waste even more product. Although I realize It Cosmetics doesn&#x27;t advertise this as a foundation, I was a little disappointed after hearing so many people did substitute this as a high coverage foundation instead of just as a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried using this as a concealer and I actually really like using this for that function. The acne scarring on my face runs along the majority of my jawline and I really like how the product spreads well without getting less pigmented so that I don&#x27;t have to add more layers of product onto my face. One layer of this stuff is more than enough. I definitely recommend this product as a concealer. Be wary, though, because this product has a powder finish and setting powder on top can also make this look cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I absolutely cannot stand is the packaging. I wish it came in a squeeze tube or pump form. It is inevitable to pick up too much product when dipping your finger or brush into the container without much thought and I don&#x27;t like the idea of having to always dip my fingers in and transferring bacteria every time I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a great concealer with high coverage in one layer and are willing to work a little more when using a make up product, then feel free to purchase this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It really does cover all the red and most blemishes.</li>
            <li> I like this cover for red and brown spots.  I did not give it 5 stars because it does not stay on all day, wish it did</li>
            <li> The most incredible coverage product I have ever found any where, why time!  I&#x27;m  ordering more!</li>
            <li> HOLY GRAIL!!! Love this stuff.. just perfect for covering up acne marks and red spots. I just LOVE this stuff! Yet again, IT cosmetics delivers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months, and at first it was a 5/5 but I&#x27;ve realized I&#x27;m not really into this product. Here&#x27;s my story, It feels like I&#x27;m the whitest girl in the world. This product only comes in one shade it&#x27;s somewhat dark. It does have a thickness for red areas and it does work. When I put on my foundation though, it&#x27;s just obvious I&#x27;m wearing some sort of darker cream underneath so it doesn&#x27;t really even out. I think this product would be great if you had red spots the size of a quarter, but not your whole cheeks like my problem area is. Overall, if you have somewhat tan skin and have red areas, this is a great product. I do not recommend this to those who are fair skin and/or have big red areas.</li>
            <li> The Best foundation I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t need a lot to cover the entire face.&lt;br /&gt;My face look so smoot, mate and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I dont have any redness throughout the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;I finally found the product for me.</li>
            <li> I heard rave reviews about this product, so I wanted to give it a try. I could have bought it from QVC, which includes a stand and a brush and will cost about $10 more with S&amp;H.  When I got the product, I was surprised by how small the jar is.  It only comes with 11 ml or 0.37 fl. oz, which was never stated in the ad here.  So I really did not know how much product I were to get with $32 until I received the shipment.  This is the only thing about this order that I am not too happy about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that. It&#x27;s fast shipment. Easy order &amp; checkout. I will now try the product and see for it myself if it is worth all the hype!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mimi</li>
            <li> Great product works really well. I have a lot of splotchy skin and redness. This products definitely neutralized it. very easy to apply, stays on really well. The only complaint I have is the color, I thought it would be white/clear and it&#x27;s actually somewhat of a nude skin tone.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this prodict but it just made my pores more visible and didn&#x27;t do a good job covering the red.  I had to wash my face and start over.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day! I have very red cheeks and this product covers that up amazingly!! Would recommend to everyone with redness on their face. Try all the products they are great!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this on amazon for the prime shipping and it was sold out at ulta. I had done some research and thought this product was going to work. like a charm because of the tutorials and rave reviews. Overall I am not disappointed. It can look to be cake when not used over primer, especially if you use too much of it. I suggest purchasing a flat top kabuki like the Sonia one I have from target which is one of the less expensive. It should last me a long time because of how little you really need so it really is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I have very severe red marks from past acne. This concealer worked wonders on covering up the redness. It&#x27;s a bit of an odd shade, so let it dry and then place your correct shade of light, acnegenic foundation over it.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin with some light redness around my nose and on my cheeks that bothers me. I bought this with high hopes but I ended up sending it back. It was no more effective than a heavy foundation would be AND it disappeared within an hour. Something that costs this much should be able to stand up to heat and humidity (Texas summers) better than that. HUGE disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going back to my tried and true, beloved Skin79 BB cream. Fair-skinned ladies, if you are looking for something to cover redness, try a good Korean BB cream first. I use the Gold Skin79 for dry skin but there are all sorts of different kinds out there for different skin types. Whatever you do, though, don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product after seeing a demo on youtube. Works just as great as I was hoping! it covers my acne scars and breakouts without looking cakey. Very pigmented high coverage but natural looking! Way better for skin then a regular foundation, so it helps me prevent getting more acne when trying to hide it. Was surprised by how small the packaging is but you really don&#x27;t need much. I think it will last at least twice as long as a normal foundation would. If you have bad acne I would definitely give this product a try!</li>
            <li> It cosmetics is a phenomenal product.  This Seller is however a COMPLETELY different story!  Pic showed with brush applicator, so I purchased.  Received cream only.  They stated to keep it &amp; they would send out correct order.  I even emailed them and asked if the brush would be with it.  The assured me it would.  Within hours, the photo changed for the item number showing the cream alone.  Again, I received no brush.  Emailed again.  Finally, I get a reply that it no longer comes with the brush!  I purchased it because of the applicator.  It was a great priced for the set, but over priced for cream alone.  And I get &amp;#34;sorry, no longer cones with it!?&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned and often have trouble finding something light enough that covers the redness I have.  This definitely covers, better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and it matches my skin tone perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this, but I could only give it four stars.  It is very matte and when I tried to use it as foundation on my normal skin it just looked dry and accentuated fine lines.  It also is too matte under my foundation, although if I am careful to keep to just the areas of red (nose and chin), I can get away with it.  It also lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I had CO2 Laser done under my eyes, and after the initial healing my skin is bright PINK, PINK, PINK!  I tried mineral powder to cover, but you still saw some pink.  It looked like I&#x27;d been crying.  I just got this today and put it on a soon as I opened the package.  Wow!  You cannot see any red underneath my eyes now.  I might need to put a little more moisturizing cream underneath because it got a little cake like in spots, but that could be due to the new skin.  I am happy about this product.  I can now go out and feel I&#x27;m sufficiently covered and less self conscious. I dabbed a little lower than the pink area and it showed my pores horribly though.  I have older skin, so my pores are bigger than they used to be, but this seems to magnify it.  I will keep this to the new pink skin only.  Expensive for small amount, but well worth it; a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that delivers what it says! This will be a staple in my makeup case. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!  I have rosacea, and even with the thickest concealer and foundation, you can see the redness creeping through. I applied tiny amount of this ONLY on my redness and blended, did not HAVE to put foundation over it, and my face looked GREAT!!!  This will be my go to from now on instead of foundation!!  Perfect for someone who hates wearing makeup all the time!!</li>
            <li> I am 37 weeks pregnant and have been fighting pregnancy acne since week one.  Mostly on my cheeks and jawline, it has left pink and purple discoloration where the lesions have dried and healed.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of foundation because I don&#x27;t like my face feeling cakey or the look of something painted on the skin like foundation can have.  I mostly use tinted moisturizer or more recently, Tarte CC cream just to even my skin tone.  I started using this product to cover the red discoloration from the acne and it is doing well.  I have fair skin (skin type 2 on the 1-6 scale) and while it looks dark in the container it does blend fairly well, especially when mixed with my lighter CC cream.  I apply it to clean skin with my finger like the instructions say and then use my CC cream over it and blend with a foundation brush.  It can get dry and cakey around my nasal creases if I apply too much.  However, it does stay matte throughout the day which is great because I tend to get oily in the afternoon; I was always applying powder after lunch but don&#x27;t seem to need that as much using this product.  It&#x27;s not perfect but I do like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college student, and I used to and still sometimes get pretty bad hormonal breakouts around my chin. I also tend to get a lot of redness around my nose and chin area. This stuff really works wonders. I use it over a primer and just like that, my skin is soft and completely even. A little goes a long way. Seriously this is the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever tried (I know its correcting creme but I use it the way I would a foundation). I barely need concealer. It&#x27;s a little annoying that it only comes in one color but it matches me pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the packaging. I definitely prefer something with a pump. Overall, this stuff is worth the hype and the money. I will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of all the hype about how it matches to your skin tone and so after reading so many good reviews I brought the product and all it does is make my fair skin look orange! So i don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with fair skin because it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I was leary when I purchased this, but it really does cover the redness.  I have red on my chin and around my nose.</li>
            <li> This product gives the face a fresh and flawless look!  You know when you get out of the shower, and your face is a little pink? Well, during the winter, my face keeps that pink look throughout the day... however, this fabulous product covers up the red/pink pigments.</li>
            <li> I use this as my foundation and just love it. I watched a youtube makeup video and it was recommended so I gave it a try for my warm light skin tone. Never had a better match!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very pale sensitive skin, but this product is my favorite! I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> It had amazing coverage and your skin looks great, The down side is that if you put too much on on accident not only do you look whited out but this stuff goes super fast. You also can&#x27;t reapply it later in the day it won&#x27;t set. But its amazing if you can get it right, my friend said it should last about 6 months so it is worth the price, however I am also out because if you grab to much you can&#x27;t put it back in the container.</li>
            <li> My face is almost always mild to moderately red. It annoys me so much and I desperately wanted to get rid of it. This is the perfect product to do that. At first it looked a little to dark on my fair skin but then it took only a minute for it to settle in and look amazing! You don&#x27;t need much at all either. I&#x27;ve barely even got through the cap yet. I do like the packaging because it&#x27;s easy for me to dip my finger into the jar and blend it into my face. Does not settle into my dry spots. Overall highly recommended for people with mild to moderately red skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it is tented to a light/medium so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you&#x27;re really fair complected , it&#x27;s great coverage and definitely takes care of any redness. This is my new &amp;#34;GO-TO&amp;#34; favorite thing in my make up bag. It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a makeup artist due to my red splotchy skin. It really works! I use if for special occasions and it does not require a lot to use. Very good product. I would make sure you have a foundation type brush to spread around.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my hairline and this product is the first I can put on in the morning and not have to worry about redness the rest of the day. I use (after primer)  under my mineral foundation. You only need a very little it so do not be put off by the price. I use daily for a large area and the jar lasted 2+ months. Sent to my sister with rosacea and she loved it too.</li>
            <li> Very matte look, but that&#x27;s what I love about it. I prefer to apply this cream with a makeup brush. It covers red spots and lasts all day long, plus does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin. The color is a little light, so plan to add bronzer and/or blush to add contouring.</li>
            <li> If you have allergy/medical level redness, this is just another foundation. Only very expensive and in a tiny jar. I have major redness. Like true crayon-red, tomato, sunburn face. I manage this in many ways. However, this was not some miracle product for a person with my level red. My redness still shows through, but reduced. If you have my level red you need a green based primer or corrector, not a neutral one like this. This has a thick consistency, is true neutral not too pink or too yellow. A little does go a long way, but if I still need to put on a foundation, for my amount of red this is not cost effective. Try Revlon Colorstay Whipped with Clinique Redness Solutions Daily Protective Base under it. Also this product is much cheaper on the IT cosmetics website. I think if you have average red, go for it, a jar could last you forever. Great ingredients and has a dry texture, if you are oily. You&#x27;re gonna need some powder over it if you want it to last more like a foundation. Especially if you have the kind of redness that most other people can&#x27;t understand. Edited to clarify: I should say this is not a foundation, as it does not last the day. This is a corrector for mild to average redness. I don&#x27;t notice it performing any better than a good concealer at hiding freckles/spots/scars. Start with a tiny amount because this will give you cakey skin fast. I use Real Techniques expert face brush, start at outside (reddest area) of my face and blend inward. Finish with a setting spray after powdering to help with the dry appearance. Does apply nicely over my SPF.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great for helping with any rosyness on my face, i&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s best when putting on entire face to use the thick square brush. You only need a little bit and make sure to blend very well in order not to look caked on. I put primer on first let dry and then put on this stuff, i love it. i can&#x27;t go a day without.</li>
            <li> This did not cover at all any of my face redness, for $32.00 you would think this product would have done the job,  I returned the cream and they refunded my money quickly, I was very pleased.  Also, they only have one color, it was way too light for my complexion.  Bye, Bye redness does not work, dont waste your money, buy Dermablend instead.</li>
            <li> Much better than I expected. I didn&#x27;t have my hopes up, but was knocked out with this concealer. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It only takes a very tiny amount to get rid of redness.  I tend to have a ruddy undertone especially if I&#x27;m stressed.  This product corrects and lasts at least 8 hours !</li>
            <li> It gives some coverage, but not full coverage of my birthmarks. And makes my skin feels even drier than it is.</li>
            <li> I suffer from oily/acne prone skin and living in a hot, humid client, makeup is the last thing you want on sweaty, oily skin. This cc is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t cake and it provides just the right amount of coverage without feeling heavy. I have light/medium skin tone and the color works well. I do apply a setting powder as well as apply this product with a foundation brush for a more even, natural application.</li>
            <li> It really covers the redness very well. I will repurchase!</li>
            <li> Great product!!!  No redness showing at all.  Product does exactly as it says.  Very matte! I will buy again! Love It!</li>
            <li> I will not be able to try this until tomorrow (5/7/2014), but I have watched a few YouTube videos today with demonstrations and reviews of different skin tones and it looks good.  I have a few tiny concerns I will not know until I try  (I will edit this review with any info  before  the end of the weekend).&lt;br /&gt;I have dry sensitive skin, will this work with that.....  .&lt;br /&gt;Can I use moisturizer first,...........  .&lt;br /&gt;Will it work better with light primer,..........  .&lt;br /&gt;In our north Ga. hot, humid summer weather, will it melt off,............&lt;br /&gt;Will it make my large pores areas look larger or cake in lines and around my nose ,..........  .</li>
            <li> This really works exactly as promised.  I have redness on and around my nose.  It covers the redness and blends into my complexion. You can use product alone or with foundation. I don&#x27;t like heavy make up so I use it by itself.</li>
            <li> amazing for spot treatment and of course covering up that redness. a little really goes a longggg way, highly pigmented but not cakey!</li>
            <li> I can not tell you enough how amazing this product is for me. It really helps reduce any redness on my skin and my liquid foundation goes over it flawlessly. Lasts all day. I have tried every concealer known to mankind (literally) and this is my new HG. Thank you IT Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I am 34 years old and have fair skin and BAD rosacea!! I love this product! I got a sample of &amp;#34;it under eye cream&amp;#34; and started wearing it on my whole face to help cover my redness. When I searched for other products from this company, I got lucky and found  bye bye redness. The jar is tiny but a little product goes a long way!!! I can use one jar for 2 months and I don&#x27;t know any people with rosacea as bad as mine!! I have to reapply at the end of my workday if I have plans in the evening, but I still think the product lasts longer than anything i have found.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not covering better than other foundations at all! My MAC studio fix is way better...</li>
            <li> This will be my THIRD repurchase of this product. I know many have said this product has not worked for them, but this has worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone skin and have tried all different kinds of concealer but kept having the same problem with every opening one that I tried: it wouldn&#x27;t cover the redness, it would begin to loom cake throughout the day, and it felt sticky on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried about if this product was actually gonna work. But it does! It goes on like a primer but has the coverage of a full coverage foundation yet doesn&#x27;t loom caky or like you have a ton of makeup on. I set it with a translucent powder from NYX and it stays put all day. I apply it with either my fingers or my Real techniques expert face brush. Sometimes I apply it all over my face as a foundation, but I usually just apply it as concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that it adjusts to my skin tone perfectly, though, sometimes it can look too dark if you put too many layers on. (Although one layer is all you need)</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t confuse this product for a foundation... even though it can be used as one for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have early stage rosacea and didn&#x27;t find much that wasn&#x27;t heavy to cover my broken capillaries by my nose. This stuff is thick and creamy. When I first opened the package I was actually surprised how thick it was and didn&#x27;t have much hope for the gloppy stuff in the jar, lol. I was wrong, this stuff covers everything on my face including my freckles! The tone for me is spot on, but might not work at all for anyone fair skinned. It&#x27;s a pretty dark shade the more you apply, so maybe with a light hand it could be blendable. I don&#x27;t know that the undertones are in it, but I&#x27;m Asian and have no issues with it blending in. I also have no issues with skin irritation. It seems really gentle, no clogged pores or allergies as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that doesn&#x27;t thrill me about it is the jar. It comes covered with a white plastic insert on the top under the lid. Because the product is a bit thick, it glops onto the top of that... so you might as well take the excess from there to use. If you remove the plastic cover inside, you&#x27;re in for a nightmare of wasted product stuck in the threads of the lid! I think this product would benefit from being squeezable from a tube, but that&#x27;s just my opinion. I highly recommend it for anyone with skin conditions they&#x27;d like to hide, including under eye circles... however, if it&#x27;s scars you&#x27;re dealing with I recommend DermaBlend.</li>
            <li> My cheeks and chest turn red occasionally throughout the day, amd sometimes even my nose, as a result of stress or even caffeine intake. When I do t have these flareups, my skin is flawless. I&#x27;ve always used a super full coverage foundation just in case my skin turns red. After trying this concealer, i no longer need heavy coverage makeup. It works best by applying after primer.  It matches a wide range of skin colors, so I&#x27;d imagine some wear it as a foundation. I prefer using it as a base, then putting foundation over it. It&#x27;s consistency is a bit thicker than liquid foundation , and is applied best with the dab of your finger. I strongly recommend for anyone who has struggled with any sort of skin redness. This is worth trying and may be the solution you&#x27;ve been hoping to find.</li>
            <li> I have very fair, red, sensitive, combination (including very dry in certain spots) skin. Almost every foundation I have worn barely covers my redness without leaving flakes and/or being too dark. This stuff is like magic. I have no redness and it lasts all day. If I don&#x27;t have enough moisturizer on the driest parts of my face ahead of time it definitely will flake there, but as long as I prep my skin it is perfect. I normally use this as a foundation and set it with a translucent powder, although on rare occasions I will wear a medium coverage liquid foundation on top of this (before the powder). I live in Arizona and it definitely stands up to the heat, even in our humid monsoon season.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!!  I have a lot of redness in my face and have tried many other concealers but they never work.  This one really does work and I will not go without it ever again!</li>
            <li> I have a chronic illness and between my illness and my medications, my skin really takes a beating. I deal with dryness, blemishes and sensitivity from time to time and have never been able to find a product that can adequately address and cover well without looking heavy. This product does everything it says it will and looks flawless all day long!!!! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about It Cosmetics Bye Bye Redness concealer. The fact that it does all of that AND treats skin with great ingredients is almost too good to be true. I will be a fan for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light/fair skin and have found that  this product works very well to adapting to my skin tone like it says it will. If you have an olive or dark complexion, this probably won&#x27;t work for you. They should definitely develop a product that covers different skin tones and shades so that everyone can use this product and not just Caucasians.</li>
            <li> I love this product. After hearing about it from a beauty guru on youtube I thought I would try it out and am so thankful I did. This is like the only product I need on my skin. It stays on a full day and it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have something caked on your face, it is very lightweight but still has that full coverage affect! Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a great product to hide acne and redness from my face but that doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing make up... pretty much an impossible request... until I used this product!! It feels weightless, doesn&#x27;t break out my face, and stays on all day! very much worth the money for a great product if you are looking for the solution to NO redness! Highly recommenced for all, also recommend buying a foundation brush to apply this product with, use very little also! a little goes a very long way on your face, use the brush to apply to entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I really love this product because it gives excellent coverage. I suffer from moderate acne, and because I have fair skin, redness and acne scars really stand out. This foundation covered everything with only a tiny dab, and it lasts all day! I only give it 4 stars because it only comes in one color, which is a little too dark for my skin tone. I got away with it for a while, but have since discovered the Kat Von D lock it foundation. This stuff comes in many different colors and covers just as well, so it is a better choice for me. However, if you are not super fair skinned or dark skinned, you should be able to get away with this product, and I would definitely recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and am always looking for things to correct the redness with a goal of helping my skin, soothing my skin, and making my skin look better. The women on QVC made this really look like it worked, and maybe it did, for them. For me, however, it is drying. Also, it has an appearance of something being on your skin, like a foundation would. That would be fine, even desired, except that it is not natural looking at all. There&#x27;s only one tone that comes with this product and it&#x27;s not a tone that works on my face. I exfoliate gently and often enough to where it should not be an issue for a cream like this to make pores seem bigger and more noticeable, which is the case using this product.</li>
            <li> Definitely covered redness but was very cakey, even on my oily/combo skin! Probably wouldnt re purchase this item ever again.</li>
            <li> This works very well at covering red spots. I was a little disappointed by the price, as I later found it on QVC in a larger size bottle for half the price. Live and learn!</li>
            <li> It covered all my redness and stays matte all day. It even helped cover my acne scars and you only need a small amount each time!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. It works great for me, I don&#x27;t have very red skin but I use this as a cover up. I also viewed Megan Rossette on Youtube to be sure I wanted the product, and yes. Great product. You don&#x27;t get very much of it, the bottle is small unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Love the product will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It covers without being heavy or shiny and still looks natural.  It&#x27;s a foundation that does not look like one.  I have used it since it came out.  And, as a bonus, shipping from this vendor is the fastest yet.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Flawless skin with one application. I do wish they made a tub size of this stuff. It would still be worth the price.</li>
            <li> Awesome service and awesome product. This is one of the best foundations that I have ever used. The coverage is awesome for redness just like it suggests and doesn&#x27;t look cakey!!</li>
            <li> Really covers rosacea well, and wears for a long time. Washes off easily. A small jar but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This gives great coverage I just wish that this came in different shades! I would totally recommend this to anyone with medium toned skin!</li>
            <li> My son is getting married in a couple of weeks and I am doing everything in my power to step it up for the festivities. I have a lot of broken capillaries around my nostrils and a lot of redness on my cheeks. I use Bare Minerals products, but the concealer doesn&#x27;t completely cover all the redness and it also wears off way sooner than I feel it should. I ran across this product on Amazon and thought it was worth a try. I am so glad I did. I should have been a research scientist because I don&#x27;t buy anything until I have read everything I can find about the product prior to my money leaving my hand. As a result of this I landed at the IT Cosmetics websight and ended up purchasing there. They offer a discount if you sign up and it saved me about six dollars along with free shipping. But this is a bargain at any price.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to use a very small amount. I patted the cream on the reddest parts of my face....the end. No foundation, no powder, nothing! I wanted to make sure it does not crease or wear off, and make sure the cream is doing what it is suppose to. It DOES!!!!! It hid my redness all day long, to the point that my husband said I looked pale (hours later) because he was so accustomed to my RED face. I really think this would work well as a concealer or a foundation. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product..I love it because it actually does what it is suppose to. I do wish it came in more like colors.light, medium and dark.</li>
            <li> I adore this product- I have super fair skin and the color of this stuff is a little terra cotta which is kind of terrifying at first. But it blends in perfectly and covers up the red areas across my nose and cheeks- LOVE this and will buy in bulk if I ever hear it&#x27;s being discontinued.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. It is greasy and doesn&#x27;t do what it says. I am better off with my concealer.</li>
            <li> I LIVE by this product. I use a small concealer brush to apply over areas where I have redness and then blend out onto the rest of my face. I use liquid foundation over this. This product is not meant to be used alone. You don&#x27;t need much and frankly, if you put too much on it looks uneven once you apply your foundation. Put a bit on and then let your face relax for a few minutes - my face gets red just from rubbing it or putting on foundation for example so if this is true for you, give yourself a minute to let your face return to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; before deciding if you need more or if it&#x27;s time for foundation.</li>
            <li> Absolute magic. This is pretty much the magic eraser of cosmetics. Totally worth every penny and it will last forever, definitely buying again!</li>
            <li> AMAZING! A little product goes a long way and the coverage is unbelievable! It completely evens out my skin tone and covers all blemishes, yet feels so light weight like your not wearing anything. I dab it all over my face, blend with beauty blender, and set with powder. I will definitely repurchase this when I run out!</li>
            <li> Amazing coverage. Very thick so don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product over and over, I love it, I just wish it would come in a different container. So many people have said that, hopefully Jaime Will listen someday.</li>
            <li> My daughter convinced me to buy this product, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did!  When it first arrived, I wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed by looking at it - the container is small, it&#x27;s not cheap, and most importantly, the cream itself looked thin.  My daughter and I both have hyperpigmentation, so we&#x27;re always looking for products that give us great coverage, without looking like we have tons of makeup on.  A little of this goes a long way and even though it feels and looks very natural, it evens out skin tone and provides excellent coverage.  I have a few very dark spots, so those areas need some extra coverage but overall, the rest of my face looks pretty darn good.  I even splurged and bought the recommended brush that goes along with it (the IT dual brush) and it works really well.  Super soft brush (Amazon was by far the cheapest place to buy it) that spreads the cream evenly.  If you&#x27;re like us and have tried tons of different coverage products, I think that you will be very happy with this one.  My daughter even says that it has improved the condition of her skin (less breakouts, etc) but I have not used it long enough to determine that one way or another.</li>
            <li> It gives you very good coverage,if you have any redness on your face this product is for you,it goes on smooth,i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you&#x27;re looking for a foundation that eliminates the need for a concealer and corrects redness very well. I also like this line of cosmetics because they have anti-aging qualities. Wearing makeup is damaging to your skin so any help with anti aging elements is great.&lt;br /&gt;Foundation stays on well for most of the day. I only need to lightly re-powder if I&#x27;m going out again at night.&lt;br /&gt;Product has always arrived promptly and in good condition. I&#x27;ve purchased this quite a few times now.</li>
            <li> Found this product to stand up to its claims. I give high marks across the board.</li>
            <li> Overpriced concealer.  I bought this and would not buy it again.  Candidly, I put this on side-by-side with drugstore concealers and there was no difference.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea skin and I use this product for some of the scarring I have from it.  It covers well and I am fairly light skinned, do not notice it on the areas that I use it vs. the areas that I don&#x27;t use it.  I would highly recommend this.  A little dab will do ya though.  I use my fingers to apply so a quick dab into the jar to get out a little and I mean a little.  This small jar will last me a long time.  I highly recommend.  Does not irritate my Rosacea skin which is a plus.</li>
            <li> works great. highly recommend</li>
            <li> Worked just as well as they said it would-- that&#x27;s something!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!  I&#x27;ve been applying this with a brush and wearing it as foundation.  It does not &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34; or settle at all.  It is creamy but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I don&#x27;t  ever want.to be without it! Most days I don&#x27;t wear any make up with it...it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> Only product that covers my red! Also I have dry skin and it looks great! Try and get it with the min kabuki brush it does wonders.</li>
            <li> DO NOT PAY $52 FOR THIS. I&#x27;m just trying to get your attention. This product is at Ulta for $32. With that said, I do love the product and I have repurchased twice already. It is a bit thick. You only need a little so it lasts a long time. I only gave one star to deter people from getting ripped off by whoever is trying to sell this for $52!</li>
