            <li>Great witch hazel, love the pads.</li>
            <li>so I just took some of the formula out and put in the Thayer Witch Hazel in Peach, and now they smell great and make my skin feel and look even better.</li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These pads are handy.</li>
            <li>They came in handy after a treacherous hike on Kauai.</li>
            <li>handy and no search for elusive cotton balls-</li>
            <li>Best make up remover for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Perfect- super moist and fresh</li>
            <li>When I finished the pads, I just put more of my own in, and added some more Thayers Witch Hazel on top, to save money and be eco-friendly with out wasting the container.</li>
            <li>This Astringent has made my skin so much more manageable.</li>
            <li>I Love the product.  </li>
            <li>Love the cooling pads.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the witch hazel-aloe vera pads, but I wish it was double the count (120 rather than 60).</li>
            <li>My skin is looking better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product, can feel changes in my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of being able to travel with these.</li>
            <li>I love these pads.</li>
            <li>I love that this includes aloe as well.</li>
            <li>Gentle, works good and isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>Why did I wander away from this fine product, offered since 1845?</li>
            <li>I love using witch hazel as an exfoliant and often buy fresh aloe leaf to use for moisture.</li>
            <li>I love these, I use them on backpacking trips for a quick evening clean up.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, shipped fast and is super easy carry around.</li>
            <li>I usually use witch hazel in the liquid form, but found these as a perfect alternative.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t realize that the original formula has alcohol in it unlike the scented Thayer versions.</li>
            <li>They leave me refreshed and clean before I crawl into my sleeping bag for the night.</li>
            <li>I also find it hard to find those perfect textured pads for exfoliation</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning for a quick wash.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>It was fun to surprise her..</li>
            <li>Witch hazel was the first cash-generating export from Virginia to London markets (followed by sassafras, then by tobacco).</li>
            <li>I went on and off several times to make sure it was the product.  </li>
            <li>This is such a refreshing astringent.</li>
            <li>She phoned recently to ask me where I got them, saying her skin felt so much better, smoother.</li>
            <li>It was first manufactured in Lynn Massachusetts</li>
            <li>They left my skin tone looking better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>Love the pads, helps to have the ease of these in order to have a daily and nightly regimen.</li>
            <li>This way is for the rich and people who are busy and in a hurry on the go sorta speak.</li>
            <li>great product, pads a little smaller than expect.</li>
            <li>The alcohol, while less than other commercial witch hazels, still doesn&#x27;t feel as good on my skin as the rose version.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, cleared up my face.</li>
            <li>Not only is it blemish free but it is extremely soft,</li>
            <li>Pore reduction and smoother skin is the main result.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and soft!</li>
            <li>Plain witch hazel is fine.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t stop the breakouts completely, but it did reduce the amount of acne and the size.</li>
            <li>I like the convenience and no waste of the product.</li>
            <li>He has eczema and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so I wanted something that was all natural and would not irritate his face.  </li>
            <li>The aloe vera also leaves the skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I gifted two jars to a senior friend in Michigan this past week who raved about it when she used mine while visited a few months ago.</li>

            <li> Why did I wander away from this fine product, offered since 1845? Witch hazel was the first cash-generating export from Virginia to London markets (followed by sassafras, then by tobacco). There are a lot of superstitions about it.

Ever for cleaning a tablet screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oops, almost forgot to note: Not tested on animals.</li>

            <li> This broke my skin out.  I went on and off several times to make sure it was the product.  Yes, it was the astringent pads that caused the break outs. Plain witch hazel is fine.</li>
            <li> Gentle, works good and isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> My son is 10 and starting to get tiny pimples on his forehead.  He has eczema and sensitive skin so I wanted something that was all natural and would not irritate his face.  These work great!</li>
            <li> This is such a refreshing astringent. My skin is looking better. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Great product - great service</li>

            <li> This is an &amp;#34;old time&amp;#34; astringent used for hemarhoids that actually works. It was first manufactured in Lynn Massachusetts</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful and the service was excellent!</li>
            <li> Great for oily skin and keeping acne at bay. Best make up remover for sensitive skin. I noticed that my pores are smaller .</li>
            <li> Works well for travel, although pricy. When I finished the pads, I just put more of my own in, and added some more Thayers Witch Hazel on top, to save money and be eco-friendly with out wasting the container.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and soft!</li>

            <li> Works good.  Got rid of my acne.</li>
            <li> Love this product, can feel changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of being able to travel with these. I didn&#x27;t really like the smell so I just took some of the formula out and put in the Thayer Witch Hazel in Peach, and now they smell great and make my skin feel and look even better.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, cleared up my face. I was shocked, sometimes it&#x27;s the simple ingredients that work.</li>
            <li> I use these pads as a toner and they work great! The texture of the pads scrubs any remaining dirt, oil and makeup off my skin. The aloe vera also leaves the skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Perfect- super moist and fresh</li>
            <li> Great product.  Pads are very handy.</li>
            <li> I love these pads. they aren&#x27;t to harsh and make your skin dry.&lt;br /&gt;Try it. it&#x27;s the only pads I will use.</li>
            <li> I have been using the rose Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel for years and love how it is probably the best anti-wrinkle product I&#x27;ve ever used. I recently bought these pads since I will be going on vacation in a month and wanted something I can take on the plane. However, I didn&#x27;t realize that the original formula has alcohol in it unlike the scented Thayer versions. My bad. The alcohol, while less than other commercial witch hazels, still doesn&#x27;t feel as good on my skin as the rose version. I will use it but will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love using witch hazel as an exfoliant and often buy fresh aloe leaf to use for moisture. I love that this includes aloe as well. I also find it hard to find those perfect textured pads for exfoliation so it&#x27;s perfect they use pads that exfoliate bit aren&#x27;t too soft and aren&#x27;t too rough either. They left my skin tone looking better than it has in years. I noticed a difference the very next day. I&#x27;ll never go without these again. If you have dry, blemished skin these will work wonders.</li>
            <li> This is the best witch hazel that I have ever used and I love the fact that it is small thin pads that are soaked in the witch hazel so there is never any mess or waste.  I have been buying this product for years and will continue to do so.  It makes a great cleanser and toner for my face.</li>
            <li> Love the pads, helps to have the ease of these in order to have a daily and nightly regimen.</li>
            <li> Been using this somewhat obscure brand for a while, generous package quantity, does the job and is compact for storage and travel.</li>
            <li> Best thing you could ever put on your skin.</li>
