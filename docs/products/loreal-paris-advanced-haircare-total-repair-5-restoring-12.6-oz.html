            <li>my hair isn&#x27;t incredibly damaged; i keep it in two strand twits or crochet braids 99% of the time and have made a routine consisting of twice weekly co-washing/aloe, glycerin +rosemary oil spritz, weekly dc&#x27;s, and i&#x27;ve created my own hair butter and oil spray for sealing.</li>

            <li>It is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>it smells nice too ;</li>
            <li>So far so good!!</li>
            <li>Most amazing stuff ever to me better then</li>
            <li>As soon as I got out of the shower i felt a huge difference in the way my hair felt!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried so many products ranging from $20-$80 and NOTHING worked better than this.</li>
            <li>Many of you may be like me, and wondering which one to buy, so this review is a play-by-play comparison of the two conditioners.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love how my hair looks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still use and love it.</li>
            <li>I ordered it with the shampoo and erasing balm, and I love it</li>
            <li>Looks better already, and that&#x27;s after just one use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m making sure to stay stocked up</li>
            <li>I am able to comb through my hair without having to use my leave in treatments that I use after washing my hair.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I worried more when I got it in my hair and let it sit for 1-3 minutes as per the instructions.</li>
            <li>saloon stuff and price is way better too</li>
            <li>Love the feel and smell.  </li>
            <li>I have the matching shampoo and deep conditioning balm (the balm is the BEST)!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really worth it!!</li>
            <li>nonetheless, about two or so months ago i lightened my hair with peroxide/baking soda after an unsuccessful attempt at flat ironing/frying my hair so my hair isn&#x27;t in the most ideal</li>
            <li>Only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t smell very good.  </li>
            <li>(The shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to smell as strong.)  </li>
            <li>it smells nice too ;-)</li>
            <li>At first, this product really made my hair look happy, shinier and feel smoother.</li>
            <li>and I liked that actually better than the Damage Erasing Balm because it made my hair soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>also tried the Advanced Haircare Power Moisture Moisture Rush Mask</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I still use them but the fact that I can comb through without, tells me how super soft this makes my fair.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 Conditioner is the nicest, most effective conditioner ever.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo from this line leaves my hair clean and de-tangled with NO residue.  </li>
            <li>It would be TOO much for natural hair, but damaged hair, just drinks this up :) beautiful, soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>My hair is still extremely soft, and silky, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner so much.</li>
            <li>I used them both tonight, in the shower, and was surprised at how well I liked it.</li>
            <li>hair is easy to brush when wet, which is always a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the shampoo and conditioner for the first time last night and it is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I have never been able to comb my fingers through wet hair without catching some tangles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new hair care line since my favorite one was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>im very surprised and ultimately pleased with my experience with this product.</li>
            <li>The glowing reviews were right; after I use it my shortish hair slides around on my head as if I toss it in the wind.  </li>
            <li>you can feel difference right away.</li>
            <li>It made my hair really soft, easy to brush, and seems to be stronger.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if they were supposed to be the same thing in the line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it makes it feel all soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever written a 5-star review for a hair product -- but I have to share my experience.  </li>
            <li>First rinse around the face line and then lift that hair out of the way, and rinse underneath at the back/behind the ears.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this line since it first came out.</li>
            <li>If only I could keep myself from touching it.</li>
            <li>When it was time to rinse, my hair felt slick, and I could comb my finger through it easily, making rinsing it out super easy.</li>
            <li>After first use I could tell right after I got out of the shower my hair felt so soft!</li>
            <li>On the bright side, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long after rinsing out the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s dry, my hair looks SO shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Even my stylist said my hair looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very salon-type smell.</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair, but you could never tell after using these products.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I hesitated to try it because I already liked my usual conditioner.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use and buy this product, and the price is less that the Paul Mitchell and Matrix that I use, and my hair feels better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll try more expensive conditioner for better results.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been usings suaves natural paraben/silicone/sulfate free conditioner as my cowash for a long while now</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think that the EXTREME conditioner is more of a deep conditioner that you may only want to use once a week, where the Total Repair 5 is a better every-day conditioner.</li>
            <li>my ends, my previously fried, crispy feeling ends are soft and silky to the touch with that strength of healthy hair.</li>
            <li>It did take a little longer to rinse out than I would have liked, which is the only downfall.</li>
            <li>Soft!</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft, shiny, light feeling, and even after riding around with my windows down</li>
            <li>I purchased both the &amp;#34;L&#x27;Oreal Advanced EXTREME Repair&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;L&#x27;Oreal Advanced Total Repair 5&amp;#34; because they are both yellow bottles, and they often get mixed up or categorized together at the drug store.</li>
            <li>My dry hard hair has really switched it up on me because now it&#x27;s silky smooth and pretty again!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend for color treated hair or just damaged hair in general.  </li>
            <li>Also super shiny after a blow-dry, even without adding other styling products.</li>
            <li>Rich conditioner used on dry white hair prevented frizz.</li>
            <li>When I tried it I was happily surprised with how shiny and manageable my hair was.</li>
            <li>My hair is FRIED, like completely</li>
            <li>I recommend it completely.</li>
            <li>it leaves your hair silky, shiny and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>so it did not fall gently into the cut, especially the ends which tended to stick out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just, WOW.</li>
            <li>This shampoo-conditioner line leaves my hair so soft, shiny, and touchable.</li>
            <li>It is like a professional conditioner, and I&#x27;ve used some pricey ones.  </li>
            <li>I will never waste money on Nexxus products again.  </li>
            <li>I used it with the shampoo and my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li>Not to heavy, though not too light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can tell right away that my hair is drying faster than it did compared to when I used the Extreme Repair, probably because it is not as thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First I noticed that it seemed softer and smoother even when wet.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t really know how your hair looks until it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>my hair feels buttery really, something i didn&#x27;t think was possible with my coarse strands.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed is that the smell is different, and the Total Repair 5 conditioner is much thinner consistency than the Extreme.</li>
            <li>It helps my hair not dry out</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and the items that go along with it including: Shampoo, Damage Erasing Balm and Total Repair 5 Multi-Restorative Dry Oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am wondering if the Total Repair 5 was updated with the new formula to the Extreme Repair.</li>

            <li> This shampoo-conditioner line leaves my hair so soft, shiny, and touchable.</li>
            <li> It is like a professional conditioner, and I&#x27;ve used some pricey ones.  </li>
            <li> I will never waste money on Nexxus products again.  </li>
            <li> I used it with the shampoo and my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li> Not to heavy, though not too light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can tell right away that my hair is drying faster than it did compared to when I used the Extreme Repair, probably because it is not as thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First I noticed that it seemed softer and smoother even when wet.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t really know how your hair looks until it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> my hair feels buttery really, something i didn&#x27;t think was possible with my coarse strands.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed is that the smell is different, and the Total Repair 5 conditioner is much thinner consistency than the Extreme.</li>
            <li> It helps my hair not dry out</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and the items that go along with it including: Shampoo, Damage Erasing Balm and Total Repair 5 Multi-Restorative Dry Oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am wondering if the Total Repair 5 was updated with the new formula to the Extreme Repair.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m generally not a fan of silicone&#x27;s as it wears my fragile 4c strands over time</li>
            <li> I mean right now, buy it.  </li>
            <li> Both conditioners have the same sickly, sweet scent that is unappealing to me.  </li>
            <li> I have bleach blonde chemically damaged long hair</li>
            <li> i couldnt even straighten my hair the next day because it was so dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> either way, i&#x27;ve been hearing a lot of about l&#x27;oreal total repair/advanced hair care line and have been dying to test out this conditioner, the erasing balm, and the total repair extreme.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, chemically processed hair and always need extra moisture, and conditioners and oils that control friz.</li>
            <li> But, now that i have been using both the conditioners and the shampoos together, my hair has become much drier than usual, and much harder to straighten as well.</li>
            <li> I always get two bottles of conditioner for every one bottle of shampoo, because my hair is really long.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, dry hair and this conditioner</li>
            <li> I had none of the usual flyaway or frizziness, and I have super thick hair that I flat iron everyday and takes major abuse.</li>
            <li> so my hair is dry and frizzy and breaks off all the time.</li>
            <li> so I bought this to help treat my very dry damaged looking hair.</li>
            <li> i purchased two of those little $1 samples at target about two weeks ago and finally got to using it tonight.</li>
            <li> my hair has never been this soft after a conditioner, or at least not within in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> but it seems to work for alot of other people.</li>
            <li> But I was using her technique on other conditioners and it did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it has it uses, specifically when i plan on heat styling or during extremely dry/cold months.</li>
            <li> Normally, I do not like thin conditioners, because I feel like I am not getting hydrated enough, but I did not feel that way when I applied this conditioner in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then ends were crunchy and really hard to blow dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit my hair was dry and hard.</li>
            <li> If I can get used to the icky scent, I would buy this again and recommend it to others with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I color my drab hair (2 colors in heavy streaks), then highlight around the front for drama.  </li>
            <li> Then when it dried, it was the same!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I waited til my hair completely dried to write a review, because, let&#x27;s face it..</li>
            <li> If this conditioner didn&#x27;t have a nasty artificial scent, it would be practically perfect.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, curly, and long, and it has Also started falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair a bit slick feeling afterward, which just adds to the softness once it&#x27;s dried.  </li>
            <li> stubborn ends that are usually frizzy and unruly even after i cowash  seem rejuvenated and my curl pattern has returned on those pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have some concern that there is silicone in it but not sure.</li>
            <li> I usually put samples up for whenever I go on vacation...</li>
            <li> I coated my hair in this, root to tip which I NEVER do since my hair is oily, usually.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it was dry looking, and stiff at the ends</li>
            <li> I usually hate to use conditioner, so I normally don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> Not a good idea, and it didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually shocked, because I normally do not get any shine in my hair until I put in argon oil.</li>
            <li> it made it WORSE</li>
            <li> You know that freaky weird consequence of menopause where your hormones shift and your hair turns to straw?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For the last couple of years my hair has been so worked. Then ends were crunchy and really hard to blow dry. I&#x27;ve been using the conditioner and shampoo for about 2 months and have been really impressed with the results. Even my stylist said my hair looks so much healthier. I&#x27;m a salon product girl and have used everything from Paul Mitchell to Alterna. I highly recommend this product and the items that go along with it including: Shampoo, Damage Erasing Balm and Total Repair 5 Multi-Restorative Dry Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the Advanced Haircare Power Moisture Moisture Rush Mask and I liked that actually better than the Damage Erasing Balm because it made my hair soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> Be warned, the product has lots of chemicals in it but it does deliver on its promise of giving your hair shine, and moisture even just with one use.</li>
            <li> I have used L&#x27;Oreal products for years.  Great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for a month, but my hair still looks damaged... (from hair color and daily use of hair dryer??)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try more expensive conditioner for better results.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this with our Sunday newspaper. I hesitated to try it because I already liked my usual conditioner. When I tried it I was happily surprised with how shiny and manageable my hair was. In fact, my hair seems to respond to styling without the mousse that I always use. I didn&#x27;t leave off the mousse on purpose, I was distracted. Since then, I&#x27;ve left off the mousse.</li>
            <li> Ladies! You know that freaky weird consequence of menopause where your hormones shift and your hair turns to straw? And even after you go see the doctor and start taking thyroid supplements, your hair STILL feels like straw? To the point where you&#x27;re afraid to let anyone touch it &#x27;cause you feel like the Scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY HAIR FEELS LIKE HAIR AGAIN!!! Soft! Silky! Manageable!  It&#x27;s a miracle!!! Coupled with the intensive conditioner, the texture changes with one treatment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, L&#x27;Oreal--NEVER stop making this stuff. And THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> I have no idea what they put in this Conditioner, but I have never used one like it. My hair is FRIED, like completely and I&#x27;ve tried so many products ranging from $20-$80 and NOTHING worked better than this. My hair felt like legit silk and it smelled amazing. I&#x27;m going to buy this in BULK!!!</li>
            <li> If this conditioner didn&#x27;t have a nasty artificial scent, it would be practically perfect.  I purchased the shampoo, conditioner and the deep conditioner from this line.  Both conditioners have the same sickly, sweet scent that is unappealing to me.  (The shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to smell as strong.)  On the bright side, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long after rinsing out the conditioner.  I have long, curly, dry hair and this conditioner make it shinier, silkier and holds the curls together perfectly.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a new hair care line since my favorite one was discontinued.  If I can get used to the icky scent, I would buy this again and recommend it to others with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased both the &amp;#34;L&#x27;Oreal Advanced EXTREME Repair&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;L&#x27;Oreal Advanced Total Repair 5&amp;#34; because they are both yellow bottles, and they often get mixed up or categorized together at the drug store. I always get two bottles of conditioner for every one bottle of shampoo, because my hair is really long. I wasn&#x27;t sure if they were supposed to be the same thing in the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am wondering if the Total Repair 5 was updated with the new formula to the Extreme Repair. Many of you may be like me, and wondering which one to buy, so this review is a play-by-play comparison of the two conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is that the smell is different, and the Total Repair 5 conditioner is much thinner consistency than the Extreme. It smells good- it&#x27;s a very salon-type smell. It reminds me of the thinner consistency of Pantene conditioners. Normally, I do not like thin conditioners, because I feel like I am not getting hydrated enough, but I did not feel that way when I applied this conditioner in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is easy to brush when wet, which is always a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell right away that my hair is drying faster than it did compared to when I used the Extreme Repair, probably because it is not as thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that it&#x27;s dry, my hair looks SO shiny and healthy. I&#x27;m actually shocked, because I normally do not get any shine in my hair until I put in argon oil. There are little-to-no frizzies. I really love how my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think that the EXTREME conditioner is more of a deep conditioner that you may only want to use once a week, where the Total Repair 5 is a better every-day conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have bleach blonde chemically damaged long hair so I bought this to help treat my very dry damaged looking hair. I also have the shampoo. After first use I could tell right after I got out of the shower my hair felt so soft! Later when it had dried it looked so much healthier and shiny I was shocked. I still use and love it.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the conditioner that comes with the hair color!  Excellent conditioner for our hair.  Try this product!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner so much. It helps my hair not dry out and it makes it feel all soft and smooth. I recommend it completely.</li>
            <li> omg, this conditioner is awesome. I ordered it with the shampoo and erasing balm, and I love it so does everyone else. it leaves your hair silky, shiny and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> At first, this product really made my hair look happy, shinier and feel smoother. But, now that i have been using both the conditioners and the shampoos together, my hair has become much drier than usual, and much harder to straighten as well. My hair is very thick, curly, and long, and it has Also started falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t for everyone! ;) but it seems to work for alot of other people.</li>
            <li> I started using this weeks before I colored my hair and was wowed by how silky my hair felt. After I colored my hair, I have continued using it because it is for damaged hair.  It continues to feel great and I also like the smell.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever written a 5-star review for a hair product -- but I have to share my experience.  I color my drab hair (2 colors in heavy streaks), then highlight around the front for drama.  Needless to say, it was dry looking, and stiff at the ends so it did not fall gently into the cut, especially the ends which tended to stick out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried these two!  The change was immediate!  First I noticed that it seemed softer and smoother even when wet.  Then when it dried, it was the same!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion my hairdresser had was not to over-rinse any conditioner.  First rinse around the face line and then lift that hair out of the way, and rinse underneath at the back/behind the ears.  But I was using her technique on other conditioners and it did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This combo ROCKS!!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m generally not a fan of silicone&#x27;s as it wears my fragile 4c strands over time but it has it uses, specifically when i plan on heat styling or during extremely dry/cold months. either way, i&#x27;ve been hearing a lot of about l&#x27;oreal total repair/advanced hair care line and have been dying to test out this conditioner, the erasing balm, and the total repair extreme. my hair isn&#x27;t incredibly damaged; i keep it in two strand twits or crochet braids 99% of the time and have made a routine consisting of twice weekly co-washing/aloe, glycerin +rosemary oil spritz, weekly dc&#x27;s, and i&#x27;ve created my own hair butter and oil spray for sealing. nonetheless, about two or so months ago i lightened my hair with peroxide/baking soda after an unsuccessful attempt at flat ironing/frying my hair so my hair isn&#x27;t in the most ideal state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anywho, back to the topic at hand, this conditioner. i purchased two of those little $1 samples at target about two weeks ago and finally got to using it tonight. just, WOW. i left it on in an almost unbearably steamy shower for about 5 minutes and rinsed with lukewarm water. my hair has never been this soft after a conditioner, or at least not within in a matter of minutes. i&#x27;ve been usings suaves natural paraben/silicone/sulfate free conditioner as my cowash for a long while now and i don&#x27;t think i can ever go back... despite the silicone&#x27;s. my ends, my previously fried, crispy feeling ends are soft and silky to the touch with that strength of healthy hair. after just one use my hair is hanging longer and my curls are clumping wonderfully. my hair feels buttery really, something i didn&#x27;t think was possible with my coarse strands. stubborn ends that are usually frizzy and unruly even after i cowash  seem rejuvenated and my curl pattern has returned on those pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;honestly im very surprised and ultimately pleased with my experience with this product. i signed on to amazon immediately to write a review and purchase a couple things for the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if your hair is in any state of damage, PLEASE, try this!!! it smells nice too ;-)s for the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if your hair is in any state of damage, PLEASE, try this!!! it smells nice too ;-)</li>
            <li> This is probably the best conditioner I have ever used. It is so great for keeping hair smooth, moisturized, and silky in between washes. Please buy!</li>
            <li> I could not believe how well this conditioner works.  I usually hate to use conditioner, so I normally don&#x27;t use it.  I decided to try this one and was amazed.  It made my hair really soft, easy to brush, and seems to be stronger.  Only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t smell very good.  I wish it came as a 2 in 1.</li>
            <li> I actually paid $3.99 for this at Meijer, along with the shampoo.  After I rinsed my hair, it felt like just like silk.  Also super shiny after a blow-dry, even without adding other styling products. I had none of the usual flyaway or frizziness, and I have super thick hair that I flat iron everyday and takes major abuse. Looks better already, and that&#x27;s after just one use. So far so good!!</li>
            <li> Not a good idea, and it didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair either. Felt coated. Would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this line since it first came out. I color and perm my hair so my hair is dry and frizzy and breaks off all the time. This shampoo-conditioner line leaves my hair so soft, shiny, and touchable. It never leaves it greasy or oily. I have NEVER used anything like it. I&#x27;m making sure to stay stocked up so if they happen to \\&quot;change\\&quot; it in any way, I&#x27;ll have a stockpile. IT&#x27;S THAT GOOD!</li>
            <li> move over pantene.  I have chemically processed hair.  This stuff in amazing,,I saw it in the store,,passed it up, saw it again on amazon, bought it..it is amazing.  It is like a professional conditioner, and I&#x27;ve used some pricey ones.  HIGHLY recommend for color treated hair or just damaged hair in general.  It would be TOO much for natural hair, but damaged hair, just drinks this up :) beautiful, soft and shiny! yay</li>
            <li> See above...........................................................The product for me makes oily hair so I only use it when I am not going out that day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  The glowing reviews were right; after I use it my shortish hair slides around on my head as if I toss it in the wind.  I have some concern that there is silicone in it but not sure.</li>
            <li> BUY THIS NOW!!  I mean right now, buy it.  It is AMAZING.  You will be a convert the day you try it.  Absolutely fantastic conditioner.  I will never waste money on Nexxus products again.  L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 Conditioner is the nicest, most effective conditioner ever.  My hair is dramatically softer, shinier, silkier and smoother when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to throw it out when I realized it was making my hair break off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, chemically processed hair and always need extra moisture, and conditioners and oils that control friz. This conditioner is amazing!  I used it with the shampoo and my hair feels so soft. I am able to comb through my hair without having to use my leave in treatments that I use after washing my hair. I still use them but the fact that I can comb through without, tells me how super soft this makes my fair. I could feel it in the shower, my hair felt silky. I will continue to use and buy this product, and the price is less that the Paul Mitchell and Matrix that I use, and my hair feels better.  So happy I found it, and thank you to all the informative reviews that helped me decide to give this a try. I hope my review helps others too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the perfect conditioner ever since Pantene changed the formula of their Beautiful Lengths line.  THIS IS IT!  The shampoo from this line leaves my hair clean and de-tangled with NO residue.  The conditioner leaves my hair a bit slick feeling afterward, which just adds to the softness once it&#x27;s dried.  I have very oily hair, but you could never tell after using these products.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo and conditioner for the first time last night and it is AMAZING! As soon as I got out of the shower i felt a huge difference in the way my hair felt! My hair is so soft, shiny, light feeling, and even after riding around with my windows down it is still not tangled! You can not beat this product,especially for the price, I love it!  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Rich conditioner used on dry white hair prevented frizz.</li>
            <li> I recieved a sample of this in the mail, and I&#x27;m SO SO SO glad I decided to use it! I usually put samples up for whenever I go on vacation... However, I&#x27;ve been itching to try this, as well as the matching shampoo. I used them both tonight, in the shower, and was surprised at how well I liked it. Smells wonderful! Not to heavy, though not too light. I was a tiny bit worried it would make my hair greasy.. I worried more when I got it in my hair and let it sit for 1-3 minutes as per the instructions. I coated my hair in this, root to tip which I NEVER do since my hair is oily, usually. When it was time to rinse, my hair felt slick, and I could comb my finger through it easily, making rinsing it out super easy. I have never been able to comb my fingers through wet hair without catching some tangles. It did take a little longer to rinse out than I would have liked, which is the only downfall. I waited til my hair completely dried to write a review, because, let&#x27;s face it.. you don&#x27;t really know how your hair looks until it&#x27;s dry. My hair is still extremely soft, and silky, and it smells amazing. It doesn&#x27;t look greasy or feel oily at all.. If only I could keep myself from touching it. lol!  I LOOOOOOVE this stuff! Definitely going to invest in the bottles.</li>
            <li> Most amazing stuff ever to me better then saloon stuff and price is way better too you can feel difference right away. Smells good feels good. And I have been bragging to al my friends to buy this product. Must buy.</li>
            <li> Fantastic conditioner.  Love the feel and smell.  I have the matching shampoo and deep conditioning balm (the balm is the BEST)!</li>
            <li> I used all 3 of this line. my hair started comming out, it dryed it up knotted it and sucked all the moisture out. i couldnt even straighten my hair the next day because it was so dry and brittle. i have waist length wavey hair this did not repair it it made it WORSE</li>
            <li> 3 stars because it does moisturize however I have brown hair with blonde highlights and after using this my hair looks totally brown!</li>
            <li> Overpriced on Amazon, go to your local walmart or even a drug store. Conditioner works great, and doesn&#x27;t rely on gimmicks like coating your hair in a silicone-like substance. L&#x27;Oreal outspends on research and development.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit my hair was dry and hard. I was looking for a good conditioner and I found it! This Total Repair 5 works wonders and I&#x27;m already on my second bottle of it. I won&#x27;t use nothing else for quite awhile, if ever! My dry hard hair has really switched it up on me because now it&#x27;s silky smooth and pretty again! I&#x27;m so happy I bought this! It&#x27;s really worth it!!</li>
