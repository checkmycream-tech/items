            <li>This is an excellent deodorant.</li>

            <li>Otherwise it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Tussy is light and cream deodorant, it is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The roll on is better</li>
            <li>She is a wonderful 95 year old friend and we live in a retirement community</li>
            <li>I coulnt find it at my local Walgreens and happily perchased it from here</li>
            <li>Love this deordorant very much</li>
            <li>The finger-tip application was cool too.</li>
            <li>Works great with rare underarm itching, but no rashes  Never strong underarm odor even when exercising</li>
            <li>I enjoy the cool confidence of feeling fresh thru out my daily tasks.</li>
            <li>This product is very gentle to my underarms and does not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>It smells light clean and has just enough &amp;#34;spice.&amp;#34; It provides protection regardless of the circumstance.</li>
            <li>The regular Tussy was much better.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;d like is for it to have a better dispenser.</li>
            <li>This is just a little different from what I remember but it is still a great deodorant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so she doesn&#x27;t get  out much and has to depend on others to do her shopping for her.</li>
            <li>Please go back to the original ingratiates for this deodorant.</li>
            <li>This is a classic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to do w/ a kitchen spatula &amp; can&#x27;t imagine having to go back to a different product.</li>
            <li>It is so hard to find this locally anymore &amp; is really such a great product.</li>
            <li>I recall first learning about it, as a child (about 35 years ago), when a visiting relative used this.</li>
            <li>Have used for years but find it more &amp; more difficult to find in the local stores.  </li>
            <li>My opinion is that it works too good and last too long, this produces less profit for the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>Tussy Cream Deodorant is hard to find at stores in this area of Arizona and glad this area had it.</li>
            <li>The lot I received of this item ( Tussy ) was complete garbage.</li>

            <li> The lot I received of this item ( Tussy ) was complete garbage.</li>
            <li> According to reports the product as been discontinued because it works too good and last too long; it has acid (it has base).  </li>
            <li> Tried to purchase in CVS and other stores</li>
            <li> The Tussy jars recieved were not creamy as previously purchsed in stores.</li>
            <li> The jars appear to have been on a shelf for a long period of time, as it was hard and created crusty lumps under the arms.</li>
            <li> Save your hard earned cash.</li>
            <li> Lately I could not find it in any stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge problem as you can use a repurposed Secret creme/gel container w/ all the holes in the lid;</li>
            <li> If this is how it must be bought, and the product in such bad shape, another deodorant will have to be found.</li>

            <li> i have used Tussy for over 40yrs. it has and still does a very good job for me.</li>
            <li> The lot I received of this item ( Tussy ) was complete garbage. It was not as I remember It to be. Save your hard earned cash.</li>
            <li> The Tussy jars recieved were not creamy as previously purchsed in stores. My wife has used this product for over 50 years and never experienced jars that were not creamy and smooth to use. The jars appear to have been on a shelf for a long period of time, as it was hard and created crusty lumps under the arms. Tried to purchase in CVS and other stores but theysaid it had to be purchased online. If this is how it must be bought, and the product in such bad shape, another deodorant will have to be found.</li>
            <li> This is just a little different from what I remember but it is still a great deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;It could not be found for years.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this product, but it should have gotten a different scent. I don&#x27;t care for the spice smell. Otherwise it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the cool confidence of feeling fresh thru out my daily tasks. I&#x27;d recommend to others by ordering online.</li>
            <li> Tussy Cream Deodorant is hard to find at stores in this area of Arizona and glad this area had it.</li>
            <li> Tussy is light and cream deodorant, it is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I coulnt find it at my local Walgreens and happily perchased it from here</li>
            <li> This is an excellent deodorant. It smells light clean and has just enough &amp;#34;spice.&amp;#34; It provides protection regardless of the circumstance. This is a classic. I recall first learning about it, as a child (about 35 years ago), when a visiting relative used this. She smelled great. The finger-tip application was cool too. Now, I opt for the roll-on.</li>
            <li> Have used for years but find it more &amp; more difficult to find in the local stores.  Thank heavens for Amazon.</li>
            <li> like this product chose it because i use it  yes i will recommend this product to anyone that ask about it</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had been looking for some of this product for months and couldn&#x27;t find any.  She is a wonderful 95 year old friend and we live in a retirement community so she doesn&#x27;t get  out much and has to depend on others to do her shopping for her. She had others looking for this   product for months and they couldn&#x27;t find any either. She mentioned it to me one morning and I   got on the internet and found it in about 5 minutes and ordered it for her. She is extremely happy  with the product and I am happy I found it for her.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 30 years. Lately I could not find it in any stores.Best deodorant on the market.Period!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hole as well as it use to, and it makes you itch under you arms. The regular Tussy was much better. Please go back to the original ingratiates for this deodorant.</li>
            <li> 1.  Have used for almost 60 yrs&lt;br /&gt;2.  Works great with rare underarm itching, but no rashes  Never strong underarm odor even when exercising&lt;br /&gt;3.  According to reports the product as been discontinued because it works too good and last too long; it has acid (it has base).  My opinion is that it works too good and last too long, this produces less profit for the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Recommend enthusiastically, but doubt company will reconsider discontinuance.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen this deodorant in ages  works well</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find this locally anymore &amp; is really such a great product. The only thing I&#x27;d like is for it to have a better dispenser. It&#x27;s not a huge problem as you can use a repurposed Secret creme/gel container w/ all the holes in the lid; which makes this the best deodorant out there. It&#x27;s easy to do w/ a kitchen spatula &amp; can&#x27;t imagine having to go back to a different product. I went to this after having tried to go w/ natural/organic deodorants that just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This product is very gentle to my underarms and does not cause any irritation. Love this deordorant very much and I plan to continue ordering it since I cannot find in stores.</li>
            <li> Just like I remembered.</li>
            <li> The roll on is better</li>
    </ol>
