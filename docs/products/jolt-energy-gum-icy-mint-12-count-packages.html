            <li>I&#x27;m sure my patients appreciate that I don&#x27;t have &amp;</li>
            <li>This gun tastes delicious, but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t contain enough caffeine to help keep me awake while driving.</li>
            <li>Maybe 2 is the magic number.  </li>
            <li>Gum is tougher than most gums</li>
            <li>I have purchased this gum many times.</li>
            <li>I love this gum</li>
            <li>And this is the better flavor of it.  </li>
            <li>but I can understand how this would be better for a lot of people.</li>
            <li>If you love caffeine it should be in the arsenal.</li>
            <li>The caffeine level isn&#x27;t too strong</li>
            <li>It does lose it&#x27;s flavor after about 10 minutes, but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>and I really do feel more energetic.  </li>
            <li>I love this gum and cannot say good enough things about it!</li>
            <li>I love the taste and it was delivered fast</li>
            <li>Overall, good product.</li>
            <li>It tastes good enough.</li>
            <li>Paying full price per pack at a gas station would be a 2</li>
            <li>the delivery was great no waiting endlessly to get it</li>
            <li>Gives a boost quickly.</li>
            <li>Alert gum might not taste very good, but it at least does the job.</li>
            <li>The best thing to have when you are tired.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>No longer on ThinkGeek, where it rightfully belonged, I&#x27;m thankful that I can get my caffeine fix right here on Amazon, for the time being.</li>
            <li>This is true of any caffeinated gum most likely.</li>
            <li>A consistent dose helps me regulate my caffeine intake.</li>
            <li>This stuff really helps me get through the gym doors at some ungodly hours!</li>
            <li>This gum certainly helps keep you awake.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find most places were we live in the central valley.</li>
            <li>A nice little office energy boost.</li>
            <li>It gets caffeine into your system so much faster than an energy drink.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t drink coffee,so the jolt of caffeine really keeps me moving.  </li>
            <li>My whole family uses it now.</li>
            <li>I need about three pieces to really do much.</li>
            <li>and really don&#x27;t want to deal with an energy drink/shot.</li>
            <li>Jolt really helps boost my energy slump in the afternoon.  </li>
            <li>Like the other version better</li>
            <li>Additionally, if you chew as much Jolt Gum per day as I did, the Newly Added B Vitamins are ingested at Toxic Levels!  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;New Flavor\\&quot; is Aabsolutely Intolerable!</li>
            <li>The main thing to keep in mind, this will not give you sustained energy.</li>
            <li>Hard to find Coffee Gum is much better for you than those addicting power drinks!</li>
            <li>As with all mild stimulants, moderate use is advised.</li>
            <li>it packed a little more punch though.</li>
            <li>This gum does the trick and buying the box is far more cost-efficient than buying individual packages locally.</li>
            <li>This gum is really sweet and not very minty.</li>
            <li>I use these nearly every day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost ready for my next order!</li>
            <li>It helps give me a little zing to get through the rest of the day without having a full cup of coffee.</li>
            <li>I personally rather drink an energy drink but the gum is good when you are unable too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying Jolt gum for years, ever since I decided during a long commute fueled by cold, acidic coffee that there must be a better caffeine delivery system available somewhere.</li>
            <li>As an RN in a busy L and D unit there are times when I&#x27;m starting to fade and don&#x27;t have time to sit and drink a soda or cup of coffee.  </li>
            <li>To much sugar and no real kick</li>
            <li>but I have no regrets.  </li>
            <li>He said that 3 pieces left him jittery, while I don&#x27;t think that a single piece did much for me.  </li>
            <li>Like the caffeine high but not the bitter coffee taste?</li>

            <li> Buying a big box only adds to the convenience, and it&#x27;s a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> bought this gums for some energy but felt nothing coffee works better taste was not that bad would not buy again</li>
            <li> Tastes close to other gum&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 5 due to price.</li>
            <li> Taste is slightly off, but that is expected form the caffeine&lt;</li>
            <li> A little bitter after taste, but I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I drink less tea and coffee now and quit the monster.</li>
            <li> Once you chew it for a few minutes it tastes bitter,it taste like drinking an energy drink.</li>
            <li> Overnight Trucking in a SlooOoo 63 MPH truck for a few hundred miles can be DEADLY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve chewed hundreds of packs of Jolt Gum over the past few years.</li>
            <li> I usually need to pop like 4 at a time to feel anything although I like chewing gum so it still going to be used up.  </li>
            <li> The caffeine is contained in the hard shell.</li>
            <li> Loses its flavor within 20 mins</li>
            <li> A little expensive for how I use it</li>
            <li> Tasty, sometimes my energy/awake level lags behind my gum chewing, but whatever, it&#x27;s jolt gum,</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t get tired again until you take it out of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re really tired, stop and get a cup of coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sadly, Jolt Gum is No Longer in My Life</li>
            <li> After that is gone, the caffeine is gone and you are chewing on a gum base.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy it again, but my wife prefers RockStar Gum</li>
            <li> Tasty, sometimes my energy/awake level lags behind my gum chewing, but whatever, it&#x27;s jolt gum, right? I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> The best thing to have when you are tired. it wakes you up and you don&#x27;t get tired again until you take it out of your mouth.  This is great for traveling, but it does not work if you drink a lot of caffeine.</li>
            <li> I love the taste and it was delivered fast</li>
            <li> this product gives me the extra energy that I need without the jitters that come along with my using caffine products!</li>
            <li> this is a very good product, but could improve on the taste.  the delivery was great no waiting endlessly to get it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read may studies on the improvement  in memory, alertness and concentration from both chewing gum and peppermint scents/flavors.  The extra caffeine is an even bigger bonus!  As an RN in a busy L and D unit there are times when I&#x27;m starting to fade and don&#x27;t have time to sit and drink a soda or cup of coffee.  I couple pieces of Jolt and I really do feel more energetic.  The caffeine level isn&#x27;t too strong so I don&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;wired&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m sure my patients appreciate that I don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;coffee breath&amp;#34; either!  It does lose it&#x27;s flavor after about 10 minutes, but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> I love this gum and cannot say good enough things about it! I will always keep one in each car for that emergency energy that we all need!</li>
            <li> I use these nearly every day. It gets caffeine into your system so much faster than an energy drink.</li>
            <li> bought this gums for some energy but felt nothing coffee works better taste was not that bad would not buy again</li>
            <li> This gun tastes delicious, but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t contain enough caffeine to help keep me awake while driving. Alert gum might not taste very good, but it at least does the job.</li>
            <li> This gum is great when I don&#x27;t want coffee. I also chew two pieces before a run. Great pick-me-up from an afternoon slump</li>
            <li> 😃it works,especially while traveling.  I don&#x27;t drink coffee,so the jolt of caffeine really keeps me moving.  tastes good as well</li>
            <li> I regularly purchase this product for my husband, who tends to fall asleep at the wheel. It works great for him. I do not personally use it bc I don not like the taste, but if you need to be awake, this is for you!</li>
            <li> We got this gum last week - my husband and I both took a pack.  He said that 3 pieces left him jittery, while I don&#x27;t think that a single piece did much for me.  Maybe 2 is the magic number.  This gum is really sweet and not very minty.</li>
            <li> Like the soda of the same name, this gum seems to be disappearing from everywhere it once found a home. No longer on ThinkGeek, where it rightfully belonged, I&#x27;m thankful that I can get my caffeine fix right here on Amazon, for the time being.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this stuff for years, just found out it was available on Amazon! I&#x27;m almost ready for my next order!</li>
            <li> Husband is a truck driver he loves this gum. Can&#x27;t find most places were we live in the central valley.</li>
            <li> This gum certainly helps keep you awake. Here are some of the pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Caffeine is present and works&lt;br /&gt;- Tastes close to other gum&lt;br /&gt;- Relatively inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;- Good packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Gum is tougher than most gums&lt;br /&gt;- Loses its flavor within 20 mins&lt;br /&gt;- Taste is slightly off, but that is expected form the caffeine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a good product. The main thing to keep in mind, this will not give you sustained energy. The caffeine is contained in the hard shell. After that is gone, the caffeine is gone and you are chewing on a gum base. This is true of any caffeinated gum most likely. Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, tastes good.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this gum many times. Great taste.  It gives me a boost of energy in the middle of the day or while driving.</li>
            <li> Easier to carry than an energy drink, and nearly as effective. I still prefer an energy drink for a big pick-me-up, but for those times when a drink isn&#x27;t an option, this gum is my second choice. And it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than buying a drink. It tastes good enough. Not amazingly delicious, but not awful. I&#x27;m very happy with it, and would buy it again. Buying a big box only adds to the convenience, and it&#x27;s a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Jolt gum for years, ever since I decided during a long commute fueled by cold, acidic coffee that there must be a better caffeine delivery system available somewhere. Google led me to Jolt Gum. My whole family uses it now. We buy the multi-packs and keep them in the pantry. We like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I chew 1 piece a day after lunch hour at work. It helps give me a little zing to get through the rest of the day without having a full cup of coffee. Both flavors are tasty, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Like the other version better</li>
            <li> Works great and tastes pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love this gum it is awesome best energy gum I ever had definitely will keep buying this!!!!!!!!!!!!! Outstanding for real give it a try!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great price! Flavor only lasts about 30 min then turns to rubber. It&#x27;s a 5 due to price. Paying full price per pack at a gas station would be a 2</li>
            <li> To much sugar and no real kick</li>
            <li> Jolt has a great taste for being a caffeine delivery gum. I do wish thay it packed a little more punch though. I need about three pieces to really do much. If you&#x27;re really tired, stop and get a cup of coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not complaining though. It&#x27;s a gum that you can actually chew for enjoyment, and although it is not for kids, I don&#x27;t think that it would be the end of the world if your kid accidentally got ahold of a piece.</li>
            <li> My wife is not a big fan of coffee but often needs caffeine.  This gum does the trick and buying the box is far more cost-efficient than buying individual packages locally.</li>
            <li> I use this when I need it. It came fresh, good taste, all happy and zippy! Would by from again.</li>
            <li> Like the caffeine high but not the bitter coffee taste? This gum is perfect for you! And this is the better flavor of it.  Personally, I still prefer a cup of coffee but I can understand how this would be better for a lot of people.</li>
            <li> A little bitter after taste, but I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Just what I need for an afternoon pickup. I&#x27;m not a coffee drinker so this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> It taste good, it gives me a boost when I need it. I drink less tea and coffee now and quit the monster. It&#x27;s quite convenient to carry around instead of the coffee cup. A consistent dose helps me regulate my caffeine intake. If you love caffeine it should be in the arsenal. Also check out foosh mints if you don&#x27;t like to chew gum</li>
            <li> A nice little office energy boost.</li>
            <li> I usually need to pop like 4 at a time to feel anything although I like chewing gum so it still going to be used up.  A little expensive for how I use it but I have no regrets.  Shipper was good</li>
            <li> A handy jolt when driving.  Flavor does not last long and the end result is yucky but you are not buying this for flavor.</li>
            <li> Overnight Trucking in a SlooOoo 63 MPH truck for a few hundred miles can be DEADLY! Hard to find Coffee Gum is much better for you than those addicting power drinks! As with all mild stimulants, moderate use is advised. Good product but nothing beats a good ol power nap in a safe place off the highway!</li>
            <li> Good for a quick burst of energy when you can&#x27;t get to a cup o&#x27; joe and really don&#x27;t want to deal with an energy drink/shot. Stays in my purse at all times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve chewed hundreds of packs of Jolt Gum over the past few years. The \\&quot;New Flavor\\&quot; is Aabsolutely Intolerable! Additionally, if you chew as much Jolt Gum per day as I did, the Newly Added B Vitamins are ingested at Toxic Levels!  Sadly, Jolt Gum is No Longer in My Life</li>
            <li> Jolt really helps boost my energy slump in the afternoon.  It keeps me going!</li>
            <li> This stuff really helps me get through the gym doors at some ungodly hours!</li>
            <li> Jolt gum taste good at first! Once you chew it for a few minutes it tastes bitter,it taste like drinking an energy drink. I personally rather drink an energy drink but the gum is good when you are unable too</li>
            <li> Tastes good.  Gives a boost quickly.</li>
