            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my hair feel with some smoothing included.</li>
            <li>I was able to go over 48 hours with straight hair and no frizzy!!!</li>
            <li>and I can very easily brush it back to straight and perfect.</li>
            <li>my opinion the formulation is fantastic and I rate this product A+.</li>
            <li>I got it today and used it the same way she did and it worked great</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product</li>
            <li>my curls were so amazing and soft and looked like when I was a kid all over again</li>
            <li>, I just know it for sure didnt weigh my locks down, and my hair jas good volume when I use it when blow-drying</li>
            <li>Although I wasn&#x27;t too satisfied with the highlights because you can hardly see them, almost as if they don&#x27;t exist, I was happy with how she made my hair curl, with my own natural curls.</li>
            <li>scent.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your hair super soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>THIS Stuff REALLY WORKS!!</li>
            <li>All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li>It exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be ordering more of it.</li>
            <li>None were able to work the curls just came back.</li>
            <li>and she really trimmed it!</li>
            <li>It takes away the frizz for sure but as for staying straight, it was the same outcome as if I were to straighten it without using the product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it will hold totally straight when it is over the top humid out, but it does a very good job of helping to maintain straight style under impossible conditions....</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very knotty tho</li>
            <li>I have curly, wavy hair and this made my hair very brittle.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed..</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li>Worked very well except seemed to change the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>I did EVERYTHING I could to keep my hair straight, blow drier, straightener, hair cap.</li>
            <li>This really helps alot in the moistness of Seattle</li>
            <li>This product gets my hair straight with just blow drying and using a paddle brush.  </li>
            <li>It really is humidity resistant.  </li>
            <li>and it is still straight.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t look like the length was taken off too much just the layers.</li>
            <li>, it just dries, frizzes and stays straight and nappy.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do what it says.</li>
            <li>I still have frizz and my hair really isn&#x27;t that straight after using this product.</li>
            <li>I have pretty curly hair, and my hair is really sensitive to both heat, and humidity, but also inclined to get weighed down if a product I use before blow-drying has too much oil, this is fairly light compared to other \\&quot;Straight\\&quot; Serums, It smells good and seems to help w/ humidity..</li>
            <li>Great product but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight hair naturally with a lot of flyaways</li>
            <li>basically, she cut my hair, colored the whole head to match one color, then put 7 foils in it of high lights.</li>
            <li>I am usually very hesitant on trying new products on my hair.</li>
            <li>so I find myself to be particularly picky.  </li>
            <li>When I use this cream my hair stays soft and straight.</li>
            <li>so I wanted a new look.</li>
            <li>With it, my usually wavy hair stays nice and straight all day long.  </li>
            <li>o the bottle it clearly states it controls 98% of humidity.</li>
            <li>It leaves my curls defined yet soft - no crunchiness.</li>
            <li>Since my hair is naturally curly, (like shirley temple curly)</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and usually products will give it the so called &amp;#34;dirty</li>
            <li>Only downfall is its very sticky so only use on damp hair if you use on dry hair it will be very greasy.</li>
            <li>I use in conjunction w/ other \\&quot;Bed-Head products, so cant say where it comes in exactly</li>
            <li>and I can barely pull a brush through it.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and wavy naturally.  </li>

            <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair straighter than any other product I have tried. Makes my hair very knotty tho</li>
            <li> I like this product wish it was in a bigger size for the price I paid for it but it works</li>
            <li> I work in a salon, I use all types of frizz control anti humidity creams, and I was not satisfied with this at all in my hair. I noticed my hair was fizzy once I finished styling it, and the minute I was outside and the humidity hit, it became wavy and also got a crease from just holding it with my hand to the side.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product but it did not give me the results I hoped for. I have curly, wavy hair and this made my hair very brittle. It takes away the frizz for sure but as for staying straight, it was the same outcome as if I were to straighten it without using the product. Very dissapointed..</li>
            <li> This was the BEST humidity defying serum I have ever used. It exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be ordering more of it. I was able to go over 48 hours with straight hair and no frizzy!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much.  Great product but a little goes a long way.  My stylist introduced me to this product.</li>
            <li> Love it but was wondering if you have to use a blow drier</li>
            <li> This is the absolute BEST product I have ever used on my hair. I have very long spiral curls. I put this in my hair after I squeeze excess water out - comb it through and then let my hair air dry. It leaves my curls defined yet soft - no crunchiness. It has heat protection in it, and I do use the Bed Head Rock N Roller when my hair is dry. For any of you who have spiral curls but want beautiful waves - try the Rock N Roller. Totally amazing!!  By the way, I also use Tigi S Factor before I use the Roller for added shine.</li>
            <li> Product was opened and spilled everywhere when I received it!</li>
            <li> I have pretty curly hair, and my hair is really sensitive to both heat, and humidity, but also inclined to get weighed down if a product I use before blow-drying has too much oil, this is fairly light compared to other \\&quot;Straight\\&quot; Serums, It smells good and seems to help w/ humidity.. I use in conjunction w/ other \\&quot;Bed-Head products, so cant say where it comes in exactly, I just know it for sure didnt weigh my locks down, and my hair jas good volume when I use it when blow-drying</li>
            <li> THIS Stuff REALLY WORKS!! SOOO Glad I FOUND this PRODUCT!! It&#x27;s PERFECT for the Summer Time Humidity!!  Thank you TIGI!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought this from Amazon yet but I will be soon. I have very straight hair naturally with a lot of flyaways and I wouldn&#x27;t need this every day but I use it when it&#x27;s windy or raining. When my hair gets blown around or wet it tangles and I can barely pull a brush through it. When I use this cream my hair stays soft and straight. I will not spend a day on the Oregon coast without this now! My hair will blow around for hours and I can very easily brush it back to straight and perfect. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I am usually very hesitant on trying new products on my hair. I have a degree in chemistry and an extensive background in formulating cosmetics so I find myself to be particularly picky.  I have to say that this product keeps it&#x27;s promise, and I will never blow dry without it. I had purchased it in a store and paid a few dollars more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It smells fantastic-almost like a fruity scent.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your hair super soft.&lt;br /&gt;Gives it strength so I can see that less hair falls out during my normal blow-dry&lt;br /&gt;Helps give hold so that the blow-dry lasts longer and straighter.&lt;br /&gt;Does not weigh hair down- I have fine hair and usually products will give it the so called &amp;#34;dirty look&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t dry hair out it helps to retain moisture.&lt;br /&gt;**Basically this is what you need if your looking for a product to give hold and shape to your hair so that it doesn&#x27;t curl up the second you leave the house.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion the formulation is fantastic and I rate this product A+.</li>
            <li> It seems to damage my hair. I did not like it at all. I will not ever buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Only downfall is its very sticky so only use on damp hair if you use on dry hair it will be very greasy. All in all very good product works well smells good. I would recommend using biosilk after as well good combo for this :)</li>
            <li> Worked very well except seemed to change the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> This product was horrible... My hair is curly so I wanted a new look. I did EVERYTHING I could to keep my hair straight, blow drier, straightener, hair cap. None were able to work the curls just came back. I give it a two star because it does smo</li>
            <li> This really helps alot in the moistness of Seattle</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My hair is long and wavy naturally.  I hate to use the flat iron because it does so my damage to your hair.  This product gets my hair straight with just blow drying and using a paddle brush.  No need to use the flat iron.  It really is humidity resistant.  I can go without washing my hair the following day too.  Just blow out again and it is still straight.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This product worked great for me.  Do not over apply tho.  It only take a small amount.... of course I have very short hair so use according to your hair style.  I can&#x27;t say it will hold totally straight when it is over the top humid out, but it does a very good job of helping to maintain straight style under impossible conditions....</li>
            <li> Hate the way my hair feels when I use this</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been trying to let me hair grow out long, ive been avoiding dying it and my ends are disgusting. I went to the salon a few days ago to get it trimmed and she really trimmed it! she took a lot off but it didn&#x27;t look like the length was taken off too much just the layers. Since my hair is naturally curly, (like shirley temple curly) I always straighten it. She told me she can tell I straighten it because the ends looked melted and fired. I told her I like my curly hair but it just doesn&#x27;t curl like it used too, it just dries, frizzes and stays straight and nappy. I also have grey hairs I wanted covered up but was too scared to put any color on it because I don&#x27;t wanna keep damaging it. basically, she cut my hair, colored the whole head to match one color, then put 7 foils in it of high lights. Although I wasn&#x27;t too satisfied with the highlights because you can hardly see them, almost as if they don&#x27;t exist, I was happy with how she made my hair curl, with my own natural curls. She used the bed head leave in cream conditioner (pink bottle) then put this stuff over my hair. she told me I want to get stuff that&#x27;s going to coat my curls from being damaged by the sun and humidity and o the bottle it clearly states it controls 98% of humidity. my curls were so amazing and soft and looked like when I was a kid all over again I had to buy some. I got it today and used it the same way she did and it worked great I will be continuing to buy this product as long as its around.</li>
            <li> Used this before and thought that I could do without it in the Florida humidity.  Without it, my hair frizzed up the minute I walked out the door.  With it, my usually wavy hair stays nice and straight all day long.  This product works for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do what it says. I still have frizz and my hair really isn&#x27;t that straight after using this product.</li>
            <li> Was a little slow getting here</li>
            <li> Been using this for a while.  Love how it makes my hair feel with some smoothing included.</li>
