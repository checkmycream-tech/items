            <li>I really enjoy the great quality of this brush.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>awesome packaging, very convienant&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li>Very nice brush, incredibly soft and great for travel or just keeping in your purse, since it&#x27;s retractable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many many kabuki brushes and i liked the reviews of this brush.  </li>
            <li>size but love the softness of the brush</li>
            <li>Love the collapsable lid and protection it provided to the brush during travel.</li>
            <li>I love how the brush retracts &amp; has a cap.</li>
            <li>Plus, it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks of makeup on the inside of my bag (possibly its best feature).</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS KABUKI BRUSH</li>
            <li>A CUTE HELLO KITTY BARBIE KABUKI BRUSH.(AND GIRLY</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>For the investment, this should be much much better.  </li>
            <li>I also love how it has a cover, so that works well when traveling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an all-around great brush.</li>
            <li>can try any brush you like, but this is the one you&#x27;ll love-</li>
            <li>Simply ... Amazing!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft as all get out and the coverage it provides is even and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Purchase from amazon to get the real and good quality ones.</li>
            <li>love the fact that it is &amp;#34;retractable&amp;#34; which isn&#x27;t 100% true but still it does the job which is why I was looking for something for taking around.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is more like a finishing brush instead of a full coverage Kabuki.</li>
            <li>This brush is so cute, sonia kashuk brushes are better, but this is really soft and easy to carry!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brush as far as the materials, size, and durability goes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and the right size and applies beautifully with the mineral foundation</li>
            <li>Very useful to take when</li>
            <li>I would recommend not trying to save the 3 dollars and buy direct or from a more reputable source.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean... portable... super cute... and VERY soft.</li>
            <li>Soft, holds the powder, and spreads it on nicely</li>
            <li>soft (honestly sometimes I just like to rub it on my face)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best kabuki brush out there, since I&#x27;ve only ever tried the Bare Minerals full coverage kabuki brush</li>
            <li>Authentic and so soft!!!</li>
            <li>also bought a great deal of other brushes-</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly worried about the quality of materials used to make this product though, as per the reviews I&#x27;m sure it performs just as well as any other non-professional brush would.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a pretty fantastic make-up brush.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations after reading reviews and was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>I fixed it with some super glue and am able to use it.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I looked into trying to get a travel friendly kabuki brush and found this one with high reviews and thought that I had found the one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I personally prefer the flat-top to the kabuki in terms of shape, but this one&#x27;s really quite nice.</li>
            <li>I bought my first one in France in 2009</li>
            <li>Nice and soft, no loose fibers fall out when using it.</li>
            <li>great cruelty free brush - don&#x27;t know how they did it, but this company has found the solution to make synthetic soft enough to use for pressed and loose powered makeup.</li>
            <li>it is really soft, but the whole thing just feels kind of cheap compared to other retractable brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Thick/full brush, not stingy at all&lt;br /&gt;-Small enough to easily carry around in my purse</li>
            <li>I will agree that this brush is soft to the touch but is shed the very first use.</li>
            <li>It is extremely soft and exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Really picks up the product and gets it evenly on your skin.</li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>In their defense I did not complain as it was too much of a hazel for me.  </li>
            <li>Very compact and durable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brush, but smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft, compact, and high quality.</li>
            <li>some small enough or retractable for travel, and many, many others which were intended for home use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it will continue to be my main applicator)</li>
            <li>the one I recently received was very light and cheap, the top wouldnt stay on either, I guess they are cutting corners on the way they are making it now.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly soft and I&#x27;d certainly use them if I used make-up brushes.</li>
            <li>bristles falling out, no complaints, no points retracted, no negative anything to say about this brush.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I use this with Bare Minerals Original foundation, and it is the only brush</li>
            <li>Have to be soooooooo careful that no water enters the roots whilst ensuring all the bristles are clean....</li>
            <li>This is hands down the softest brush I own, and it lives inside my travel makeup bag, when it&#x27;s not busy earning</li>
            <li>The brush itself was very soft</li>
            <li>This brush is soooo soft!</li>
            <li>Its a superbly soft brush.</li>
            <li>It is so so soft and there is no &amp;#34;prickle&amp;#34; to it.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, give this a try.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is price--I really feel like,</li>
            <li>The brush is extremely soft and plyable.</li>
            <li>but I dont know how long it would last if the outside was as cheap as it felt.</li>
            <li>so you can carry it in a bag and not mess up the bristles.</li>
            <li>is the brush, out of no less than dozens of them, that I use every time I apply my powder.</li>
            <li>So i use bare minerals foundation.  </li>
            <li>But i come to find that, while the bristles are soft and long, there are not enough of them!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using it for a year and a half with no noticeable change in the bristles, and the whole retractable thing was definitely a bonus the handful of times I&#x27;ve traveled with it.</li>
            <li>although it&#x27;s certainly a brush worth having, it is expensive for just the one brush.</li>

            <li> although it&#x27;s certainly a brush worth having, it is expensive for just the one brush.</li>
            <li> On the second use, one of the metal parts came loose and without realizing it, I scraped my face because the brush did not retract, and I was in a hurry dashing in between meetings.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, how did I not write a review on this when I first bought it?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its smaller than expected and arrived all busted up.</li>
            <li> The silver and pink part at the bottom of the brush wasn&#x27;t glued well enough and it slid off as soon as I opened it.</li>
            <li> I will ever purchase so long as they don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
            <li> almost every single day singe</li>
            <li> SO now I have four, five loose pieces.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was definitely disappointed when I tried to use it and found that although it is definitely as soft as many stated, it was definitely not a full as I would have liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The metal parts are thin, single layered and aren&#x27;t secured together very well.</li>
            <li> this little kabuki brush is SO SOFT and has lasted me quite a few months.</li>
            <li> The retractable metal guard is very loose</li>
            <li> This brush is not what I expected in terms of quality.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a few years back</li>
            <li> All of it just seems very loosely put together.</li>
            <li> Only had it a little while; the metal insert has fallen out!</li>
            <li> I wanted this brush to travel with me and have used a similar brush in the past.  </li>
            <li> and I tried other cheaper brushs like Eco brushes, Shanny , and ELF but nothing</li>
            <li> but the part that slides down when the lid comes off is very loose.  </li>
            <li> love this brush, just wish it would extend longer, has a short nubby base, seems small even for&lt;br /&gt;full</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned at least three other Kabuki brushes and they&#x27;ve all either shed or have shown wear and tear in a very short amount time.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find any collapsable brushes in stores such as ulta or sephora</li>
            <li> I have read multiple instances of dropping or long term use leading to a broken brush.</li>
            <li> Ruins the point of having a rectractable brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s odd.  </li>
            <li> Not cool at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li> My brush came out of the holder after a few days.  </li>
            <li> it is not a full thick brush, but a rather thin powder applying brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little too expensive but I like it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a tough retractable brush, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Would have been 5 stars if mind hadn&#x27;t come broken.</li>
            <li> Came broken and the picture is not what it looked like at all</li>
            <li> Poor quality mine came in broken all in pieces.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the item I received came broken.  </li>
            <li> sorry.</li>
            <li> This was disappointing tbh.  </li>
            <li> I am also disappointed in the lack of bristle density.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love this brush, just wish it would extend longer, has a short nubby base, seems small even for&lt;br /&gt;full size but love the softness of the brush</li>
            <li> I bought this kabuki brush for my girlfriend for xmas. I had never seen it before, so I went into Ulta to take a closer look. TBH it is really soft, but the whole thing just feels kind of cheap compared to other retractable brushes. Keep in mind, I have no idea how well it works, this review is based on aesthetics and manufacturing quality.   The metal parts are thin, single layered and aren&#x27;t secured together very well. The retractable metal guard is very loose so it slides around and rattles when I move the brush as if it were in use. I have read multiple instances of dropping or long term use leading to a broken brush. I would definitely not want to drop this brush, it feels fragile.   If you&#x27;re looking for a tough retractable brush, look elsewhere. I&#x27;m honestly worried about the quality of materials used to make this product though, as per the reviews I&#x27;m sure it performs just as well as any other non-professional brush would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase.  My brush came out of the holder after a few days.  Not even a week</li>
            <li> I like the brush. Its smaller than expected and arrived all busted up. I never actually got to use the retractable bit.</li>
            <li> I loveeeee this brush! It is extremely soft and exactly what I was looking for! Love the collapsable lid and protection it provided to the brush during travel. Have had no issues with quality or hairs falling out! Hard to find any collapsable brushes in stores such as ulta or sephora so I was very excited when this purchased worked out perfectly!</li>
            <li> Great little....fat stubby makeup brush...Too Faced Cosmetics Kabuki Brush, 2.2 Ounce....a good price and the color is nice and I like that it covered wit a top to take with you in your purse!~</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I needed something with the quality of a regular Kabuki brush, but the portability of... well, this. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I&#x27;ve used it almost every single day singe I bought it. I love how the brush retracts &amp; has a cap. I use the end of it, fully retracted, to concentrate bronzer on my cheekbones. Obviously I also use it open, as it&#x27;s meant to be used, for overall coverage. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks of makeup on the inside of my bag (possibly its best feature). I used to just toss my non-retractable, capless makeup brushes in with the rest of my makeup, but now that I&#x27;ve seen what can be, I&#x27;m solely buying brushes with caps and/or cases. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I looked into trying to get a travel friendly kabuki brush and found this one with high reviews and thought that I had found the one.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it is &amp;#34;retractable&amp;#34; which isn&#x27;t 100% true but still it does the job which is why I was looking for something for taking around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was definitely disappointed when I tried to use it and found that although it is definitely as soft as many stated, it was definitely not a full as I would have liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still hold onto it but only use it for applying touch up or a finishing powder only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(regarding the fullness, I have a buffer brush from MAC that is fuller than this one and it will continue to be my main applicator)</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS KABUKI BRUSH IT&#x27;S SOFT,STURDY,AND IT HANDLES MY POWDER GREAT. I SEEN THIS BRUSH AND IT WAS CALLING ME EVERY SINCE I LAYED MY EYES ON IT. IT LOOK&#x27;S LIKE A CUTE HELLO KITTY BARBIE KABUKI BRUSH.(AND GIRLY WHICH I AM). I USE THIS AFTER I PUT MY FOUNDATION ON AND SET MY POWDER. I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. WHEN IT TOUCHES MY FACE IT&#x27;S LIKE SILK. PLUS BUFFS IN THE POWDER PERFECT. BEST PART IT&#x27;S RETRACTABLE SO YOU WON&#x27;T DAMAGE IT OR GET ANY GERMS ON IT. BUY THIS KABUKI BRUSH!!! IM SAYING TO MYSELF \\&quot;WHY YOU DIDN&#x27;T BUY THIS EARLIER\\&quot;? LOL!! THANK&#x27;S TOO FACED!!</li>
            <li> Its a superbly soft brush. Very useful to take when travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is washing it. Have to be soooooooo careful that no water enters the roots whilst ensuring all the bristles are clean....</li>
            <li> Nice and soft, no loose fibers fall out when using it. I really enjoy the great quality of this brush.</li>
            <li> These were a gift and the recipient is very happy with them.  They are incredibly soft and I&#x27;d certainly use them if I used make-up brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush is not what I expected in terms of quality. I have Rosacea and find that if a brush is coarse or sheds it will aggravate the symptoms of Rosacea.  I will agree that this brush is soft to the touch but is shed the very first use. I am also disappointed in the lack of bristle density. It is more like a finishing brush instead of a full coverage Kabuki. For these reasons, I would not repurchase this brush.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a few years back and it was the greatest thing. So I wanted to buy one as a gift but the one I recently received was very light and cheap, the top wouldnt stay on either, I guess they are cutting corners on the way they are making it now. The brush itself was very soft but I dont know how long it would last if the outside was as cheap as it felt.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations after reading reviews and was not disappointed!  Great quality, no shedding.  It is in a nice swivel container, making it great for travel.</li>
            <li> I have the touchiest skin in the world and this is the only brush that doesn&#x27;t irritate it.  It is so so soft and there is no &amp;#34;prickle&amp;#34; to it.  If you have sensitive skin, give this a try.</li>
            <li> great cruelty free brush - don&#x27;t know how they did it, but this company has found the solution to make synthetic soft enough to use for pressed and loose powered makeup. Really picks up the product and gets it evenly on your skin.</li>
            <li> Lasted me 2.5 years! I&#x27;m just now having to replace it, and that&#x27;s only because it just started to shed after all this time. It&#x27;s super soft, compact, and high quality.</li>
            <li> So i use bare minerals foundation.  I&#x27;ve gone through many many kabuki brushes and i liked the reviews of this brush.  But i come to find that, while the bristles are soft and long, there are not enough of them!  it is not a full thick brush, but a rather thin powder applying brush.  not good for a medium to full coverage of foundation.  sorry.</li>
            <li> Would have been 5 stars if mind hadn&#x27;t come broken. Ruins the point of having a rectractable brush.</li>
            <li> Came broken and the picture is not what it looked like at all</li>
            <li> Very nice brush, incredibly soft and great for travel or just keeping in your purse, since it&#x27;s retractable. I personally prefer the flat-top to the kabuki in terms of shape, but this one&#x27;s really quite nice. My only gripe is price--I really feel like, although it&#x27;s certainly a brush worth having, it is expensive for just the one brush.</li>
            <li> Nice brush great for your purse makeup bag. Soft, holds the powder, and spreads it on nicely</li>
            <li> I wanted this brush to travel with me and have used a similar brush in the past.  On the second use, one of the metal parts came loose and without realizing it, I scraped my face because the brush did not retract, and I was in a hurry dashing in between meetings.  Not cool at all.  For the investment, this should be much much better.  SO now I have four, five loose pieces.</li>
            <li> I will forever have one of these Too Faced brushes for the rest of my life. I bought my first one in France in 2009 and i had it well over 3 years... it finally started falling apart and I tried other cheaper brushs like Eco brushes, Shanny , and ELF but nothing will compare to this Too Faced Kabuki Brush. This is a must have brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter. It feels absolutely wonderful! I also like the fact that it collapses so you can carry it in a bag and not mess up the bristles.</li>
            <li> This brush is soooo soft! I also love how it has a cover, so that works well when traveling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush, but smaller than I expected. I&#x27;m using it, but I wish it was a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> The silver and pink part at the bottom of the brush wasn&#x27;t glued well enough and it slid off as soon as I opened it. The brush is excellent though. It applies powder evenly and thoroughly!</li>
            <li> Kind of awkward to use.  Only had it a little while; the metal insert has fallen out!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a pretty fantastic make-up brush. It&#x27;s easy to clean... portable... super cute... and VERY soft. It&#x27;s an all-around great brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush earlier this year.  I really like Too Faced&#x27;s teddy bear brushes.  Unfortunately the item I received came broken.  I fixed it with some super glue and am able to use it.  I would recommend not trying to save the 3 dollars and buy direct or from a more reputable source.  I recommend the brush but cannot recommend he seller as the item came damaged.  In their defense I did not complain as it was too much of a hazel for me.  Just what I got from trying to get a good deal.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Very nice, beautiful presentation and very effective. It&#x27;s just a little too expensive but I like it.</li>
            <li> omg! dream bvrush! buying 4 more for my friends!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect brush for travel. It is protected by a collaspeable case. The brush is extremely soft and plyable. Came quickly. Product as expected/.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!! Authentic and so soft!!!</li>
            <li> Worth the money.  Very compact and durable.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush.  It&#x27;s soft as all get out and the coverage it provides is even and beautiful.  I&#x27;ve owned at least three other Kabuki brushes and they&#x27;ve all either shed or have shown wear and tear in a very short amount time.  Not this one.  No shedding whatsoever and still looks like it did the day I got it.  Don&#x27;t bother looking any further.  If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect Kabuki brush, you&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li> This was disappointing tbh.  It&#x27;s a good brush as far as the materials, size, and durability goes but the part that slides down when the lid comes off is very loose.  I haven&#x27;t had one like that before.... it&#x27;s odd.  All of it just seems very loosely put together.</li>
            <li> Reasons I like it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Thick/full brush, not stingy at all&lt;br /&gt;-Small enough to easily carry around in my purse&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely soft (honestly sometimes I just like to rub it on my face)</li>
            <li> Seriously, how did I not write a review on this when I first bought it?&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in September of 2012.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a great deal of other brushes- some small enough or retractable for travel, and many, many others which were intended for home use.&lt;br /&gt;This is the brush, out of no less than dozens of them, that I use every time I apply my powder. This is hands down the softest brush I own, and it lives inside my travel makeup bag, when it&#x27;s not busy earning it&#x27;s two-years-and-going-strong room and board.&lt;br /&gt;TWO YEARS of near-daily use, and I have ZERO complaints.&lt;br /&gt;No bristles falling out, no complaints, no points retracted, no negative anything to say about this brush.&lt;br /&gt;You can try any brush you like, but this is the one you&#x27;ll love- I can tell you this with all certainty, from personal experience.</li>
            <li> This brush is so cute, sonia kashuk brushes are better, but this is really soft and easy to carry! I always love toofaced products! Purchase from amazon to get the real and good quality ones.</li>
            <li> Poor quality mine came in broken all in pieces. Will return and not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Simply ... Amazing!!! A+</li>
            <li> Love this it works good!!!</li>
            <li> I use this with Bare Minerals Original foundation, and it is the only brush I will ever purchase so long as they don&#x27;t discontinue it. It&#x27;s super soft and the right size and applies beautifully with the mineral foundation and I&#x27;ve been using it for a year and a half with no noticeable change in the bristles, and the whole retractable thing was definitely a bonus the handful of times I&#x27;ve traveled with it. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best kabuki brush out there, since I&#x27;ve only ever tried the Bare Minerals full coverage kabuki brush and that&#x27;s it - but when the one I have now eventually kicks the bucket I see no need to look elsewhere for a brush.</li>
            <li> this little kabuki brush is SO SOFT and has lasted me quite a few months. awesome packaging, very convienant&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
