            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how good this stuff works.</li>
            <li>my brother and my brother had 2 girls come up to him saying he smelled really good.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t as good as it seemed</li>
            <li>Anyway, it smells good</li>
            <li>It sprays out a good amount</li>
            <li>Good buy and good</li>
            <li>good deal</li>
            <li>it smells really good.</li>
            <li>Not over powering, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Smells good.  </li>
            <li>but the price was so good i had to try it.</li>
            <li>It worked great.it works great with my own Cologne</li>
            <li>loved this product.</li>
            <li>:smells good ,going to try it for a week , but would like to try PherX Pheromone Oil for Men (Attract Women) -</li>
            <li>It smells good also.</li>
            <li>and someone else I loved.....</li>
            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>it will help others to notice all the good things that you have going on.  </li>
            <li>After using this product for a week, and being around many beautiful women where I work</li>
            <li>I love it works great and smells well.and my girlfriend loves the way it smells on me</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff, I had a lot of fun with it  </li>
            <li>I am very glad.</li>
            <li>I would suggest the formulators add more of the attractive scent.    </li>
            <li>If someone wears a supposed attractant and is expecting it to work they will probably try to make themselves more attractive</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>LOTS of great looking girls at this place and many women I&#x27;ve met through friends.</li>
            <li>it is a great product and i love it.</li>
            <li>this cologne is great ladies love it</li>
            <li>Great fragrance and doesnt require too many sprays.  </li>
            <li>Some days more attractive then others, and it was rather normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reason there are probably so many good reviews is because the product gives you a 10 dollar amazon gift card if you write a good review about them here.</li>
            <li>NOT A LIE, I get more attention!</li>
            <li>I have so many dates now that I can&#x27;t even keep up!</li>
            <li>it has that musty smell that women love!</li>
            <li>I love this cologne!</li>
            <li>The women at my office love how I smell!  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and consider it a working tool!</li>
            <li>Pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>started talking to me more and now we are going to a park in the mountains!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li>Interesting results!</li>
            <li>She has been a lot more flirty since I&#x27;ve been using this!</li>
            <li>Love the product works like it says!  </li>
            <li>Will buy again for sure!  </li>
            <li>It smells better and applies easier!</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;d slide her&#x27;s over to continue touching!</li>
            <li>Whether it is the (PherX) or not I cannot say for my wife is not the elaborate kind of women!</li>
            <li>I will be getting some more of this PherX !</li>
            <li>I give the pleasant fragrance 4 stars but have noticed no changes in the expressed sexual interest of women.</li>
            <li>It smells good and works great with my true religion cologne which gets a ton of compliments.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, not overpowering or potent.  </li>
            <li>Great fragrance and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>went to the movies yesterday and sprayed myself twice before going in one nice girl was staring at me till the movie was over this product really works!!!!!</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>, if you want to smell like a billy goat wearing cheap cologne (that is attractive?)</li>
            <li>Pherx was simply amazing to me</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product,I wore it on the bed for my girl friend and she did not allow me to sleep for the night at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This item is amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>fool yourself to believe you can get this product to help you pull women and do better than a good after shave&lt;</li>
            <li>Product had a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if the chemicals are effective.  </li>
            <li>it has a nice fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>a good night for me is 3 at the most</li>
            <li>Women are more receptive some even compliment me on how good I look.</li>
            <li>but I can honestly say it this product does attract women</li>
            <li>you do have to keep in mind with any pheromone cologne the scent will adapt to your own body heat (aka pulse points)</li>
            <li>do give it a try because women respond nicely to a man who looks empowered.</li>
            <li>If you want to give it a try I honestly don&#x27;t see the harm in it for the price.</li>
            <li>I find that for me, Gucci Envy is a nice combination.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, pheromone products aren&#x27;t like what the Axe commercials show, but it&#x27;s always nice to get dose in within 2-3 sprays.</li>
            <li>I have a background in biology and chemistry and can honestly say that scientists do acknowledge the existence of chemical attractants called pheromones.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you if it truly works, but it sure has given me confidence; maybe just because I smell so good.</li>
            <li>I bought the PherX Pheromone Cologne for Men and I am absolutely thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>and it will make you popular amongst your group of people and people</li>
            <li>I have not tested yet how effective there are attracting women</li>

            <li>It also has a nice scent to it as well.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because of the nice smell.</li>
            <li>and I liked it</li>
            <li>Upon attracting females, it is up to the person using the product to then be able to make a good impression.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell</li>

            <li>It did affect someone&#x27;s behavior, my own.</li>
            <li>It creates a kind of placebo effect that boosts your confidence.</li>

            <li>Honestly the smell is not noticeable but the effect was.</li>
            <li>The spray container is really handy.</li>
            <li>All that is needed now is to develop a soap of some kind with this product.</li>
            <li>As I pass by good looking girls they turn around more often and some even try to strike up conversations.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice scent that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent to it</li>
            <li>the scent is something to be disired kind of a genaric scent i have purchesed the oil without scent[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Pheromones do work, an this product is an effective pheromone.</li>

            <li>The smell is nice not over powering .</li>
            <li>Honestly though, you can&#x27;t argue with the results it&#x27;s given me.</li>
            <li>I honestly believe the manish smell helps with women besides the pheromones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>To be honest</li>
            <li>Product smells nice.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend liked the smell which I think might have influenced the effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mostly trying it out of curiosity and it seems to have good reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m just recouping after losing someone I liked alot....</li>
            <li>I tried it both with my own cologne and without and both showed no reaction with women</li>
            <li>Make sure to follow the instructions, and it&#x27;s best to use right after you shower.</li>
            <li>women loved the smell and was very friendly.</li>
            <li>I noticed two things, people were generally more pleasant and approachable and I had more confidence.</li>
            <li>The product has a pleasant smell once it settles and made me feel more confident.</li>
            <li>Smells like a pleasant cologne and its fine as is.</li>
            <li>co workers and girls noticed the new smell, told me it smells great!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff, really gets me going lol!  </li>

            <li>Nice clean and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>The spray has a light fragrance that is pleasant.</li>
            <li>It works very strongly.</li>
            <li>Very strong alcohol smell too.  </li>
            <li>like I smell like, another good place is right on the side of your abdomen and on your clothes seems good try not to rub it in</li>
            <li>I feel more popular with women than before.</li>
            <li>Honestly if this stuff worked they wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep it in stock.  </li>
            <li>This company and product suck ,they offer you a free bottle in exchange for a good review.</li>
            <li>amazing how ladies are noticing me more than without the majical cologne</li>
            <li>More smiles and nice reactions from women</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take more than a spray or two to make you smell nice.</li>
            <li>But ,do not expect that some kind of magic will happen...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells nice like an aftershave because it&#x27;s mostly alcohol, just like an aftershave.      </li>
            <li>The pheromone oil has a nice scent to it however it is a bit more greasy than the cologne since it is oil based.  </li>
            <li>Its the best product I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>One week after I received this in the mail, I got an email from their Customer Service requesting me to leave a good review of this product on Amazon and promised to send me the PherX Oil for free.</li>
            <li>I like better today, am I being more charming, confident, and</li>
            <li>far one of the best products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>she is not that nice most of the time and even ask me to stay and talk for a time .</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t explain how wonderful this product has been thus far.</li>
            <li>it was something new to try on a girlfriend , an it worked magnificently, I will Definately buy more</li>
            <li>I like it and, my girl friends like it.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced super sexual attraction effect like the Axe ad yet, but I hope that happens soon.</li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasing and beside the overt angle of attracting women, it is also a good product for sales individuals!</li>
            <li>I bought the product and the smell is good, and now each time, I talked with a woman, I feel more comfortable than I used to.</li>
            <li>I guess the most honest review I could give is that I would gladly pay for another bottle once this one is gone.  </li>
            <li>It smelled nice and it made me more confident.</li>
            <li>all great product though, fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>In retrospect, that review is just too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>This is especially true if you sweet a lot.</li>
            <li>I tryout it that be good and cool</li>
            <li>OK except the smell is strong!</li>
            <li>I honestly think that it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>it has a nice smell and it does not smell too strong and gives people headaches.</li>
            <li>These colognes actually smell great and get pleasant responses for me.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>The pheromones are masked by the cologne, which has a very good, masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Ive noticed women are talking to me more and more</li>
            <li>Just more snake oil to get your money.</li>
            <li>Wife has been more touchy since my purchase.</li>
            <li>More research is needed :)</li>
            <li>Or coming and talking to me more.</li>
            <li>The attraction is better when use this product of the pheromone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s slightly more potent in the oil version, but the spray bottle is arguably more convenient.  </li>
            <li>its better than no attention at all.</li>
            <li>Need more time to try it</li>
            <li>Call it a magic formula where in reality is it nothing but a $15 scam.</li>
            <li>I can agree with most of the five star reviews.</li>
            <li>but it does make people seem to feel more relaxed when it is worn.</li>
            <li>I have never been approached by so many girls in one night.</li>
            <li>It has an okay fragrance.</li>
            <li>Okay, as for the smell.. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything</li>
            <li>I believe it works more when going out or having a conversation with one girl.</li>
            <li>In fact, a lot of women I meet seem to be more chatty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok as others I had my doubts.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m looking forward to some more trials.</li>
            <li>Women touch my face and body much more when I&#x27;m wearing them.</li>
            <li>A bit nothing more.</li>
            <li>PherX is a great product that really works.</li>
            <li>I cannot wait to buy it more</li>
            <li>Woman would not be able to discern source if you&#x27;re with a group.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the magical bullet you think.&lt;br /&gt;Telling</li>
            <li>Thing is I did ok with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use more too see better results</li>
            <li>And perhaps there will be a placebo effect for some people that will give them more confidence and, in turn, make them more attractive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If there was any noticable effect, it was that women seem more relaxed.</li>
            <li>I combine this with my favorite cologne and head out.</li>
            <li>i was 100% satisfied with the product  </li>
            <li>a couple friends say it smells ok...</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference in the way she would act towards me: a lot more flirty and touchy.</li>
            <li>Women are from nowhere saying Hello more than before.</li>
            <li>you believ your self more</li>
            <li>i love the smell</li>
            <li>but if you want more then that is up to you but do not expect it to do the work for you</li>
            <li>And me and my girl friend love it</li>
            <li>They are more receptive to you.</li>
            <li>I never felt so confident as when I used pherx.&lt;br /&gt;encourage</li>
            <li>I made sure to wear it every time I was around her, but it did not do anything to help.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like she was attracted to me more when I didn&#x27;t wear</li>
            <li>When I am out, I can tell more woman want to be around me and that they seem more approachable.</li>
            <li>Girls became more engaged in trying to keep a conversation going.</li>
            <li>Had a lady approach me and calling me sexy and touching me in the mall ...</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>It by no means makes them fall head over heels for you, but it does seem to have women approach me more often.</li>
            <li>but they want to be closer and are more flirty than ever.  </li>
            <li>Will order more.</li>
            <li>but i (like many others) have done some observation.</li>
            <li>Something interesting</li>
            <li>I have been noticing more females smiling at me.</li>
            <li>n not so cute.</li>
            <li>and I know it works for sure</li>
            <li>The women I speak to are more receptive to my conversation.</li>
            <li>Also, I have found that they spend more time in my personal space, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend  it to others....</li>
            <li>I use another cologne on top of it (Farenheit, her favorite-</li>
            <li>but I find that when I wear this product,  more women are around me and definitely more &amp;#34;touchy-feely&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I think many just have placebo effect but that my opinion.</li>
            <li>smell is FANTASTIC and my GIRLFRIEND loves it!</li>
            <li>noticed any more attention then when before ever using the product.</li>
            <li>I tried this product and I am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s one problem of this product which is the smell doesn&#x27;t take more than 5 mint.</li>
            <li>Just got it...tried it once so far...not sure of results....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it truly works or if its just a placebo effect, but it has made me more confident in my endeavors.</li>
            <li>I have a fiance and it has made her more affectionate when I wear it</li>
            <li>Light smell and lasts all day if you were wondering about it!</li>
            <li>I know that it won&#x27;t help you bed all the ladies because before all that women were just alot nicer and much more closer to me during the day.</li>
            <li>When I used it I am not just seeing the girls looking at me, but more that that</li>
            <li>Ok, so, I think it helps but can&#x27;t be 100% sure because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve notice no change in how women relate to me which is mostly ignore....  </li>
            <li>The magic is in the person, but whatever works.</li>
            <li>but still :) This cannot happen from the sky.</li>
            <li>PhreX is Magical.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and she couldn&#x27;t stop touching me</li>
            <li>, i will be buying more no doubt about that, i owe it all to pherx</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sure does give you a confidence boost.</li>
            <li>But Sure Got Noticed With All The Smiles And Attention.</li>
            <li>I do notice that she is more \\&quot;touchy feely\\</li>
            <li>All i know is that they show more attention.</li>
            <li>, I tried it, and I think that it made her irritable :-)</li>
            <li>This product is okay,</li>
            <li>I am perfectly satisfied with PherX.  </li>
            <li>The spray version of this is ok.</li>
            <li>This stuff actually smells awesome too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many times when time meet the peoples but does not make any difference.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>If you must I&#x27;m not going to be able to stop you, but please know that you will basically smell like rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li>but i dont know for sure about that one</li>
            <li>One guy wrote, \\&quot;I have never been approached by so many girls in one night.</li>
            <li>but it seems to work :)</li>
            <li>I have used both Scent Of Eros (My favorite) and Shikari.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off without it.</li>
            <li>and the conversations went better.</li>
            <li>and it attracted many women.</li>
            <li>It is still too soon to know for sure</li>
            <li>You still gotta me a man and approach because most women aren&#x27;t gonna throw themselves at you.</li>
            <li>Product seams to work better</li>
            <li>It might be placebo, but they seem more responsive when I am wearing PherX. As for Zyloo Research Labs-</li>
            <li>This product does work, but there are many variables to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that this works best indoors, the smaller the room</li>
            <li>I would of gave this a 5 if it was more potent</li>
            <li>I feel that women feel an increased attraction to me , I notice women checking me out more</li>
            <li>My wife even said I smelled nice and has been more aggressive and attentive.  </li>
            <li>Am I being more confident?  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am well pleased.  </li>
            <li>It also combines well with EDT and/or cologne as a top layer (around the neck and wrists).</li>
            <li>I know I DO get more play.</li>
            <li>DID receive this item free of charge to give an honest review...  </li>
            <li>admittedly haven&#x27;t had many chances to use it yet, but I have noticed a lot more attention from girls when I do.  </li>
            <li>Smells ok</li>
            <li>now i won&#x27;t say for sure that it&#x27;s my homemade cologne, but it does make you wonder....</li>
            <li>used it at the gym...and can already tell the ladies making more of an attempt to get my attention...</li>
            <li>and i tried this in many environments..</li>
            <li>I tried this for many days and NO RESULTS..</li>
            <li>Noticed more attention from women at work and my wife.</li>
            <li>Noticed more women talked to me throughout the day on my route.</li>
            <li>The ladies love the smell though</li>
            <li>Most women will pay more attention to you and even get excited/nervous.</li>
            <li>my lady love it not greasy or oily</li>
            <li>This one seems a bit more &amp;#34;misty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Anyways, it&#x27;s a interesting cologne to have, you will see the change.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>But decided to try based on many online reviews...</li>
            <li>I like the oil better.  </li>
            <li>I can already tell that I am flirted with more and girls show me more attention.  </li>
            <li>but I can say the wife does appear to be more touchy feely when I wear this.  </li>
            <li>I love science.</li>
            <li>I cannot confirm for sure that the product works, but I feel that women feel an increased attraction to me while wearing the product.  </li>
            <li>I notice women checking me out more often</li>
            <li>And the more i wear it the more</li>
            <li>I love the smell, hopefully it will work for me soon</li>
            <li>Does nothing smells ok but in no way does this do what it says it does.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel more confident/</li>
            <li>this product nreall helps ,i am glad to have tried it and will continue to purchase</li>
            <li>If it works it&#x27;s because it makes you believe more in your abilities.</li>
            <li>Who knows if this product works, there&#x27;s too many variables, but I like the smell.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have seen better responses from women (but who knows if that&#x27;s the placebo effect).</li>
            <li>Women were definitely more attracted to me.</li>
            <li>me as a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>If I were to spend more than $30 on cologne</li>
            <li>I will combine this with my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>look at the mirror make sure u look okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Will have to use it longer to better see if it is 100% working.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using this product, girls are much more receptive to my \\&quot;moves\\&quot; and that has given me all the confidence in the world.</li>
            <li>that I would expect in a top of the  line product.</li>
            <li>I started getting more looks from the women around me.</li>
            <li>Now, let&#x27;s not think this is love potion number 9 and all women will drop to their knees for you...but the product DOES do as it says.  </li>
            <li>I seem to get more attention from women when I wear PherX.  </li>
            <li>You know I haven&#x27;t been able to tell if this works.</li>
            <li>I work at a school where there are many smells to compete with it.</li>
            <li>Perhaps i need to do some more testing.</li>
            <li>I tried this to entice my overworked doctor girlfriend into more lovemaking.</li>
            <li>but maybe this is how most colognes are.  </li>
            <li>The cologne has an OK scent to it, but I was a bit disapointed because the ingridients did not describe what phermone it contained.</li>
            <li>Ok, I just received this product on Tuesday.</li>
            <li>keep buying more.</li>
            <li>I like the spray more than the oil,  </li>
            <li>not 100% sure about the efficacy of the product</li>
            <li>yet but seems like it works for most people.</li>
            <li>I will update this review once I used the product more.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>More kick</li>
            <li>when I done it.&lt;br /&gt;Smell of this product is ok too&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and</li>
            <li>you will get more smiles...and people staring into your eyes with this for sure.</li>
            <li>Someday it seems to have more of an affect than others.</li>
            <li>I hope to have more of an reaction when I go out to parties.</li>
            <li>The girls that have smelled seemed to be noticing it more than I do.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had anybody be overly aggressive, but I do seem to get more attention.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok..</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I can mix it with my favorite cologne and it does not interfere.</li>
            <li>he needed it more than me.</li>
            <li>I was way better before using this.</li>
            <li>one time use you will love that have everytime use.</li>
            <li>I have orderd more , it is priced well and would continue to use it .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting many compliments and attention about how I smell.</li>
            <li>and she become more touchy-feely.</li>
            <li>After trying this product out for a while I have noticed being noticed a bit more.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say for sure if it works or not</li>
            <li>but I feel like when I wear it I seem to strike the interest of females more often.</li>
            <li>of for now, it is a product that I would love to think works as it is supposed to</li>
            <li>For instance good hygiene, having confidence, and being a fun person.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Several of the office men were also more talkative during these tests as well, asking mostly about an opinion on something, or requesting help with what we do for the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Boosts my confidence and women seem more at ease.  </li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>I have to say, this is priced cheaper and works better.</li>
            <li>However I have found many women who seem to be able to resist it.  </li>
            <li>Will order more.</li>
            <li>And according to many on here it does,</li>
            <li>being as there are many it works for.</li>
            <li>I got way more compliments and attention using a Bath and Body Works NOIR body spray than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Get the body spray over the cologne version though, it works much better.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t help to notice increased interest as well as more openness from ladies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve notice a lot more smiles and conversations.</li>
            <li>I feel energized and much more confident while wearing it</li>
            <li>I wore it on top of my cologne on a night out in the city.</li>
            <li>This product has a pleasant mellow and fresh smell that is not too strong and is wearable around an office or during the day.  </li>
            <li>SERIOUSLY MY REGULAR COLOGNE GETS ME BETTER RESULTS!!!</li>
            <li>People do seem to be very friendly and relaxed when wearing this product.</li>
            <li>Conversations with women start spontaneously and in a friendly manner.  </li>
            <li>We normally have great sex, but this time it was more than ever</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>Men seem more respectable and easy going in my company.</li>
            <li>First impression is whether or not it has pheromones in it, it does smell good and would stand alone as a colonge.</li>
            <li>I think it works best if you use it where women will be around you for long periods of time like work or school</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Attraction Gold is also pretty good.</li>
            <li>Good at first, but then after, ewww.</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty good</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this product smells pretty good</li>
            <li>I think it smells pretty good by itself.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>Much easy to apply than the oil and works a lot better.</li>
            <li>Women are generally more receptive, and easy to talk to and initiate conversation enabling me to continue the chatting if I wish.  </li>
            <li>Always keeping in mind that females bore easily, so if you don&#x27;t keep things interesting............</li>
            <li>I mix it with my cologne for an added boost women seem to be more easily approachable and chatty.</li>
            <li>Nice mild scent.</li>
            <li>I wear it frequently and have gotten many great responses from it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps I do feel more comfortable and self confident around females using this product....</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t use too much anyway, hoping to get a good 6 months or more out of this product.</li>
            <li>I have noticed females being more friendly towards me, and giving me more attention.</li>
            <li>I got a complement about how nice I smell from the pretty teller!  </li>
            <li>It is very clean smelling and not too strong.</li>
            <li>It made me smell really good, girls love it, and my one gay friend haha, over all I would keep buying it</li>
            <li>The seller offered me a free sample to test out, so I said sure.  </li>
            <li>If you are that cheap for 10 bucks, I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t know you.</li>
            <li>what is that your wearing?&amp;#34; It does also seem to make the women I interact with more relaxed and comfortable.</li>
            <li>women become more aware of my presence and caused immediate changes in their behavior, they were more talkative, affectionate and had a better sense of humor with me which gave me more confidence and women</li>
            <li>Noticed  girls smiling and feeling comfortable around and tend to touch more often..</li>
            <li>Noticed that women were more attentive around me as well as wanting to get closer to me.</li>
            <li>and I had spray pump that fit it and was ok.</li>
            <li>was surprised when i use it for first time it was wonderful</li>
            <li>It feels like people are more comfortable meeting me when I wear it.</li>
            <li>smells good but really has no effect</li>
            <li>I opened it and the smell was nice, slightly powerful.</li>
            <li>This is a good product that really works.</li>
            <li>I really think it works, Also five drops seems to be a good amount.&lt;br /&gt;Men</li>
            <li>i really recommend trying it for yourself and experience what i had, a good ass time with the hottest brunette in the office.</li>
            <li>delivery be good and fast to me.</li>
            <li>I give it five stars because it is working, smells good, and shipped amazingly fast.</li>
            <li>However, one thing to understand is that pheromones like any hormones are very potent, and the reason they work in nature is that they&#x27;re potent at very dilute levels.</li>
            <li>The smell is very nice, it makes me feel more confident around the opposite sex.</li>
            <li>Dating wise, I didn&#x27;t have any more women approach me than normal; but the women I went to talk to opened up and were more friendly a lot quicker</li>
            <li>it gives you an edge, works best meeting someone for the first time, really adds to the first impression I make, most women size you up in about 5 seconds its either yes or no.</li>
            <li>You will not regret it, best 30 bucks I have ever spent!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the best compared to Pherazone and other products like it.</li>
            <li>were much more friendly.</li>
            <li>But for the best results I found apply a little at bed time and let it work its magic.  </li>
            <li>It was a beautiful smile and you will definitely notice how girls going to be nice with you and talk with you.</li>
            <li>For the price I think is worth giving it a try, plus the fact that you feel confident helps more than anything else.</li>
            <li>and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>They can cause a girl to fall for you very quickly.</li>
            <li>Great smell and the ladies definitely take a greater notice towards me and talkative.</li>
            <li>this thing is ok, it smells good, but as far as it saying what it says, well i use it around my wife and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I can easily get my energy boost from coffee or chocolate.  </li>
            <li>Spray bottle makes application quite easy.  </li>
            <li>, i also did notice she would stare at me more, and she would keep making more eye contact, also at work i did notice female co-workers seemed nicer and more talkative, i dont know if its the spray that works or its a placebo effect, but for now i do think it has some effect, it does smell good as well, almost a light musk smell, i will keep trying and update.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply</li>
            <li>Easily masked by another cologne.</li>
            <li>It was also shipped and delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, that I had to wait an hour after applying it to go out because of how strong the scent is.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t go overboard as it is a strong scent.</li>
            <li>love that, only positive reaction I got from this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pheromones are volatile!!!</li>
            <li>Gay men were also more than friendly every time I have worn it.</li>
            <li>Woman will tend to be more talkative and smile more at you, it is true you also get more glances from the woman around you, but the rest is all on you.</li>
            <li>I have a long time (2+ years) girlfriend, so I thought it would be a very good test situation.      </li>
            <li>(smile more, try to be more attentive, etc.) and get results from that.</li>
            <li>Also, it seems to be more effective on younger women, which is nice.</li>
            <li>When you first spray it, it smells nice.</li>
            <li>Bought this product because i needed some cologne and wanted to see more myself if the claims were true.  </li>
            <li>if so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty effective.</li>
            <li>do not think this works any better than being more friendly, interesting, and interested.</li>
            <li>it smells soapy and more sweet and citrus rather than musky.</li>
            <li>it 100% safe even drop full in eyes</li>
            <li>When i first looked around to purchase a reliable honest product i figured this would be a place to buy.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this stuff would work, it does not, it also has a funny smell that kind of burns my nostrils</li>
            <li>It has a nice light, while the oil is nearly scentless the spray cologne has a really nice light scent.</li>
            <li>The scent on this is fine.</li>
            <li>I was around a bunch of either lesbians or gay males, so</li>
            <li>just an ave. guy not a super model  was very happy with this product</li>
            <li>Okay first off the oil is a much better product than this spray cologne.</li>
            <li>A lady tried to pick me up in the GAY grocery store in Wilton Manors one night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gay.</li>
            <li>After many many months of not being receptive to romance, I was interested in testing the product which just arrived.</li>
            <li>while hanging with my friend (She is gay) and to my surprise she couldn&#x27;t smell it either.</li>
            <li>Women seem to have a better response to what I&#x27;m saying in conversation and seem more interested in me.</li>
            <li>so go light and not smell too strong.</li>
            <li>get laid quick product!</li>
            <li>so far, a pleasant chemistry.</li>
            <li>I bought this with skepticism but was pleasant surprised by the reaction from my wife.  </li>
            <li>It smells okay for a mild cologne.  </li>
            <li>and I am a real person with outstanding results!</li>
            <li>With this product you cannot expect to magically attract every single girl, however it smells very nice and with the added pheromones I could notice that girls came closer to me when they were talking.</li>
            <li>Price - Nothing to get super excited about, but better than most.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Having said that, I went into this experiment with huge doubts.</li>
            <li>really works and really does great as said.</li>
            <li>Others that I&#x27;ve never spoken to before are now engaging me in conversation.</li>
            <li>For those men who have trouble talking to women, this is a must buy as it will change your life for the best!</li>
            <li>this was free, I&#x27;d use it just for the scent but trust me when I say it does NOT work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells great haven&#x27;t seen much female attention</li>
            <li>They have a detailed video there that shows some background information on pheromones.  </li>
            <li>This also helped out with my confidence as if I glow in a room filled with women.</li>
            <li>It is a great smelling cologne that you can carry around discreetly and spray when you see the only you are attracted to.  </li>
            <li>After using the oil and getting fantastic results, I was leery of how adding the fragrance would affect the outcome.</li>
            <li>, if you are already physically attractive this will definitely Enhance how women respond to you</li>
            <li>but honestly I believe it is more then a placebo effect, noticed instantly more attraction from the opposite sex would recommend</li>
            <li>whatever it is, it is something only than women can smell and it may not be attractive to all.</li>
            <li>Then give a review, and I&#x27;ll receive it for free.</li>
            <li>so i guess if you like a light musk cologne</li>
            <li>I dont ever have problems with getting the attention of ladies, but this product has made life easier and a lot of fun for sure.</li>
            <li>Lets just say it ended up being a great night with the extra desired touches.</li>
            <li>I think this product is great for bringing women in closer but the rest is up to you, your charisma and physical attraction.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The company also sent me another free bottle of my choice.</li>
            <li>Cheap prize , this pheromone is working is well , iam the pheromone lover</li>
            <li>Women do seem to light up a bit when I am around them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for going out to the club and bars and will get you alot of female attention.</li>
            <li>She makes comments about my virility---postitive comments filled with lust.</li>
            <li>The seller and I made a agreement for a free product  if I reviewed again.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped the free product as they promised, With that said here is my review.</li>
            <li>This product smells great and every time I wore it, I seemed to attract the opposite sex.</li>
            <li>will enjoy what I bought</li>
            <li>its a great product to buy if ur just starting off!</li>
            <li>When I put it on it had the smell of CHEAP cologne.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, it&#x27;s all about the search for help and understanding, if this is what you&#x27;ve got to buy in order to continue that, please feel free to buy it.  </li>
            <li>Girls begin to get much closer, much more touchy-feely, much more flirtatious</li>
            <li>Having hung around my female friends, they have been more touchy and have commented that I smell good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I tried to do the best &#x27;research&#x27; about this on Google, and thanks to mixed reviews, I thought \\&quot;well some say it worked for them\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how good it smelled.</li>
            <li>But as far as I know it does smell good.</li>
            <li>Smeels good and blends in with your natural scent.</li>
            <li>the offers are incredibly good</li>
            <li>More intimate love.  </li>
            <li>As for now i can say it doesnt really have a magical affect but does make women appear more friendly.  </li>
            <li>Product really does work fellas!!!</li>
            <li>This is the third product of PherX that I&#x27;ve tried and I love them all!!</li>
            <li>It is very powerfully scented however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li>very nice indeed...will update later on results at the club this weekend</li>
            <li>and usually I&#x27;m not one to have problems with a strong scent of any kind.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it seems to work pretty well so far.</li>
            <li>you wear it around, and I really believe this product works to a pretty good extent.</li>
            <li>I mainly got it because the reviews mentioned that it has a nice smell to it</li>
            <li>When I use this product it seems that women are more comfortable around me, quite a bit more talkative, and more intrusive of personal space</li>
            <li>I really like this sprayable form because it is easier to apply, and I also like that it is very mildly scented, so that I can use it along with any of my favorite cologne</li>
            <li>Now for a quick disclaimer, the cologne will attract women but you have to give them a reason to stay, so focus on becoming confident (if you aren&#x27;t already) also do groom yourself and put on clothes that shows a more professional you.</li>
            <li>Since using PherX for Men I have noticed that women are more positive and engaging to me.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying this is some magical \\&quot;get any girl\\&quot; cologne, but it&#x27;s pretty damn close as I believe it worked.</li>
            <li>30 days and was not expecting anything significant in how people would react, but did not see &#x27;any&#x27; change in their mannerisms around me.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is nothing more than a bit of an edge when someone is interested to you.</li>
            <li>and this seems to make her a bit more interested in &amp;#34;us&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Not saying you have to stink, but this can be a replacement for those that shower more than once a day and want to get their woman interested.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure with the of scent</li>
            <li>It helps you get noticed, and helps you me a better first impression.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this to see what effect it might have on my wife...</li>
            <li>most at work really took to me, she would smile at me more at work talk to me close up, i askd her out</li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>Smell - Not bad by itself, sort of like a light aftershave.</li>
            <li>Women around me were more talkative and it seemed that women close by were interested in getting closer to me and or the conversation.</li>
            <li>I wore it and noticed that people there were friendly and talkative to me.  </li>
            <li>At first I just wanted to try it for laughs and where it around the office, but i realized most of the women</li>
            <li>I notice when I use this that women are more willing to accept conversation engagements or may even place themselves to be in a conversation with you.</li>
            <li>Today I tried PherX for the first time and I have to say I am really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>This product did not work as advertised, maybe snake oil would be a better name or antagonizer would be more precise, attracts old fat chicks with kids</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure it works in the way it says it does, plus it has the added benefit of boosting your confidence, which is also helpful.</li>
            <li>i put generally 3 sprays to get a a good reaction.</li>
            <li>To find women interested in you, sometimes you don&#x27;t need anything more than the provocative scent of manly pheromones to get women to come on to you.  </li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time and seemed to get more looks from women.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty unique I guess, in relation to the hole in my life</li>
            <li>2 more girls were interested in me and hung around with us.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to boost their self esteem and be more successful in social situations.</li>
            <li>it help you in your relations,when i start new relation i need some attract for femals,this kind of products give you help because it works like biology attract,but i think it works diffrent ways from one to another,</li>
            <li>similar price, much more effective.</li>
            <li>it works :)  Has a nice aroma and definitely gives you a confidence boost.</li>
            <li>When I spayed it on I smelled a clean soapy scent.</li>
            <li>I think if you are not a big cologne person and want a fairly light cologne that might boost your confidence - this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>I rarely have any success with the ladies but this stuff was magic.</li>
            <li>The scent may have changed since my last order but i still get amazing result with the ladies :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product and several of the competitors comparable products and PherX is the best by far.</li>
            <li>Pleasant enough if it was a standalone fragrance</li>
            <li>but it does actually have a pleasant scent to it.</li>
            <li>experienced is limited though</li>
            <li>the product do what it can do as you are relaxed, positive and confident.</li>
            <li>When applied, I found that women are more curious, more flirty, and more engaging.</li>
            <li>This cologne seems to make both men and women friendly and more uninhibited almost like there is something you have that they really, really want hehe.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep you posted on how things turn out, but I am noticing a more pleasant wife who actually is starting to appreciate my attention just as much as the boys.</li>
            <li>Inside the club I must say I didn&#x27;t notice any special reaction but oustide yes</li>
            <li>I love the way this spray smells, defenintly can get certain women&#x27;s attention.</li>
            <li>Some women are more attracted to certain pheromones.</li>
            <li>I put some on and noticed a difference right away!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, a refill!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how to evaluate this product accurately, but I find the scent to be pleasant and not overpowering, and women do seem to be more interested in sexual activity IF THEY ARE ALREADY INCLINED TO BE IN THAT MOOD.  </li>
            <li>Women around me were more talkative and interested in getting to know me, though it is worth knowing how to keep a conversation going with a girl before you spray the stuff on.</li>
            <li>True product.</li>
            <li>all the females were more talkative, they looked at me and were very flirty.</li>
            <li>Now realizing that by doing this, you wash away your own natural pheromones.  </li>
            <li>one of the girls i work with told me a good smelling guy is a big turn on</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t approached by too many woman; but wasn&#x27;t really turned away either...</li>
            <li>The cologne smells good and seems to give me an extra edge.  </li>
            <li>The women always ask what are you wearing that smells good even several hours after application</li>
            <li>Buy some good cologne and take daily showers, it does wonders to your attractiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but really can make you feel better.</li>
            <li>have found it best works if you put at least two sprays on your neck and then ask a girl to dance with you.  </li>
            <li>and I felt overall more confident and comfortable talking to her</li>
            <li>, I was able to flirt a bit and really keep the eye contact and conversation going.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve become more touchy and flirty so making a move is so much easier now.</li>
            <li>The PherX is a good product overall.  </li>
            <li>no complaints and for full disclosure-  </li>
            <li>I have recently ordered the PherX product for men and have found it to be a good product  </li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied and will be buying another bottle very soon.</li>
            <li>Well i only have to say that this one smells good, it doesn&#x27;t do any miracles</li>
            <li>Good product overall.</li>
            <li>Used in a controlled physiology lab experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: inconclusive, but makes for a cool story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife thinks it smells good in a much different way than cologne.</li>
            <li>Anything more, then you may want to consider paying a dating coach, haha.</li>
            <li>It also does last for a good while.</li>
            <li>but, I have noticed the wife being a lot more touchy feely and wants to be closer to me all the time</li>
            <li>It shows that really work I love it and</li>
            <li>Definitely got some attention from some good looking women.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t magic, let&#x27;s be real here.</li>
            <li>i gave it to my friend and he used it with his wife and he said &#x27; Cool &#x27;</li>
            <li>What you need to know is that this is a pheromone product that works as advertised, and if you do your part, (dress nicely, smile, act police, keep your teeth free of chives, don&#x27;t smoke and don&#x27;t over-do it with coffee)</li>
            <li>Not a bad thing</li>
            <li>Not bad at all for the price.</li>
            <li>Not bad for $30.</li>
            <li>We had a great time, that night, and for the next few days she showered my with affection telling me how happy she is, and how lucky she felt to be my wife.</li>
            <li>The reason I keep reordering this item is because more than any other cologne I use, women actually tell me I smell wonderful!</li>
            <li>I noticed a little bit difference in the way the ladies acted around me (in a good way).&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must try!</li>
            <li>If not, it definitely smells great and still gives off a positive effect</li>
            <li>for 5 spray married women&#x27;s are attracting very depth looking nice , I like it so much , girls are attracting but not in powerful way, to attract girls need more than 5 spray ; now iam using along with (max attraction gold ) it use to attract girls &amp; women</li>
            <li>Other than this, I&#x27;m really happy with PherX and intend to keep using it for a while.</li>
            <li>I noticed more looks, more friendly faces, and a little more contact.</li>
            <li>If you wear strong enough you&#x27;ll see that girls will be more willing to talk to you and pay more attention to you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lately I have been using the spray on my legs and the oil up top, i&#x27;ve found decent results although I have no way of knowing which is doing what..</li>
            <li>you might be lucky.</li>
            <li>Along with the fact that I have been feeling better losing weight and eating better things have been different for me.  </li>
            <li>It smells like cologne with a mild</li>
            <li>The cologne also comes with a spray nozzle which is more convenient and rations are more equal allowing for additional usages.</li>
            <li>(the more human pheromones, the more potent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely, observed women giving me more looks, and being more communicative.  </li>
            <li>Works as advertised, is fairly cheap and free fast shipping.</li>
            <li>You will get a few more women that notice you smell &amp;#34;Nice&amp;#34; which is a good conversation starter.  </li>
            <li>but it seemed that the females were much more open to conversation and made more eye contact.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and obviously women love it too.</li>
            <li>It is a really mild scent.</li>
            <li>Product was however shipped and received quickly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be sure on its actual &amp;#34;effects&amp;#34; but I love the scent regardless.</li>
            <li>Super quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>It definitely helps you feel more confident.</li>
            <li>I found it does seem to be causing for more conversations with strangers but am not certain I can solely attest it to the product or my amazing personality.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The K9 test was positive every time, although the handler said the dog didn&#x27;t hit strong, and acted unsure about what it located.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended :-)</li>
            <li>I can say that I felt a little more energized which led to me feeling more motivated and confident.  </li>
            <li>in all, very satisfied with results from this product and highly recommend it &amp; definitely gives me a confidence boost, and I have noticed women treating me with more leniency.</li>
            <li>I will be getting more of this on a normal occasions.</li>
            <li>I got a lot of compliments from women the very first day when I start using it.</li>
            <li>They also give you a free product if its your first time purchasing.</li>
            <li>u might want to wear it with another cologne cuz it barely has a scent of its own</li>
            <li>However, it smells good, and that alone might be enough if you don&#x27;t have any regular cologne handy.  </li>
            <li>of the waitresses who is a good friend only was standing near me and started playing with her hair while talking to me, a sure sign she&#x27;s attracted.</li>
            <li>of the waitresses who is a good friend only was standing near me and started playing with her hair while talking to me, a sure sign she&#x27;s attracted.</li>
            <li>Has a very fresh, crisp scent.</li>
            <li>My co-workers love the new scent that I carry and everyone asks what sort of cologne I use.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have always been intrigued by the idea of pheromones, and I decided to opt for this one becasue it was reasonably priced and generally had good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I put it on before I go out to any kind of social gathering.</li>
            <li>excellent product, but does not last long and sometimes does not work as it should recommend . . . .</li>
            <li>#34;Sorry, your voice is too sexy, please repeat your question.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;She is usually very professional</li>
            <li>when i first used it never thought that it is gonna work,but after putting it on i saw my female friends becoming more friendly and touchier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving 2 stars for the very light pleasant smell that is very short lasting.</li>
            <li>I was getting a lot of looks and friendly smiles when I first went out with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying pheromones for the last 4 month&#x27;s this product is the best one that has worked for me at first I noticed the difference at my job not only just with females but also with males.</li>
            <li>the next thing that made me sure this product worked was first thing i did when i walked into the party was introduced myself to all of the girls and hugged them to make sure they smelled it, for the rest of the night wherever i went</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend using pheromone cologne, but if you do, make sure you buy it form PherX!</li>
            <li>The tricky part of my little study is that I am more aware of women when wearing Pher-X and much more confident.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited.</li>
            <li>This product really works!!</li>
            <li>u can really tell the difference!!</li>
            <li>They become more social, touchy, and comfortable in the presence of this scent.  </li>
            <li>It really helps you feel comfortable being around women</li>
            <li>I purchased the product because I found its claims to be intriguing.  </li>
            <li>Its aroma is so fantastic that can really attrect women.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money even if it&#x27;s all in your head</li>
            <li>A smile and polite conversation does the rest.</li>
            <li>am happy with this product and was surprised that it actually worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would be curious with a more potent version, but yes I would buy again.</li>
            <li>and overall I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>If you are reading this then you are probably deciding whether or not it is worth taking a look into.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I thought it would be fun to order it and see if it works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth the price and wait (for shipping).</li>
            <li>worth trying</li>
            <li>it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Is it worth it to try it out?</li>
            <li>Point is, your mileage can and will vary, but in my opinion it&#x27;s worth seeing what that mileage will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the pheromone cologne had a great  smell , however it did not provide droves of women as described , guess I was to old for the proper effect..........</li>
            <li>but I think its definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Pheromones will give you an edge; she&#x27;ll smile at you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>far, my favorite is pheroforce.</li>
            <li>So overall this product was fun to try to be honest</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, even if it&#x27;s just a placebo effect, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Should have more dates and women to hang out with and it makes it easier so far</li>
            <li>The result was phenomenal so far.</li>
            <li>And it has a nice aroma to it definitely recommend to try it out</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to see if girls in public can be attracted to you and with this product I got no results.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again because of the fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>Feel it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pleased with the results I&#x27;m seeing from Pherx.  </li>
            <li>anyways it is worth to buy....</li>
            <li>Is it effective enough to get into someone pants?</li>
            <li>I am so far satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Simple yet effective.  </li>
            <li>I also e mailed them inquiring possible allergens and received prompt courteous service.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It is powerful for man.</li>
            <li>No noticeable smell, easy pump, and decent amount for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>Which is rare for me.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than an &amp;#34;Axe&amp;#34; body spray or Old Spice.</li>
            <li>So far its working ok.</li>
            <li>I would like to say that this product is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;100% work and also worth the money, we went to a party at the night when i got it, and the girls went crazyy</li>
            <li>kind of amazed cause it definitely  did not smell like vanilla</li>
            <li>Product works well, I&#x27;m in sales and my clients are always far more receptive when I use it.</li>
            <li>This stuff  seems like it makes women want to speak to you and smile.</li>
            <li>but overall nice smell.</li>
            <li>worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It was a fun experiment but would not put this stuff on again for anything.  </li>
            <li>When I walk into a supermarket or visit the library, women stare at me, smile at me, and sometimes even cast me that enticing glance that says: \\&quot;Come on over and talk to me.  </li>
            <li>I think it just helped with knowing I&#x27;m worth a girl&#x27;s attention.  </li>
            <li>Your entire life can change in the span of 6 months with that kind of decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can only vouch for my own.</li>
            <li>I found this product on Amazon and thought that at the price it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I was glad it is not strong because I have my own preferred cologne that i can wear with it.  </li>
            <li>I see a ladies a bit more open and friendly and easier to deal with.</li>
            <li>But then I noticed she keeps coming back to the room &amp; ask how I&#x27;m doing &amp; seems more friendly.</li>
            <li>It had a feminine perfume smell to it as well, but was easily covered up with the normal cologne i use.</li>
            <li>If this isn&#x27;t working for you then you honestly have no social skills.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far, but so far I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but and seems as little effective but by no means as strong as its oil based substitute from the same company.</li>
            <li>This I have experienced with PherX in the past, and it&#x27;s happening again with my second order of this amazing product.  </li>
            <li>My wife kind of liked the scent, but it did not last that long.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try since I couldn&#x27;t decide on a mainstream cologne and have read other good reviews.</li>
            <li>but I do all right.</li>
            <li>but I am out of the country right now and dont need it.  </li>
            <li>I spray it right on after getting cleaned up and stepping out for the night</li>
            <li>I knew right away that it wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>Just eat right.</li>
            <li>I started doubting the potency of this product right that moment.</li>
            <li>The waitress kept coming over to make sure everything was OK, asking me what I had planned for the weekend and generally spending more time with me than any of the other 10-12 guys at the bar.  </li>
            <li>This worked great the first few times I used it.  </li>
            <li>While they are not a magic love potion that will make all the eye candy fall hopelessly under your spell,I do find that they have the ability to boost your own attraction levels,and magnify the range of chemistry between those who would share it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product over the past year and have received many compliments about the nice smell.</li>
            <li>I think overall it is not a bad buy, considering many colognes cost over $50.  </li>
            <li>Not only do I have great social skills, but I have this potion as my sidekick.</li>
            <li>I think it is better to err on the side of caution and apply less rather than more.</li>
            <li>first thing i noticed was when i was riding the bus 2 beautiful girls got on the bus and sat right next to me when there were plenty of open seats.</li>
            <li>Obviously it got her more on the sexual side because of the natural attraction already there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already been getting some action on the regular, which makes you more appealing to women.</li>
            <li>I applied a fresh spray when I first saw her and again before we went to bed and</li>
            <li>I could definitely see the difference on how women behave near you when you have such an awesome smell.</li>
            <li>You can tell women feel more comfortable when the around me when I&#x27;m wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;You have to apply it constantly as it looses it smells, the oil based one is the one I much preferred.</li>
            <li>PherX may work great for me but not so much for another, and the effect seems to vary a little depending on who&#x27;s doing the smelling.</li>
            <li>To my surprise I couldn&#x27;t help but notice a little more intensity in my lady&#x27;s love making .</li>
            <li>At first in my mind I&#x27;m like \\&quot;Yeah Right, a placebo effect huh\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Need to try a few more times before writing a more comprehensive review.</li>
            <li>We are more intelligent than animals, so this stuff is not going to work, sorry to burst bubbles.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and it definitely lowers a woman&#x27;s guard to allow her to open up.</li>
            <li>Activity with my mate increased considerably and is more intense.</li>
            <li>They were very quick and professional.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t sensed much difference as far as attract more woman.</li>
            <li>It may have been coincidental, so I will test it out a few more times to make sure.</li>
            <li>Great product ,I have had several women walk up out of the blue and introduce them selves.</li>
            <li>I have actually had much more success after switching to unscented products and lengthening times between showers.</li>
            <li>Some people might be sensitive to a strong signal so in that case it might work against you.</li>
            <li>Wow, really smells great and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Thanks very much, will buy again!</li>
            <li>Recently got this in the mail and have had pretty good responses so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Realm (a different pheromone cologne, about $70 for 1.7oz back in the day) twice before with zero noticeable effect, whereas PherX has produced some definite- and interesting- results, not all of them necessarily welcome (ever been &amp;#34;huffed&amp;#34; by a teenager?</li>
            <li>Recieved my order very fast.</li>
            <li>You only need one spray and it smells great and definitely gets you more attention from the opposite sex.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping by the way.</li>
            <li>In certain situations did she notice my scent a little more, maybe feel a bit of a more animal attraction?</li>
            <li>but I guess a little help is always good.</li>
            <li>you coming to bed?&amp;#34; Although we have a very nice love life she&#x27;s seldom &#x27;ready to go&#x27; when she&#x27;s tired, so this was unusual.</li>
            <li>Pherx has a nice subtle smell, i can&#x27;t say for sure if the spray or a placebo is at work</li>
            <li>I liked the scent and it seemed to last for a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I can also say that younger people seem to respond more strongly to it (or maybe they&#x27;re simply more impulsive and less reserved with their reactions?).</li>
            <li>I want to thank you for producing such an amazing product, normally I&#x27;m a skeptic, but</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>women do seem to see me more and say a couple extra sentences while I am wearing this.</li>
            <li>When I first wore it</li>
            <li>Girls become more interested when wearing this, definitely going to keep using it.</li>
            <li>This is my first reveiw im making out of 5 products on amazon,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I definitely have noticed a lot more attention in my direction.</li>
            <li>However, while giving you confidence on the day you&#x27;re wearing it, your confidence in the day you&#x27;re not will drop to-9000 so my only advice is considering this before you buy it :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;PherX Pheromone Cologne helps you to be more noticed by the opposite sex.</li>
            <li>I will say that it smells more like alcohol than I would have hoped, but I simply simply combine it with another cologne.</li>
            <li>Sure enough however girls were complementing me on how I smelled and even got a couple numbers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it will have alot more females approaching you</li>
            <li>I have found that if interested, the woman will come in closer out of curiosity.</li>
            <li>I also notice that girls become a lot more open and chatty... but</li>
            <li>I first found out about PherX on Youtube.  </li>
            <li>It works like a charm with most women but not all women are the same so don&#x27;t expect attention from all ladys.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time before work on friday morning.</li>
            <li>I am 46, but I&#x27;m well-known there by the younger waitresses who are mostly college students and am friends with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Women who knew me before I started using it suddenly started showing a lot more interested.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting that they all the sudden start flirting alot with you.</li>
            <li>at first, there was a glitch with the shipping.</li>
            <li>and I get more lasting glances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had this much attention in years!</li>
            <li>she likes how it smells different every time :)</li>
            <li>I get more attention by wearing regular cologne.  </li>
            <li>This does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was gonna work, and I don&#x27;t notice anything except my girlfriend can&#x27;t keep her hands off of me.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, they are the first to initiate a conversation with me.</li>
            <li>I would like proving something more concentrated on a future.</li>
            <li>for the mixed reviews... scent is one of the most subjective things out there.</li>
            <li>In my experience this stuff simply makes others view you more favorably (and if they already like you, it seems to intensify that)...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 40 and happily married</li>
            <li>I bought this to see if female customers tip and/or flirt more...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;Pheromones&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t going to magically change human nature.</li>
            <li>Some are more receptive at different times.</li>
            <li>So I believe if you mixed it with lotion, it will be much better.</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Girls definitely take notice more.  </li>
            <li>, she said it smells funny.</li>
            <li>More attention from ladies, even at the bank women never speak to me but with this I not only get spoken to today.....</li>
            <li>Just wear it for the first time.</li>
            <li>a Phone number I didn&#x27;t expect and an invitation for lunch by a hot chick.</li>
            <li>The First Time I Used The Product.</li>
            <li>I Think Should Really Give It A Try!</li>
            <li>here&#x27;s the funny bit; PherX e-mailed me with a request.</li>
            <li>But The female that was over my house was more in a rush to get her clothes off then me.</li>
            <li>I think it even keep the female more turned on while having sex</li>
            <li>I began to test whether the product works, being aware not to let the placebo effect color my observations.  </li>
            <li>First one spray per day, then two sprays, I worked up to eight sprays, always with no effect.  </li>
            <li>I did notice a lot more eye contact from around the room more so than usual.</li>
            <li>This is very noticeable!</li>
            <li>Someone mentioned to us: the smell made my heart beat fast!</li>
            <li>and I definitely receive more attention.  </li>
            <li>I also found that the people who you rate as a 5, 6, or 7, lower on the scale, respond higher to this.</li>
            <li>I just do 2 on the neck, but if you are going out to something big i would spray 2 more times on your wrists.</li>
            <li>Obviously the more you have on, the easier it is for them to get attracted to you.</li>
            <li>Wore it the first day and it got her attention.</li>
            <li>Works great!, after I threw it in the garbage and dug up the courage to talk to a women myself instead of relying on some fake miracle</li>
            <li>I first purchased the oil version of this and now have the spray.  </li>
            <li>and it smelled exactly like this</li>
            <li>and Im sure they use the same bulk pheromone that Got2Be uses.</li>
            <li>I have different types pheromone&#x27;s buyed from all that this is pheromone 100% safe , this I am giving 3 rd place in world ,(</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;ll be a chick magnet all of a sudden, but do expect looks and more conversation.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this perfume and when i tried it for the first time i didn&#x27;t notice any effects.</li>
            <li>The whole night she was all over me and asked me for my number!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>i can most definitely see them starring at me .</li>
            <li>I feel that this product definitely gives me more of an edge.</li>
            <li>Show them you&#x27;re interested.</li>
            <li>great stuff, last long and gives you confidence.</li>
            <li>Smell funny  like someones piss.</li>
            <li>Obviously these guys know what they&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times, but it seemed to make more women approach me at the parties I went to.</li>
            <li>The first night I wore it</li>
            <li>Funny thing is there wasn&#x27;t any hazard shipping labels on the box.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it</li>
            <li>many been days prior to this product that I had confidence</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m married and my wife gave birth about 2-1/2 years ago.</li>
            <li>(and I don&#x27;t want them to as I&#x27;m happily married)</li>
            <li>Not only did it boost my confidence around women, it seemed like it helped women feel like i was more approachable.</li>
            <li>She said \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know what it is, but you look hot today.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Hahaha!</li>
            <li>Product did exactly what it was intended to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely plan to order more.</li>
            <li>I have to say, the ladies around me have become more &amp;#34;chatty&amp;#34; and with occasional bumping of shoulders.</li>
            <li>There was an actually recognizable difference from the amount of attention</li>
            <li>and actually, my tips were better too now that I think of it.</li>
            <li>I am 46, but I&#x27;m well-known there by the younger waitresses who are mostly college students and am friends with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells kinda funny.</li>
            <li>So I thought it would be cool to see if I got a reaction from some of the women I normally interact with.</li>
            <li>It works like a charm with most women but not all women are the same</li>
            <li>pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the first day it was applied</li>
            <li>This is the first time buying this type of product</li>
            <li>If people are paying more attention to you when wearing this PherX its probably because they smell you coming a mile off and want to go the opposite direction.</li>
            <li>This happened before to me when I first tried and used PherX Pheromone Cologne.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I did doubt it much at first</li>
            <li>I love to use this daily.</li>
            <li>is more likely to project that image, and women like men who have confidence.</li>
            <li>think most of the feed back on amazon for this product was done by bribery .&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>I really believe that this product works!</li>
            <li>The first day I wore it in the office, I notices all the women started saying hello, asking me about my day and week, what were my plans for the weekend and stuff like that.</li>
            <li>As for attractions of the opposite sex, it does get more looks</li>
            <li>Of course I bought this, and of course, I wasted a perfectly good 30 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So nothing not even a smells good i think it was a waste of money</li>
            <li>It has a subtle scent that goes well with a light cologne or after shave.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not just for single guys, it&#x27;s also great for that date night with your wife too!</li>
            <li>It MAY give you a slight edge to get them interested, but you still have to able to talk to them comfortably to close the deal so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>so once applied it will not smell the same for two different people, so it will be unique to your own chemistry.</li>
            <li>As of right now its too soon to tell if this stuff really works on attracting women.</li>
            <li>the first way is that it relaxes the people around you so they feel a certain amount of comfort around you and the second way it works is by boosting your confidence and making you more talkative...</li>
            <li>Skeptical at first but many good reviews so decided on the purchase.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing is it has a pleasant smell and can be worn as cologn so not a complete waste.</li>
            <li>is a bit strong at first, strangely no one seems to notice or complain about it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>3 of the attractive girls whom I work with spent a significantly larger amount of time visiting me at the bar</li>
            <li>this pheremone is a lilttle stinky im trying to use it around my female friends , i &#x27;ll see the results and i&#x27;ll be back to let u people know if is good or not</li>
            <li>but the overall experience was that women seemed much more relaxed and causal with me; even when talking intimately.</li>
            <li>i never believed this would work, but it smells good and worth it to try at least one time.&lt;br /&gt;next</li>
            <li>Young, old, cute</li>
            <li>I have used it for two days now, and I have made sure to hug women when possible to really give them the scent.</li>
            <li>After doing some research on countless websites, I found that one of the most appreciated pheromone sprays out there was PherX...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a waste of money .Smell is good but absolute no results.</li>
            <li>But is it a psychological thing for me giving me more confidence or does it really work on women?  </li>
            <li>works well and surprised at how nice it smells, would recommend it to any guy, noticed a big change in responses of women, ( of all ages !!).</li>
            <li>but people in general seem to be more open and friendly.  </li>
            <li>It is lighter smelling than most of the other cologne that I own and I will have to test out how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>its high price, it&#x27;s honestly worth it</li>
            <li>He still insisted that he was totally positive it made a difference.</li>
            <li>and I have gotten nothing but positive results every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I seem to have positive results.  </li>
            <li>I would say positive results.  </li>
            <li>I would say positive results.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe some of the positive reviews were people from PherX posing</li>
            <li>If the product works, I&#x27;ll be positive.  </li>
            <li>Some blogger said that the company was giving out gift cards if the buyer wrote a positive review.  </li>
            <li>The product does appear to cause women to respond in a positive way.  </li>
            <li>My wife appears to act positively to this product.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see any glaring positive results.  </li>
            <li>I first tried the oil which I really like a lot , but it did not have a sprayer.</li>
            <li>do notice you more as long as you want looks</li>
            <li>strange smell is softer and leave you confident.</li>
            <li>Smells great by itself or in combination with your other basic colognes.</li>
            <li>The girls do not swarm at u like world war Z or an ax commercial, but i have been a lot more smiles from some of the most expected females.</li>
            <li>This product came in pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Its the first time am using this product and it really give off a expression.</li>
            <li>I have noticed more attention and touching  after only two uses although I do not really notice a scent that pherX is supposed to have.</li>
            <li>When I first read about this product I didn&#x27;t have much believe in it.</li>
            <li>I am married, so I really just wanted to see how my wife would respond after applying it.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, got it before expected, product so far so good, I may update my review after a while of using it to give details about result.....</li>
            <li>Smells good even as an addition to you&#x27;re usual Cologne.</li>
            <li>It works just as good if not better and girls tend to like that.</li>
            <li>Very nice and subtle smell.</li>
            <li>While overpowering for some, to those with less sensitive noses it seems to have a pleasant hairspray-like smell.</li>
            <li>Not bad girly strong or musky, but not likely to get you compliments on the way you smell.as far as the pheromones go</li>
            <li>And Zyloo, for gods sake give us a little more information on your ingredients!  </li>
            <li>I only rated it 4 out of 5 stars because it is soo strong</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the scent is good and it does last a fairly long time if you apply it correctly.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend buying this and using it as often as possible.</li>
            <li>First of all I must inform that in Zyloo Laboratories they are responsible and very attentive people, with regard to the product at first its results are confusing , then I realized that they depend on many factors, as  are the mixtures with other smells of the surrounding environment, once I walking on one street where was flowing a very strong smell is countered the smell of the product, another factor is the receiving person, it is preferable use near since smell does not have much scope, also they influence the conditions of the receiving person, its frame of mind, its olfactory conditions if it has flu</li>
            <li>First day and very positive results so far.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is better when out hunting for the single ladies.</li>
            <li>It could have been pure coincidence</li>
            <li>It is pure nonsense.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but certainly, the cologne has a certain effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There is no way to say it 100%, it might be also a placebo effect, but certainly when I wear the product i notice a difference in the way women interct with me.</li>
            <li>but it does certainly</li>
            <li>No one has commented directly on me using it, but when I went to the dentist yesterday the dental assistant sure was a lot more talkative to me than she usually is.  </li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t noticed any of the pheromone effects but I will keep testing an in the mean time I have a pretty good smelling cologne</li>
            <li>Nice clean subtle smell too.</li>
            <li>So I get the cologne and it dosen&#x27;t work, right out of the box new.</li>
            <li>Smell is fine and could be used simply as a cologne - my wife loves it!</li>
            <li>Smells pretty decent.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s easy to use - has a subtle but pleasant scent - and I do get the sense at times that it is a plus in interactions with the opposite sex.</li>
            <li>Met a super cute redhead for a first date this past weekend and wore the cologne.</li>
            <li>the important part, The Performance - I &amp;#34;tested&amp;#34; it out in two main places, at work and just general living.</li>
            <li>It has a good subtle smell not over powering or funny smelling, which I was worried about.  </li>
            <li>It really is a conversation starter.</li>
            <li>I wish the sprayer didn&#x27;t shoot as much out</li>
            <li>The next few days I noticed a lot more females staring and when I would start a conversation they seemed more inclined to want to keep talking to me.</li>
            <li>I recommend spraying on your neck, wrist(skin area), don&#x27;t put too much or else it would drive females away..</li>
            <li>Like reasonable reviewers have stated, this will not have women fight over you</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much of a difference this made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked with people my whole life and did not vary my discussions, approach, or conversations towards the women I was with or around at the time.</li>
            <li>This stuff really wooorks.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any results yet.</li>
            <li>Again, not to much.</li>
            <li>Girls looked at me in a flirty way and looked really relaxed when around me.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li>she really likes?</li>
            <li>still the price should be much lower to drive sales</li>
            <li>I will continue trying to find out if you really can work to attract women ...</li>
            <li>but you really don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>product really works well</li>
            <li>was a girl that I had been trying to get with for some time, and this stuff really did not help anything.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely does not help to attract women at all.</li>
            <li>Fast reaction and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>I received this as a trial from the company and tried it out and have to say it works very well.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>This product really works....</li>
            <li>This product really works, i used the product yesterday at gym and felt the difference immediately.</li>
            <li>My wife seems to really like it and respond to it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a jerk or haven&#x27;t showered in a week, don&#x27;t expect pheromones (or anything else, really) to override that.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really tried it fully yet</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it does much</li>
            <li>This was absolutely the stupidest purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.  </li>
            <li>*** was \\&quot;snake oil\\&quot;, but I REALLY WANTED it to work.  </li>
            <li>It really made me skeptic.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know much about the product before I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I really like the sent</li>
            <li>I never thought pheromones are really working.</li>
            <li>it really works the woman i wanted to talk to me</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing period.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping my wife would notice.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend really likes the smell of pherx.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s building my confidence or if it really attracts the ladies.</li>
            <li>Any advise on this would be appreciated as I&#x27;d like to fulfill my end of the bargain.</li>
            <li>and she was being real flirty, and</li>
            <li>So much attention.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that I have to use quiet a bit to see a difference, but overall this is a great product</li>
            <li>I ordered this product on a whim, and really wanted to see what all the hype with pheromone colognes were.</li>
            <li>Everyone around me was much nicer</li>
            <li>and my husband was all touchy feely which I really like.</li>
            <li>Its scent is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I like the scent so much</li>
            <li>This product absolutely does not work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that the review is just advertising from Zyloo Research Labs posing as a review, but maybe it&#x27;s a real guy</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very susceptible to the placebo effect.      </li>
            <li>I selected the Amazon reviewers that appear to be real people because they&#x27;ve review products that are not from Zyloo Research Labs.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This product is a very affective when it comes to attracting the ladies it performance is 100% a must for a guy thats in the dating scene.</li>
            <li>I think it does work but not as much as the women will be taking off their panties to be with you.</li>
            <li>Package came in really intact and on time!&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product as a whole.</li>
            <li>Now, if you are wearing this outside, the effectiveness lessens, especially if it is really windy.</li>
            <li>Note-The company was really fast shipping.</li>
            <li>That being said, does it really matter?  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely making my life alot easier.</li>
            <li>I was sent a offer by the manufacturer to post a review for a free extra bottle.</li>
            <li>Also notice the spray doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Do have to say doesnt really smell like much.</li>
            <li>This cologne really works.</li>
            <li>This product seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li>I think it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I havent seen much change from my wife, but she did without her knowing</li>
            <li>but i dont ware colone very offten</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>I really put this product to the test and my girlfriend didnt know I purchased it.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t like its scent.</li>
            <li>And it really works.</li>
            <li>and I still wasn&#x27;t given as much attention that I received that day.</li>
            <li>I have found that just applying during the day does not change much.  </li>
            <li>Sealed very well and protected.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be unhappy with the results the attention is excellent.</li>
            <li>It was shipped fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn it a couple times and haven&#x27;t noticed any real change in people&#x27;s behavior toward me.  </li>
            <li>This product really seems to work.</li>
            <li>i didnt really talk to started coming up to me and asking how my day was etc.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t really have a smell</li>
            <li>I have to assume the stuff really makes an impact</li>
            <li>Since I have begun using this product my girlfriend seems very intriqued about how much she is attracted to my masculinity.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise and delight it is a very nice&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this product really fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks...</li>
            <li>and she didn&#x27;t like is as much as the others  </li>
            <li>the area were it is and a few mins later sit back and enjoy lol</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t so sure what to think when I got this, I have never really used a cologne before but the allure of pheromone ones tempted me.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Was not a show stopper,,, but it is real.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much when I bought this</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference.</li>
            <li>I have yet to really see any results, but I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
            <li>Really attracts the women to come to you .  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me at all.</li>
            <li>Whether this is from the scent, pheromones, or the increased confidence it really seems to be working.</li>
            <li>I have used it now for about a month and really didnt see a difference.</li>
            <li>I bought it to try it out and see how it really works.</li>
            <li>It has a very pungent smell that should be masked with a moree desirable aroma.</li>
            <li>It was shipped fast though.</li>
            <li>Since I rely heavily on what others say, then I feel that I have a duty to contribute by giving an honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>it at least will give you a confidence boost, and with all the good reviews it seems like it works.</li>
            <li>This pheromone looks to be among the few effective one.</li>
            <li>I am experimenting with different people in different situations to see just how close you need to be for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>When used in equal doses over a period of two weeks time I had far more interactions using PherX.  </li>
            <li>This has a nice smell to it, but is gone in a few hours.</li>
            <li>Use it  at work, and I had a few girls get closer and said I smell nice..</li>
            <li>Smell is pleasant and subtle.  </li>
            <li>so far no positive response may take longer,will see what happens in a few days,weeks as i go out more!!!!</li>
            <li>Not sure if there&#x27;s any correlation, but wearing this product will certainly give you more confidence!</li>
            <li>Just WOW!!!</li>
            <li>strong enough might be the normal amount.)</li>
            <li>or if it was this product but thus far i do admit that i enjoy the smell of this although its not a super strong scent</li>
            <li>on different days this one was not as good as the other</li>
            <li>The first day I didn&#x27;t see much just a little added confidence and people seemed to want to talk to me more.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I&#x27;m very interested in studying human behavior, and I wanted to see first hand if there are any synthetic pheromones in the market that can significantly affect human behavior.</li>
            <li>Even women who don&#x27;t really like my look (masculine, muscular, rough around the edges) and prefer more feminine pretty boys seem to approach me as well.</li>
            <li>When asked about it, the majority of them said even though they &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; a curious reaction about us at that particular time, they knew it was a test, but that they also notice a difference from time to time in most men.  </li>
            <li>and she seems to be a little more interested.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten more flirts and smiles than any other product.</li>
            <li>Still within my first 2 days of wearing it, so I hope to come back with more definite results.</li>
            <li>In a crowded party, a woman from across the room approaches you because you smelled sexy and she could just tell from a distance that the smell was yours and not one of the other guys?  </li>
            <li>All and all, this would be a product I would recommend if you need a little more of a edge to start a conversation while keeping them interested in you.</li>
            <li>However after opening the bottle and spraying some on I instantly was familiar with the smell.</li>
            <li>I have tried other pheremone cologne&#x27;s that I feel worked better.  </li>
            <li>Many pheremone products have an extreme musk to them.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed it on at work (sweat a lot) and was surprised how long it stayed on and I was able to smell it on for almost the whole work day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My friend bought some other pheromone colognes from a sex shop and it smelled much better</li>
            <li>have used other pheromone products and this one is comparable at a better price.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know how lady&#x27;s act yet , but product have clean smell and last up to 6 hour</li>
            <li>like the smell of it, and have noticed women generally being more open to talking</li>
            <li>we are still active in our love dept.</li>
            <li>Love it, we&#x27;ll worth the small investment.</li>
            <li>The Science of Attraction - 20mg of Human Pheromones]] and much happyer with that its not bad</li>
            <li>I normally do not find it easy to initiate conversation with women.</li>
            <li>Once again I cannot confirm for sure, it may just be psychological, but at the end of the day the product certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt or ruin your chances with the opposite sex.</li>
            <li>But it may do not mean much.</li>
            <li>and I must say I was surprised when this product arrived very quickly via shipping, and by the fact that it ACTUALLY works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But looks positive so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to spritz again one night when we can enjoy some quiet time to see if PherX is really making romance come alive...</li>
            <li>but the fact that it IS scented means you can&#x27;t pour this into your usual fragrance but have to use it by itself.&lt;br /&gt;Potency: Not as effective as advertising</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know what to except but after seeing it in action I AM A BELIEVER.</li>
            <li>and she completely blanked on the first time I asked it, and she responded with &amp;</li>
            <li>Usually they were just being nice and seemed like they had to talk to me.</li>
            <li>and she was very touchy feely which she normally isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, I am not able to say that it works, but smells nice and give you all confidence needed.</li>
            <li>I received the shipment last week in proper condition and It seems to be a good product when used occasionally</li>
            <li>2 weeks a bit short for full review.</li>
            <li>This is not magic, women won&#x27;t jump on you, but it does makes them attract to you, it does makes women behave nicely with you when they are around you.</li>
            <li>This little guy is as good as its Big brother the Oil Base!&lt;br /&gt;You can wear it as it is or mix it with any cologne</li>
            <li>A cute courtesy associate whom I&#x27;ve always greeted and only received a \\&quot;Hello\\&quot; in return, actually greeted me first and then proceeded to ask how my day was this far,</li>
            <li>Yes, I&#x27;ve gotten more attention from the opposite sex with other products but the other products I&#x27;ve used have either had a sweat odor that I could smell or just weren&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li>well,my ex-gf is jealous,but it works if you are finding for new girl, it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003H146PY PherX Pheromone Cologne for Men (Attract Women) -</li>
            <li>It is nothing more than a slight stimulant to the unthinking primal part of consciousness.</li>
            <li>Has a slight cologne smell which is OK.  </li>
            <li>a handsome fellow as is with slight confidence issues, and no effect.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible product,&lt;br /&gt;Misleading label.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li>So I have to say this review is for the a previous order which worked like a dam love potion.</li>
            <li>Tested it in restaurants, church, shopping, in the car, and basically in many public / private places.    </li>
            <li>, a girl even asked me if I was wearing a particular perfume</li>
            <li>Oil Based Pheromones do last longer, and overall tend to settle better.</li>
            <li>but those are the main things.</li>
            <li>A disadvantage is that the presentations of 30 ml is too low to use in adequate amounts.</li>
            <li>it definitely makes her more frisky (and no, I haven&#x27;t told her about it), but funnily enough she also doesn&#x27;t like the PherX scent.</li>
            <li>you still have to project confidence and have a decent appearance.</li>
            <li>Its better to use pherx when you&#x27;re going to meet a girl not just waiting for the girls talk to you which is wasting money and time because these girls in the club are not focusing on you only so they might to walk next to you and look to another guy, so they&#x27;ll be attracted to the guy they look at.</li>
            <li>It smells classic or what i call OG.</li>
            <li>Folks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the main feature of this cologne is that it can increase confidence if you are susceptible to the powers of suggestion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for several weeks and getting more attention and dates by the opposite sex..</li>
            <li>Well I did a quick spritz and left it at that.</li>
            <li>The next day I found things to be much different.... and for the better.</li>
            <li>I am not sure whether this is the placebo effect or not, but I have been pretty confident when I spray this stuff on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my girlfriend definitely seems to be more eager to have some private time.  </li>
            <li>the scent is decent.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping... received it before the shipping status said it has left the facility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have more random encounters with woman than I have ever had,  they seem to want to talk to me more and stand alot closer during the conversation.&lt;br /&gt;Gas stations,  grocery stores,  even doc office now seems to be a playground for attraction.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nor are clever one-liners and having a fancy sports car.  </li>
            <li>I did notice the first day how women seemed to get closer to talk to me in public places, I was at Starbucks the first morning</li>
            <li>and this older women was practically sitting on my lap to have a conversation.</li>
            <li>Our jobs take us into office buildings routinely, so that was our main test.  </li>
            <li>This actually works, I noticed more attention and even some women acting nervous</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very masculine scent and very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before with limited but positive results, so I ordered some more from Amazon and got it yesterday and put some on when I went out to play trivia at the local pub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before with limited but positive results, so I ordered some more from Amazon and got it yesterday and put some on when I went out to play trivia at the local pub.</li>
            <li>most of them who don&#x27;t keep long conversations just happens to stick around longer much longer further when i pass girls on the street</li>
            <li>Smells good though, so don&#x27;t worry about that part at least!</li>
            <li>but I have high expectations.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product, two squirts</li>
            <li>but it cost is high</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone, men or women.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and the added bonus</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s a placebo effect, but when I wear this cologne I feel that I have received more positive attention from people.  </li>
            <li>Even if it&#x27;s psychological, the smell blends nicely with other colognes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you want to standout more than the average Joe!</li>
            <li>This Cologne smells like aftershave, just a little better.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s mostly alcohol and contains extremely little pheromones.      </li>
            <li>so I will keep using and taking advantage of this little magic attractant.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>I would recamend this product to anyone looking to get a little more out of the art of scent accesories.</li>
            <li>I am very encouraged with the results so far.</li>
            <li>WOW this stuff really works as advertised</li>
            <li>Within probably 5-10 minutes of being in the bar she came over and started talking to me, we ended up chatting for nearly the whole night over 2</li>
            <li>and so far I would say it really works.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see an effect in everyday interactions but seemed to notice one when I was already on a date or in a setting where you are looking for a sexual partner...</li>
            <li>Smell is normal ...accepted....</li>
            <li>Did not do much, so safe to say this was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the product, I use it everyday with my cologne, price is somewhat steep</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t notice a big difference but does smell good, the bottle is small for the price i think, I don&#x27;t know if I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li>I, like I&#x27;m sure many of you are, was very skeptical at first.</li>
            <li>if you have the extra money its definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Certainly worth the money, and definitely helped boost my confidence.</li>
            <li>I plan on using this product with much success in the future!</li>
            <li>The boyfriend of one of them could smell it, so I am guessing that men are able to really pick up that scent but woman can&#x27;t, or at least as much as we can.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Got to have good game also.</li>
            <li>Plastic bottle is less likely to break than glass which is nice.</li>
            <li>My social life has advanced immensely.  </li>
            <li>DId a simple test by spraying this on the subway platform right before I boarded the train.  </li>
            <li>left and right</li>
            <li>I got the product in the mail and put it on right before i went to class, i&#x27;m in college and today this girl in my class started talking to me out of the blue</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just starting with pheromones, the price seems about right.</li>
            <li>I Received a $10 Certificate from this Company if I gave them a positive feed back, this is Very wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I did feel a bit more confident because of it, so its hard to say at this point if the extra attention is from the smells, or the extra confidence on my part.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;d recommend using this with a little caution and only around the kind of women you want to attract.</li>
            <li>I was afraid it might not smell very good, but i was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even mention I had purchased a new cologne she just called me out and said she didn&#x27;t want me to wear it ever again.  </li>
            <li>nothing new</li>
            <li>Well, no one has even noticed I am wearing a new cologne.</li>
            <li>I have started getting lots of hugs each day, and the new running joke is that after a hug, the women giggle and exclaim, &amp;#34;I smell like Dan!!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I decided to try something new</li>
            <li>but no I didn&#x27;t see anything new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost about to buy a new one</li>
            <li>Used at work and didnt notice anything new from co-worker.</li>
            <li>, I tried it on wrist and the smell was fine, but only if you had your nose right up to it, up to a half hour</li>
            <li>shipping of this product was fast and discreet, and i recieved it a day before the estimated shipping time.&lt;br /&gt;i ordered this product as an impulse buy with low expectations and was not expecting much from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cologne doesn&#x27;t really have much of an odor, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any response from women different from when I&#x27;m not wearing it.</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle but nice.  </li>
            <li>I turn around and there all behind me following me lol</li>
            <li>The girls will chat with you longer than the normal, they pay more attention to the talk and it seems that want to stay with you longer than the usual.</li>
            <li>All in all, if it really works or not, I think it is worth a try if your are curious.</li>
            <li>Not sure how much more potential this stuff has, but a little attention is always nice.</li>
            <li>Not sure that I&#x27;ve noticed any difference in wearing this product over any other good cologne I&#x27;ve worn, but I can say that it does have a pleasing scent, and I will update this review if any noticeable effects do really reveal themselves from the pheromones.</li>
            <li>Very Masculine smell.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for such products.</li>
            <li>Using very sparingly, maybe I&#x27;ll try a little more next time as it just sprays out</li>
            <li>I recently bought this product more or less for the fun of it and to see if it could actually work.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I got home and ordered my own bottle!</li>
            <li>first of all it takes an alpha male attitude and body language to attract...</li>
            <li>i did notice a girl whom i&#x27;ve spoken to in the past at the gym act a lot more peppy when i spoke with her</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed not only women go out of their to talk to me, but also I seemed to get more respect from other employees (men)</li>
            <li>I tried the oil first, thinking it would last longer.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It definitely made a difference the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That was a month ago and now I&#x27;ll buy it definitely again because it really works!</li>
            <li>It does have some affect on females only if they are already interested.</li>
            <li>Much better price than other similar products I have used.  </li>
            <li>probably this is my first review ever, I think this product will not do too obvious effect.</li>
            <li>( generally, I don&#x27;t wear that much fragrance stuffs, so maybe to me</li>
            <li>i just got this 2 days ago, i sprayed some on and had a female friend come over, i had just made some enchiladas so the kitchen was smelling greasy, anyways as soon as my friend walked in, first words she said were: \\&quot;</li>
            <li>This stuff actually works pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So apparently, you also don&#x27;t need to join online dating sites or hang out at night clubs to meet women and really do nothing but just sit there and let them come to you.  </li>
            <li>They seem to be friendlier and more responsive than usual.</li>
            <li>Women have been gravitating to me more than usual.</li>
            <li>Product smells a bit strong so use a little each time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars just because I personally think it smells good, maybe a bit subtle, but (like the oil)</li>
            <li>but i think it was strange that someone would move their seat farther back, where the veiw was not as good as where they were previously sitting.  </li>
            <li>I used it two nights later prior to going out, it has a nice smell on it&#x27;s own, and applied to neck etc, but I also sprayed some cologne on my chest as normal, needless to say it seemed as if it worked!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from this, I wore it every day in the Summer and pushed myself in public, no extra attention, nothing special.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used pherx for two days now and have had woman at work and from the bar being extra nice to me and wanting to talk longer than usual.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curious if statistically I was just lucky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant smell, kinda reminds me of my dad (in a non creepy way).</li>
            <li>But it does fade away a little quick!</li>
            <li>Wish I could write a positive review because i was hoping this product actually worked.</li>
            <li>It got their attention, but after that it was up to us to keep them interested.&lt;br /&gt;Trying to single out one particular woman didn&#x27;t do much, andworked better when a small group was gathered for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Long lasting fresh scent - I like it just for that !</li>
            <li>The last two times I saw her at large gatherings with friends</li>
            <li>At first I used it only but then combined it with my habitual perfume as to give a touch to this one that is stronger and of major scope.</li>
            <li>Attraction to the scent wears off quickly as the sense of smell becomes desensitized, just like any other smell.</li>
            <li>Seems to make &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; a little easier!! :)</li>
            <li>The body language they had was a clear giveaway.</li>
            <li>I was a big skeptic of the whole pheromone thing</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the added confidence that did it or if the cologne helped, but I never got one from a complete stranger before the cologne.</li>
            <li>so I put it on as instructed (directly on skin and not on clothes)without letting her know.</li>
            <li>actually 1 of the girls at work was smelling me and said that there was soothing on me that really like that</li>
            <li>and I noticed women were actually naturally coming towards me.</li>
            <li>girls go wild</li>
            <li>Been using this for about a week so far.  </li>
            <li>Stay far from this one.</li>
            <li>stay far from this one.</li>
            <li>I notice alot more looks and smiles when I wear it, if it&#x27;s a placebo ( which it&#x27;s not) at least it boosts confidence.</li>
            <li>You have some of that naturally</li>
            <li>It still is some classy smelling Cologne, though.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>lightly spritzed it on and also heavily applied</li>
            <li>and i will definitely be buying another bottle very soon.  </li>
            <li>Of course it takes some effort in actually approaching women, but when I have, I do have get very receptive responses.</li>
            <li>but I thought I&#x27;d give some comments so far.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>bought this to try it and so far it seems to be working how to keep trying a longer to see how well</li>
            <li>You just have to determine how fast you want to buy the next bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think less is more, better to be subtle then obvious.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tested this product out completely, it could have just been a fluke.</li>
            <li>, I surprised my girlfriend at work</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really all you need to expect out of this product, and totally what I wanted out of it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s only one way to really find out...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young guy.</li>
            <li>To complete this review.</li>
            <li>but I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>always end with a wild atraction</li>
            <li>because, as I said, it&#x27;s a bit early in the process for me to make a call on its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>since she is sensitive to smell.</li>
            <li>I of course didn&#x27;t try anything on them, so I can&#x27;t say if they were aroused by the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what sort of effect it has on females in regards to sexual attraction, but I have noticed that the women around me have been friendlier lately.</li>
            <li>/ aroused.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing PherX to work the last few days and have noticed I receive a lot more attention from the ladies in my office.  </li>
            <li>Fresh scent - not much results beyond that.</li>
            <li>I can only tell you that it is worth that extra look.  </li>
            <li>I tested this a few times when go outside and notice a difference in the way woman approach me (they are more receptive).</li>
            <li>I just want to take the experiment more extreme, since the stripper sniffed my neck, she started kissing my nick which is not normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been able to use the product a few times but I like it.</li>
            <li>The first date ended up lasting 6 hours, nothing naughty happened, but we had loads of fun</li>
            <li>It smelled decent, but I never got any compliments or enhanced attraction out in social encounters.</li>
            <li>Only good for giving false hope.</li>
            <li>you only can have synthetic pheromones, what a loud of nonsense!!!</li>
            <li>So for me, it is just a small boost, but for others less experienced it can make a big difference.</li>
            <li>The price is a little high if it is just cologne, but if it actually works then I will update my review later to 5 stars and buy more bottles.</li>
            <li>As long as your expectations are realistic and not ridiculous, I would recommend trying this.</li>
            <li>So I got half the product at full price and can&#x27;t spray it on.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell if my (female) co-workers were just being nice as usual or if they actually were affected by the pheromones.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have such a small bottle in case you don&#x27;t want to travel with a larger cologne bottle.</li>
            <li>It has been used in several social settings and I have received a couple of positive comments on the cologne I was wearing.</li>
            <li>seems to get attention, subtle but noticed some women wanting to talk more, opening up to conversation faster?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure the product works as most of us expect it to work, however I can definitely say that it does make feel cnfident .</li>
            <li>I used as directed and tried it out in different situations, the first was dinner at a local steak house</li>
            <li>First bottle I have ever bought and will definitely buy another when my current one runs out.</li>
            <li>After using it for only a short time I have already noticed a difference in the way women look at me, while also having a higher self-confidence knowing that I have this stuff on.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but women will notice you more with this on.</li>
            <li>They were like an old gym bag, but PherX actually smells like a normal cologne.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that she didn&#x27;t complain about the scent, (I can&#x27;t say if what happened next was because of the spray, since it&#x27;s normal in a relationship.)</li>
            <li>High end colognes both men&#x27;s and woman&#x27;s contain pheromone as a propitiatory ingredient, and both work the same way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scents</li>
            <li>I bought this product with high expectations, it is a total lie.</li>
            <li>Im a masculine gay guy and can be confused for straight, but I have women tripping over me to talk.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a about  a week  now and have really noticed a marked increase of attention from my female coworkers.  </li>
            <li>Well, lately, my wife is taking more of an interest in what I&#x27;m saying, &amp; will occasionally give me a soft pat on the hand.</li>
            <li>I received above normal attention from women.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>goes a little quick</li>
            <li>It burns a little bit when you spray it on, but that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a uniqe, long lasting, mild fragrence that adds the element of attraction and an overall scence of confidence.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just trying to help other guys who are looking for a decent pheromone cologne at a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;Max</li>
            <li>The previous one I ordered was a little more oily which made it last longer and scent was much nicer.</li>
            <li>I have had mixed results with trying new pheromone products but was hopeful about this one after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the whole side of the bus that i was sitting on was open with 7 or 8 seats and instead of sitting a couple seats over theysat in the seat directly next to me and started talking to me</li>
            <li>this product is aa a total scam, it says on the bottle it consists of human pheromones, really???</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t buy to attract other women, just wanted to see if my wife noticed me smell different and possibly pay a little more attention.</li>
            <li>I noticed a higher level of attention by the other girls.</li>
            <li>First time I used it I didn&#x27;t need to introduce myself to other ladies at my work.</li>
            <li>It is priced half as much as the normal cologne I wear anyway.</li>
            <li>After the first time I&#x27;ve tried pushing the sprayer down only 1/2 way or less if possible although this isn&#x27;t easy to do.  </li>
            <li>When I first saw the review I got very curious</li>
            <li>I tried this product before in the past, and now that I&#x27;m single again, I decided to try it out once more.</li>
            <li>The actual fragrance is a little bit odd or cheap or something, so I added a few drops of my favorite citrus aftershave.</li>
            <li>This product is a pure scam, it doesn&#x27;t do what it is suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;There were absolutely no change in behaviour by any one after wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li>I recommend it in closed places, in my long-term opinion it seems that if it has certain effect.</li>
            <li>The evenings were also tested, in restaurants and bars/clubs.&lt;br /&gt;We also had access to a K9 trained to locate missing people.&lt;br /&gt;Our individual notes, showed a little over half of the women, both in the offices and in clubs, reacted more friendly when we had the attractant on.&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
            <li>It smells amazing though...like expensive cologne.</li>
            <li>general</li>
            <li>Also just people in general.</li>
            <li>I could barely smell it</li>
            <li>Thanks but no thanks Zyloo.</li>
            <li>I will be testing another pheromone cologne for men (attract women) in the near future.</li>
            <li>I bought the Pherx bottle for an early Christmas gift this year and the results were definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li>That next morning I was pleasently surprised to have a uninterupted minute of romance before our child came around...</li>
            <li>Seems to have desired effect as far as I can tell, will definitely leave complete review at a later date</li>
            <li>As others have said before, this isn&#x27;t going to fix all that is wrong with you and magically make all your women problems vanish, but you will at least get noticed more which could lead to something over not being noticed at all.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want your *Top Secret* formulary, just which pheromones I&#x27;m saturating myself with.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, spend it on a book or something useful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it fairly consistently for the past couple of weeks squirting behind each ear and to be totally honest</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first,then when i tried it for the first time i definitely noticed females being more social toward me and not having to exert any extra effort!and as for the smell</li>
            <li>I previously reviewed this product with 2 words (GOOD STUFF), was not good enough for amazon policies!</li>
            <li>This product came in about Tuesday of this week, so far i&#x27;ve had nothing currently change in my social interactions ...</li>
            <li>tried this, and the one woman I pulled in for a quick goodbye hug stopped with a visible desire to keep the conversation going longer than she&#x27;d intended just a few seconds prior.</li>
            <li>Im not sure if it was a lucky night for me</li>
            <li>I was interested in the fragrance but think a little mild aftershave is probably better and less expensive.</li>
            <li>This or any other cologne, really.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting more smiles from girls and even had this girl who hated me smile at me for the first time.</li>
            <li>Product has been used once and appears to enhance social interactions.</li>
            <li>I am sorry to say but as far as I was able to tell this product has no effect on women.</li>
            <li>I suggest doing a little research first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only been using it for a short time, so I will try to update this review if I notice any  major affects.</li>
            <li>People in general were drawn to me in a mysterious way.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable compared to other similar items.</li>
            <li>thanks for stealing my money for a watered down product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested this product in several venues (work, church, bar, social settings)...  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in terms of my social interactions with the opposite sex.</li>
            <li>I have recently received this product and was astounded even after the first few uses.</li>
            <li>Envy is not cheap, but the low end of higher quality.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s not a miracle worker; you still need to look presentable and be able to act normal and have a little game.</li>
            <li>and I was very surprised by her comment as I have never heard her nor expected her to say anything like that.  </li>
            <li>I normally wear it with a splash of my other cologne.</li>
            <li>Only down side was that it did not last the whole night.</li>
            <li>I have had a number of other products much like this one, but not nearly with similar results.</li>
            <li>You would be better off using water, saving the $30, and at the very least water will quench your thirst unlike this snake oil!</li>
            <li>Recently the company sent me a sample of this product in the &amp;#34;Oil&amp;#34; version, the smell is much stronger so a little goes along way.</li>
            <li>a little does go a long way,im jus finishing up my first and.</li>
            <li>I did read a lot of different post from a lot of different website, both good and bad, I still ordered the product anyway.</li>

            <li> It worked great.it works great with my own Cologne</li>
            <li> loved this product.</li>
            <li> :smells good ,going to try it for a week , but would like to try PherX Pheromone Oil for Men (Attract Women) -</li>
            <li> It smells good also.</li>
            <li> and someone else I loved.....</li>
            <li> It smells good.</li>
            <li> it will help others to notice all the good things that you have going on.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for a week, and being around many beautiful women where I work</li>
            <li> I love it works great and smells well.and my girlfriend loves the way it smells on me</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, I had a lot of fun with it  </li>
            <li> I am very glad.</li>
            <li> I would suggest the formulators add more of the attractive scent.    </li>
            <li> If someone wears a supposed attractant and is expecting it to work they will probably try to make themselves more attractive</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> LOTS of great looking girls at this place and many women I&#x27;ve met through friends.</li>
            <li> it is a great product and i love it.</li>
            <li> this cologne is great ladies love it</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and doesnt require too many sprays.  </li>
            <li> Some days more attractive then others, and it was rather normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reason there are probably so many good reviews is because the product gives you a 10 dollar amazon gift card if you write a good review about them here.</li>
            <li> NOT A LIE, I get more attention!</li>
            <li> I have so many dates now that I can&#x27;t even keep up!</li>
            <li> it has that musty smell that women love!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne!</li>
            <li> The women at my office love how I smell!  </li>
            <li> I love the scent and consider it a working tool!</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome.</li>

            <li> I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> Interesting results!</li>
            <li> She has been a lot more flirty since I&#x27;ve been using this!</li>
            <li> Love the product works like it says!  </li>
            <li> Will buy again for sure!  </li>
            <li> It smells better and applies easier!</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;d slide her&#x27;s over to continue touching!</li>
            <li> Whether it is the (PherX) or not I cannot say for my wife is not the elaborate kind of women!</li>
            <li> I will be getting some more of this PherX !</li>
            <li> I give the pleasant fragrance 4 stars but have noticed no changes in the expressed sexual interest of women.</li>
            <li> It smells good and works great with my true religion cologne which gets a ton of compliments.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, not overpowering or potent.  </li>
            <li> Great fragrance and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> went to the movies yesterday and sprayed myself twice before going in one nice girl was staring at me till the movie was over this product really works!!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> , if you want to smell like a billy goat wearing cheap cologne (that is attractive?)</li>
            <li> Pherx was simply amazing to me</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product,I wore it on the bed for my girl friend and she did not allow me to sleep for the night at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item is amazing.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> fool yourself to believe you can get this product to help you pull women and do better than a good after shave&lt;</li>
            <li> Product had a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if the chemicals are effective.  </li>
            <li> it has a nice fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> a good night for me is 3 at the most</li>
            <li> Women are more receptive some even compliment me on how good I look.</li>
            <li> but I can honestly say it this product does attract women</li>
            <li> you do have to keep in mind with any pheromone cologne the scent will adapt to your own body heat (aka pulse points)</li>
            <li> do give it a try because women respond nicely to a man who looks empowered.</li>
            <li> If you want to give it a try I honestly don&#x27;t see the harm in it for the price.</li>
            <li> I find that for me, Gucci Envy is a nice combination.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, pheromone products aren&#x27;t like what the Axe commercials show, but it&#x27;s always nice to get dose in within 2-3 sprays.</li>
            <li> I have a background in biology and chemistry and can honestly say that scientists do acknowledge the existence of chemical attractants called pheromones.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you if it truly works, but it sure has given me confidence; maybe just because I smell so good.</li>
            <li> I bought the PherX Pheromone Cologne for Men and I am absolutely thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> and it will make you popular amongst your group of people and people</li>
            <li> I have not tested yet how effective there are attracting women</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband after trying and loving the pherx to attract men.  </li>
            <li> It also has a nice scent to it as well.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because of the nice smell.</li>
            <li> and I liked it</li>
            <li> Upon attracting females, it is up to the person using the product to then be able to make a good impression.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell</li>
            <li> I am kind of nervous to try this out.</li>
            <li> Liked the idea..has a nice scent but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> IT WAS A NICE EXPERIMENT</li>
            <li> LMAO</li>
            <li> Pherx has a really nice smell to it, like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I know is has some kind of effect on people.</li>
            <li> , I dont wear my own perfumes when wearing this cologne.</li>
            <li> It did affect someone&#x27;s behavior, my own.</li>
            <li> It creates a kind of placebo effect that boosts your confidence.</li>
            <li> Am nice looking</li>
            <li> a good night for me is 3 at the most</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this scent does work.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have an oily feel, nice &amp; crisp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is effective.  </li>
            <li> and I must honestly say it makes talking to people alot easier</li>
            <li> and when I use it my girlfriend does comment that I smell nice</li>
            <li> Please dont Purchase these kind of snake oils which just eat up your money and do nothing..</li>
            <li> I ordered this, just wondering how effective this sort of product could be.</li>
            <li> Honestly the smell is not noticeable but the effect was.</li>
            <li> The spray container is really handy.</li>
            <li> All that is needed now is to develop a soap of some kind with this product.</li>
            <li> As I pass by good looking girls they turn around more often and some even try to strike up conversations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice scent that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Nice scent to it</li>
            <li> the scent is something to be disired kind of a genaric scent i have purchesed the oil without scent[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Pheromones do work, an this product is an effective pheromone.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get a refund either, it&#x27;s considered hazardous to ship.</li>

            <li> Honestly though, you can&#x27;t argue with the results it&#x27;s given me.</li>
            <li> I honestly believe the manish smell helps with women besides the pheromones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> To be honest</li>
            <li> Product smells nice.</li>

            <li> Has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mostly trying it out of curiosity and it seems to have good reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m just recouping after losing someone I liked alot....</li>
            <li> I tried it both with my own cologne and without and both showed no reaction with women</li>
            <li> Make sure to follow the instructions, and it&#x27;s best to use right after you shower.</li>
            <li> women loved the smell and was very friendly.</li>
            <li> I noticed two things, people were generally more pleasant and approachable and I had more confidence.</li>
            <li> The product has a pleasant smell once it settles and made me feel more confident.</li>
            <li> Smells like a pleasant cologne and its fine as is.</li>
            <li> co workers and girls noticed the new smell, told me it smells great!</li>

            <li> It works very strongly.</li>
            <li> Very strong alcohol smell too.  </li>
            <li> like I smell like, another good place is right on the side of your abdomen and on your clothes seems good try not to rub it in</li>
            <li> I feel more popular with women than before.</li>
            <li> Honestly if this stuff worked they wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep it in stock.  </li>
            <li> This company and product suck ,they offer you a free bottle in exchange for a good review.</li>
            <li> amazing how ladies are noticing me more than without the majical cologne</li>
            <li> More smiles and nice reactions from women</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take more than a spray or two to make you smell nice.</li>
            <li> But ,do not expect that some kind of magic will happen...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells nice like an aftershave because it&#x27;s mostly alcohol, just like an aftershave.      </li>
            <li> The pheromone oil has a nice scent to it however it is a bit more greasy than the cologne since it is oil based.  </li>
            <li> Its the best product I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> One week after I received this in the mail, I got an email from their Customer Service requesting me to leave a good review of this product on Amazon and promised to send me the PherX Oil for free.</li>
            <li> I like better today, am I being more charming, confident, and</li>
            <li> far one of the best products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> she is not that nice most of the time and even ask me to stay and talk for a time .</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain how wonderful this product has been thus far.</li>
            <li> it was something new to try on a girlfriend , an it worked magnificently, I will Definately buy more</li>
            <li> I like it and, my girl friends like it.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced super sexual attraction effect like the Axe ad yet, but I hope that happens soon.</li>
            <li> The scent is very pleasing and beside the overt angle of attracting women, it is also a good product for sales individuals!</li>
            <li> I bought the product and the smell is good, and now each time, I talked with a woman, I feel more comfortable than I used to.</li>
            <li> I guess the most honest review I could give is that I would gladly pay for another bottle once this one is gone.  </li>
            <li> It smelled nice and it made me more confident.</li>
            <li> all great product though, fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> In retrospect, that review is just too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> This is especially true if you sweet a lot.</li>
            <li> I tryout it that be good and cool</li>
            <li> OK except the smell is strong!</li>
            <li> I honestly think that it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> it has a nice smell and it does not smell too strong and gives people headaches.</li>
            <li> These colognes actually smell great and get pleasant responses for me.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> The pheromones are masked by the cologne, which has a very good, masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Ive noticed women are talking to me more and more</li>
            <li> Just more snake oil to get your money.</li>
            <li> Wife has been more touchy since my purchase.</li>
            <li> More research is needed :)</li>
            <li> Or coming and talking to me more.</li>
            <li> The attraction is better when use this product of the pheromone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s slightly more potent in the oil version, but the spray bottle is arguably more convenient.  </li>
            <li> its better than no attention at all.</li>
            <li> Need more time to try it</li>
            <li> Call it a magic formula where in reality is it nothing but a $15 scam.</li>
            <li> I can agree with most of the five star reviews.</li>
            <li> but it does make people seem to feel more relaxed when it is worn.</li>
            <li> I have never been approached by so many girls in one night.</li>
            <li> It has an okay fragrance.</li>
            <li> Okay, as for the smell.. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything</li>
            <li> I believe it works more when going out or having a conversation with one girl.</li>
            <li> In fact, a lot of women I meet seem to be more chatty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok as others I had my doubts.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m looking forward to some more trials.</li>
            <li> Women touch my face and body much more when I&#x27;m wearing them.</li>
            <li> A bit nothing more.</li>
            <li> PherX is a great product that really works.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to buy it more</li>
            <li> Woman would not be able to discern source if you&#x27;re with a group.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the magical bullet you think.&lt;br /&gt;Telling</li>
            <li> Thing is I did ok with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use more too see better results</li>
            <li> And perhaps there will be a placebo effect for some people that will give them more confidence and, in turn, make them more attractive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If there was any noticable effect, it was that women seem more relaxed.</li>
            <li> I combine this with my favorite cologne and head out.</li>
            <li> i was 100% satisfied with the product  </li>
            <li> a couple friends say it smells ok...</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in the way she would act towards me: a lot more flirty and touchy.</li>
            <li> Women are from nowhere saying Hello more than before.</li>
            <li> you believ your self more</li>
            <li> i love the smell</li>
            <li> but if you want more then that is up to you but do not expect it to do the work for you</li>
            <li> And me and my girl friend love it</li>
            <li> They are more receptive to you.</li>
            <li> I never felt so confident as when I used pherx.&lt;br /&gt;encourage</li>
            <li> I made sure to wear it every time I was around her, but it did not do anything to help.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like she was attracted to me more when I didn&#x27;t wear</li>
            <li> When I am out, I can tell more woman want to be around me and that they seem more approachable.</li>
            <li> Girls became more engaged in trying to keep a conversation going.</li>
            <li> Had a lady approach me and calling me sexy and touching me in the mall ...</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> It by no means makes them fall head over heels for you, but it does seem to have women approach me more often.</li>
            <li> but they want to be closer and are more flirty than ever.  </li>
            <li> Will order more.</li>
            <li> but i (like many others) have done some observation.</li>
            <li> Something interesting</li>
            <li> I have been noticing more females smiling at me.</li>
            <li> n not so cute.</li>
            <li> and I know it works for sure</li>
            <li> The women I speak to are more receptive to my conversation.</li>
            <li> Also, I have found that they spend more time in my personal space, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend  it to others....</li>
            <li> I use another cologne on top of it (Farenheit, her favorite-</li>
            <li> but I find that when I wear this product,  more women are around me and definitely more &amp;#34;touchy-feely&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I think many just have placebo effect but that my opinion.</li>
            <li> smell is FANTASTIC and my GIRLFRIEND loves it!</li>
            <li> noticed any more attention then when before ever using the product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and I am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s one problem of this product which is the smell doesn&#x27;t take more than 5 mint.</li>
            <li> Just got it...tried it once so far...not sure of results....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it truly works or if its just a placebo effect, but it has made me more confident in my endeavors.</li>
            <li> I have a fiance and it has made her more affectionate when I wear it</li>
            <li> Light smell and lasts all day if you were wondering about it!</li>
            <li> I know that it won&#x27;t help you bed all the ladies because before all that women were just alot nicer and much more closer to me during the day.</li>
            <li> When I used it I am not just seeing the girls looking at me, but more that that</li>
            <li> Ok, so, I think it helps but can&#x27;t be 100% sure because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice no change in how women relate to me which is mostly ignore....  </li>
            <li> The magic is in the person, but whatever works.</li>
            <li> but still :) This cannot happen from the sky.</li>
            <li> PhreX is Magical.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and she couldn&#x27;t stop touching me</li>
            <li> , i will be buying more no doubt about that, i owe it all to pherx</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sure does give you a confidence boost.</li>
            <li> But Sure Got Noticed With All The Smiles And Attention.</li>
            <li> I do notice that she is more \\&quot;touchy feely\\</li>
            <li> All i know is that they show more attention.</li>
            <li> , I tried it, and I think that it made her irritable :-)</li>
            <li> This product is okay,</li>
            <li> I am perfectly satisfied with PherX.  </li>
            <li> The spray version of this is ok.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually smells awesome too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many times when time meet the peoples but does not make any difference.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> If you must I&#x27;m not going to be able to stop you, but please know that you will basically smell like rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li> but i dont know for sure about that one</li>
            <li> One guy wrote, \\&quot;I have never been approached by so many girls in one night.</li>
            <li> but it seems to work :)</li>
            <li> I have used both Scent Of Eros (My favorite) and Shikari.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off without it.</li>
            <li> and the conversations went better.</li>
            <li> and it attracted many women.</li>
            <li> It is still too soon to know for sure</li>
            <li> You still gotta me a man and approach because most women aren&#x27;t gonna throw themselves at you.</li>
            <li> Product seams to work better</li>
            <li> It might be placebo, but they seem more responsive when I am wearing PherX. As for Zyloo Research Labs-</li>
            <li> This product does work, but there are many variables to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that this works best indoors, the smaller the room</li>
            <li> I would of gave this a 5 if it was more potent</li>
            <li> I feel that women feel an increased attraction to me , I notice women checking me out more</li>
            <li> My wife even said I smelled nice and has been more aggressive and attentive.  </li>
            <li> Am I being more confident?  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am well pleased.  </li>
            <li> It also combines well with EDT and/or cologne as a top layer (around the neck and wrists).</li>
            <li> I know I DO get more play.</li>
            <li> DID receive this item free of charge to give an honest review...  </li>
            <li> admittedly haven&#x27;t had many chances to use it yet, but I have noticed a lot more attention from girls when I do.  </li>
            <li> Smells ok</li>
            <li> now i won&#x27;t say for sure that it&#x27;s my homemade cologne, but it does make you wonder....</li>
            <li> used it at the gym...and can already tell the ladies making more of an attempt to get my attention...</li>
            <li> and i tried this in many environments..</li>
            <li> I tried this for many days and NO RESULTS..</li>
            <li> Noticed more attention from women at work and my wife.</li>
            <li> Noticed more women talked to me throughout the day on my route.</li>
            <li> The ladies love the smell though</li>
            <li> Most women will pay more attention to you and even get excited/nervous.</li>
            <li> my lady love it not greasy or oily</li>
            <li> This one seems a bit more &amp;#34;misty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Anyways, it&#x27;s a interesting cologne to have, you will see the change.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> But decided to try based on many online reviews...</li>
            <li> I like the oil better.  </li>
            <li> I can already tell that I am flirted with more and girls show me more attention.  </li>
            <li> but I can say the wife does appear to be more touchy feely when I wear this.  </li>
            <li> I love science.</li>
            <li> I cannot confirm for sure that the product works, but I feel that women feel an increased attraction to me while wearing the product.  </li>
            <li> I notice women checking me out more often</li>
            <li> And the more i wear it the more</li>
            <li> I love the smell, hopefully it will work for me soon</li>
            <li> Does nothing smells ok but in no way does this do what it says it does.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel more confident/</li>
            <li> this product nreall helps ,i am glad to have tried it and will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> If it works it&#x27;s because it makes you believe more in your abilities.</li>
            <li> Who knows if this product works, there&#x27;s too many variables, but I like the smell.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have seen better responses from women (but who knows if that&#x27;s the placebo effect).</li>
            <li> Women were definitely more attracted to me.</li>
            <li> me as a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> If I were to spend more than $30 on cologne</li>
            <li> I will combine this with my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> look at the mirror make sure u look okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Will have to use it longer to better see if it is 100% working.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using this product, girls are much more receptive to my \\&quot;moves\\&quot; and that has given me all the confidence in the world.</li>
            <li> that I would expect in a top of the  line product.</li>
            <li> I started getting more looks from the women around me.</li>
            <li> Now, let&#x27;s not think this is love potion number 9 and all women will drop to their knees for you...but the product DOES do as it says.  </li>
            <li> I seem to get more attention from women when I wear PherX.  </li>
            <li> You know I haven&#x27;t been able to tell if this works.</li>
            <li> I work at a school where there are many smells to compete with it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps i need to do some more testing.</li>
            <li> I tried this to entice my overworked doctor girlfriend into more lovemaking.</li>
            <li> but maybe this is how most colognes are.  </li>
            <li> The cologne has an OK scent to it, but I was a bit disapointed because the ingridients did not describe what phermone it contained.</li>
            <li> Ok, I just received this product on Tuesday.</li>
            <li> keep buying more.</li>
            <li> I like the spray more than the oil,  </li>
            <li> not 100% sure about the efficacy of the product</li>
            <li> yet but seems like it works for most people.</li>
            <li> I will update this review once I used the product more.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> More kick</li>
            <li> when I done it.&lt;br /&gt;Smell of this product is ok too&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and</li>
            <li> you will get more smiles...and people staring into your eyes with this for sure.</li>
            <li> Someday it seems to have more of an affect than others.</li>
            <li> I hope to have more of an reaction when I go out to parties.</li>
            <li> The girls that have smelled seemed to be noticing it more than I do.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had anybody be overly aggressive, but I do seem to get more attention.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok..</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I can mix it with my favorite cologne and it does not interfere.</li>
            <li> he needed it more than me.</li>
            <li> I was way better before using this.</li>
            <li> one time use you will love that have everytime use.</li>
            <li> I have orderd more , it is priced well and would continue to use it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting many compliments and attention about how I smell.</li>
            <li> and she become more touchy-feely.</li>
            <li> After trying this product out for a while I have noticed being noticed a bit more.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say for sure if it works or not</li>
            <li> but I feel like when I wear it I seem to strike the interest of females more often.</li>
            <li> of for now, it is a product that I would love to think works as it is supposed to</li>
            <li> For instance good hygiene, having confidence, and being a fun person.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Several of the office men were also more talkative during these tests as well, asking mostly about an opinion on something, or requesting help with what we do for the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Boosts my confidence and women seem more at ease.  </li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> I have to say, this is priced cheaper and works better.</li>
            <li> However I have found many women who seem to be able to resist it.  </li>
            <li> Will order more.</li>
            <li> And according to many on here it does,</li>
            <li> being as there are many it works for.</li>
            <li> I got way more compliments and attention using a Bath and Body Works NOIR body spray than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Get the body spray over the cologne version though, it works much better.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t help to notice increased interest as well as more openness from ladies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice a lot more smiles and conversations.</li>
            <li> I feel energized and much more confident while wearing it</li>
            <li> I wore it on top of my cologne on a night out in the city.</li>
            <li> This product has a pleasant mellow and fresh smell that is not too strong and is wearable around an office or during the day.  </li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY MY REGULAR COLOGNE GETS ME BETTER RESULTS!!!</li>
            <li> People do seem to be very friendly and relaxed when wearing this product.</li>
            <li> Conversations with women start spontaneously and in a friendly manner.  </li>
            <li> We normally have great sex, but this time it was more than ever</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> Men seem more respectable and easy going in my company.</li>
            <li> First impression is whether or not it has pheromones in it, it does smell good and would stand alone as a colonge.</li>
            <li> I think it works best if you use it where women will be around you for long periods of time like work or school</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Attraction Gold is also pretty good.</li>
            <li> Good at first, but then after, ewww.</li>
            <li> The scent is pretty good</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, this product smells pretty good</li>
            <li> I think it smells pretty good by itself.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Much easy to apply than the oil and works a lot better.</li>
            <li> Women are generally more receptive, and easy to talk to and initiate conversation enabling me to continue the chatting if I wish.  </li>
            <li> Always keeping in mind that females bore easily, so if you don&#x27;t keep things interesting............</li>
            <li> I mix it with my cologne for an added boost women seem to be more easily approachable and chatty.</li>
            <li> Nice mild scent.</li>
            <li> I wear it frequently and have gotten many great responses from it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps I do feel more comfortable and self confident around females using this product....</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t use too much anyway, hoping to get a good 6 months or more out of this product.</li>
            <li> I have noticed females being more friendly towards me, and giving me more attention.</li>
            <li> I got a complement about how nice I smell from the pretty teller!  </li>
            <li> It is very clean smelling and not too strong.</li>
            <li> It made me smell really good, girls love it, and my one gay friend haha, over all I would keep buying it</li>
            <li> The seller offered me a free sample to test out, so I said sure.  </li>
            <li> If you are that cheap for 10 bucks, I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t know you.</li>
            <li> what is that your wearing?&amp;#34; It does also seem to make the women I interact with more relaxed and comfortable.</li>
            <li> women become more aware of my presence and caused immediate changes in their behavior, they were more talkative, affectionate and had a better sense of humor with me which gave me more confidence and women</li>
            <li> Noticed  girls smiling and feeling comfortable around and tend to touch more often..</li>
            <li> Noticed that women were more attentive around me as well as wanting to get closer to me.</li>
            <li> and I had spray pump that fit it and was ok.</li>
            <li> was surprised when i use it for first time it was wonderful</li>
            <li> It feels like people are more comfortable meeting me when I wear it.</li>
            <li> smells good but really has no effect</li>
            <li> I opened it and the smell was nice, slightly powerful.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that really works.</li>
            <li> I really think it works, Also five drops seems to be a good amount.&lt;br /&gt;Men</li>
            <li> i really recommend trying it for yourself and experience what i had, a good ass time with the hottest brunette in the office.</li>
            <li> delivery be good and fast to me.</li>
            <li> I give it five stars because it is working, smells good, and shipped amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> However, one thing to understand is that pheromones like any hormones are very potent, and the reason they work in nature is that they&#x27;re potent at very dilute levels.</li>
            <li> The smell is very nice, it makes me feel more confident around the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> Dating wise, I didn&#x27;t have any more women approach me than normal; but the women I went to talk to opened up and were more friendly a lot quicker</li>
            <li> it gives you an edge, works best meeting someone for the first time, really adds to the first impression I make, most women size you up in about 5 seconds its either yes or no.</li>
            <li> You will not regret it, best 30 bucks I have ever spent!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the best compared to Pherazone and other products like it.</li>
            <li> were much more friendly.</li>
            <li> But for the best results I found apply a little at bed time and let it work its magic.  </li>
            <li> It was a beautiful smile and you will definitely notice how girls going to be nice with you and talk with you.</li>
            <li> For the price I think is worth giving it a try, plus the fact that you feel confident helps more than anything else.</li>
            <li> and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> They can cause a girl to fall for you very quickly.</li>
            <li> Great smell and the ladies definitely take a greater notice towards me and talkative.</li>
            <li> this thing is ok, it smells good, but as far as it saying what it says, well i use it around my wife and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I can easily get my energy boost from coffee or chocolate.  </li>
            <li> Spray bottle makes application quite easy.  </li>
            <li> , i also did notice she would stare at me more, and she would keep making more eye contact, also at work i did notice female co-workers seemed nicer and more talkative, i dont know if its the spray that works or its a placebo effect, but for now i do think it has some effect, it does smell good as well, almost a light musk smell, i will keep trying and update.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply</li>
            <li> Easily masked by another cologne.</li>
            <li> It was also shipped and delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , that I had to wait an hour after applying it to go out because of how strong the scent is.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go overboard as it is a strong scent.</li>
            <li> love that, only positive reaction I got from this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pheromones are volatile!!!</li>
            <li> Gay men were also more than friendly every time I have worn it.</li>
            <li> Woman will tend to be more talkative and smile more at you, it is true you also get more glances from the woman around you, but the rest is all on you.</li>
            <li> I have a long time (2+ years) girlfriend, so I thought it would be a very good test situation.      </li>
            <li> (smile more, try to be more attentive, etc.) and get results from that.</li>
            <li> Also, it seems to be more effective on younger women, which is nice.</li>
            <li> When you first spray it, it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because i needed some cologne and wanted to see more myself if the claims were true.  </li>
            <li> if so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty effective.</li>
            <li> do not think this works any better than being more friendly, interesting, and interested.</li>
            <li> it smells soapy and more sweet and citrus rather than musky.</li>
            <li> it 100% safe even drop full in eyes</li>
            <li> When i first looked around to purchase a reliable honest product i figured this would be a place to buy.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this stuff would work, it does not, it also has a funny smell that kind of burns my nostrils</li>
            <li> It has a nice light, while the oil is nearly scentless the spray cologne has a really nice light scent.</li>
            <li> The scent on this is fine.</li>
            <li> I was around a bunch of either lesbians or gay males, so</li>
            <li> just an ave. guy not a super model  was very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Okay first off the oil is a much better product than this spray cologne.</li>
            <li> A lady tried to pick me up in the GAY grocery store in Wilton Manors one night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gay.</li>
            <li> After many many months of not being receptive to romance, I was interested in testing the product which just arrived.</li>
            <li> while hanging with my friend (She is gay) and to my surprise she couldn&#x27;t smell it either.</li>
            <li> Women seem to have a better response to what I&#x27;m saying in conversation and seem more interested in me.</li>
            <li> so go light and not smell too strong.</li>
            <li> get laid quick product!</li>
            <li> so far, a pleasant chemistry.</li>
            <li> I bought this with skepticism but was pleasant surprised by the reaction from my wife.  </li>
            <li> It smells okay for a mild cologne.  </li>
            <li> and I am a real person with outstanding results!</li>
            <li> With this product you cannot expect to magically attract every single girl, however it smells very nice and with the added pheromones I could notice that girls came closer to me when they were talking.</li>
            <li> Price - Nothing to get super excited about, but better than most.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Having said that, I went into this experiment with huge doubts.</li>
            <li> really works and really does great as said.</li>
            <li> Others that I&#x27;ve never spoken to before are now engaging me in conversation.</li>
            <li> For those men who have trouble talking to women, this is a must buy as it will change your life for the best!</li>
            <li> this was free, I&#x27;d use it just for the scent but trust me when I say it does NOT work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells great haven&#x27;t seen much female attention</li>
            <li> They have a detailed video there that shows some background information on pheromones.  </li>
            <li> This also helped out with my confidence as if I glow in a room filled with women.</li>
            <li> It is a great smelling cologne that you can carry around discreetly and spray when you see the only you are attracted to.  </li>
            <li> After using the oil and getting fantastic results, I was leery of how adding the fragrance would affect the outcome.</li>
            <li> , if you are already physically attractive this will definitely Enhance how women respond to you</li>
            <li> but honestly I believe it is more then a placebo effect, noticed instantly more attraction from the opposite sex would recommend</li>
            <li> whatever it is, it is something only than women can smell and it may not be attractive to all.</li>
            <li> Then give a review, and I&#x27;ll receive it for free.</li>
            <li> so i guess if you like a light musk cologne</li>
            <li> I dont ever have problems with getting the attention of ladies, but this product has made life easier and a lot of fun for sure.</li>
            <li> Lets just say it ended up being a great night with the extra desired touches.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great for bringing women in closer but the rest is up to you, your charisma and physical attraction.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The company also sent me another free bottle of my choice.</li>
            <li> Cheap prize , this pheromone is working is well , iam the pheromone lover</li>
            <li> Women do seem to light up a bit when I am around them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for going out to the club and bars and will get you alot of female attention.</li>
            <li> She makes comments about my virility---postitive comments filled with lust.</li>
            <li> The seller and I made a agreement for a free product  if I reviewed again.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped the free product as they promised, With that said here is my review.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and every time I wore it, I seemed to attract the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> will enjoy what I bought</li>
            <li> its a great product to buy if ur just starting off!</li>
            <li> When I put it on it had the smell of CHEAP cologne.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless, it&#x27;s all about the search for help and understanding, if this is what you&#x27;ve got to buy in order to continue that, please feel free to buy it.  </li>
            <li> Girls begin to get much closer, much more touchy-feely, much more flirtatious</li>
            <li> Having hung around my female friends, they have been more touchy and have commented that I smell good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I tried to do the best &#x27;research&#x27; about this on Google, and thanks to mixed reviews, I thought \\&quot;well some say it worked for them\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how good it smelled.</li>
            <li> But as far as I know it does smell good.</li>
            <li> Smeels good and blends in with your natural scent.</li>
            <li> the offers are incredibly good</li>
            <li> More intimate love.  </li>
            <li> As for now i can say it doesnt really have a magical affect but does make women appear more friendly.  </li>
            <li> Product really does work fellas!!!</li>
            <li> This is the third product of PherX that I&#x27;ve tried and I love them all!!</li>
            <li> It is very powerfully scented however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li> very nice indeed...will update later on results at the club this weekend</li>
            <li> and usually I&#x27;m not one to have problems with a strong scent of any kind.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it seems to work pretty well so far.</li>
            <li> you wear it around, and I really believe this product works to a pretty good extent.</li>
            <li> I mainly got it because the reviews mentioned that it has a nice smell to it</li>
            <li> When I use this product it seems that women are more comfortable around me, quite a bit more talkative, and more intrusive of personal space</li>
            <li> I really like this sprayable form because it is easier to apply, and I also like that it is very mildly scented, so that I can use it along with any of my favorite cologne</li>
            <li> Now for a quick disclaimer, the cologne will attract women but you have to give them a reason to stay, so focus on becoming confident (if you aren&#x27;t already) also do groom yourself and put on clothes that shows a more professional you.</li>
            <li> Since using PherX for Men I have noticed that women are more positive and engaging to me.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this is some magical \\&quot;get any girl\\&quot; cologne, but it&#x27;s pretty damn close as I believe it worked.</li>
            <li> 30 days and was not expecting anything significant in how people would react, but did not see &#x27;any&#x27; change in their mannerisms around me.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is nothing more than a bit of an edge when someone is interested to you.</li>
            <li> and this seems to make her a bit more interested in &amp;#34;us&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not saying you have to stink, but this can be a replacement for those that shower more than once a day and want to get their woman interested.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure with the of scent</li>
            <li> It helps you get noticed, and helps you me a better first impression.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this to see what effect it might have on my wife...</li>
            <li> most at work really took to me, she would smile at me more at work talk to me close up, i askd her out</li>
            <li> Worth a try!</li>
            <li> Smell - Not bad by itself, sort of like a light aftershave.</li>
            <li> Women around me were more talkative and it seemed that women close by were interested in getting closer to me and or the conversation.</li>
            <li> I wore it and noticed that people there were friendly and talkative to me.  </li>
            <li> At first I just wanted to try it for laughs and where it around the office, but i realized most of the women</li>
            <li> I notice when I use this that women are more willing to accept conversation engagements or may even place themselves to be in a conversation with you.</li>
            <li> Today I tried PherX for the first time and I have to say I am really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This product did not work as advertised, maybe snake oil would be a better name or antagonizer would be more precise, attracts old fat chicks with kids</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure it works in the way it says it does, plus it has the added benefit of boosting your confidence, which is also helpful.</li>
            <li> i put generally 3 sprays to get a a good reaction.</li>
            <li> To find women interested in you, sometimes you don&#x27;t need anything more than the provocative scent of manly pheromones to get women to come on to you.  </li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time and seemed to get more looks from women.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty unique I guess, in relation to the hole in my life</li>
            <li> 2 more girls were interested in me and hung around with us.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to boost their self esteem and be more successful in social situations.</li>
            <li> it help you in your relations,when i start new relation i need some attract for femals,this kind of products give you help because it works like biology attract,but i think it works diffrent ways from one to another,</li>
            <li> similar price, much more effective.</li>
            <li> it works :)  Has a nice aroma and definitely gives you a confidence boost.</li>
            <li> When I spayed it on I smelled a clean soapy scent.</li>
            <li> I think if you are not a big cologne person and want a fairly light cologne that might boost your confidence - this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I rarely have any success with the ladies but this stuff was magic.</li>
            <li> The scent may have changed since my last order but i still get amazing result with the ladies :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product and several of the competitors comparable products and PherX is the best by far.</li>
            <li> Pleasant enough if it was a standalone fragrance</li>
            <li> but it does actually have a pleasant scent to it.</li>
            <li> experienced is limited though</li>
            <li> the product do what it can do as you are relaxed, positive and confident.</li>
            <li> When applied, I found that women are more curious, more flirty, and more engaging.</li>
            <li> This cologne seems to make both men and women friendly and more uninhibited almost like there is something you have that they really, really want hehe.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep you posted on how things turn out, but I am noticing a more pleasant wife who actually is starting to appreciate my attention just as much as the boys.</li>
            <li> Inside the club I must say I didn&#x27;t notice any special reaction but oustide yes</li>
            <li> I love the way this spray smells, defenintly can get certain women&#x27;s attention.</li>
            <li> Some women are more attracted to certain pheromones.</li>
            <li> I put some on and noticed a difference right away!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, a refill!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to evaluate this product accurately, but I find the scent to be pleasant and not overpowering, and women do seem to be more interested in sexual activity IF THEY ARE ALREADY INCLINED TO BE IN THAT MOOD.  </li>
            <li> Women around me were more talkative and interested in getting to know me, though it is worth knowing how to keep a conversation going with a girl before you spray the stuff on.</li>
            <li> True product.</li>
            <li> all the females were more talkative, they looked at me and were very flirty.</li>
            <li> Now realizing that by doing this, you wash away your own natural pheromones.  </li>
            <li> one of the girls i work with told me a good smelling guy is a big turn on</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t approached by too many woman; but wasn&#x27;t really turned away either...</li>
            <li> The cologne smells good and seems to give me an extra edge.  </li>
            <li> The women always ask what are you wearing that smells good even several hours after application</li>
            <li> Buy some good cologne and take daily showers, it does wonders to your attractiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but really can make you feel better.</li>
            <li> have found it best works if you put at least two sprays on your neck and then ask a girl to dance with you.  </li>
            <li> and I felt overall more confident and comfortable talking to her</li>
            <li> , I was able to flirt a bit and really keep the eye contact and conversation going.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve become more touchy and flirty so making a move is so much easier now.</li>
            <li> The PherX is a good product overall.  </li>
            <li> no complaints and for full disclosure-  </li>
            <li> I have recently ordered the PherX product for men and have found it to be a good product  </li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied and will be buying another bottle very soon.</li>
            <li> Well i only have to say that this one smells good, it doesn&#x27;t do any miracles</li>
            <li> Good product overall.</li>
            <li> Used in a controlled physiology lab experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: inconclusive, but makes for a cool story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife thinks it smells good in a much different way than cologne.</li>
            <li> Anything more, then you may want to consider paying a dating coach, haha.</li>
            <li> It also does last for a good while.</li>
            <li> but, I have noticed the wife being a lot more touchy feely and wants to be closer to me all the time</li>
            <li> It shows that really work I love it and</li>
            <li> Definitely got some attention from some good looking women.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t magic, let&#x27;s be real here.</li>
            <li> i gave it to my friend and he used it with his wife and he said &#x27; Cool &#x27;</li>
            <li> What you need to know is that this is a pheromone product that works as advertised, and if you do your part, (dress nicely, smile, act police, keep your teeth free of chives, don&#x27;t smoke and don&#x27;t over-do it with coffee)</li>
            <li> Not a bad thing</li>
            <li> Not bad at all for the price.</li>
            <li> Not bad for $30.</li>
            <li> We had a great time, that night, and for the next few days she showered my with affection telling me how happy she is, and how lucky she felt to be my wife.</li>
            <li> The reason I keep reordering this item is because more than any other cologne I use, women actually tell me I smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> I noticed a little bit difference in the way the ladies acted around me (in a good way).&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must try!</li>
            <li> If not, it definitely smells great and still gives off a positive effect</li>
            <li> for 5 spray married women&#x27;s are attracting very depth looking nice , I like it so much , girls are attracting but not in powerful way, to attract girls need more than 5 spray ; now iam using along with (max attraction gold ) it use to attract girls &amp; women</li>
            <li> Other than this, I&#x27;m really happy with PherX and intend to keep using it for a while.</li>
            <li> I noticed more looks, more friendly faces, and a little more contact.</li>
            <li> If you wear strong enough you&#x27;ll see that girls will be more willing to talk to you and pay more attention to you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lately I have been using the spray on my legs and the oil up top, i&#x27;ve found decent results although I have no way of knowing which is doing what..</li>
            <li> you might be lucky.</li>
            <li> Along with the fact that I have been feeling better losing weight and eating better things have been different for me.  </li>
            <li> It smells like cologne with a mild</li>
            <li> The cologne also comes with a spray nozzle which is more convenient and rations are more equal allowing for additional usages.</li>
            <li> (the more human pheromones, the more potent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely, observed women giving me more looks, and being more communicative.  </li>
            <li> Works as advertised, is fairly cheap and free fast shipping.</li>
            <li> You will get a few more women that notice you smell &amp;#34;Nice&amp;#34; which is a good conversation starter.  </li>
            <li> but it seemed that the females were much more open to conversation and made more eye contact.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and obviously women love it too.</li>
            <li> It is a really mild scent.</li>
            <li> Product was however shipped and received quickly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be sure on its actual &amp;#34;effects&amp;#34; but I love the scent regardless.</li>
            <li> Super quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> It definitely helps you feel more confident.</li>
            <li> I found it does seem to be causing for more conversations with strangers but am not certain I can solely attest it to the product or my amazing personality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The K9 test was positive every time, although the handler said the dog didn&#x27;t hit strong, and acted unsure about what it located.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended :-)</li>
            <li> I can say that I felt a little more energized which led to me feeling more motivated and confident.  </li>
            <li> in all, very satisfied with results from this product and highly recommend it &amp; definitely gives me a confidence boost, and I have noticed women treating me with more leniency.</li>
            <li> I will be getting more of this on a normal occasions.</li>
            <li> I got a lot of compliments from women the very first day when I start using it.</li>
            <li> They also give you a free product if its your first time purchasing.</li>
            <li> u might want to wear it with another cologne cuz it barely has a scent of its own</li>
            <li> However, it smells good, and that alone might be enough if you don&#x27;t have any regular cologne handy.  </li>
            <li> of the waitresses who is a good friend only was standing near me and started playing with her hair while talking to me, a sure sign she&#x27;s attracted.</li>
            <li> of the waitresses who is a good friend only was standing near me and started playing with her hair while talking to me, a sure sign she&#x27;s attracted.</li>
            <li> Has a very fresh, crisp scent.</li>
            <li> My co-workers love the new scent that I carry and everyone asks what sort of cologne I use.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have always been intrigued by the idea of pheromones, and I decided to opt for this one becasue it was reasonably priced and generally had good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I put it on before I go out to any kind of social gathering.</li>
            <li> excellent product, but does not last long and sometimes does not work as it should recommend . . . .</li>
            <li> #34;Sorry, your voice is too sexy, please repeat your question.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;She is usually very professional</li>
            <li> when i first used it never thought that it is gonna work,but after putting it on i saw my female friends becoming more friendly and touchier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 2 stars for the very light pleasant smell that is very short lasting.</li>
            <li> I was getting a lot of looks and friendly smiles when I first went out with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying pheromones for the last 4 month&#x27;s this product is the best one that has worked for me at first I noticed the difference at my job not only just with females but also with males.</li>
            <li> the next thing that made me sure this product worked was first thing i did when i walked into the party was introduced myself to all of the girls and hugged them to make sure they smelled it, for the rest of the night wherever i went</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend using pheromone cologne, but if you do, make sure you buy it form PherX!</li>
            <li> The tricky part of my little study is that I am more aware of women when wearing Pher-X and much more confident.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited.</li>
            <li> This product really works!!</li>
            <li> u can really tell the difference!!</li>
            <li> They become more social, touchy, and comfortable in the presence of this scent.  </li>
            <li> It really helps you feel comfortable being around women</li>
            <li> I purchased the product because I found its claims to be intriguing.  </li>
            <li> Its aroma is so fantastic that can really attrect women.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money even if it&#x27;s all in your head</li>
            <li> A smile and polite conversation does the rest.</li>
            <li> am happy with this product and was surprised that it actually worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would be curious with a more potent version, but yes I would buy again.</li>
            <li> and overall I am thrilled.</li>
            <li> If you are reading this then you are probably deciding whether or not it is worth taking a look into.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I thought it would be fun to order it and see if it works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth the price and wait (for shipping).</li>
            <li> worth trying</li>
            <li> it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Is it worth it to try it out?</li>
            <li> Point is, your mileage can and will vary, but in my opinion it&#x27;s worth seeing what that mileage will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the pheromone cologne had a great  smell , however it did not provide droves of women as described , guess I was to old for the proper effect..........</li>
            <li> but I think its definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Pheromones will give you an edge; she&#x27;ll smile at you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> far, my favorite is pheroforce.</li>
            <li> So overall this product was fun to try to be honest</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, even if it&#x27;s just a placebo effect, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Should have more dates and women to hang out with and it makes it easier so far</li>
            <li> The result was phenomenal so far.</li>
            <li> And it has a nice aroma to it definitely recommend to try it out</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to see if girls in public can be attracted to you and with this product I got no results.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again because of the fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> Feel it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pleased with the results I&#x27;m seeing from Pherx.  </li>
            <li> anyways it is worth to buy....</li>
            <li> Is it effective enough to get into someone pants?</li>
            <li> I am so far satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Simple yet effective.  </li>
            <li> I also e mailed them inquiring possible allergens and received prompt courteous service.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It is powerful for man.</li>
            <li> No noticeable smell, easy pump, and decent amount for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> Which is rare for me.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than an &amp;#34;Axe&amp;#34; body spray or Old Spice.</li>
            <li> So far its working ok.</li>
            <li> I would like to say that this product is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;100% work and also worth the money, we went to a party at the night when i got it, and the girls went crazyy</li>
            <li> kind of amazed cause it definitely  did not smell like vanilla</li>
            <li> Product works well, I&#x27;m in sales and my clients are always far more receptive when I use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff  seems like it makes women want to speak to you and smile.</li>
            <li> but overall nice smell.</li>
            <li> worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It was a fun experiment but would not put this stuff on again for anything.  </li>
            <li> When I walk into a supermarket or visit the library, women stare at me, smile at me, and sometimes even cast me that enticing glance that says: \\&quot;Come on over and talk to me.  </li>
            <li> I think it just helped with knowing I&#x27;m worth a girl&#x27;s attention.  </li>
            <li> Your entire life can change in the span of 6 months with that kind of decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can only vouch for my own.</li>
            <li> I found this product on Amazon and thought that at the price it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I was glad it is not strong because I have my own preferred cologne that i can wear with it.  </li>
            <li> I see a ladies a bit more open and friendly and easier to deal with.</li>
            <li> But then I noticed she keeps coming back to the room &amp; ask how I&#x27;m doing &amp; seems more friendly.</li>
            <li> It had a feminine perfume smell to it as well, but was easily covered up with the normal cologne i use.</li>
            <li> If this isn&#x27;t working for you then you honestly have no social skills.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far, but so far I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but and seems as little effective but by no means as strong as its oil based substitute from the same company.</li>
            <li> This I have experienced with PherX in the past, and it&#x27;s happening again with my second order of this amazing product.  </li>
            <li> My wife kind of liked the scent, but it did not last that long.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try since I couldn&#x27;t decide on a mainstream cologne and have read other good reviews.</li>
            <li> but I do all right.</li>
            <li> but I am out of the country right now and dont need it.  </li>
            <li> I spray it right on after getting cleaned up and stepping out for the night</li>
            <li> I knew right away that it wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Just eat right.</li>
            <li> I started doubting the potency of this product right that moment.</li>
            <li> The waitress kept coming over to make sure everything was OK, asking me what I had planned for the weekend and generally spending more time with me than any of the other 10-12 guys at the bar.  </li>
            <li> This worked great the first few times I used it.  </li>
            <li> While they are not a magic love potion that will make all the eye candy fall hopelessly under your spell,I do find that they have the ability to boost your own attraction levels,and magnify the range of chemistry between those who would share it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product over the past year and have received many compliments about the nice smell.</li>
            <li> I think overall it is not a bad buy, considering many colognes cost over $50.  </li>
            <li> Not only do I have great social skills, but I have this potion as my sidekick.</li>
            <li> I think it is better to err on the side of caution and apply less rather than more.</li>
            <li> first thing i noticed was when i was riding the bus 2 beautiful girls got on the bus and sat right next to me when there were plenty of open seats.</li>
            <li> Obviously it got her more on the sexual side because of the natural attraction already there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already been getting some action on the regular, which makes you more appealing to women.</li>
            <li> I applied a fresh spray when I first saw her and again before we went to bed and</li>
            <li> I could definitely see the difference on how women behave near you when you have such an awesome smell.</li>
            <li> You can tell women feel more comfortable when the around me when I&#x27;m wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;You have to apply it constantly as it looses it smells, the oil based one is the one I much preferred.</li>
            <li> PherX may work great for me but not so much for another, and the effect seems to vary a little depending on who&#x27;s doing the smelling.</li>
            <li> To my surprise I couldn&#x27;t help but notice a little more intensity in my lady&#x27;s love making .</li>
            <li> At first in my mind I&#x27;m like \\&quot;Yeah Right, a placebo effect huh\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Need to try a few more times before writing a more comprehensive review.</li>
            <li> We are more intelligent than animals, so this stuff is not going to work, sorry to burst bubbles.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and it definitely lowers a woman&#x27;s guard to allow her to open up.</li>
            <li> Activity with my mate increased considerably and is more intense.</li>
            <li> They were very quick and professional.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t sensed much difference as far as attract more woman.</li>
            <li> It may have been coincidental, so I will test it out a few more times to make sure.</li>
            <li> Great product ,I have had several women walk up out of the blue and introduce them selves.</li>
            <li> I have actually had much more success after switching to unscented products and lengthening times between showers.</li>
            <li> Some people might be sensitive to a strong signal so in that case it might work against you.</li>
            <li> Wow, really smells great and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Thanks very much, will buy again!</li>
            <li> Recently got this in the mail and have had pretty good responses so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Realm (a different pheromone cologne, about $70 for 1.7oz back in the day) twice before with zero noticeable effect, whereas PherX has produced some definite- and interesting- results, not all of them necessarily welcome (ever been &amp;#34;huffed&amp;#34; by a teenager?</li>
            <li> Recieved my order very fast.</li>
            <li> You only need one spray and it smells great and definitely gets you more attention from the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping by the way.</li>
            <li> In certain situations did she notice my scent a little more, maybe feel a bit of a more animal attraction?</li>
            <li> but I guess a little help is always good.</li>
            <li> you coming to bed?&amp;#34; Although we have a very nice love life she&#x27;s seldom &#x27;ready to go&#x27; when she&#x27;s tired, so this was unusual.</li>
            <li> Pherx has a nice subtle smell, i can&#x27;t say for sure if the spray or a placebo is at work</li>
            <li> I liked the scent and it seemed to last for a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I can also say that younger people seem to respond more strongly to it (or maybe they&#x27;re simply more impulsive and less reserved with their reactions?).</li>
            <li> I want to thank you for producing such an amazing product, normally I&#x27;m a skeptic, but</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> women do seem to see me more and say a couple extra sentences while I am wearing this.</li>
            <li> When I first wore it</li>
            <li> Girls become more interested when wearing this, definitely going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> This is my first reveiw im making out of 5 products on amazon,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I definitely have noticed a lot more attention in my direction.</li>
            <li> However, while giving you confidence on the day you&#x27;re wearing it, your confidence in the day you&#x27;re not will drop to-9000 so my only advice is considering this before you buy it :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;PherX Pheromone Cologne helps you to be more noticed by the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> I will say that it smells more like alcohol than I would have hoped, but I simply simply combine it with another cologne.</li>
            <li> Sure enough however girls were complementing me on how I smelled and even got a couple numbers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it will have alot more females approaching you</li>
            <li> I have found that if interested, the woman will come in closer out of curiosity.</li>
            <li> I also notice that girls become a lot more open and chatty... but</li>
            <li> I first found out about PherX on Youtube.  </li>
            <li> It works like a charm with most women but not all women are the same so don&#x27;t expect attention from all ladys.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time before work on friday morning.</li>
            <li> I am 46, but I&#x27;m well-known there by the younger waitresses who are mostly college students and am friends with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Women who knew me before I started using it suddenly started showing a lot more interested.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting that they all the sudden start flirting alot with you.</li>
            <li> at first, there was a glitch with the shipping.</li>
            <li> and I get more lasting glances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had this much attention in years!</li>
            <li> she likes how it smells different every time :)</li>
            <li> I get more attention by wearing regular cologne.  </li>
            <li> This does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was gonna work, and I don&#x27;t notice anything except my girlfriend can&#x27;t keep her hands off of me.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, they are the first to initiate a conversation with me.</li>
            <li> I would like proving something more concentrated on a future.</li>
            <li> for the mixed reviews... scent is one of the most subjective things out there.</li>
            <li> In my experience this stuff simply makes others view you more favorably (and if they already like you, it seems to intensify that)...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 and happily married</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if female customers tip and/or flirt more...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;Pheromones&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t going to magically change human nature.</li>
            <li> Some are more receptive at different times.</li>
            <li> So I believe if you mixed it with lotion, it will be much better.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Girls definitely take notice more.  </li>
            <li> , she said it smells funny.</li>
            <li> More attention from ladies, even at the bank women never speak to me but with this I not only get spoken to today.....</li>
            <li> Just wear it for the first time.</li>
            <li> a Phone number I didn&#x27;t expect and an invitation for lunch by a hot chick.</li>
            <li> The First Time I Used The Product.</li>
            <li> I Think Should Really Give It A Try!</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s the funny bit; PherX e-mailed me with a request.</li>
            <li> But The female that was over my house was more in a rush to get her clothes off then me.</li>
            <li> I think it even keep the female more turned on while having sex</li>
            <li> I began to test whether the product works, being aware not to let the placebo effect color my observations.  </li>
            <li> First one spray per day, then two sprays, I worked up to eight sprays, always with no effect.  </li>
            <li> I did notice a lot more eye contact from around the room more so than usual.</li>
            <li> This is very noticeable!</li>
            <li> Someone mentioned to us: the smell made my heart beat fast!</li>
            <li> and I definitely receive more attention.  </li>
            <li> I also found that the people who you rate as a 5, 6, or 7, lower on the scale, respond higher to this.</li>
            <li> I just do 2 on the neck, but if you are going out to something big i would spray 2 more times on your wrists.</li>
            <li> Obviously the more you have on, the easier it is for them to get attracted to you.</li>
            <li> Wore it the first day and it got her attention.</li>
            <li> Works great!, after I threw it in the garbage and dug up the courage to talk to a women myself instead of relying on some fake miracle</li>
            <li> I first purchased the oil version of this and now have the spray.  </li>
            <li> and it smelled exactly like this</li>
            <li> and Im sure they use the same bulk pheromone that Got2Be uses.</li>
            <li> I have different types pheromone&#x27;s buyed from all that this is pheromone 100% safe , this I am giving 3 rd place in world ,(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;ll be a chick magnet all of a sudden, but do expect looks and more conversation.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this perfume and when i tried it for the first time i didn&#x27;t notice any effects.</li>
            <li> The whole night she was all over me and asked me for my number!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> i can most definitely see them starring at me .</li>
            <li> I feel that this product definitely gives me more of an edge.</li>
            <li> Show them you&#x27;re interested.</li>
            <li> great stuff, last long and gives you confidence.</li>
            <li> Smell funny  like someones piss.</li>
            <li> Obviously these guys know what they&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times, but it seemed to make more women approach me at the parties I went to.</li>
            <li> The first night I wore it</li>
            <li> Funny thing is there wasn&#x27;t any hazard shipping labels on the box.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it</li>
            <li> many been days prior to this product that I had confidence</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m married and my wife gave birth about 2-1/2 years ago.</li>
            <li> (and I don&#x27;t want them to as I&#x27;m happily married)</li>
            <li> Not only did it boost my confidence around women, it seemed like it helped women feel like i was more approachable.</li>
            <li> She said \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know what it is, but you look hot today.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Hahaha!</li>
            <li> Product did exactly what it was intended to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely plan to order more.</li>
            <li> I have to say, the ladies around me have become more &amp;#34;chatty&amp;#34; and with occasional bumping of shoulders.</li>
            <li> There was an actually recognizable difference from the amount of attention</li>
            <li> and actually, my tips were better too now that I think of it.</li>
            <li> I am 46, but I&#x27;m well-known there by the younger waitresses who are mostly college students and am friends with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells kinda funny.</li>
            <li> So I thought it would be cool to see if I got a reaction from some of the women I normally interact with.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm with most women but not all women are the same</li>
            <li> pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the first day it was applied</li>
            <li> This is the first time buying this type of product</li>
            <li> If people are paying more attention to you when wearing this PherX its probably because they smell you coming a mile off and want to go the opposite direction.</li>
            <li> This happened before to me when I first tried and used PherX Pheromone Cologne.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I did doubt it much at first</li>
            <li> I love to use this daily.</li>
            <li> is more likely to project that image, and women like men who have confidence.</li>
            <li> think most of the feed back on amazon for this product was done by bribery .&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> I really believe that this product works!</li>
            <li> The first day I wore it in the office, I notices all the women started saying hello, asking me about my day and week, what were my plans for the weekend and stuff like that.</li>
            <li> As for attractions of the opposite sex, it does get more looks</li>
            <li> Of course I bought this, and of course, I wasted a perfectly good 30 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So nothing not even a smells good i think it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> It has a subtle scent that goes well with a light cologne or after shave.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not just for single guys, it&#x27;s also great for that date night with your wife too!</li>
            <li> It MAY give you a slight edge to get them interested, but you still have to able to talk to them comfortably to close the deal so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> so once applied it will not smell the same for two different people, so it will be unique to your own chemistry.</li>
            <li> As of right now its too soon to tell if this stuff really works on attracting women.</li>
            <li> the first way is that it relaxes the people around you so they feel a certain amount of comfort around you and the second way it works is by boosting your confidence and making you more talkative...</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first but many good reviews so decided on the purchase.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing is it has a pleasant smell and can be worn as cologn so not a complete waste.</li>
            <li> is a bit strong at first, strangely no one seems to notice or complain about it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> 3 of the attractive girls whom I work with spent a significantly larger amount of time visiting me at the bar</li>
            <li> this pheremone is a lilttle stinky im trying to use it around my female friends , i &#x27;ll see the results and i&#x27;ll be back to let u people know if is good or not</li>
            <li> but the overall experience was that women seemed much more relaxed and causal with me; even when talking intimately.</li>
            <li> i never believed this would work, but it smells good and worth it to try at least one time.&lt;br /&gt;next</li>
            <li> Young, old, cute</li>
            <li> I have used it for two days now, and I have made sure to hug women when possible to really give them the scent.</li>
            <li> After doing some research on countless websites, I found that one of the most appreciated pheromone sprays out there was PherX...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money .Smell is good but absolute no results.</li>
            <li> But is it a psychological thing for me giving me more confidence or does it really work on women?  </li>
            <li> works well and surprised at how nice it smells, would recommend it to any guy, noticed a big change in responses of women, ( of all ages !!).</li>
            <li> but people in general seem to be more open and friendly.  </li>
            <li> It is lighter smelling than most of the other cologne that I own and I will have to test out how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> its high price, it&#x27;s honestly worth it</li>
            <li> He still insisted that he was totally positive it made a difference.</li>
            <li> and I have gotten nothing but positive results every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I seem to have positive results.  </li>
            <li> I would say positive results.  </li>
            <li> I would say positive results.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe some of the positive reviews were people from PherX posing</li>
            <li> If the product works, I&#x27;ll be positive.  </li>
            <li> Some blogger said that the company was giving out gift cards if the buyer wrote a positive review.  </li>
            <li> The product does appear to cause women to respond in a positive way.  </li>
            <li> My wife appears to act positively to this product.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any glaring positive results.  </li>
            <li> I first tried the oil which I really like a lot , but it did not have a sprayer.</li>
            <li> do notice you more as long as you want looks</li>
            <li> strange smell is softer and leave you confident.</li>
            <li> Smells great by itself or in combination with your other basic colognes.</li>
            <li> The girls do not swarm at u like world war Z or an ax commercial, but i have been a lot more smiles from some of the most expected females.</li>
            <li> This product came in pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Its the first time am using this product and it really give off a expression.</li>
            <li> I have noticed more attention and touching  after only two uses although I do not really notice a scent that pherX is supposed to have.</li>
            <li> When I first read about this product I didn&#x27;t have much believe in it.</li>
            <li> I am married, so I really just wanted to see how my wife would respond after applying it.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, got it before expected, product so far so good, I may update my review after a while of using it to give details about result.....</li>
            <li> Smells good even as an addition to you&#x27;re usual Cologne.</li>
            <li> It works just as good if not better and girls tend to like that.</li>
            <li> Very nice and subtle smell.</li>
            <li> While overpowering for some, to those with less sensitive noses it seems to have a pleasant hairspray-like smell.</li>
            <li> Not bad girly strong or musky, but not likely to get you compliments on the way you smell.as far as the pheromones go</li>
            <li> And Zyloo, for gods sake give us a little more information on your ingredients!  </li>
            <li> I only rated it 4 out of 5 stars because it is soo strong</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the scent is good and it does last a fairly long time if you apply it correctly.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend buying this and using it as often as possible.</li>
            <li> First of all I must inform that in Zyloo Laboratories they are responsible and very attentive people, with regard to the product at first its results are confusing , then I realized that they depend on many factors, as  are the mixtures with other smells of the surrounding environment, once I walking on one street where was flowing a very strong smell is countered the smell of the product, another factor is the receiving person, it is preferable use near since smell does not have much scope, also they influence the conditions of the receiving person, its frame of mind, its olfactory conditions if it has flu</li>
            <li> First day and very positive results so far.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is better when out hunting for the single ladies.</li>
            <li> It could have been pure coincidence</li>
            <li> It is pure nonsense.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but certainly, the cologne has a certain effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is no way to say it 100%, it might be also a placebo effect, but certainly when I wear the product i notice a difference in the way women interct with me.</li>
            <li> but it does certainly</li>
            <li> No one has commented directly on me using it, but when I went to the dentist yesterday the dental assistant sure was a lot more talkative to me than she usually is.  </li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t noticed any of the pheromone effects but I will keep testing an in the mean time I have a pretty good smelling cologne</li>
            <li> Nice clean subtle smell too.</li>
            <li> So I get the cologne and it dosen&#x27;t work, right out of the box new.</li>
            <li> Smell is fine and could be used simply as a cologne - my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> Smells pretty decent.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s easy to use - has a subtle but pleasant scent - and I do get the sense at times that it is a plus in interactions with the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> Met a super cute redhead for a first date this past weekend and wore the cologne.</li>
            <li> the important part, The Performance - I &amp;#34;tested&amp;#34; it out in two main places, at work and just general living.</li>
            <li> It has a good subtle smell not over powering or funny smelling, which I was worried about.  </li>
            <li> It really is a conversation starter.</li>
            <li> I wish the sprayer didn&#x27;t shoot as much out</li>
            <li> The next few days I noticed a lot more females staring and when I would start a conversation they seemed more inclined to want to keep talking to me.</li>
            <li> I recommend spraying on your neck, wrist(skin area), don&#x27;t put too much or else it would drive females away..</li>
            <li> Like reasonable reviewers have stated, this will not have women fight over you</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much of a difference this made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked with people my whole life and did not vary my discussions, approach, or conversations towards the women I was with or around at the time.</li>
            <li> This stuff really wooorks.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any results yet.</li>
            <li> Again, not to much.</li>
            <li> Girls looked at me in a flirty way and looked really relaxed when around me.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> she really likes?</li>
            <li> still the price should be much lower to drive sales</li>
            <li> I will continue trying to find out if you really can work to attract women ...</li>
            <li> but you really don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> product really works well</li>
            <li> was a girl that I had been trying to get with for some time, and this stuff really did not help anything.  </li>
            <li> It absolutely does not help to attract women at all.</li>
            <li> Fast reaction and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I received this as a trial from the company and tried it out and have to say it works very well.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> This product really works....</li>
            <li> This product really works, i used the product yesterday at gym and felt the difference immediately.</li>
            <li> My wife seems to really like it and respond to it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a jerk or haven&#x27;t showered in a week, don&#x27;t expect pheromones (or anything else, really) to override that.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really tried it fully yet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it does much</li>
            <li> This was absolutely the stupidest purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.  </li>
            <li> *** was \\&quot;snake oil\\&quot;, but I REALLY WANTED it to work.  </li>
            <li> It really made me skeptic.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know much about the product before I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I really like the sent</li>
            <li> I never thought pheromones are really working.</li>
            <li> it really works the woman i wanted to talk to me</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing period.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping my wife would notice.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really likes the smell of pherx.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s building my confidence or if it really attracts the ladies.</li>
            <li> Any advise on this would be appreciated as I&#x27;d like to fulfill my end of the bargain.</li>
            <li> and she was being real flirty, and</li>
            <li> So much attention.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that I have to use quiet a bit to see a difference, but overall this is a great product</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on a whim, and really wanted to see what all the hype with pheromone colognes were.</li>
            <li> Everyone around me was much nicer</li>
            <li> and my husband was all touchy feely which I really like.</li>
            <li> Its scent is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I like the scent so much</li>
            <li> This product absolutely does not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that the review is just advertising from Zyloo Research Labs posing as a review, but maybe it&#x27;s a real guy</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very susceptible to the placebo effect.      </li>
            <li> I selected the Amazon reviewers that appear to be real people because they&#x27;ve review products that are not from Zyloo Research Labs.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This product is a very affective when it comes to attracting the ladies it performance is 100% a must for a guy thats in the dating scene.</li>
            <li> I think it does work but not as much as the women will be taking off their panties to be with you.</li>
            <li> Package came in really intact and on time!&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product as a whole.</li>
            <li> Now, if you are wearing this outside, the effectiveness lessens, especially if it is really windy.</li>
            <li> Note-The company was really fast shipping.</li>
            <li> That being said, does it really matter?  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely making my life alot easier.</li>
            <li> I was sent a offer by the manufacturer to post a review for a free extra bottle.</li>
            <li> Also notice the spray doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Do have to say doesnt really smell like much.</li>
            <li> This cologne really works.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li> I think it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I havent seen much change from my wife, but she did without her knowing</li>
            <li> but i dont ware colone very offten</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> I really put this product to the test and my girlfriend didnt know I purchased it.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t like its scent.</li>
            <li> And it really works.</li>
            <li> and I still wasn&#x27;t given as much attention that I received that day.</li>
            <li> I have found that just applying during the day does not change much.  </li>
            <li> Sealed very well and protected.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be unhappy with the results the attention is excellent.</li>
            <li> It was shipped fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it a couple times and haven&#x27;t noticed any real change in people&#x27;s behavior toward me.  </li>
            <li> This product really seems to work.</li>
            <li> i didnt really talk to started coming up to me and asking how my day was etc.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t really have a smell</li>
            <li> I have to assume the stuff really makes an impact</li>
            <li> Since I have begun using this product my girlfriend seems very intriqued about how much she is attracted to my masculinity.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise and delight it is a very nice&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this product really fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks...</li>
            <li> and she didn&#x27;t like is as much as the others  </li>
            <li> the area were it is and a few mins later sit back and enjoy lol</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t so sure what to think when I got this, I have never really used a cologne before but the allure of pheromone ones tempted me.  </li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Was not a show stopper,,, but it is real.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much when I bought this</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference.</li>
            <li> I have yet to really see any results, but I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
            <li> Really attracts the women to come to you .  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me at all.</li>
            <li> Whether this is from the scent, pheromones, or the increased confidence it really seems to be working.</li>
            <li> I have used it now for about a month and really didnt see a difference.</li>
            <li> I bought it to try it out and see how it really works.</li>
            <li> It has a very pungent smell that should be masked with a moree desirable aroma.</li>
            <li> It was shipped fast though.</li>
            <li> Since I rely heavily on what others say, then I feel that I have a duty to contribute by giving an honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> it at least will give you a confidence boost, and with all the good reviews it seems like it works.</li>
            <li> This pheromone looks to be among the few effective one.</li>
            <li> I am experimenting with different people in different situations to see just how close you need to be for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> When used in equal doses over a period of two weeks time I had far more interactions using PherX.  </li>
            <li> This has a nice smell to it, but is gone in a few hours.</li>
            <li> Use it  at work, and I had a few girls get closer and said I smell nice..</li>
            <li> Smell is pleasant and subtle.  </li>
            <li> so far no positive response may take longer,will see what happens in a few days,weeks as i go out more!!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if there&#x27;s any correlation, but wearing this product will certainly give you more confidence!</li>
            <li> Just WOW!!!</li>
            <li> strong enough might be the normal amount.)</li>
            <li> or if it was this product but thus far i do admit that i enjoy the smell of this although its not a super strong scent</li>
            <li> on different days this one was not as good as the other</li>
            <li> The first day I didn&#x27;t see much just a little added confidence and people seemed to want to talk to me more.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m very interested in studying human behavior, and I wanted to see first hand if there are any synthetic pheromones in the market that can significantly affect human behavior.</li>
            <li> Even women who don&#x27;t really like my look (masculine, muscular, rough around the edges) and prefer more feminine pretty boys seem to approach me as well.</li>
            <li> When asked about it, the majority of them said even though they &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; a curious reaction about us at that particular time, they knew it was a test, but that they also notice a difference from time to time in most men.  </li>
            <li> and she seems to be a little more interested.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten more flirts and smiles than any other product.</li>
            <li> Still within my first 2 days of wearing it, so I hope to come back with more definite results.</li>
            <li> In a crowded party, a woman from across the room approaches you because you smelled sexy and she could just tell from a distance that the smell was yours and not one of the other guys?  </li>
            <li> All and all, this would be a product I would recommend if you need a little more of a edge to start a conversation while keeping them interested in you.</li>
            <li> However after opening the bottle and spraying some on I instantly was familiar with the smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried other pheremone cologne&#x27;s that I feel worked better.  </li>
            <li> Many pheremone products have an extreme musk to them.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed it on at work (sweat a lot) and was surprised how long it stayed on and I was able to smell it on for almost the whole work day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My friend bought some other pheromone colognes from a sex shop and it smelled much better</li>
            <li> have used other pheromone products and this one is comparable at a better price.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know how lady&#x27;s act yet , but product have clean smell and last up to 6 hour</li>
            <li> like the smell of it, and have noticed women generally being more open to talking</li>
            <li> we are still active in our love dept.</li>
            <li> Love it, we&#x27;ll worth the small investment.</li>
            <li> The Science of Attraction - 20mg of Human Pheromones]] and much happyer with that its not bad</li>
            <li> I normally do not find it easy to initiate conversation with women.</li>
            <li> Once again I cannot confirm for sure, it may just be psychological, but at the end of the day the product certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt or ruin your chances with the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> But it may do not mean much.</li>
            <li> and I must say I was surprised when this product arrived very quickly via shipping, and by the fact that it ACTUALLY works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But looks positive so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to spritz again one night when we can enjoy some quiet time to see if PherX is really making romance come alive...</li>
            <li> but the fact that it IS scented means you can&#x27;t pour this into your usual fragrance but have to use it by itself.&lt;br /&gt;Potency: Not as effective as advertising</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know what to except but after seeing it in action I AM A BELIEVER.</li>
            <li> and she completely blanked on the first time I asked it, and she responded with &amp;</li>
            <li> Usually they were just being nice and seemed like they had to talk to me.</li>
            <li> and she was very touchy feely which she normally isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, I am not able to say that it works, but smells nice and give you all confidence needed.</li>
            <li> I received the shipment last week in proper condition and It seems to be a good product when used occasionally</li>
            <li> 2 weeks a bit short for full review.</li>
            <li> This is not magic, women won&#x27;t jump on you, but it does makes them attract to you, it does makes women behave nicely with you when they are around you.</li>
            <li> This little guy is as good as its Big brother the Oil Base!&lt;br /&gt;You can wear it as it is or mix it with any cologne</li>
            <li> A cute courtesy associate whom I&#x27;ve always greeted and only received a \\&quot;Hello\\&quot; in return, actually greeted me first and then proceeded to ask how my day was this far,</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;ve gotten more attention from the opposite sex with other products but the other products I&#x27;ve used have either had a sweat odor that I could smell or just weren&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li> well,my ex-gf is jealous,but it works if you are finding for new girl, it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003H146PY PherX Pheromone Cologne for Men (Attract Women) -</li>
            <li> It is nothing more than a slight stimulant to the unthinking primal part of consciousness.</li>
            <li> Has a slight cologne smell which is OK.  </li>
            <li> a handsome fellow as is with slight confidence issues, and no effect.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible product,&lt;br /&gt;Misleading label.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> So I have to say this review is for the a previous order which worked like a dam love potion.</li>
            <li> Tested it in restaurants, church, shopping, in the car, and basically in many public / private places.    </li>
            <li> , a girl even asked me if I was wearing a particular perfume</li>
            <li> Oil Based Pheromones do last longer, and overall tend to settle better.</li>
            <li> but those are the main things.</li>
            <li> A disadvantage is that the presentations of 30 ml is too low to use in adequate amounts.</li>
            <li> it definitely makes her more frisky (and no, I haven&#x27;t told her about it), but funnily enough she also doesn&#x27;t like the PherX scent.</li>
            <li> you still have to project confidence and have a decent appearance.</li>
            <li> Its better to use pherx when you&#x27;re going to meet a girl not just waiting for the girls talk to you which is wasting money and time because these girls in the club are not focusing on you only so they might to walk next to you and look to another guy, so they&#x27;ll be attracted to the guy they look at.</li>
            <li> It smells classic or what i call OG.</li>
            <li> Folks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the main feature of this cologne is that it can increase confidence if you are susceptible to the powers of suggestion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for several weeks and getting more attention and dates by the opposite sex..</li>
            <li> Well I did a quick spritz and left it at that.</li>
            <li> The next day I found things to be much different.... and for the better.</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether this is the placebo effect or not, but I have been pretty confident when I spray this stuff on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my girlfriend definitely seems to be more eager to have some private time.  </li>
            <li> the scent is decent.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping... received it before the shipping status said it has left the facility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have more random encounters with woman than I have ever had,  they seem to want to talk to me more and stand alot closer during the conversation.&lt;br /&gt;Gas stations,  grocery stores,  even doc office now seems to be a playground for attraction.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nor are clever one-liners and having a fancy sports car.  </li>
            <li> I did notice the first day how women seemed to get closer to talk to me in public places, I was at Starbucks the first morning</li>
            <li> and this older women was practically sitting on my lap to have a conversation.</li>
            <li> Our jobs take us into office buildings routinely, so that was our main test.  </li>
            <li> This actually works, I noticed more attention and even some women acting nervous</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very masculine scent and very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before with limited but positive results, so I ordered some more from Amazon and got it yesterday and put some on when I went out to play trivia at the local pub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before with limited but positive results, so I ordered some more from Amazon and got it yesterday and put some on when I went out to play trivia at the local pub.</li>
            <li> most of them who don&#x27;t keep long conversations just happens to stick around longer much longer further when i pass girls on the street</li>
            <li> Smells good though, so don&#x27;t worry about that part at least!</li>
            <li> but I have high expectations.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product, two squirts</li>
            <li> but it cost is high</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone, men or women.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and the added bonus</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s a placebo effect, but when I wear this cologne I feel that I have received more positive attention from people.  </li>
            <li> Even if it&#x27;s psychological, the smell blends nicely with other colognes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you want to standout more than the average Joe!</li>
            <li> This Cologne smells like aftershave, just a little better.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s mostly alcohol and contains extremely little pheromones.      </li>
            <li> so I will keep using and taking advantage of this little magic attractant.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> I would recamend this product to anyone looking to get a little more out of the art of scent accesories.</li>
            <li> I am very encouraged with the results so far.</li>
            <li> WOW this stuff really works as advertised</li>
            <li> Within probably 5-10 minutes of being in the bar she came over and started talking to me, we ended up chatting for nearly the whole night over 2</li>
            <li> and so far I would say it really works.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see an effect in everyday interactions but seemed to notice one when I was already on a date or in a setting where you are looking for a sexual partner...</li>
            <li> Smell is normal ...accepted....</li>
            <li> Did not do much, so safe to say this was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the product, I use it everyday with my cologne, price is somewhat steep</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice a big difference but does smell good, the bottle is small for the price i think, I don&#x27;t know if I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I, like I&#x27;m sure many of you are, was very skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> if you have the extra money its definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Certainly worth the money, and definitely helped boost my confidence.</li>
            <li> I plan on using this product with much success in the future!</li>
            <li> The boyfriend of one of them could smell it, so I am guessing that men are able to really pick up that scent but woman can&#x27;t, or at least as much as we can.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Got to have good game also.</li>
            <li> Plastic bottle is less likely to break than glass which is nice.</li>
            <li> My social life has advanced immensely.  </li>
            <li> DId a simple test by spraying this on the subway platform right before I boarded the train.  </li>
            <li> left and right</li>
            <li> I got the product in the mail and put it on right before i went to class, i&#x27;m in college and today this girl in my class started talking to me out of the blue</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just starting with pheromones, the price seems about right.</li>
            <li> I Received a $10 Certificate from this Company if I gave them a positive feed back, this is Very wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did feel a bit more confident because of it, so its hard to say at this point if the extra attention is from the smells, or the extra confidence on my part.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;d recommend using this with a little caution and only around the kind of women you want to attract.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it might not smell very good, but i was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even mention I had purchased a new cologne she just called me out and said she didn&#x27;t want me to wear it ever again.  </li>
            <li> nothing new</li>
            <li> Well, no one has even noticed I am wearing a new cologne.</li>
            <li> I have started getting lots of hugs each day, and the new running joke is that after a hug, the women giggle and exclaim, &amp;#34;I smell like Dan!!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I decided to try something new</li>
            <li> but no I didn&#x27;t see anything new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost about to buy a new one</li>
            <li> Used at work and didnt notice anything new from co-worker.</li>
            <li> , I tried it on wrist and the smell was fine, but only if you had your nose right up to it, up to a half hour</li>
            <li> shipping of this product was fast and discreet, and i recieved it a day before the estimated shipping time.&lt;br /&gt;i ordered this product as an impulse buy with low expectations and was not expecting much from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cologne doesn&#x27;t really have much of an odor, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any response from women different from when I&#x27;m not wearing it.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle but nice.  </li>
            <li> I turn around and there all behind me following me lol</li>
            <li> The girls will chat with you longer than the normal, they pay more attention to the talk and it seems that want to stay with you longer than the usual.</li>
            <li> All in all, if it really works or not, I think it is worth a try if your are curious.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much more potential this stuff has, but a little attention is always nice.</li>
            <li> Not sure that I&#x27;ve noticed any difference in wearing this product over any other good cologne I&#x27;ve worn, but I can say that it does have a pleasing scent, and I will update this review if any noticeable effects do really reveal themselves from the pheromones.</li>
            <li> Very Masculine smell.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for such products.</li>
            <li> Using very sparingly, maybe I&#x27;ll try a little more next time as it just sprays out</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product more or less for the fun of it and to see if it could actually work.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I got home and ordered my own bottle!</li>
            <li> first of all it takes an alpha male attitude and body language to attract...</li>
            <li> i did notice a girl whom i&#x27;ve spoken to in the past at the gym act a lot more peppy when i spoke with her</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed not only women go out of their to talk to me, but also I seemed to get more respect from other employees (men)</li>
            <li> I tried the oil first, thinking it would last longer.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It definitely made a difference the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That was a month ago and now I&#x27;ll buy it definitely again because it really works!</li>
            <li> It does have some affect on females only if they are already interested.</li>
            <li> Much better price than other similar products I have used.  </li>
            <li> probably this is my first review ever, I think this product will not do too obvious effect.</li>
            <li> ( generally, I don&#x27;t wear that much fragrance stuffs, so maybe to me</li>
            <li> i just got this 2 days ago, i sprayed some on and had a female friend come over, i had just made some enchiladas so the kitchen was smelling greasy, anyways as soon as my friend walked in, first words she said were: \\&quot;</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So apparently, you also don&#x27;t need to join online dating sites or hang out at night clubs to meet women and really do nothing but just sit there and let them come to you.  </li>
            <li> They seem to be friendlier and more responsive than usual.</li>
            <li> Women have been gravitating to me more than usual.</li>
            <li> Product smells a bit strong so use a little each time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars just because I personally think it smells good, maybe a bit subtle, but (like the oil)</li>
            <li> but i think it was strange that someone would move their seat farther back, where the veiw was not as good as where they were previously sitting.  </li>
            <li> I used it two nights later prior to going out, it has a nice smell on it&#x27;s own, and applied to neck etc, but I also sprayed some cologne on my chest as normal, needless to say it seemed as if it worked!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from this, I wore it every day in the Summer and pushed myself in public, no extra attention, nothing special.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pherx for two days now and have had woman at work and from the bar being extra nice to me and wanting to talk longer than usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious if statistically I was just lucky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pleasant smell, kinda reminds me of my dad (in a non creepy way).</li>
            <li> But it does fade away a little quick!</li>
            <li> Wish I could write a positive review because i was hoping this product actually worked.</li>
            <li> It got their attention, but after that it was up to us to keep them interested.&lt;br /&gt;Trying to single out one particular woman didn&#x27;t do much, andworked better when a small group was gathered for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long lasting fresh scent - I like it just for that !</li>
            <li> The last two times I saw her at large gatherings with friends</li>
            <li> At first I used it only but then combined it with my habitual perfume as to give a touch to this one that is stronger and of major scope.</li>
            <li> Attraction to the scent wears off quickly as the sense of smell becomes desensitized, just like any other smell.</li>
            <li> Seems to make &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; a little easier!! :)</li>
            <li> The body language they had was a clear giveaway.</li>
            <li> I was a big skeptic of the whole pheromone thing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the added confidence that did it or if the cologne helped, but I never got one from a complete stranger before the cologne.</li>
            <li> so I put it on as instructed (directly on skin and not on clothes)without letting her know.</li>
            <li> actually 1 of the girls at work was smelling me and said that there was soothing on me that really like that</li>
            <li> and I noticed women were actually naturally coming towards me.</li>
            <li> girls go wild</li>
            <li> Been using this for about a week so far.  </li>
            <li> Stay far from this one.</li>
            <li> stay far from this one.</li>
            <li> I notice alot more looks and smiles when I wear it, if it&#x27;s a placebo ( which it&#x27;s not) at least it boosts confidence.</li>
            <li> You have some of that naturally</li>
            <li> It still is some classy smelling Cologne, though.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> lightly spritzed it on and also heavily applied</li>
            <li> and i will definitely be buying another bottle very soon.  </li>
            <li> Of course it takes some effort in actually approaching women, but when I have, I do have get very receptive responses.</li>
            <li> but I thought I&#x27;d give some comments so far.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> bought this to try it and so far it seems to be working how to keep trying a longer to see how well</li>
            <li> You just have to determine how fast you want to buy the next bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think less is more, better to be subtle then obvious.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested this product out completely, it could have just been a fluke.</li>
            <li> , I surprised my girlfriend at work</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really all you need to expect out of this product, and totally what I wanted out of it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only one way to really find out...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young guy.</li>
            <li> To complete this review.</li>
            <li> but I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> always end with a wild atraction</li>
            <li> because, as I said, it&#x27;s a bit early in the process for me to make a call on its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> since she is sensitive to smell.</li>
            <li> I of course didn&#x27;t try anything on them, so I can&#x27;t say if they were aroused by the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what sort of effect it has on females in regards to sexual attraction, but I have noticed that the women around me have been friendlier lately.</li>
            <li> / aroused.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing PherX to work the last few days and have noticed I receive a lot more attention from the ladies in my office.  </li>
            <li> Fresh scent - not much results beyond that.</li>
            <li> I can only tell you that it is worth that extra look.  </li>
            <li> I tested this a few times when go outside and notice a difference in the way woman approach me (they are more receptive).</li>
            <li> I just want to take the experiment more extreme, since the stripper sniffed my neck, she started kissing my nick which is not normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been able to use the product a few times but I like it.</li>
            <li> The first date ended up lasting 6 hours, nothing naughty happened, but we had loads of fun</li>
            <li> It smelled decent, but I never got any compliments or enhanced attraction out in social encounters.</li>
            <li> Only good for giving false hope.</li>
            <li> you only can have synthetic pheromones, what a loud of nonsense!!!</li>
            <li> So for me, it is just a small boost, but for others less experienced it can make a big difference.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high if it is just cologne, but if it actually works then I will update my review later to 5 stars and buy more bottles.</li>
            <li> As long as your expectations are realistic and not ridiculous, I would recommend trying this.</li>
            <li> So I got half the product at full price and can&#x27;t spray it on.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell if my (female) co-workers were just being nice as usual or if they actually were affected by the pheromones.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have such a small bottle in case you don&#x27;t want to travel with a larger cologne bottle.</li>
            <li> It has been used in several social settings and I have received a couple of positive comments on the cologne I was wearing.</li>
            <li> seems to get attention, subtle but noticed some women wanting to talk more, opening up to conversation faster?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the product works as most of us expect it to work, however I can definitely say that it does make feel cnfident .</li>
            <li> I used as directed and tried it out in different situations, the first was dinner at a local steak house</li>
            <li> First bottle I have ever bought and will definitely buy another when my current one runs out.</li>
            <li> After using it for only a short time I have already noticed a difference in the way women look at me, while also having a higher self-confidence knowing that I have this stuff on.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but women will notice you more with this on.</li>
            <li> They were like an old gym bag, but PherX actually smells like a normal cologne.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that she didn&#x27;t complain about the scent, (I can&#x27;t say if what happened next was because of the spray, since it&#x27;s normal in a relationship.)</li>
            <li> High end colognes both men&#x27;s and woman&#x27;s contain pheromone as a propitiatory ingredient, and both work the same way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scents</li>
            <li> I bought this product with high expectations, it is a total lie.</li>
            <li> Im a masculine gay guy and can be confused for straight, but I have women tripping over me to talk.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a about  a week  now and have really noticed a marked increase of attention from my female coworkers.  </li>
            <li> Well, lately, my wife is taking more of an interest in what I&#x27;m saying, &amp; will occasionally give me a soft pat on the hand.</li>
            <li> I received above normal attention from women.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> goes a little quick</li>
            <li> It burns a little bit when you spray it on, but that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a uniqe, long lasting, mild fragrence that adds the element of attraction and an overall scence of confidence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just trying to help other guys who are looking for a decent pheromone cologne at a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;Max</li>
            <li> The previous one I ordered was a little more oily which made it last longer and scent was much nicer.</li>
            <li> I have had mixed results with trying new pheromone products but was hopeful about this one after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the whole side of the bus that i was sitting on was open with 7 or 8 seats and instead of sitting a couple seats over theysat in the seat directly next to me and started talking to me</li>
            <li> this product is aa a total scam, it says on the bottle it consists of human pheromones, really???</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t buy to attract other women, just wanted to see if my wife noticed me smell different and possibly pay a little more attention.</li>
            <li> I noticed a higher level of attention by the other girls.</li>
            <li> First time I used it I didn&#x27;t need to introduce myself to other ladies at my work.</li>
            <li> It is priced half as much as the normal cologne I wear anyway.</li>
            <li> After the first time I&#x27;ve tried pushing the sprayer down only 1/2 way or less if possible although this isn&#x27;t easy to do.  </li>
            <li> When I first saw the review I got very curious</li>
            <li> I tried this product before in the past, and now that I&#x27;m single again, I decided to try it out once more.</li>
            <li> The actual fragrance is a little bit odd or cheap or something, so I added a few drops of my favorite citrus aftershave.</li>
            <li> This product is a pure scam, it doesn&#x27;t do what it is suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;There were absolutely no change in behaviour by any one after wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li> I recommend it in closed places, in my long-term opinion it seems that if it has certain effect.</li>
            <li> The evenings were also tested, in restaurants and bars/clubs.&lt;br /&gt;We also had access to a K9 trained to locate missing people.&lt;br /&gt;Our individual notes, showed a little over half of the women, both in the offices and in clubs, reacted more friendly when we had the attractant on.&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
            <li> It smells amazing though...like expensive cologne.</li>
            <li> general</li>
            <li> Also just people in general.</li>
            <li> I could barely smell it</li>
            <li> Thanks but no thanks Zyloo.</li>
            <li> I will be testing another pheromone cologne for men (attract women) in the near future.</li>
            <li> I bought the Pherx bottle for an early Christmas gift this year and the results were definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> That next morning I was pleasently surprised to have a uninterupted minute of romance before our child came around...</li>
            <li> Seems to have desired effect as far as I can tell, will definitely leave complete review at a later date</li>
            <li> As others have said before, this isn&#x27;t going to fix all that is wrong with you and magically make all your women problems vanish, but you will at least get noticed more which could lead to something over not being noticed at all.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want your *Top Secret* formulary, just which pheromones I&#x27;m saturating myself with.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, spend it on a book or something useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it fairly consistently for the past couple of weeks squirting behind each ear and to be totally honest</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first,then when i tried it for the first time i definitely noticed females being more social toward me and not having to exert any extra effort!and as for the smell</li>
            <li> I previously reviewed this product with 2 words (GOOD STUFF), was not good enough for amazon policies!</li>
            <li> This product came in about Tuesday of this week, so far i&#x27;ve had nothing currently change in my social interactions ...</li>
            <li> tried this, and the one woman I pulled in for a quick goodbye hug stopped with a visible desire to keep the conversation going longer than she&#x27;d intended just a few seconds prior.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it was a lucky night for me</li>
            <li> I was interested in the fragrance but think a little mild aftershave is probably better and less expensive.</li>
            <li> This or any other cologne, really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting more smiles from girls and even had this girl who hated me smile at me for the first time.</li>
            <li> Product has been used once and appears to enhance social interactions.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say but as far as I was able to tell this product has no effect on women.</li>
            <li> I suggest doing a little research first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only been using it for a short time, so I will try to update this review if I notice any  major affects.</li>
            <li> People in general were drawn to me in a mysterious way.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable compared to other similar items.</li>
            <li> thanks for stealing my money for a watered down product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested this product in several venues (work, church, bar, social settings)...  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in terms of my social interactions with the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> I have recently received this product and was astounded even after the first few uses.</li>
            <li> Envy is not cheap, but the low end of higher quality.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s not a miracle worker; you still need to look presentable and be able to act normal and have a little game.</li>
            <li> and I was very surprised by her comment as I have never heard her nor expected her to say anything like that.  </li>
            <li> I normally wear it with a splash of my other cologne.</li>
            <li> Only down side was that it did not last the whole night.</li>
            <li> I have had a number of other products much like this one, but not nearly with similar results.</li>
            <li> You would be better off using water, saving the $30, and at the very least water will quench your thirst unlike this snake oil!</li>
            <li> Recently the company sent me a sample of this product in the &amp;#34;Oil&amp;#34; version, the smell is much stronger so a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> a little does go a long way,im jus finishing up my first and.</li>
            <li> I did read a lot of different post from a lot of different website, both good and bad, I still ordered the product anyway.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the pheromones really work to attract women, however this product has increased my confidence when going into social settings.  </li>
            <li> it smells like piss and it has other fragrances that make it hard to mix with other colognes to get a better smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work with her or any other woman as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> (Attract Women)has a unique smell which can attract women, it works well when you spray it on your neck, area behind the ear and wrist.&lt;br /&gt;buy</li>
            <li> Not sure if I use enough or how much to use.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that the smell does not last that long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As trivia was on-going, a 20 year old, pretty college girl sitting at the table behind me started standing at our table and outright flirting with me.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t going to get girls jumping all over you, but in the real world every little bit counts!</li>
            <li> Average looking guy who could lose a few pounds, so I kept track of who sat next to me on the subway for a week prior to first wearing the item.</li>
            <li> One girl in particular I&#x27;ve had some conversation with on and off in the past, we had spoken on Facebook a few times but nothing really progressed.</li>
            <li> It sprays pretty hard) and would then pass it over her face a bit while we were laying on the couch.</li>
            <li> I have been on several dates since I received this product, and I can&#x27;t say anything negative nor positive about it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if i am doing the dosage correctly as there is no instructions on how much to use.</li>
            <li> I really believe there is no magic here.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the Phermones really work or not,</li>
            <li> If you are like me sometime in the past you&#x27;ve heard of attractant pheromones,or used them before,and maybe wondering to yourself,&#x27; ..do these things really work?..&#x27;</li>
            <li> not sure if it really worked or not.</li>
            <li> However the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
            <li> You want to target your the center of your bare chest, your wrists and the sides of your neck.</li>
            <li> but like another reviewer said, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long...  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last long on you</li>
            <li> then my average body spray, I have noticed that within the two days that I&#x27;ve been using the product that females do seam to slow down and look more then before</li>
            <li> course, I graciouslly turned her down because I&#x27;m too old for her but thanked her for making me feel so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bottom line is it works, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I instantly felt the women drawn to me, not in crazy &amp;#34; I want to be on top of you &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> lastly i am not a \\&quot;sleep around person\\&quot; but really curious to find out if it actually gets</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete waste of money and is the ultimate &amp;#34;placebo&amp;#34; for marks like myself who bought it.  </li>
            <li> so i put some on and went next door to see my single  neighbor .</li>
            <li> Neither negative nor positive.  </li>
            <li> lay, hope you won&#x27;t be out of business, if you would, notify me so I can buy 100 of them and sell it to other chumps who have no success with women at incredulous high price.</li>
            <li> One squirt of this on the neck is a pretty mild and descent scent; may smell bad to some, not to others.</li>
            <li> At first results are subtle...</li>
            <li> As an experiment I have switched back and forth between this and other colognes and the differences seem tiny if any.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell of this cologne, and it wasn&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
            <li> She kind of shocked herself after she heard herself saying</li>
            <li> I was familier with Pheromone science long before I ran into this product, however I had never tried any.</li>
            <li> I tried it several times around women, and saw absolutely no attention.</li>
            <li> i am a bartender so was curious to see if people would act differently when ordering and it has made no difference in this enviornment</li>
            <li> night went out on the town with friends  had strange women all over me and wanting me  i&#x27;am</li>
            <li> However, women don&#x27;t think it smells strange.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s not really a plus for me, but for the younger guys out there it may be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After careful testing in my personal life, I&#x27;ve concluded there is no measurable effect.</li>
            <li> This paired with a bit of confidence goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> One bottle has lasted me quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells strange.  </li>
            <li> I have been using PherX Pheromone Cologne for Men(Attract Women)for a few days now, but so far I have not seen any effect.</li>
            <li> The girl Iv been after for a long time</li>
            <li> I normally am in the room alone where my wife usually is hanging out with the children watching tv.</li>
            <li> guy but haven&#x27;t had time to date until recently and was curious to see how this would do.</li>
            <li> so long, I might have forgotten how to close the deal.</li>
            <li> As others have said in previous comments, I too was skeptical at first over this product and if it could really work.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a definite &amp;#34;ice breaker&amp;#34; effect, especially with women who had previously been aloof.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a bottle of Adidas or Calvin Klein cologne instead since they actually give more quantity and better quality than this PherX crap that is absurdly overpriced.</li>
            <li> At my other job, a female coworker said she had a friend that she wanted me to meet.</li>
            <li> For 30 dollars i would recommend purchasing a bottle or two and rotate them them in with your other cologne&#x27;s or just use this daily.</li>
            <li> I definitely think this sets them apart from other Amazon sellers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely nicer than the other one PherX sells.</li>
            <li> We tested this and one other similar attractant over the course of a week.  </li>
            <li> I purchased PherX Pheromone Cologne and decided to test it out just the other night at the local bar.</li>
            <li> is that it costs far less than the other brands.</li>
            <li> I am 68 yrs old, it is hard for me to be reviewing a product that is for the younger crowd!!</li>
            <li> , rather let it air dry</li>
            <li> Wearing a spritz of straight pheromones be would ridiculous overkill.</li>
            <li> , I wasted my money ) ; few men&#x27;s are attracting , if u have any Question ask seller , the seller tells fast , one day I applyed 9 spray&#x27;s  all girls &amp; women</li>
            <li> Compared to a multitude of other products on the market, you can definitely do a helluva lot worse for a substantially higher dollar amount.</li>
            <li> but it was a limited timeframe...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m single so any edge you can get helps</li>
            <li> I walked into work and turned heads, usually all I say is hello and keep walking, this time around they said hello, and kept the conversation alive.</li>
            <li> When it first arrived the pump was broken</li>
            <li> To me it has a weird musky and yet sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li> This product will not make women tear your clothes off, but it will definitely get them to bring down any defensive walls.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull panties down, but it definitely outs you in their radar.</li>
            <li> Am a single black male.</li>
            <li> My Burberry, Armani, Versace, and other colognes receive far more attention than this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> so you could apply less and use multiple sprays if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is odd though that the difference is only 2 mg between the two..just saying)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, this is only my experience, and only over the past couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a Friday evening, so I showered and sprayed just a slight puff of this stuff on the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> About a half an hour later I get a call from my wife, &amp;#34;are</li>
            <li> Chemical pheromones only do half the job.</li>
            <li> I like it, it seems to work decently or not at all; still figuring it out.</li>
            <li> The next day I did not wear it and I received the normal amount of attention I usually get, whether it is the product or just my confidence I am still not sure.</li>
            <li> So I go to the firm&#x27;s products, and the only other product that was different was &#x27;Pheromone for Women&#x27;(attract men), so I picked it to see if it would work on my wife like the other</li>
            <li> It is that extra little advantage that will give you the edge and confidence you need.</li>
            <li> Depending on your bodies ph level, can smell a little different.</li>
            <li> I hardly spoke to her, merely a \\&quot;hello, how are you doing?\\&quot; and nothing more.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and it lasts surprisingly long for those crazy nights out!</li>
            <li> I tried it a couple of times and got extra attention from at least one female each time.  </li>
            <li> Was curious after reading a couple of articles and believe there is science to support it, but for me the PherX did not supply results.</li>
            <li> I have made these and a few others a regular part of my arsenol!</li>
            <li> Not really...    </li>
            <li> effect unknown</li>
            <li> A few minutes later, I couldn&#x27;t help but be surrounded by a couple of beauties.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of money and it smells like roach spray.</li>
            <li> But I was curious, and I figure it wouldn&#x27;t be</li>
            <li> not much to say, no effect.</li>
            <li> I was curious</li>
            <li> As part of an ad hoc, pseudo-scientific trial, the product has shown a minimal active life span beyond application and subsequent subject testing.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no effect</li>
            <li> I spent a couple of hours reading and researching and settled on PherX.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The same make up that i wear everyday was asked what i did</li>
            <li> Week one (no pheromones) almost always men or empty space.  </li>
            <li> I sat next to a girl at lunch and spoke with her for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I was always curious about pheromones</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to compare it against pheromone oil.</li>
            <li> I was curious about pheromones, so I decided to purchase this product just to try it out.  </li>
            <li> It was fun to experiment and see that it didn&#x27;t work at all just another thing to prove science of attraction wrong.</li>
            <li> I feel like it mentally helps me talk to women and</li>
            <li> i think it has a faint but fresh</li>
            <li> me tell you,  that seems to really not be the case.  </li>
            <li> Drys fast and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue behind.</li>
            <li> I then put some on my wrist (be careful when pumping the bottle.</li>
            <li> A few women were told about the test ahead of time to see if they could recognize any noticeable differences, and give us a different perspective.  </li>
            <li> I was curious about how it would work, and if it works, what reactions were to happen.</li>
            <li> I would definitely mix it with some other cologne as the smell dissipates after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I use a little bit along with Polo Black or Polo Blue.  </li>
            <li> ; it smells a little strange to me</li>
            <li> Just remember, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I doubt it will work well with other ladies.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mix it with other colognes too.</li>
            <li> Looked at other products (without buying) and then bought PherX Pheromone after watching the clip provided.</li>
            <li> I on the other hand, will not be buying PherX again.  </li>
            <li> I think it was an overlook since I was supposed to get it friday, but other than that...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li> It shows that it has the same ingredients as the one for women, but I am not sure.</li>
            <li> , check out some of my other reviews on other products.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed a small dose, medium even extra strength .Nothing .</li>
            <li> These colognes are pretty expensive, so you want to do research instead of buying everything in sight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure, but I think that this stuff actually works.</li>
            <li> They said go and pick out any other of their products other than this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this on accident, but since I couldnt return it due to some laws, I figured Id give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to mix this with any other cologne unless you want to.  </li>
            <li> any other way to use other than given?&lt;br /&gt;should</li>
            <li> drink other than spray?</li>
            <li> So I have used two other Pheromone cologne&#x27;s before.</li>
            <li> I would def recommend but feel other products might be stronger.</li>
            <li> saying it doesn&#x27;t work due to the other 5 star reviews</li>
            <li> I immediately started getting compliments on the way that i smelled, even though I have been wearing my other cologne for years.</li>
            <li> a big waste of money!</li>
            <li> So from my experience ( see other reviews)</li>
            <li> Before I went out the other day I sprayed some of this on my wrists and neck and</li>
            <li> If pheromones do exist in humans we probably cover them up and maks them with all the other smelly stuff we put on.</li>
            <li> She swears it&#x27;s NOT the pheromones, but we went from once a week to every other night.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my wife, and a couple of other friends(didn&#x27;t tell them what it was) to see if it affected them in anyway, and they all said no.</li>
            <li> Any other time it&#x27;s the kids or nothing.</li>
            <li> Other tools are required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No headaches like some other colognes.</li>
            <li> You have to be in extreme close proximity in order for the scent to be recognized.  </li>
            <li> I actually have trouble smelling it, I just get a very faint sweet smell.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because i was very curious in how this worked(saw</li>
            <li> The bottle came to me half empty,and wet.</li>
            <li> I used a few  times amd working every single time .</li>
            <li> The big difference is the smell,I have tried other pheromone colognes in the past and they were so heavy in smell.</li>
            <li> At first, when buying this product, I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> I am an average looking guy.</li>
            <li> If anyone here does that, all you did was commit a real sin towards others for a lousy 10 dollars for a company who scammed you and those who bought because of your review.  </li>
            <li> well at least this specific one.</li>
            <li> As with the other one (oil-based) I&#x27;m not exactly  being mobbed by hordes of admirers, but it seems to make a difference in everyday interactions.</li>
            <li> Did not know what to really expect from this product, so my expectation where low and I am a very skeptical person.  </li>
            <li> only complaint would have to be the smell.</li>
            <li> It appears to break down resistance but does not overwhelm the woman.</li>
            <li> It still works on 10&#x27;s, but they don&#x27;t jump down your pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amount-</li>
            <li> yet this isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;Tear down the Walls - Get you lots of women&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but my bottle leaks if it is stored upside down,</li>
            <li> When I say it was like we were the only dudes at the party, I mean it.</li>
            <li> But I am still not married.!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than the other stuff!</li>
            <li> It mixes well with other colognes and adds a little spice.</li>
            <li> The product may provide different results for other people, but for me it was not a good investment.</li>
            <li> It mix&#x27;s well with other stuff I wear, I did get a few compliments, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference but its not as affective as it claims....</li>
            <li> My G/F NEVER used to say anything about my cologne previously.  </li>
            <li> Usually we sit at the end of sofa corner and watch, thus not touching and have some personal zone for movement.</li>
            <li> Once I put it on, she came close to me within half an hour</li>
            <li> think PherX works on about half of the girls</li>
            <li> am dating women half my age....</li>
            <li> The scent seems to wear off within half an hour, though...</li>
            <li> But for those who need a slight boost in energy for the sake of confidence, then go ahead and try this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-1 star because package was slightly leaking on arrival.</li>
            <li> The oil seems to have less fragrance and is easier to apply to pulse points.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it less than one star.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe just spend 6 months, half a year working out and restoring your confidence.....</li>
            <li> BUT I have noticed a slight increase in attention when I wear this out.</li>
            <li> I had previously used pheromone colognes and additives from a well-known website, but had been put off by their customer service and decided to try elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> and I already saw a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> I was a shy, awkward kind of guy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;science&amp;#34;, or merely the confidence I have when I spray it, but i mix it with my normal cologne, and it seems to attract women, like they wanna be close to me.  </li>
            <li> So I have tried Pheromone products in the past and never really saw any results.</li>
            <li> Typically we go out for dinner then settle in watching a little netflix and she falls asleep in my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No special reaction from the ladies ....</li>
            <li> Women hold their gazes a little longer and want to extend thir conversations with you.</li>
            <li> so I spray a little colonge with it.</li>
            <li> Apply a little while before you go out to let it &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; and dissipate somewhat.</li>
            <li> All it is , is a little scented water.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work even a little</li>
            <li> Also I will note that it does smell a little bit like perspiration after its cover smell goes away.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive that there would be a musk type smell in a product like this.  </li>
            <li> and I just mix a little cologne with it.</li>
            <li> Yes this product has a scent that is somewhat enticing, however, it doesn&#x27;t stick in you, females, including one of my close girlfriends saw little or no difference.</li>
            <li> With other women, they seem to get jealous of my fiance and are really tense with each other when I am around.</li>
            <li> luck men, and don&#x27;t let the craziness of life pull you all down!</li>
            <li> A little bit on the pulse thin skin areas such as wrists, inside elbows and neck just under the ears.</li>
            <li> Yes I have already recommended this to a friend who has a shy side as far as conversation with women.</li>
            <li> I decided to spray a few spritz on neck and wrists just before going to work.</li>
            <li> crack a few flirtatious jokes to me and some smiles.</li>
            <li> and I just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I even had a few friends try them out</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t waste your $30</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> a few day&#x27;s i do not notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a few times</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn the product a few days at work now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This product those not work do not buy it, you will waste your money.</li>
            <li> using this product everyday with the body wash</li>
            <li> I tried this a few times and the product does not work.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money</li>
            <li> I think this product was a waste of my money...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update in a few day and see if anything changes</li>
            <li> yes a few glances here and there</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t care im not buying anything like this again, waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> The product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to school in a few hours</li>
            <li> Bought this a few weeks ago and I have noticed some differences out in the field.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> NO WAY DAWG DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY</li>
            <li> a firm believer and everyone needs to get a hold of this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Pherx bottle for myself a few weeks ago to see if it would help me with the attraction.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve also sparked up a few conversations with strangers who just wanted to say hi.</li>
            <li> but this product blah, don&#x27;t waste your $ on it.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product at first.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t waste your money thinking this will cure your loneliness.</li>
            <li> Waste of money..</li>
            <li> but then later on in the night it got worse</li>
            <li> I ordered the cologne and received it a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Have to reapply every few hours.</li>
            <li> but i have been using this product a few days</li>
            <li> It smelled like soap and it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> A waste of time and money ,it&#x27;s not working for me .is</li>
            <li> i tried this one and a few others  </li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve order this product and been using it for a few days now.</li>
            <li> , the weird part is that I got attention from women that are a considerable distance from me ( around 10 meters )</li>
            <li> As I said started to work after a few days using it.</li>
            <li> I advise not to wear to heavy a cologne or body spray with it.</li>
            <li> Between the 3 of us we got close 15 at this party, this was not a huge party either.</li>
            <li> at that point get up and do a few things until I&#x27;m tired enough to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> PherX doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant, but Zyloo should really cut down the size of the bottle and reduce the amount of alcohol used as a carrier.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;I think...\\&quot; part is due to the fact that attraction and the reasons for it are hard to quantify.</li>
            <li> no strong pherom or smell about it.</li>
            <li> Very odd that I even bought this item.</li>
            <li> the title says, I&#x27;m not sure if it just game me confidence or actually attracted her, but seems to have worked.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m not willing to spend the $60 on Zyloo&#x27;s PherX Oil, doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a quality product/ will work for you[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> You could wear it by itself, though I usually combine it with a little of something</li>
            <li> I have noticed small changes in women that im around everyday, so im changing dosage alittle.</li>
            <li> Which means with or without the product I can get the few head turns I usually get and interact with women and garnish their attention.</li>
            <li> and i do noticed a few of them standing alittle closer to me than usual...</li>
            <li> That said, what I&#x27;ve noticed over the past few weeks are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when I look like crap or I&#x27;m in a rush, girls will try and get a quick word in if we are stopped at a crosswalk.</li>
            <li> and I feel a little clarity or something!</li>
            <li> has helped a little!</li>
            <li> So far I have not experienced a dramatic change in the way females behave around me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its not a sure thing to get you laid</li>
            <li> From the day I began using PherX, I noticed that women were friendlier to me than usual.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this!  </li>
            <li> The 2-3 times I have seen her in the past couple of weeks</li>
            <li> Normally she is very shy and reserved (always has been), but add this in the mix</li>
            <li> , im not sure if this was a coincidence</li>
            <li> It comes in a small bottle</li>
            <li> This is not a magic spray that will let you get all the women, but I have noticed that it does help.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it works because of the pheromones,</li>
            <li> Since I started using the product, I have been approached on the street for things like directions or small talk.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not magic in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s ineffective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works or not yet.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it works on my wife</li>
            <li> In fact the one time I wore this product, she happened to not have sex with me and we usually have sex every time I spend the night.</li>
            <li> Looks like it works, but it not magic spray.</li>
            <li> The biggest thing I noticed is that people around the office that were usually stand-offish or crabby etc.</li>
            <li> I wore it to one of classes and the exchange student beside, who I have tried to push past the \\&quot;classroom friends\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I did research online, and the part of your body that responds to pheromones is in your nose, so there may be a small percent of the population who doesn&#x27;t respond to it.</li>
            <li> Well, tried this product on and off for the past two weeks as an experiment.  </li>
            <li> Not sure yet if this works.</li>
            <li> While wearing this cologne, I went to a small gathering of friends where I met a girl who was a friend of a friend.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this product claims its MO.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work, waste of money!</li>
            <li> It seems like a small amount of product for what you pay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how to &amp;#34;test&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the spray works or not.</li>
            <li> But is not a magic potion.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> The girl was all over me and everything seemed a bit easier than usually.</li>
            <li> but I have found that my female supervisor has become less cold towards me and has invited me out with her and colleagues drinking.</li>
            <li> have tried &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; colognes, and very very few of them mix with my body chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s up to me from there, but this gets the hard part out of the way.</li>
            <li> I have my doubts as to how to use it all as hard, but I&#x27;m seeing changes every day</li>
            <li> We were laughing so hard.</li>
            <li> its really hard to explain this products effects or if its just a placebo effect, but it seems to be a legit product.</li>
            <li> and I hardly got anything done at work .</li>
            <li> its hard to explain</li>
            <li> Now hardly any girl talk to me after applying to this.</li>
            <li> I put a spray on each wrist, one on the neck, and sometimes a little behind my ears.  </li>
            <li> By the time I got there it&#x27;d been at least 30-45 minutes</li>
            <li> (morning traffic sucks)</li>
            <li> At least the PherX brand works.</li>
            <li> , so dont expect a big increase in your sex life if you are awkward around women</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything negative about this product either.</li>
            <li> To say the least.</li>
            <li> and One of them stayed with me till  late night.</li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve worn this, I&#x27;ve had at least one girl come up to me in the bar (even if I&#x27;m sitting off by myself not talking to anyone).</li>
            <li> My common sense told me that this s</li>
            <li> Although, I have noticed a lot of interaction with women lately, and it has improved my mood and charisma.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t just drop their panties at one whiff, but at least you catch their eye with it.</li>
            <li> This product SUCKS.</li>
            <li> ( 2nd place is men spicy scent pheromones ) over apply it may dangerous to eyes), ( ( PherX Pheromone Cologne for Men (Attract Women) -</li>
            <li> but that stuff is way expensive and not much in the bottle.</li>
            <li> it will evaporate and stop smell (at least for me) after about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this product for yrs at least 10.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing it around lately, but it seems that you need to be close for them to smell it.</li>
            <li> However, I am forced to admit after trying it myself, pheromones work.</li>
            <li> what I mean by that is a tailored suit</li>
            <li> : I mean what i say .....</li>
            <li> i mean it may work for me and do not work for sombody else,but you can try</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t exist</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been rather quiet and shy, but when I wear this, my confidence is raised a LOT!</li>
            <li> but when you try it you will know what I mean....</li>
            <li> This stuff is the illy all the girls in the club wana rub and tug on my rug if you know what i mean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magical like some seam to expect!</li>
            <li> Barely has any smell, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not just pheromone colognes in general that smell bad.</li>
            <li> My wife arrives home from work exhausted from her week as usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure when I tried it that I got a false sense of security but</li>
            <li> If I can make any criticism about this product, it is that it can be a little annoying to have to negotiate flirtation with multiple girls at once, and</li>
            <li> I will not continue to use this product after the first aplication just because of its smlell, it stinks, the smell in unpleasant, like cat or dog piss.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle smell and women seem to relax and be friendlier around it.</li>
            <li> , I spray it on after I shower in the morning - subtle smell stays on me all day.  </li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> The effects are subtle but noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Women like the subtle scent -</li>
            <li> The effect is subtle.</li>
            <li> Fake all not true.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at 1st,  but after using it I would seriously recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> The odor smells similar to sunscreen, so the smell is not too bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve talked to several friends and tried the product and instead of attracting, and fleeing away from me for how bad it smells.</li>
            <li> Not good at attracting anything at all.</li>
            <li> not good.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical , but after a few days of using it, started to notice it working: Women , looking and smiling .</li>
            <li> This is a fake product and needs to be taken down false advertisement.</li>
            <li> Anymore then that seams to make me feel sick for a short time</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s weird because we&#x27;ve seen each other in class for almost 2 months and nothing ever happened before!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe its a weak batch.</li>
            <li> I would give this negative stars if i could buyer beware!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little awkward).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but not really a scent I would choose on purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> behind our ears and not one girl tured there</li>
            <li> Ever since I have used them about 4 months ago, my game has increased 100 fold.</li>
            <li> I cannot confirm or deny the Science behind the formula</li>
            <li> You need game.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ve got game.</li>
            <li> but this product didn&#x27;t extend my game.</li>
            <li> maybe something behind all this.</li>
            <li> MY CHANCES WORSE</li>
            <li> I would spray the product twice on each wrist and rub it behind my ears.</li>
            <li> and I was even annoyed at the smell of it.</li>
            <li> of course it  is not going to have every woman in the city block running behind you</li>
            <li> I have been out of the game</li>
            <li> Figured I would give it a couple weeks, haven&#x27;t noticed any difference other than my headaches are not as bad as when I started using the product.</li>
            <li> Some of the concerns I&#x27;d read were that these products typically smell bad; this does not.</li>
            <li> I say buy it and go out often you&#x27;d be crazy and stupid not to, I see ugly guys with hot girls all the time fools!</li>
            <li> I read an article about this stuff, read tons of reviews, but I was still skeptical.</li>
            <li> After we ridiculed him for an hour or so, we agreed to try it ourselves to prove him wrong.</li>
            <li> ill probably fclose on her friday because i aint got time for her now</li>
            <li> ** fake, fake reviews.</li>
            <li> but even my friends girlfriend would find reasons to touch me and talk to me almost to the point where it made me uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Ordered wrong item.</li>
            <li> Buyer be wear , and when you do buy it, because you think this review must be wrong or fake..remember I told you so</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product is a placebo.</li>
            <li> I just received my bottle today and I am a bit skeptical now that I have it.</li>
            <li> i just recieved this product and it does make me feel realaxed being realy skeptical ive been wanting to try it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not get any chance to talk with anyone.</li>
            <li> I am a shy person</li>
            <li> I sprayed randomly and it didnt have any effect on my wife.  </li>
            <li> i was chilling with a friend at the bar having a drink and this girl looked at me and started talking like she knew me or something.</li>
            <li> However, on the times that it doesn&#x27;t always work, I have to express my theory that perhaps some girls are just too shy or don&#x27;t want to say anything--even if the pherx spray is working on them.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t turn woman on and the return guarantee is fake.</li>
            <li> Needless to say that she didn&#x27;t feel attracted at all.</li>
            <li> i am incredibly shy</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s not that expensive on amazon.......</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s weird</li>
            <li> Useless</li>
            <li> well, I&#x27;m not going to fix what ain&#x27;t broken!  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re too shy to talk to women, this is NOT going to help</li>
            <li> Using this product, as others have said, will not get women to shed clothing at your mere approach.</li>
            <li> If for some reason something would change, Ill change my review to suit the changes</li>
            <li> but i did notice a crazy weird effect.</li>
            <li> GOT TOLD I SMELLED BAD, NOT GOOD!</li>
            <li> it drives her crazy.</li>
            <li> a cold with this junk, going to get a puppy that always works.</li>
            <li> and I gotta admit my girlfriend went crazy.</li>
            <li> i used it once and felt all day like i had dirty cloth on.</li>
            <li> Mad swag</li>
            <li> I am a very skeptical person.</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very mediocre man, but with alot of confidence to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ; by Amazon so returning it is basically impossible.</li>
            <li> This product would have been 1 star except the fragrance isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> well it did give me some bad smell which everyone noticed.</li>
            <li> It smells so bad, smell like horse urine.</li>
            <li> a bad to thing bump up my confidence.</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s just a bad copy of a product that does work.</li>
            <li> Too bad money shot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really bad :</li>
            <li> It does not work, whenever you r feeling bad or seek.</li>
            <li> The smell is not too bad</li>
            <li> The plastic nozzle leaks, too bad.</li>
            <li> and nobody has said it smells bad.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at..</li>
            <li> People are either lying or we received a bad bottle.  </li>
            <li> I was also disappointed in the spray bottle that came containing the Pheromone Cologne in terms of size and the pump spray it produced.</li>
            <li> Still I am disappointed because I did not get out of it what I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
            <li> Otherwise you&#x27;ll be disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> the oil base or this base.</li>
            <li> Horse crap.  </li>
            <li> this crap is for you.</li>
            <li> Label me an idiot.  </li>
            <li> Therefore it makes sense that the base of this product is something inert: water and alcohol.</li>
            <li> hated the smell.it might work for someone else</li>
            <li> Maybe use as mosquito repellent?</li>
            <li> You will be very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was insane.</li>
            <li> But when sprayed it on on of my friends as a prank she said it smelled disgusting like men sweat and body odor.</li>
            <li> THIS CRAP!!</li>
            <li> It was insane.</li>
            <li> Smells horribly.</li>
            <li> and she told me to throw it away cuz it was awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The company gave this to me as a thank you and Its been working. Ive noticed women are talking to me more and more</li>
            <li> Did not do as they claimed. I used the cologne several times  and there was no different reaction from women. Just more snake oil to get your money.</li>
            <li> If I can make any criticism about this product, it is that it can be a little annoying to have to negotiate flirtation with multiple girls at once, and almost every time I have used this product it has led to that. Girls begin to get much closer, much more touchy-feely, much more flirtatious and I begin to feel like the truly desired object in the room. Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says.It really is a conversation starter.Wife has been more touchy since my purchase.Yes I have already recommended this to a friend who has a shy side as far as conversation with women.Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to evaluate this product accurately, but I find the scent to be pleasant and not overpowering, and women do seem to be more interested in sexual activity IF THEY ARE ALREADY INCLINED TO BE IN THAT MOOD.  I didn&#x27;t see an effect in everyday interactions but seemed to notice one when I was already on a date or in a setting where you are looking for a sexual partner... women do seem to see me more and say a couple extra sentences while I am wearing this.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a definite &amp;#34;ice breaker&amp;#34; effect, especially with women who had previously been aloof. As long as your expectations are realistic and not ridiculous, I would recommend trying this.</li>
            <li> I was familier with Pheromone science long before I ran into this product, however I had never tried any. First impression is whether or not it has pheromones in it, it does smell good and would stand alone as a colonge. I was getting a lot of looks and friendly smiles when I first went out with it. When I first wore it I did feel a bit more confident because of it, so its hard to say at this point if the extra attention is from the smells, or the extra confidence on my part. More research is needed :)</li>
            <li> When ever I use this stuff and go out, or party with some friends. I catch girls looking at me. Or coming and talking to me more. Its not a sure thing to get you laid but it gets you in the door. Works good. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased both the oil and spray.  I found the spray cologne to smell alright (floral) but my wife didn&#x27;t like the smell at all.  I didn&#x27;t even mention I had purchased a new cologne she just called me out and said she didn&#x27;t want me to wear it ever again.  I don&#x27;t agree with her take on the scent but if she&#x27;s this turned off I doubt it will work well with other ladies.  I noticed the oil seemed to have a stronger affect around others and I read it lasts longer which is also a plus.  After the first time I&#x27;ve tried pushing the sprayer down only 1/2 way or less if possible although this isn&#x27;t easy to do.  I wish the sprayer didn&#x27;t shoot as much out so you could apply less and use multiple sprays if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately I have been using the spray on my legs and the oil up top, i&#x27;ve found decent results although I have no way of knowing which is doing what..</li>
            <li> Smells nice. Dunno if it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying pheromones for the last 4 month&#x27;s this product is the best one that has worked for me at first I noticed the difference at my job not only just with females but also with males. Attracted women and created trust with my male co workers</li>
            <li> well the product is good I feel more popular with women than before. The attraction is better when use this product of the pheromone.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work but I figured I had nothing to lose by giving it a try. The first day I didn&#x27;t see much just a little added confidence and people seemed to want to talk to me more. The next few days I noticed a lot more females staring and when I would start a conversation they seemed more inclined to want to keep talking to me. I have no problem talking to girls and getting numbers but this just makes it a lot smoother. Girls become more interested when wearing this, definitely going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I read an article about this stuff, read tons of reviews, but I was still skeptical. I decided to bite the bullet and just went ahead and ordered it. I sprayed some onto my wrists and rubbed it into my neck and went to work. By the time I got there it&#x27;d been at least 30-45 minutes (morning traffic sucks) and I still smelled it. I walked into work and turned heads, usually all I say is hello and keep walking, this time around they said hello, and kept the conversation alive. I&#x27;m not saying this is some magical \\&quot;get any girl\\&quot; cologne, but it&#x27;s pretty damn close as I believe it worked. Definitely going to be buying this stuff by the gallon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pherx for two days now and have had woman at work and from the bar being extra nice to me and wanting to talk longer than usual.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff, really gets me going lol!  I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s slightly more potent in the oil version, but the spray bottle is arguably more convenient.  Either way, it&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Great aroma&lt;br /&gt;Great results</li>
            <li> This is my first reveiw im making out of 5 products on amazon,&lt;br /&gt;I seen this product with 270 good reviews so I said it should be good so I purchased it, I tried it on wrist and the smell was fine, but only if you had your nose right up to it, up to a half hour I could barely smell it that&#x27;s when I had my doubt&lt;br /&gt;so i but it to the test me and two friends we put it on  when we went night clubbing&lt;br /&gt;We put it on our wrest and our neck and behind our ears and not one girl tured there head or nobody said any thing to us&lt;br /&gt;Me and my friends said if you pured the bottle all over you it still would make no difference&lt;br /&gt;Dont fool yourself to believe you can get this product to help you pull women and do better than a good after shave&lt;br /&gt;I got done 30 dollars, the product is a scam, buy it if you want but you were warned.</li>
            <li> I have noticed small changes in women that im around everyday, so im changing dosage alittle. I&#x27;ll give it another week or two. will update shortly.</li>
            <li> I have recently received this product and was astounded even after the first few uses. I definitely have noticed a lot more attention in my direction. Happy hunting!</li>
            <li> Product had a nice smell to it.  Don&#x27;t know if the chemicals are effective.  For the scent alone, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Much easy to apply than the oil and works a lot better.</li>
            <li> I do not think this stuff attract anyone to me. It may attract me to others. Thank God I have not committed any foul.</li>
            <li> Honestly if this stuff worked they wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep it in stock.  So what they do is make bogus reviews themselves and try to get people hyped up on something that doesn&#x27;t work and will never work!  People are not like dogs and cats, smell is not as stong in humans.    I will say a big, fat wallet will go a lot further in attracting women that this stuff ever will.  You would be better off using water, saving the $30, and at the very least water will quench your thirst unlike this snake oil!</li>
            <li> The package just arrived today, it smells soooo good! Very Masculine smell. I do notice some attraction from the ladies! NOT A LIE, I get more attention! its better than no attention at all. True product. The only downside is that the smell does not last that long. I recommend spraying on your neck, wrist(skin area), don&#x27;t put too much or else it would drive females away..don&#x27;t mix it with other colognes too. I just wished the smell would last longer...GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> When I received it I opened it up and sprayed it on it has a nice fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> Has not worked yet. Need more time to try it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference but its not as affective as it claims....</li>
            <li> Put some liquid in a bottle, and sell it for $15. Call it a magic formula where in reality is it nothing but a $15 scam. I tried it several times around women, and saw absolutely no attention. My Burberry, Armani, Versace, and other colognes receive far more attention than this piece of crap. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Tried and getting results!</li>
            <li> I can agree with most of the five star reviews. Like reasonable reviewers have stated, this will not have women fight over you but it does make people seem to feel more relaxed when it is worn. I have only used it a handful of times but I have found that my female supervisor has become less cold towards me and has invited me out with her and colleagues drinking. At my other job, a female coworker said she had a friend that she wanted me to meet. Having hung around my female friends, they have been more touchy and have commented that I smell good. I have only been using it for a week and have not gone out yet to a bar or date but I have high expectations. Definitely worth the money even if it&#x27;s all in your head and you have confidence.</li>
            <li> I am a very skeptical person. Having said that, I went into this experiment with huge doubts. However, I am forced to admit after trying it myself, pheromones work. At least the PherX brand works. I was hanging out with a group of my friends last month and one of them was talking about this spray he found on the internet. He said he swore it helped him get attention from girls like nothing else. When he told us that it was bottled pheromone we laughed at him for like an hour. He still insisted that he was totally positive it made a difference. After we ridiculed him for an hour or so, we agreed to try it ourselves to prove him wrong. There was a party the next night so we agreed to try it out then. When I say it was like we were the only dudes at the party, I mean it. I have never been approached by so many girls in one night. It was insane. I got 8 numbers, a good night for me is 3 at the most and that&#x27;s a really good night. Between the 3 of us we got close 15 at this party, this was not a huge party either. Needless to say I got home and ordered my own bottle! I am literally waiting by the door. I cannot believe how much of a difference this made. Try it! You will not regret it, best 30 bucks I have ever spent!</li>
            <li> I first tried the oil which I really like a lot , but it did not have a sprayer. This has basically the same fragrance and seems to intensify from sweat, rather than fade away. It has a very good effect with the ladies as well !!</li>
            <li> Pherx is great!!! I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Looked at other products (without buying) and then bought PherX Pheromone after watching the clip provided. Used it for approx. 30 days and was not expecting anything significant in how people would react, but did not see &#x27;any&#x27; change in their mannerisms around me.  Neither negative nor positive.  I&#x27;ve worked with people my whole life and did not vary my discussions, approach, or conversations towards the women I was with or around at the time. Tested it in restaurants, church, shopping, in the car, and basically in many public / private places.    Was curious after reading a couple of articles and believe there is science to support it, but for me the PherX did not supply results. I was also disappointed in the spray bottle that came containing the Pheromone Cologne in terms of size and the pump spray it produced. It has an okay fragrance. The product may provide different results for other people, but for me it was not a good investment.</li>
            <li> Okay, as for the smell.. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything so you don&#x27;t need to worry about being caught. As for the effect... Here&#x27;s the tricky part: It works, it does work... However, while giving you confidence on the day you&#x27;re wearing it, your confidence in the day you&#x27;re not will drop to-9000 so my only advice is considering this before you buy it :)</li>
            <li> PherX Pheromone Cologne for Men  has boosted my confidence. Women are more receptive some even compliment me on how good I look. N/B I am an average looking guy.</li>
            <li> Product attracts women. What its supposed to do. Not a closer. Thats your job, so dont expect a big increase in your sex life if you are awkward around women</li>
            <li> This stuff really wooorks. I have tested only a couple of times and everytime I noticed a higher level of attention by the other girls. I believe it works more when going out or having a conversation with one girl. Inside the club I must say I didn&#x27;t notice any special reaction but oustide yes, a girl even asked me if I was wearing a particular perfume (that I&#x27;ve never used in my life)&lt;br /&gt;Great product, recommended</li>
            <li> From the day I began using PherX, I noticed that women were friendlier to me than usual. Those that I&#x27;ve known for a while tell me that I suddenly seem happier. Others that I&#x27;ve never spoken to before are now engaging me in conversation. In fact, a lot of women I meet seem to be more chatty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PherX Pheromone Cologne helps you to be more noticed by the opposite sex. A smile and polite conversation does the rest. I will say that it smells more like alcohol than I would have hoped, but I simply simply combine it with another cologne. Other than this, I&#x27;m really happy with PherX and intend to keep using it for a while.</li>
            <li> I have tried wearing it for work and to the bars but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any results yet. One thing though is I had a lady compliment me on my cologne and I know I had worn it around her before so I guess there is still some hope lol.</li>
            <li> Got to get you some... It is that extra little advantage that will give you the edge and confidence you need. Good buy! Great price!</li>
            <li> After using this product for a week, and being around many beautiful women where I work I have not yet seen any results. The jury is still out.</li>
            <li> This product seems to do what it advertises to do.</li>
            <li> Ok as others I had my doubts. The product definatly gives you an edge with the ladies when you wear it. Just one spray in my neck area  which I rubbed my wrist on too) and poof the party was on. The scent on this is fine. Smells like a pleasant cologne and its fine as is.</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first but many good reviews so decided on the purchase.  I decided to spray a few spritz on neck and wrists just before going to work. A cute courtesy associate whom I&#x27;ve always greeted and only received a \\&quot;Hello\\&quot; in return, actually greeted me first and then proceeded to ask how my day was this far, crack a few flirtatious jokes to me and some smiles. It could have been pure coincidence so I&#x27;m looking forward to some more trials. But looks positive so far!</li>
            <li> I was a big skeptic of the whole pheromone thing but I can honestly say it this product does attract women, they don&#x27;t come running to you like a pack of wolves but what I noticed when in the grocery store all the females were more talkative, they looked at me and were very flirty. I will be buying again and it does smell good also, hope this helps...</li>
            <li> Initially I was under the impression that it didn&#x27;t work and I just wasted my money. Sure enough however girls were complementing me on how I smelled and even got a couple numbers. After that I was sold. This isn&#x27;t going to get girls jumping all over you, but in the real world every little bit counts!</li>
            <li> I received it after 2 days from ordering. I would describe the scent to be a bit like a hand sanitizer (but in a good way). you do have to keep in mind with any pheromone cologne the scent will adapt to your own body heat (aka pulse points) so once applied it will not smell the same for two different people, so it will be unique to your own chemistry. Now for a quick disclaimer, the cologne will attract women but you have to give them a reason to stay, so focus on becoming confident (if you aren&#x27;t already) also do groom yourself and put on clothes that shows a more professional you. what I mean by that is a tailored suit (though it might be out of your price range to afford any suit tailored) do give it a try because women respond nicely to a man who looks empowered.</li>
            <li> I had to write a review on these pheremones. Ever since I have used them about 4 months ago, my game has increased 100 fold. I have so many dates now that I can&#x27;t even keep up! Women touch my face and body much more when I&#x27;m wearing them. I even had a few friends try them out and they noticed the same thing. I have made these and a few others a regular part of my arsenol! I do not work for the company or anything and I am a real person with outstanding results!</li>
            <li> shipping of this product was fast and discreet, and i recieved it a day before the estimated shipping time.&lt;br /&gt;i ordered this product as an impulse buy with low expectations and was not expecting much from it.&lt;br /&gt;the day after i recieved the product i decided to try it out, i was going to a party at my buddys house and rode the busthere.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing i noticed was when i was riding the bus 2 beautiful girls got on the bus and sat right next to me when there were plenty of open seats. the whole side of the bus that i was sitting on was open with 7 or 8 seats and instead of sitting a couple seats over theysat in the seat directly next to me and started talking to me and i ended up getting one of their numbers. the next thing that made me sure this product worked was first thing i did when i walked into the party was introduced myself to all of the girls and hugged them to make sure they smelled it, for the rest of the night wherever i went i constantly had atleast one girl trying to talk to me and ended up gettin laid by the end of the night.&lt;br /&gt;i am happy with this product and was surprised that it actually worked.&lt;br /&gt;it will have alot more females approaching you but it is still up to you to seal the deal</li>
            <li> I have been on several dates since I received this product, and I can&#x27;t say anything negative nor positive about it. The cologne doesn&#x27;t really have much of an odor, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any response from women different from when I&#x27;m not wearing it. I read in another review it works with some women, and others it doesn&#x27;t. Perhaps I just picked the ones it didn&#x27;t work with. I can&#x27;t say anything negative about this product either. If you want to give it a try I honestly don&#x27;t see the harm in it for the price.</li>
            <li> it has no effect from when i am wearing it to when i am not. i am a bartender so was curious to see if people would act differently when ordering and it has made no difference in this enviornment</li>
            <li> I got a number from a girl. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the added confidence that did it or if the cologne helped, but I never got one from a complete stranger before the cologne.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nothing more than a bit of an edge when someone is interested to you. A little bit on the pulse thin skin areas such as wrists, inside elbows and neck just under the ears. A bit nothing more. Then just a touch of quality cologne in the same areas. I find that for me, Gucci Envy is a nice combination. If you can smell anything on yourself 10 minutes after putting it on you over did it. Envy is not cheap, but the low end of higher quality. The pheromone just seems to reinforce a cologne. High end colognes both men&#x27;s and woman&#x27;s contain pheromone as a propitiatory ingredient, and both work the same way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scents do work, but it is up to you to attract someone receptive close enough to be exposed to it. If a woman is not receptive to you nothing will help. But if she is undecided, it at times will make the difference. Again, not to much. I have found that if interested, the woman will come in closer out of curiosity. It is nothing more than a slight stimulant to the unthinking primal part of consciousness. Attraction to the scent wears off quickly as the sense of smell becomes desensitized, just like any other smell. At that point it is all you, your behavior, personality, just be yourself. Like the cologne, don&#x27;t over do it.</li>
            <li> PherX is a great product that really works. I put some on and noticed a difference right away! Girls looked at me in a flirty way and looked really relaxed when around me. I also notice that girls become a lot more open and chatty... but its up to you to seal the deal.</li>
            <li> I love it works great and smells well.and my girlfriend loves the way it smells on me it drives her crazy.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, I had a lot of fun with it  it worked so loll on my girl! Strongly recommended!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the power of science and great stuff. I cannot wait to buy it more</li>
            <li> I tried my Pherx on a couple of my lady friends and things went quite well. We had a good time. Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> For those men who have trouble talking to women, this is a must buy as it will change your life for the best!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this!  The only thing it did was give me a headache!  Figured I would give it a couple weeks, haven&#x27;t noticed any difference other than my headaches are not as bad as when I started using the product.</li>
            <li> PherX doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant, but Zyloo should really cut down the size of the bottle and reduce the amount of alcohol used as a carrier. Keep in mind, pheromone products aren&#x27;t like what the Axe commercials show, but it&#x27;s always nice to get dose in within 2-3 sprays. As opposed to 7-8. And Zyloo, for gods sake give us a little more information on your ingredients!  I don&#x27;t want your *Top Secret* formulary, just which pheromones I&#x27;m saturating myself with. Compared to a multitude of other products on the market, you can definitely do a helluva lot worse for a substantially higher dollar amount. I on the other hand, will not be buying PherX again.  Thanks but no thanks Zyloo. ( Side Note: Oil Based Pheromones do last longer, and overall tend to settle better. Even though I&#x27;m not willing to spend the $60 on Zyloo&#x27;s PherX Oil, doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a quality product/ will work for you[[ASIN:B004SO2SVI PherX Pheromone Oil for Men (Attract Women) - The Science of Attraction - 20mg of Human Pheromones]] It is odd though that the difference is only 2 mg between the two..just saying)</li>
            <li> To say the least. I was VERY skeptical.  My G/F NEVER used to say anything about my cologne previously.  The 2-3 times I have seen her in the past couple of weeks, she has commented how good I smell and it seems to get her motor going a bit.  Normally she is very shy and reserved (always has been), but add this in the mix and she seems to be a little more interested.  Not saying this is a cure all, but in our case the relationship was lacking a bit of something and this seems to make her a bit more interested in &amp;#34;us&amp;#34; now days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally I take a shower every time before she arrives whether I need it or not.  Now realizing that by doing this, you wash away your own natural pheromones.  Not saying you have to stink, but this can be a replacement for those that shower more than once a day and want to get their woman interested.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for a couple of weeks now. I&#x27;m not sure the product works as most of us expect it to work, however I can definitely say that it does make feel cnfident . For the price I think is worth giving it a try, plus the fact that you feel confident helps more than anything else.</li>
            <li> I didnt notice any change in response from my wife or anyone else for that matter. Has a light scent that is pleasant but I would rather invest in a quality cologne.</li>
            <li> This product would have been 1 star except the fragrance isn&#x27;t bad so I use it just as a perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems and why to NOT buy this:&lt;br /&gt;If this was free, I&#x27;d use it just for the scent but trust me when I say it does NOT work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duration:  Fades within 3-4 hours&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Pleasant enough if it was a standalone fragrance but the fact that it IS scented means you can&#x27;t pour this into your usual fragrance but have to use it by itself.&lt;br /&gt;Potency: Not as effective as advertising would have you think.  You have to be close range for effects - hugging distance and alone.  Woman would not be able to discern source if you&#x27;re with a group.  If she isn&#x27;t receptive or into you, this won&#x27;t help.  It&#x27;s not the magical bullet you think.&lt;br /&gt;Telling you how it is so you don&#x27;t waste your $30+ on this tiny pinky sized bottle.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years. Now I&#x27;m no brad Pitt but I do all right. The reason I keep reordering this item is because more than any other cologne I use, women actually tell me I smell wonderful! It&#x27;s as simple as that.</li>
            <li> first of all it takes an alpha male attitude and body language to attract... thats not all it takes but those are the main things. BUT this cologne smells great. one of the girls i work with told me a good smelling guy is a big turn on and i smelled great. ill probably fclose on her friday because i aint got time for her now but i can see where this cologne will be my best wing man</li>
            <li> I have always been intrigued by the idea of pheromones, and I decided to opt for this one becasue it was reasonably priced and generally had good reviews.  I have a long time (2+ years) girlfriend, so I thought it would be a very good test situation.      In certain situations did she notice my scent a little more, maybe feel a bit of a more animal attraction? Yes....but was it anymore than if I was wearing the deoderant or cologne she really likes? Not really...    I think overall it is not a bad buy, considering many colognes cost over $50.  And I beleive the biggest boost this gives you is confidence, which all women find attractive.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty decent. Have only had the opportunity to try it out once or twice, although the times I tried it I was around a bunch of either lesbians or gay males, so I can&#x27;t yet vouch for the strength of the product.</li>
            <li> It smells great haven&#x27;t seen much female attention no I don&#x27;t know what the trick is with this stuff I&#x27;m hoping it works sooner than later</li>
            <li> Four stars cause this product may actually work. Thing is I did ok with it. Wasn&#x27;t approached by too many woman; but wasn&#x27;t really turned away either... I&#x27;ll use more too see better results</li>
            <li> The seller offered me a free sample to test out, so I said sure.  I have no complaints about this product, but nothing glowing to say about it, either.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in effect between this and my regular cologne.  However, it smells good, and that alone might be enough if you don&#x27;t have any regular cologne handy.  The smell is subtle but nice.  And perhaps there will be a placebo effect for some people that will give them more confidence and, in turn, make them more attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this is only my experience, and only over the past couple of weeks.  The plural of anecdote is not data.  Caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> this pheremone is a lilttle stinky im trying to use it around my female friends , i &#x27;ll see the results and i&#x27;ll be back to let u people know if is good or not</li>
            <li> This product is a pure scam, it doesn&#x27;t do what it is suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;There were absolutely no change in behaviour by any one after wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your money. I am suprized the amazon allows this to be sold on thie website.</li>
            <li> The cologne smells good and seems to give me an extra edge.  Even if it&#x27;s psychological, the smell blends nicely with other colognes.</li>
            <li> This product came in about Tuesday of this week, so far i&#x27;ve had nothing currently change in my social interactions ... i did notice a girl whom i&#x27;ve spoken to in the past at the gym act a lot more peppy when i spoke with her, im not sure if this was a coincidence or if it was this product but thus far i do admit that i enjoy the smell of this although its not a super strong scent but i&#x27;ll follow up with this email once atleast a month goes by to let you know how it is working</li>
            <li> I first found out about PherX on Youtube.  They have a detailed video there that shows some background information on pheromones.  I have a background in biology and chemistry and can honestly say that scientists do acknowledge the existence of chemical attractants called pheromones.  What I like about PherX is that instead of just wearing cologne, it is laced with these pheromones.  I have been wearing PherX to work the last few days and have noticed I receive a lot more attention from the ladies in my office.  I am very encouraged with the results so far.</li>
            <li> tried it out. If there was any noticable effect, it was that women seem more relaxed. This is great if you are trying to make friends. But if you are trying to avoid the friend-zone like the plague, this won&#x27;t help you. at all.    My recommendation: Dr. Amend&#x27;s pheromone advantage. similar price, much more effective.</li>
            <li> Fresh scent - not much results beyond that.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with a spray of Chikara and it has helped me pick up the ladies&lt;br /&gt;in droves. Test this in Walmart, Target, Malls, Starbucks and see how the heads start turning.&lt;br /&gt;Will boost your confidence!</li>
            <li> no it did not work as others did . nothing new well it did give me some bad smell which everyone noticed. would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff won&#x27;t have the women ALL over you, but I would have to say this stuff dose work to a degree. I combine this with my favorite cologne and head out. I would be curious with a more potent version, but yes I would buy again.</li>
            <li> My wife and I were watching movie at night and I wanted to experiment this thing so I put it on as instructed (directly on skin and not on clothes)without letting her know. Usually we sit at the end of sofa corner and watch, thus not touching and have some personal zone for movement. Once I put it on, she came close to me within half an hour and then we had to stop movie. Really good product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a few day&#x27;s i do not notice any difference. Not sure if i am doing the dosage correctly as there is no instructions on how much to use. I will use the bottle until its finished hopefully i get some results. Staying hopeful.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a few times and I have gotten nothing but positive results every time I use it. I love the smell and it lasts surprisingly long for those crazy nights out! I can&#x27;t tell you if it truly works, but it sure has given me confidence; maybe just because I smell so good.</li>
            <li> i was 100% satisfied with the product  Pher X Pheromones Cologne for men  to attract women  recived it on wed. used it on a friday night and sat. night went out on the town with friends  had strange women all over me and wanting me  i&#x27;am just an ave. guy not a super model  was very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Smell is normal ...accepted....effect unknown</li>
            <li> Has not worked for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn the product a few days at work now and I think I noticed getting attention from women a couple of times.</li>
            <li> I have gotten more flirts and smiles than any other product. Thank you. This also helped out with my confidence as if I glow in a room filled with women. I will and definitely recomend this product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I received above normal attention from women. They literally got closer than they had before. The rest was up to me&lt;br /&gt;Love this product</li>
            <li> I think it works.... still the price should be much lower to drive sales</li>
            <li> I had mixed reviews but it was a limited timeframe... My wife says it smell like I have bathed yet... a couple friends say it smells ok... but I am out of the country right now and dont need it.  I will try again when I am back there and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I bought the PherX Pheromone Cologne for Men and I am absolutely thrilled with it. I bought it to see if it would affect how my girlfriend acts around me, and quite literally within minutes of spraying it I could tell a difference in the way she would act towards me: a lot more flirty and touchy. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and overall I am thrilled. I definitely recommend using pheromone cologne, but if you do, make sure you buy it form PherX!</li>
            <li> It works like a charm with most women but not all women are the same so don&#x27;t expect attention from all ladys.&lt;br /&gt;, I will buy it again,thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 5 or 6 days ago. I tried it for the first time before work on friday morning. I couldn&#x27;t tell if my (female) co-workers were just being nice as usual or if they actually were affected by the pheromones. I only applied 2 sprays so maybe they just didn&#x27;t smell it. I will leave another review w/ 5 stars once I try it again and witness noticeable differences in the way they interact with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before with limited but positive results, so I ordered some more from Amazon and got it yesterday and put some on when I went out to play trivia at the local pub. I am 46, but I&#x27;m well-known there by the younger waitresses who are mostly college students and am friends with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the waitresses who is a good friend only was standing near me and started playing with her hair while talking to me, a sure sign she&#x27;s attracted. We&#x27;ve only been friends before. When another waitress came up to speak to her, she actually started leaning into me and making hip-to-hip, leg-to-leg, and elbow-to-elbow contact with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d move my arm and she&#x27;d slide her&#x27;s over to continue touching!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not done yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As trivia was on-going, a 20 year old, pretty college girl sitting at the table behind me started standing at our table and outright flirting with me. When I went to the restroom, she was asking my friends about me. She outright wanted to go make out with me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has never happened to me in this place before and suddenly I put this stuff on and it happens? NOT a coincidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I graciouslly turned her down because I&#x27;m too old for her but thanked her for making me feel so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think PherX works on about half of the girls you wear it around, and I really believe this product works to a pretty good extent. It&#x27;s up to you to decide to buy it or not.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003H146PY PherX Pheromone Cologne for Men (Attract Women) - The Science of Attraction - 18mg Human Pheromones]]&lt;br /&gt;This product did not help attract any women for me. There was no noticeable difference in the reaction to the women that I approached while I used this product.</li>
            <li> After reading some review I decided to buy this. I only spray once and won&#x27;t be using it again. It smells so bad, smell like horse urine. It&#x27;s a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> If you are reading this then you are probably deciding whether or not it is worth taking a look into.  I can only tell you that it is worth that extra look.  It is a great smelling cologne that you can carry around discreetly and spray when you see the only you are attracted to.  DId a simple test by spraying this on the subway platform right before I boarded the train.  A few minutes later, I couldn&#x27;t help but be surrounded by a couple of beauties.  Managed to talk to one of them and get her number.  Look for a price of two cocktail drinks at a rooftop bar, you owe it to yourself to invest in yourself by trying it out.  Who knows, like Pharell said.. you might be lucky.</li>
            <li> Only good for giving false hope. I bought this to try to get my wife to be closer to me. It doesn&#x27;t work with her or any other woman as far as I can tell. The only good thing is it has a pleasant smell and can be worn as cologn so not a complete waste. Still I am disappointed because I did not get out of it what I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This product those not work do not buy it, you will waste your money.</li>
            <li> I got the product Friday Aug.16.  One spray is all I used . Women are from nowhere saying Hello more than before. On Saturday I was hangingout with five different women.  Three of us did happy hour and One of them stayed with me till  late night. Going on a date Today for sushi Aug.20.. from the girl I met Saturday. Im 49yrs and on a date with a 31 yrold..</li>
            <li> i use in it 2 day&#x27;s but it&#x27;s some thing different i don&#x27;t know whats happen&#x27;s but it&#x27;s give power you believ your self more and it&#x27;s give you a power i don&#x27;t know how lady&#x27;s act yet , but product have clean smell and last up to 6 hour my be don&#x27;t feel but it&#x27;s stay</li>
            <li> S**** fake, fake reviews. Don&#x27;t buy this s***. Scam p.o.s</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know what to except but after seeing it in action I AM A BELIEVER. Women who knew me before I started using it suddenly started showing a lot more interested. I&#x27;m happy with the results Im getting.</li>
            <li> Girls take a big notice all the sudden. It&#x27;s interesting that they all the sudden start flirting alot with you.</li>
            <li> i gave this rating because it works not the way i was expecting but definely help me with the girls actually 1 of the girls at work was smelling me and said that there was soothing on me that really like that i smelled like a baby lol.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve using this product everyday with the body wash i love the smell and i also wear gucci cologne with it</li>
            <li> It does work and girls do notice you more as long as you want looks but if you want more then that is up to you but do not expect it to do the work for you not a lot of girls look my way but this does help.</li>
            <li> at first, there was a glitch with the shipping. I think it was an overlook since I was supposed to get it friday, but other than that...PherX is a really good product. Guys you&#x27;ve just got to try it for yourselves if you&#x27;re a skeptic.</li>
            <li> I could not figure out a change in my power of attraction over women. But the scent is very nice so I use it. I will continue trying to find out if you really can work to attract women ...</li>
            <li> The reviews don&#x27;t lie. This stuff is amazing. My wife and I thought it would be fun to order it and see if it works. It comes in a small bottle but you really don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a cologne that not only would be pleasing to smell but also please others and I came across this product. Purchased this product and without a doubt it works wonders. My co-workers love the new scent that I carry and everyone asks what sort of cologne I use.&lt;br /&gt;This product really works well and I recommend it to all my co-workers and friends.&lt;br /&gt;Despite its high price, it&#x27;s honestly worth it and it will make you popular amongst your group of people and people left and right will be asking what it is.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth the price and wait (for shipping). I recommend to anyone who has ever wanted to go on a successful date!(:</li>
            <li> I tried it several times when I was with my girlfriend and there was no change is her mood or attraction toward me.</li>
            <li> This is not a magic spray that will let you get all the women, but I have noticed that it does help.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell of it, and have noticed women generally being more open to talking and I get more lasting glances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once, wearing it into the office, I asked my manager a question and she completely blanked on the first time I asked it, and she responded with &amp;#34;Sorry, your voice is too sexy, please repeat your question.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;She is usually very professional and I was very surprised by her comment as I have never heard her nor expected her to say anything like that.  I definitely think the scent had something to do with it, even though she wouldn&#x27;t do anything further than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, very satisfied with results from this product and highly recommend it &amp; definitely gives me a confidence boost, and I have noticed women treating me with more leniency.</li>
            <li> This little guy is as good as its Big brother the Oil Base!&lt;br /&gt;You can wear it as it is or mix it with any cologne and you will get attention. I&#x27;m not lying! Everyone should try it out!.&lt;br /&gt;Either the oil base or this base. Either one of them. You will not be denied. :D</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell of this cologne, and it wasn&#x27;t that expensive. I find the pheromone concentration a great confidence booster, so even if there is no discernible physiological effect on women, I still have that.</li>
            <li> I have worn the cologne for 3 days now.  So far so good.  It is very clean smelling and not too strong. I seem to have positive results.  People seem friendier when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Smell so good! I have not tested yet how effective there are attracting women but I&#x27;m pretty sure with the of scent this cologne smell women will be all over me!</li>
            <li> After using the oil and getting fantastic results, I was leery of how adding the fragrance would affect the outcome. I had nothing to worry about!&lt;br /&gt;It smells great applied to clean skin, and the results are equally great! Haven&#x27;t had this much attention in years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  just purchased my third bottle that should tell you something. This smells great and always getting compliments. I&#x27;ve hit some home runs. I&#x27;m single so any edge you can get helps and I would say it does. The women always ask what are you wearing that smells good even several hours after application</li>
            <li> This company and product suck ,they offer you a free bottle in exchange for a good review. But it&#x27;s a scam ,the product doesn&#x27;t work at all. I paid $32 at the time for the pheromone stuff to get some chicks ,but nothing. I would stay away from this seller and product. They just want to make some $ with your need.</li>
            <li> I tried this a few times and the product does not work. I would not recommend this to others. Snake oil.</li>
            <li> I think PherX is a good product. I&#x27;ve noticed not only women go out of their to talk to me, but also I seemed to get more respect from other employees (men). I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times and truly noticed a difference. Testing it out this weekend so will give another up date soon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, spend it on a book or something useful. I tried it and nothing happens even with my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> This product is very very amazing and it works great! And me and my girl friend love it she likes how it smells different every time :)</li>
            <li> I tried this product before in the past, and now that I&#x27;m single again, I decided to try it out once more. It definitely lived up to my memories of what it does. It has a different affect for women in different ages and ethnic backgrounds.. but the overall experience was that women seemed much more relaxed and causal with me; even when talking intimately. I only rated it 4 out of 5 stars because it is soo strong, that I had to wait an hour after applying it to go out because of how strong the scent is.</li>
            <li> so far no positive response may take longer,will see what happens in a few days,weeks as i go out more!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried it a couple of times and got extra attention from at least one female each time.  Need to try a few more times before writing a more comprehensive review.</li>
            <li> this PherX Pheromone Cologne for Men (Attract Women)has a unique smell which can attract women, it works well when you spray it on your neck, area behind the ear and wrist.&lt;br /&gt;buy it now and you will see the outcome.</li>
            <li> Women hold their gazes a little longer and want to extend thir conversations with you. They are more receptive to you.</li>
            <li> i never believed this would work, but it smells good and worth it to try at least one time.&lt;br /&gt;next time i would get bigger size.</li>
            <li> I bought the PherX Oil out of curiosity and was offered PherX Pheromone Cologne for trial.  I used as directed and tried it out in different situations, the first was dinner at a local steak house and I sat at the bar.  The waitress kept coming over to make sure everything was OK, asking me what I had planned for the weekend and generally spending more time with me than any of the other 10-12 guys at the bar.  I would say positive results.  The second situation was dinner, and you wouldn&#x27;t believe how talkative women were.  It was as if I was &amp;#34;the person&amp;#34; to talk with/to.  I would say positive results.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it works because of the pheromones, but it does actually have a pleasant scent to it.</li>
            <li> Since I started using the product, I have been approached on the street for things like directions or small talk. Even when I look like crap or I&#x27;m in a rush, girls will try and get a quick word in if we are stopped at a crosswalk. Not sure how much more potential this stuff has, but a little attention is always nice.</li>
            <li> Women come to you, and ask anything. I never felt so confident as when I used pherx.&lt;br /&gt;encourage everyone who can buy. strange smell is softer and leave you confident.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products.  I purchased this from another source, but it came in a sealed bottle.  The odor smells similar to sunscreen, so the smell is not too bad.  It is very powerfully scented however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a girl that I had been trying to get with for some time, and this stuff really did not help anything.  I made sure to wear it every time I was around her, but it did not do anything to help.  I lived with the girl for 1 month and wore this stuff every day.  She did not act any different.  I was finally &amp;#34;successful in my challenges&amp;#34; after about 1 1/2 months, but I do not give ANY credit to this stuff.  It seemed like she was attracted to me more when I didn&#x27;t wear it???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from this, I wore it every day in the Summer and pushed myself in public, no extra attention, nothing special.  I get more attention by wearing regular cologne.  I have also tried to wear it to class, it doesn&#x27;t seem to help anything or change behaviors.  This stuff is not magic in a bottle.  If you think it will make girls like you, then you will have the confidence to talk to them....but there is no scientific evidence that humans are attracted to one another through pheromones.  We are more intelligent than animals, so this stuff is not going to work, sorry to burst bubbles.  Buy some good cologne and take daily showers, it does wonders to your attractiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-A</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first purchased it. I thought maybe some of the positive reviews were people from PherX posing but I bought it and I noticed women were actually naturally coming towards me. I think it works best if you use it where women will be around you for long periods of time like work or school but even my friends girlfriend would find reasons to touch me and talk to me almost to the point where it made me uncomfortable. I think this product is legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pas, if you are already physically attractive this will definitely Enhance how women respond to you</li>
            <li> Received product and have been testing it out in public. When I am out, I can tell more woman want to be around me and that they seem more approachable.</li>
            <li> Still need to put in the work and take care of your appearance, but this helps to give the extra edge.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff, no offensive smell, solid science.</li>
            <li> It absolutely does not help to attract women at all. It is pure nonsense. A total waste of money and it smells like roach spray.</li>
            <li> Fast reaction and fast delivery. Thank you very much for such products. I am very happy with this purchase :) Thanks a lot. I am very glad.</li>
            <li> Smells good, that&#x27;s about it. Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference though. I think this product was a waste of my money...</li>
            <li> I love the way this spray smells, defenintly can get certain women&#x27;s attention. I spray it right on after getting cleaned up and stepping out for the night (works best that way). Depending on your bodies ph level, can smell a little different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far, but so far I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> Did not do much, so safe to say this was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. It isn&#x27;t a miracle oil. It helps you get noticed, and helps you me a better first impression. Every time I&#x27;ve worn this, I&#x27;ve had at least one girl come up to me in the bar (even if I&#x27;m sitting off by myself not talking to anyone). It&#x27;s up to me from there, but this gets the hard part out of the way.</li>
            <li> Girls became more engaged in trying to keep a conversation going. Usually they were just being nice and seemed like they had to talk to me. First bottle I have ever bought and will definitely buy another when my current one runs out.</li>
            <li> Very odd that I even bought this item. But I was curious, and I figure it wouldn&#x27;t be a bad to thing bump up my confidence. At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was gonna work, and I don&#x27;t notice anything except my girlfriend can&#x27;t keep her hands off of me. I&#x27;ll update in a few day and see if anything changes</li>
            <li> Had a lady approach me and calling me sexy and touching me in the mall ...amazing how ladies are noticing me more than without the majical cologne</li>
            <li> Still within my first 2 days of wearing it, so I hope to come back with more definite results. Smells good though, so don&#x27;t worry about that part at least!</li>
            <li> I received this as a trial from the company and tried it out and have to say it works very well. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne that the ladies will love! i purchased it and it smells really good. it has that musty smell that women love!</li>
            <li> This is a great item and smells great. If your are looking for something to draw attention this is it.</li>
            <li> when i first used it never thought that it is gonna work,but after putting it on i saw my female friends becoming more friendly and touchier. well,my ex-gf is jealous,but it works if you are finding for new girl, it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003H146PY PherX Pheromone Cologne for Men (Attract Women) - The Science of Attraction - 18mg Human Pheromones]]</li>
            <li> I have my doubts as to how to use it all as hard, but I&#x27;m seeing changes every day and I think it pays off to take a good look and behavior</li>
            <li> Smells great by itself or in combination with your other basic colognes. Plastic bottle is less likely to break than glass which is nice.</li>
            <li> I bought the product and the smell is good, and now each time, I talked with a woman, I feel more comfortable than I used to. thanks</li>
            <li> I want to thank you for producing such an amazing product, normally I&#x27;m a skeptic, but WOW this stuff really works as advertised</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for a week. I put it on before I go out to any kind of social gathering. A lot of women come up and tell me how good I smell. It by no means makes them fall head over heels for you, but it does seem to have women approach me more often. However the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last long. I had to reapply several times throughout the night to keep getting the interactions I was use to getting with this. Bottom line is it works, but doesn&#x27;t last very long. This is why I&#x27;m giving 4 stars and not 5.</li>
            <li> Well I am impressed. Along with the fact that I have been feeling better losing weight and eating better things have been different for me.  So I decided to throw this in to my grooming and self pampering. Let me tell you the amount of women who respond to me now has definitely seen an uptake in qaulity. No ones ripping my clothes but they want to be closer and are more flirty than ever.  Its not a miracle but it ain&#x27;t hurting either. Will order more.</li>
            <li> Pherx has a nice subtle smell, i can&#x27;t say for sure if the spray or a placebo is at work but people in general seem to be more open and friendly.  I tried the oil first, thinking it would last longer.  Perhaps I was just worried about &amp;#34;over doing it&amp;#34; with the oil, but the spray seems to last on the skin longer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me :( non of any phermone products work for me</li>
            <li> Alright. This is my second purchase of Pher-X. That&#x27;s right, a refill! I cannot confirm or deny the Science behind the formula but i (like many others) have done some observation. When applied, I found that women are more curious, more flirty, and more engaging. The tricky part of my little study is that I am more aware of women when wearing Pher-X and much more confident. Something interesting; it smells a little strange to me so I spray a little colonge with it. However, women don&#x27;t think it smells strange. It obvious triggers something much different in them. My study continues....</li>
            <li> Well, no one has even noticed I am wearing a new cologne. When you first spray it, it smells nice. Within minutes the scent disappears and then nothing....Maybe its a weak batch.</li>
            <li> Good product...seems to work. Barely has any smell, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> not much to say, no effect. with and without, there is nothing this prouct will do for you. not sure if it&#x27;s ineffective or it&#x27;s just a bad copy of a product that does work.</li>
            <li> This spray is absolutely great! After I started using it I have been noticing more females smiling at me. Sometimes, they are the first to initiate a conversation with me. Men seem more respectable and easy going in my company. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to boost their self esteem and be more successful in social situations.</li>
            <li> Did not see any change at all</li>
            <li> The girls do not swarm at u like world war Z or an ax commercial, but i have been a lot more smiles from some of the most expected females. Young, old, cute n not so cute. its def. worth trying</li>
            <li> Just received my Pherx Cologne and started using it a day or so ago but have not notice a thing !!! No special reaction from the ladies ....maybe I need to wear it longer or pour it on and let it soak me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting reaction to the opposite sex which is dope and I will continue using.</li>
            <li> Smells good .But But all this pheromone stuff is just hipe.If you like to smell good it is worth it.But dont know about attraction stuff.</li>
            <li> This product really works....this is my 5th reorder..::I am dating women half my age....and I know it works for sure....I did two controlled studies....girls go wild</li>
            <li> First of all I must inform that in Zyloo Laboratories they are responsible and very attentive people, with regard to the product at first its results are confusing , then I realized that they depend on many factors, as  are the mixtures with other smells of the surrounding environment, once I walking on one street where was flowing a very strong smell is countered the smell of the product, another factor is the receiving person, it is preferable use near since smell does not have much scope, also they influence the conditions of the receiving person, its frame of mind, its olfactory conditions if it has flu it does not work. At first I used it only but then combined it with my habitual perfume as to give a touch to this one that is stronger and of major scope. I recommend it in closed places, in my long-term opinion it seems that if it has certain effect. I would like proving something more concentrated on a future. A disadvantage is that the presentations of 30 ml is too low to use in adequate amounts.</li>
            <li> I got this from Zyloo Lab here in Amazon. I think it works. Try it out for yourself and see if it will work for you.</li>
            <li> This product really works, i used the product yesterday at gym and felt the difference immediately. girls started staring at me</li>
            <li> I normally do not find it easy to initiate conversation with women. However, this helps put my &amp;#34;foot in the door&amp;#34; so to speak. The women I speak to are more receptive to my conversation. Also, I have found that they spend more time in my personal space, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> I tested this a few times when go outside and notice a difference in the way woman approach me (they are more receptive).</li>
            <li> priced right...smells good...(according to others)...and arrived very quickly. I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend  it to others....</li>
            <li> Increased interest from my wife. The product works as advertised. The price is reasonable compared to other similar items. I</li>
            <li> This product has a pleasant mellow and fresh smell that is not too strong and is wearable around an office or during the day.  This cologne seems to make both men and women friendly and more uninhibited almost like there is something you have that they really, really want hehe.  For 30 dollars i would recommend purchasing a bottle or two and rotate them them in with your other cologne&#x27;s or just use this daily.</li>
            <li> I give the pleasant fragrance 4 stars but have noticed no changes in the expressed sexual interest of women.</li>
            <li> Smelly and does not work. I&#x27;ve talked to several friends and tried the product and instead of attracting, and fleeing away from me for how bad it smells. Also tell me which has no effect. Too bad money shot.</li>
            <li> My wife seems to really like it and respond to it. I highly recommend it. Great product. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> this does not work.i tried it on several dates and they all thought it smelled like the ocean.it didn&#x27;t attract any women at all.a couple of women hated the smell.it might work for someone else but it didn&#x27;t work for me.now if it smelled like money,you know it would work.</li>
            <li> In my experience this works. I&#x27;ve tried Realm (a different pheromone cologne, about $70 for 1.7oz back in the day) twice before with zero noticeable effect, whereas PherX has produced some definite- and interesting- results, not all of them necessarily welcome (ever been &amp;#34;huffed&amp;#34; by a teenager? It&#x27;s a little awkward). I&#x27;ve been using PherX on and off for over two years now, and I&#x27;ve experimented with it enough that I can say with confidence that it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this to see what effect it might have on my wife... it definitely makes her more frisky (and no, I haven&#x27;t told her about it), but funnily enough she also doesn&#x27;t like the PherX scent. I use another cologne on top of it (Farenheit, her favorite- and yes, her reaction is different than if I use Farenheit alone) to help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the mixed reviews... scent is one of the most subjective things out there. Any given cologne is going to smell differently on various people, and be received differently depending on the smeller&#x27;s preferences. Pheromones may work similarly- PherX may work great for me but not so much for another, and the effect seems to vary a little depending on who&#x27;s doing the smelling. Is it worth it to try it out? Without a doubt, yes. Keep in mind though, this stuff isn&#x27;t a miracle brain-override. If you&#x27;re a jerk or haven&#x27;t showered in a week, don&#x27;t expect pheromones (or anything else, really) to override that. In my experience this stuff simply makes others view you more favorably (and if they already like you, it seems to intensify that)... sometimes, though, that&#x27;s all it takes to move things from &amp;#34;friendly&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;interested&amp;#34;. Point is, your mileage can and will vary, but in my opinion it&#x27;s worth seeing what that mileage will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also say that younger people seem to respond more strongly to it (or maybe they&#x27;re simply more impulsive and less reserved with their reactions?). I&#x27;m 40 and happily married so that&#x27;s not really a plus for me, but for the younger guys out there it may be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last tip: DON&#x27;T spray this on your shirt or clothes. This or any other cologne, really. You want to target your the center of your bare chest, your wrists and the sides of your neck. One or two sprays on the chest, one on the wrists and rub together, then apply the excess cologne from your wrists onto the sides of your neck. Apply a little while before you go out to let it &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; and dissipate somewhat.</li>
            <li> the pheromone cologne had a great  smell , however it did not provide droves of women as described , guess I was to old for the proper effect..........</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good.  I mixed it with the cologne I have now. But just by smelling it I can tell girls will be turned on by the smell. I haven&#x27;t really tried it fully yet but I think its definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if female customers tip and/or flirt more... I will definitely say the latter. I never had problems attracting women but I find that when I wear this product,  more women are around me and definitely more &amp;#34;touchy-feely&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it does much but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try. I think many just have placebo effect but that my opinion.</li>
            <li> Ordered wrong item. It shows that it has the same ingredients as the one for women, but I am not sure.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband after trying and loving the pherx to attract men.  This has a great mild smell and seems to give my husband a confidence boots all day.</li>
            <li> This was absolutely the stupidest purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.  My common sense told me that this s*** was \\&quot;snake oil\\&quot;, but I REALLY WANTED it to work.  I tried to do the best &#x27;research&#x27; about this on Google, and thanks to mixed reviews, I thought \\&quot;well some say it worked for them\\&quot;.  Of course I bought this, and of course, I wasted a perfectly good 30 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, check out some of my other reviews on other products.  Since I rely heavily on what others say, then I feel that I have a duty to contribute by giving an honest opinion.  If the product works, I&#x27;ll be positive.  But, if I got ripped off, you bet I trash it.  Some blogger said that the company was giving out gift cards if the buyer wrote a positive review.  Horse crap.  If anyone here does that, all you did was commit a real sin towards others for a lousy 10 dollars for a company who scammed you and those who bought because of your review.  If you are that cheap for 10 bucks, I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t know you.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about a week so far.  Has a slight cologne smell which is OK.  No one has commented directly on me using it, but when I went to the dentist yesterday the dental assistant sure was a lot more talkative to me than she usually is.  And when the dentist was drilling to do a filling she put her hand on my shoulder.  Not sure if there&#x27;s any correlation, but wearing this product will certainly give you more confidence!</li>
            <li> Some of the concerns I&#x27;d read were that these products typically smell bad; this does not. It smells like cologne with a mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Pheromones&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t going to magically change human nature. If you&#x27;re a man, and you want to meet women, you&#x27;re still going to need to do the approach. You still need confidence. You need game. This will help, but it&#x27;s not going to make her drop her panties. Pheromones will give you an edge; she&#x27;ll smile at you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this, and the one woman I pulled in for a quick goodbye hug stopped with a visible desire to keep the conversation going longer than she&#x27;d intended just a few seconds prior. So when she was close enough to smell me, she wanted to prolong her face-time with me. And that&#x27;s enough... if you&#x27;ve got game. Use this to increase your odds, but know that you still need to do your approach.</li>
            <li> Okay first off the oil is a much better product than this spray cologne. I do not like the scent of this at all. Not good at attracting anything at all. I sprayed a small dose, medium even extra strength .Nothing . with the oil yes a few glances here and there but the scent fades away like my hope to even nuzzle on a chick. Stay far from this one. A 2 outta 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NB: I mean what i say .....stay far from this one.</li>
            <li> the verdict is still out, I will have to update this review in the future when the bottle is depleted.</li>
            <li> just a joke this product is garbage, could&#x27;nt attract  a cold with this junk, going to get a puppy that always works.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product after researching about Pheromones online and I must say I was surprised when this product arrived very quickly via shipping, and by the fact that it ACTUALLY works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is FANTASTIC and my GIRLFRIEND loves it! It&#x27;s a very masculine scent and very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would order again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since the day i received it and i have not had and/or noticed any more attention then when before ever using the product. I did read a lot of different post from a lot of different website, both good and bad, I still ordered the product anyway. I will continue using it since i purchased it and try another group of women and will see what happens from there.</li>
            <li> I notice alot more looks and smiles when I wear it, if it&#x27;s a placebo ( which it&#x27;s not) at least it boosts confidence. I really enjoyed the product, I use it everyday with my cologne, price is somewhat steep but I would consider buying again or trying another one of their products. GOOD PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I wonder if this is just very lightly scented water in a bottle-&lt;br /&gt;Pheroguide.com has a very good page of reviews if you want to do some research. These colognes are pretty expensive, so you want to do research instead of buying everything in sight.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; colognes, and very very few of them mix with my body chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far, my favorite is pheroforce. It is also cheaper than a lot of the so called &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; pheromone colognes and reportedly has the highest concentration of pheromones of any product (38MG)- and no, I don&#x27;t get paid for saying this nor am I an employee of pheroforce- I&#x27;m just trying to help other guys who are looking for a decent pheromone cologne at a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;Max Attraction Gold is also pretty good. But, don&#x27;t be misled by thinking women will swarm you when wearing any pheromone product- you still have to project confidence and have a decent appearance.</li>
            <li> excellent product, but does not last long and sometimes does not work as it should recommend . . . .</li>
            <li> This product smells like women&#x27;s perfume, that&#x27;s why it makes heads turn. Also, it doesn&#x27;t work a lot of the time. The reason there are probably so many good reviews is because the product gives you a 10 dollar amazon gift card if you write a good review about them here.</li>
            <li> I whent to Walmart one day and walked by a group girls I knew walked passed them and all of a sudden I turn around and there all behind me following me lol</li>
            <li> It smells good and works great with my true religion cologne which gets a ton of compliments. By itself, I&#x27;d give the smell and 8. Not bad girly strong or musky, but not likely to get you compliments on the way you smell.as far as the pheromones go, it&#x27;s been proven that they do work. They can cause a girl to fall for you very quickly. The pheromones make them feel very good and and that&#x27;s why they like being around you. It&#x27;s still not likely that women will approach you.  you still have to make a move.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and I am satisfied with the results. The girls will chat with you longer than the normal, they pay more attention to the talk and it seems that want to stay with you longer than the usual. I will buy this product again</li>
            <li> it works :)  Has a nice aroma and definitely gives you a confidence boost. More smiles and nice reactions from women</li>
            <li> Wow! I cannot believe the amount of attention I am getting from just a simple product. Not only do I have great social skills, but I have this potion as my sidekick. Don&#x27;t let anyone fool you, this product works. You have to consider the science involved with the product however. Some women are more attracted to certain pheromones. Some are more receptive at different times. Don&#x27;t expect girls just to invite you to threesomes after wearing this. It is to subconsciously gain attention. It&#x27;s a smell. It&#x27;s a primitive smell. I have used it for two days now, and I have made sure to hug women when possible to really give them the scent. Although, I ordered PherX, and got a bottle called PherSpray. It really made me skeptic. It works.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne! I use a little bit along with Polo Black or Polo Blue.  The women at my office love how I smell!  I have started getting lots of hugs each day, and the new running joke is that after a hug, the women giggle and exclaim, &amp;#34;I smell like Dan!!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works. ;-D</li>
            <li> This fragrance has a pleasant aroma but still do not see great results. Later depending on the results will change the rating</li>
            <li> I spry this product on my neck before I go to stripe club. I just want to take the experiment more extreme, since the stripper sniffed my neck, she started kissing my nick which is not normal. Also, I let one of my friend to check all my expensive brand perfume, but in the end she likes this spry more. Its better to use pherx when you&#x27;re going to meet a girl not just waiting for the girls talk to you which is wasting money and time because these girls in the club are not focusing on you only so they might to walk next to you and look to another guy, so they&#x27;ll be attracted to the guy they look at. It&#x27;s a helpful tool but don&#x27;t be depended on 100% without using your skills to get women. I&#x27;m using it as 25% and my skills 75%. there&#x27;s one problem of this product which is the smell doesn&#x27;t take more than 5 mint. So I believe if you mixed it with lotion, it will be much better.</li>
            <li> smells good but really has no effect</li>
            <li> Just got it...tried it once so far...not sure of results....key seems to be just be yourself and&lt;br /&gt;let the product do what it can do as you are relaxed, positive and confident.</li>
            <li> I was curious so I tried this out. I don&#x27;t know if it truly works or if its just a placebo effect, but it has made me more confident in my endeavors. I have a fiance and it has made her more affectionate when I wear it and when I don&#x27;t, I can sense a difference in the way she acts towards me. With other women, they seem to get jealous of my fiance and are really tense with each other when I am around. All in all, if it really works or not, I think it is worth a try if your are curious.</li>
            <li> Have been trying the product a couple weeks now.  Seems to work pretty well.  Girls definitely take notice more.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> went to the movies yesterday and sprayed myself twice before going in one nice girl was staring at me till the movie was over this product really works!!!!!</li>
            <li> Worked for me just like they said it would! Light smell and lasts all day if you were wondering about it!</li>
            <li> After doing some research on countless websites, I found that one of the most appreciated pheromone sprays out there was PherX...so I had to give it a try. Turns out this stuff works as well as smells great. I wear it frequently and have gotten many great responses from it. I will definitly buy more! :D</li>
            <li> It definitely made a difference the first time I tried it. I could tell that it made a difference with me as well.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first but honestly I believe it is more then a placebo effect, noticed instantly more attraction from the opposite sex would recommend</li>
            <li> Smells like vinegar after a couple of hours. Good at first, but then after, ewww.</li>
            <li> I started using this as soon as I got it and that night, and I gotta admit my girlfriend went crazy. We normally have great sex, but this time it was more than ever and she was very touchy feely which she normally isn&#x27;t. the next day we hung out and we went at it again. I know that it won&#x27;t help you bed all the ladies because before all that women were just alot nicer and much more closer to me during the day. Obviously it got her more on the sexual side because of the natural attraction already there. It also has a nice scent to it as well. Make sure to follow the instructions, and it&#x27;s best to use right after you shower. I will be getting more of this on a normal occasions.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because i needed some cologne and wanted to see more myself if the claims were true.  As for now i can say it doesnt really have a magical affect but does make women appear more friendly.  So overall this product was fun to try to be honest i wouldnt purchase again</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because i was very curious in how this worked(saw it in a magazine). Therefore i bought this product to try it out for myself. I honestly think that it smells pretty good. It smells classic or what i call OG. But the container kinda ruined the cologne feel to this product and it was more like a mere lab product. Well the results to this was that it didn&#x27;t work. My woman friend did not act any different and everything was about the same. maybe because the potency of this product was too low. Either way i don&#x27;t care im not buying anything like this again, waste of money. but now i know that this just might be a fluke. well at least this specific one.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this product. The scent is very pleasing and beside the overt angle of attracting women, it is also a good product for sales individuals! I love the scent and consider it a working tool! I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It works very strongly. When I used it I am not just seeing the girls looking at me, but more that that, they want to talk with me al the time.</li>
            <li> Received product in protective packaging.  Product smells a bit strong so use a little each time.  Haven&#x27;t tried it out on the town yet.</li>
            <li> didnt work at all, friend didnt like it, she said it smells funny. Wish i could get my money back.</li>
            <li> I thought a lot about buying it or not and finally I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;That was a month ago and now I&#x27;ll buy it definitely again because it really works!</li>
            <li> Smells good and I think that girls like it, but they are not all taking off their clothes after they smell me.</li>
            <li> Ok, so, I think it helps but can&#x27;t be 100% sure because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) I&#x27;m already a good looking guy, but I feel I&#x27;m getting increased interest with PherX.&lt;br /&gt;2.) I&#x27;ve already been getting some action on the regular, which makes you more appealing to women. They can sense your lack of frantic horniness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, even if it&#x27;s just a placebo effect, it&#x27;s worth it. So slather it on fellas!</li>
            <li> this product is good enoght as i think. I use it for several times. no strong pherom or smell about it. but really can make you feel better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know much about the product before I ordered it. I&#x27;m not sure if it works or not yet. We shall see, I suppose. I mainly got it because the reviews mentioned that it has a nice smell to it and I think it does. It doesn&#x27;t take more than a spray or two to make you smell nice. It is lighter smelling than most of the other cologne that I own and I will have to test out how long it lasts. I gave it 4 stars because of the nice smell. The price is a little high if it is just cologne, but if it actually works then I will update my review later to 5 stars and buy more bottles.</li>
            <li> I really like the sent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested this product in several venues (work, church, bar, social settings)...  This doesn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ve notice no change in how women relate to me which is mostly ignore....  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Please , please please do not push the add to cart button. You will be very disappointed. Buy a good smelling cologne instead . I purchased , I used, I nor anyone else was impressed. Any good reviews must be paid for. All it is , is a little scented water. Not one lady at work said a thing about the smell , you would almost have to be in the persons lap for that person to even smell the product. Buyer be wear , and when you do buy it, because you think this review must be wrong or fake..remember I told you so...,DONT BUY THIS ! DONT BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, I am not able to say that it works, but smells nice and give you all confidence needed.</li>
            <li> PherX Pheromone Oil for Men was my 2nd pheromone purchase and I liked it so I thought I&#x27;d follow it with PherX Pheromone Cologne for Men (spray version.) It has a nice light, while the oil is nearly scentless the spray cologne has a really nice light scent. I doubt you will have women tackling you while wearing this you will probably find, like I did, women lingering to chat with you. if so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty effective. Whether it&#x27;s the pheromones or just the scent like any nice cologne, I can&#x27;t say but for the price who cares!</li>
            <li> I will not continue to use this product after the first aplication just because of its smlell, it stinks, the smell in unpleasant, like cat or dog piss. It cannot be called a cologne. I believe pheromones do work, so I will chose for renamed brand companies.</li>
            <li> we tried it her but no effect at all ( 4 guys tried it )</li>
            <li> The product does appear to cause women to respond in a positive way.  She definitely noticed it and was sniffing my chest where I sprayed it.  Such products may be just what men need when their woman is on the fence and need subliminal motivation to be with them.</li>
            <li> As part of an ad hoc, pseudo-scientific trial, the product has shown a minimal active life span beyond application and subsequent subject testing.  I would suggest the formulators add more of the attractive scent.    The product does embolden the male wearer to make some gestures of interest, to a noticeable degree in attempts to attract a female, but whether or not that has had a complementary effect on a targeted female is somewhat uncertain.</li>
            <li> I really believe there is no magic here. If someone wears a supposed attractant and is expecting it to work they will probably try to make themselves more attractive (smile more, try to be more attentive, etc.) and get results from that. I believe the placebo effect takes place and if one thinks it will work it might from the expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not think this works any better than being more friendly, interesting, and interested. The magic is in the person, but whatever works. Don&#x27;t expect to all-of-a-sudden become a chic magnet from the fragrance or supposed \\&quot;human pheromone\\&quot; you wear. You have some of that naturally and it has never been shown to draw people together. I was interested in the fragrance but think a little mild aftershave is probably better and less expensive. Some wear overpowering cologne that can give people a headache so go light and not smell too strong. One squirt of this on the neck is a pretty mild and descent scent; may smell bad to some, not to others.</li>
            <li> More attention from ladies, even at the bank women never speak to me but with this I not only get spoken to today..... I got a complement about how nice I smell from the pretty teller!  Women are generally more receptive, and easy to talk to and initiate conversation enabling me to continue the chatting if I wish.  Should have more dates and women to hang out with and it makes it easier so far and I just started.</li>
            <li> This cologne works well and it smells good. My girlfriend like it and the effect&#x27;s work. Its a win-win situation!</li>
            <li> No way!!!! Just wear it for the first time. The result was phenomenal so far. a Phone number I didn&#x27;t expect and an invitation for lunch by a hot chick. I know I am a good looking man but still :) This cannot happen from the sky. PhreX is Magical. The journey continues ...</li>
            <li> Love the product. I have ordered this product on numerous occasions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t take detect any sent to this is a good product</li>
            <li> After careful testing in my personal life, I&#x27;ve concluded there is no measurable effect. It still is some classy smelling Cologne, though. The scent seems to wear off within half an hour, though... not &amp;#34;super effective&amp;#34; against women-type like advertised.</li>
            <li> waste of money. i bought this at the same time i got certo from alpha dream, it actually works as apposed this stuff that when my husband used it i got a headache and made him take a shower... Just wanted to add that if you buy this rip off product the seller doesn&#x27;t issue a refund... thanks for stealing my money for a watered down product I would give this negative stars if i could buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a friend recommended.  Wow, really smells great and lasts a long time.  Not sure how well it works on my wife but we will see????  :)</li>
            <li> Very good product indeed.I never thought pheromones are really working.But ,do not expect that some kind of magic will happen...somewhere along the line it is you who will make the diffence between  geting laid or not.</li>
            <li> (Bought it as a gag gift for a friend.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, if you want to smell like a billy goat wearing cheap cologne (that is attractive?) this crap is for you.</li>
            <li> Pherx was simply amazing to me it really works the woman i wanted to talk to me most at work really took to me, she would smile at me more at work talk to me close up, i askd her out and i wore pherx and she couldn&#x27;t stop touching me i got to kiss her and we ended up sleeping together, i will be buying more no doubt about that, i owe it all to pherx</li>
            <li> Smells great and works wonders, 10/10 would recommend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sure does give you a confidence boost. And it has a nice aroma to it definitely recommend to try it out</li>
            <li> This works about as good as a bag of cat piss</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 2 stars for the very light pleasant smell that is very short lasting. Unfortunately, this product is a placebo. Not only did I not turn any heads  but my girlfriend did not even get any extra excitement at all around me. In fact the one time I wore this product, she happened to not have sex with me and we usually have sex every time I spend the night. I applied a fresh spray when I first saw her and again before we went to bed and NOTHING. Im not a cheater but it&#x27;s nice to see if girls in public can be attracted to you and with this product I got no results. Keep in mind I do know how to talk to girls and charm them and etc. but this product didn&#x27;t extend my game. Which means with or without the product I can get the few head turns I usually get and interact with women and garnish their attention. Only difference is the choice of whether or not I want to keep $30 extra dollars in my wallet. Save your money and buy a bottle of Adidas or Calvin Klein cologne instead since they actually give more quantity and better quality than this PherX crap that is absurdly overpriced. These colognes actually smell great and get pleasant responses for me.</li>
            <li> I got this a couple years ago. When I spayed it on I smelled a clean soapy scent. But when sprayed it on on of my friends as a prank she said it smelled disgusting like men sweat and body odor. None of my guy friends smelt that, but only her and her mother. They didn&#x27;t like it. whatever it is, it is something only than women can smell and it may not be attractive to all. I&#x27;d say instead of using this, go see a shrink and boost your self confidence.</li>
            <li> This Cologne smells like aftershave, just a little better.  My wife seems to gravitate towards the areas of my skin I put the cologne on.  I have received complements from women.  One of them was at a concert.  As this lady walks by, she turns  around and says : You smell great!.  She kind of shocked herself after she heard herself saying it.&lt;br /&gt;The pheromones must have a subconscious impact on women.  Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but certainly, the cologne has a certain effect.&lt;br /&gt;I would wear it just because I actually like the way it smells. I am please with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my wife is allergic to regular cologne and the claims of this product was a plus . It did absolutely nothing period. I work closely with also a bunch of nurses and though my interests only are with my wife I thought I would see if it worked at work. Absolutely no effect what so ever. Do not waste your money. I was really hoping my wife would notice.</li>
            <li> I Was Totally Taken Back The First Time I Used The Product.I Did Not Try To Attract Attention, But But Sure Got Noticed With All The Smiles And Attention. What A Pleasant Surprise ! I Would Recommend This Product To All Guys. I Think Should Really Give It A Try!</li>
            <li> Smells really good but I don&#x27;t think it is attracting any women. It is probably my looks and not the cologne.  I would buy it again because of the fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> Does not work, just scam.</li>
            <li> I found this product very effective to a point.  Upon attracting females, it is up to the person using the product to then be able to make a good impression.  Another words, this product works well in attracting, but the person using PherX has to still be compatible in some way.  Therefore, if you are looking only to have sex, there still has to be compatibility after meeting her.</li>
            <li> Great item, Great Seller</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really likes the smell of pherx.  I do notice that she is more \\&quot;touchy feely\\&quot; when I wear pheromones.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s building my confidence or if it really attracts the ladies. All i know is that they show more attention.</li>
            <li> I tested this product for two months. I used it per instructions at several locations and sometimes around the same ladies several times. I was making observations and looking for reactions and mood change.  The product is a waste of money. I will be testing another pheromone cologne for men (attract women) in the near future.</li>
            <li> Nice smell but thats all.</li>
            <li> Lot of female attention</li>
            <li> Zero effect.&lt;br /&gt;I lightly spritzed it on and also heavily applied it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a handsome fellow as is with slight confidence issues, and no effect.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible product,&lt;br /&gt;Misleading label.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice a big difference but does smell good, the bottle is small for the price i think, I don&#x27;t know if I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure, but I think that this stuff actually works. I bought this to spice things up a bit. Always keeping in mind that females bore easily, so if you don&#x27;t keep things interesting............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a Friday evening, so I showered and sprayed just a slight puff of this stuff on the back of my neck. My wife arrives home from work exhausted from her week as usual. Typically we go out for dinner then settle in watching a little netflix and she falls asleep in my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I at that point get up and do a few things until I&#x27;m tired enough to fall asleep. About a half an hour later I get a call from my wife, &amp;#34;are you coming to bed?&amp;#34; Although we have a very nice love life she&#x27;s seldom &#x27;ready to go&#x27; when she&#x27;s tired, so this was unusual. We had a great time, that night, and for the next few days she showered my with affection telling me how happy she is, and how lucky she felt to be my wife. This woman doesn&#x27;t just hand out adoration. We&#x27;ve been together for over twenty-five years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now here&#x27;s the funny bit; PherX e-mailed me with a request. They said go and pick out any other of their products other than this one. Try it. Then give a review, and I&#x27;ll receive it for free. So I go to the firm&#x27;s products, and the only other product that was different was &#x27;Pheromone for Women&#x27;(attract men), so I picked it to see if it would work on my wife like the other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I tried it, and I think that it made her irritable :-) hahahaaaa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne for men smells like Halston for men cologne that I used in my twenties thirty years ago. The cologne for women smells like rotting flower petals. It&#x27;s really bad :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d leave a review about the cologne for women stuff, but I don&#x27;t know how to not having purchased any. Any advise on this would be appreciated as I&#x27;d like to fulfill my end of the bargain.</li>
            <li> Great smell and the ladies definitely take a greater notice towards me and talkative. Highly recommend this product, two squirts and you&#x27;re good to go</li>
            <li> I bought this on accident, but since I couldnt return it due to some laws, I figured Id give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like pee, thats is not a overstatement....just smells like pee</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase. It arrived promply and it exceeded my expectations. I have used it and was instantly noticed by some. I would endorse this product and the company for others with no reservations.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it definitely lowers a woman&#x27;s guard to allow her to open up. But it does fade away a little quick! 3-4 hours then reapply.</li>
            <li> I got the product in the mail and put it on right before i went to class, i&#x27;m in college and today this girl in my class started talking to me out of the blue and she was being real flirty, and that&#x27;s weird because we&#x27;ve seen each other in class for almost 2 months and nothing ever happened before!!! Can&#x27;t wait to try this at my gym next week</li>
            <li> I am kind of nervous to try this out. I just received my bottle today and I am a bit skeptical now that I have it. I&#x27;m going to school in a few hours so I will try it out but Im still nervous. I will get back with a review once I go to school and to my girlfriend&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li> So far I have not experienced a dramatic change in the way females behave around me.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I do feel more comfortable and self confident around females using this product....&lt;br /&gt;Odor is a bit strong at first, strangely no one seems to notice or complain about it.&lt;br /&gt;My experienced is limited though, I still have not used in an open environment like a bar or a meeting.&lt;br /&gt;Will expand my review soon.</li>
            <li> This product is okay, it&#x27;s not the best compared to Pherazone and other products like it. This product does last however. I put some on at 8 am and at 1 pm it is still giving off scent. But it only works for some people not all.</li>
            <li> It shipped on time,as promised. It mix&#x27;s well with other stuff I wear, I did get a few compliments, so maybe something behind all this. But I am still not married.!</li>
            <li> Liked the idea..has a nice scent but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Noticeable change in female coworkers demeanor towards me. First time I used it I didn&#x27;t need to introduce myself to other ladies at my work. They asked me who I was. I didn&#x27;t need to talk.</li>
            <li> My wife kind of liked the scent, but it did not last that long. Maybe it is better when out hunting for the single ladies.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle smell and women seem to relax and be friendlier around it. I&#x27;ll buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Has a reasonably good smell.  Have received female compliments.  Feel it&#x27;s worth a try.  Good luck in your search.</li>
            <li> this thing is ok, it smells good, but as far as it saying what it says, well i use it around my wife and didn&#x27;t notice any difference. so i guess if you like a light musk cologne this is it.</li>
            <li> Activity with my mate increased considerably and is more intense. Nice clean subtle smell too.</li>
            <li> I received the shipment last week in proper condition and It seems to be a good product when used occasionally</li>
            <li> I am perfectly satisfied with PherX.  It works as advertised and without exageration.  I would recommend it to a friend.  It was delivered promptly and without any problems</li>
            <li> With this product you cannot expect to magically attract every single girl, however it smells very nice and with the added pheromones I could notice that girls came closer to me when they were talking.</li>
            <li> The spray version of this is ok. It does have some affect on females only if they are already interested. Otherwise, you just received the compliment of smelling good.</li>
            <li> Been using for a week getting mixed reactions</li>
            <li> At the end of the day I smelled like rancid milk. I literally almost puked.</li>
            <li> Great smell!  You don&#x27;t have to mix this with any other cologne unless you want to.  So far I&#x27;m pleased with the results I&#x27;m seeing from Pherx.  Worth a try!</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how this stuff works. So much attention. Women passing by at the grocery store can&#x27;t help but maintain eye contact. Pretty awesome. I suggest trying it</li>
            <li> Bought this a few weeks ago and I have noticed some differences out in the field.&lt;br /&gt;I have found it best works if you put at least two sprays on your neck and then ask a girl to dance with you.  Get her close and let her take it in. After a few minutes I noticed the pick up going much easier. She let me touch her hips as we were dancing. Then I grabbed her arms and put them on my shoulders. Move her off the dance floor. chatted for a bit. played with her hands and went in for the kiss. Simple as that.</li>
            <li> The item did not lead to any attention.  Wearing it was like not wearing it at all.  I can say that I felt a little more energized which led to me feeling more motivated and confident.  It was as if the product contained some sort of steroid.  Even so, the purpose of the product was to get attention, not lead me to create attention.  Otherwise, I can easily get my energy boost from coffee or chocolate.  But for those who need a slight boost in energy for the sake of confidence, then go ahead and try this product.  Otherwise, save your money.</li>
            <li> I never believed in pheromones, but i decided to buy a pheromone cologne after my friend said that he got girls using pheromones. I found this one on Amazon and it actually works. I&#x27;ve been getting more smiles from girls and even had this girl who hated me smile at me for the first time. The only problem is that I have to use quiet a bit to see a difference, but overall this is a great product and i will definitely be buying another bottle very soon.  I recommend this product to all men.</li>
            <li> I was a bit incredulous to decide to buy but I took a chance. I know now that was a good decision. I have 15 years of marriage and my relationship with my wife had cooled a bit. since I started using pheromones, improved my sex life! thank you!</li>
            <li> The scent is essentially distilled &#x27;musk&#x27;. While overpowering for some, to those with less sensitive noses it seems to have a pleasant hairspray-like smell.</li>
            <li> It smells like one of those musky cologne. I like it and, my girl friends like it.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced super sexual attraction effect like the Axe ad yet, but I hope that happens soon.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!! DOES NOTHING!!!! SERIOUSLY MY REGULAR COLOGNE GETS ME BETTER RESULTS!!! THIS IS BULL!! IM A PLAYER G N I KNOW HOW TO GET GIRLS!!! THIS CRAP!! NO WAY DAWG DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ITS JUNK!! TRIED IT NO EFFECT!!! AS A MATTER OF FACT I THINK IT MADE MY CHANCES WORSE LOL ONE COLOGNE BABY UNFORGIVABLE BY SEAN JOHN AND SHOOT BE CONFIDENT BABY!!! TAKE CONTROL WOMAN WANT A MAN TO PROTECT THEM NOT FEAR THEM!!! ANYWAYS IT WAS A NICE EXPERIMENT LMAO</li>
            <li> Looks like it works, but it not magic spray. I feel the excitement. It does not work, whenever you r feeling bad or seek.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on a whim, and really wanted to see what all the hype with pheromone colognes were. Of course it takes some effort in actually approaching women, but when I have, I do have get very receptive responses. I&#x27;ve wore it at the gym, and have attended yoga classes, and did get noticeable looks, and women approaching for conversation after the class. This is considering I was all but 3 men out of about 40 women in the class. This stuff actually smells awesome too. Has a very fresh, crisp scent. Not overbearing at all. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this item and i can feel it works......anyways it is worth to buy....Once i go out, i use it every time....</li>
            <li> Pherx has a really nice smell to it, like it a lot. I know is has some kind of effect on people. Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> i just recieved this product and it does make me feel realaxed being realy skeptical ive been wanting to try it</li>
            <li> So, I tried this product. Everyone around me was much nicer and my husband was all touchy feely which I really like. Is it effective enough to get into someone pants? Maybe not. I think it works well if you are in a relationship or are dating. Its scent is very relaxing. I like the scent so much, I dont wear my own perfumes when wearing this cologne. Customer service was contacted 3 times with questions I had. They were very quick and professional. From me they get an A+ for customer service and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many times when time meet the peoples but does not make any difference.&lt;br /&gt;Have any other way to use other than given?&lt;br /&gt;should drink other than spray?</li>
            <li> This product works and has made my life easier women give me what ever I want and I won the lottery.</li>
            <li> Received it last week and saw noticeable difference in way women treated me on the weekend.  Also smells great, and for the price, great buy.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely does not work.</li>
            <li> I would spray the product twice on each wrist and rub it behind my ears. The smell lasts for about 6 hours. I bought this because I&#x27;m very interested in studying human behavior, and I wanted to see first hand if there are any synthetic pheromones in the market that can significantly affect human behavior. It did affect someone&#x27;s behavior, my own. It creates a kind of placebo effect that boosts your confidence.</li>
            <li> Label me an idiot.  I saw it on Askmen.com and figured why not.  If you must I&#x27;m not going to be able to stop you, but please know that you will basically smell like rubbing alcohol.  Maybe I got knock off, but I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> At first, when buying this product, I was a little skeptical. But now, after having it for about a week, I&#x27;d say it works. If not, it definitely smells great and still gives off a positive effect</li>
            <li> Am a single black male. Am nice looking i get a lot of females with out this spray. But I figure I Give it a try cause it only 20 dollors rite. Men i tell you I had a Girl over the house that day I and i figure what the Heck let me try this stuff out. I sprayed it on my neck area. It smeel like water to me. But The female that was over my house was more in a rush to get her clothes off then me. Need to say what happen that night. Now i keep this stuff close. I think it even keep the female more turned on while having sex but i dont know for sure about that one</li>
            <li> I bought this product for three reasons:  1.  The reviews on Amazon said it worked.  2.  Competing products were described as having an overpowering smell.  3.  The price per volume seemed like a good value.    When I received the product I noticed the ingredients on the label: SDA40B alcohol, purified water, di-propylene glycol, essential oils, human pheromones.  So it&#x27;s mostly alcohol and contains extremely little pheromones.      Reason 3 for buying the product is now eliminated.  It&#x27;s cheaper because it&#x27;s diluted.  Then I started thinking about reason 2.  It&#x27;s smells nice like an aftershave because it&#x27;s mostly alcohol, just like an aftershave.      I began to test whether the product works, being aware not to let the placebo effect color my observations.  First one spray per day, then two sprays, I worked up to eight sprays, always with no effect.  Nothing.      What about the guys on Amazon that swear it works?  One guy wrote, \\&quot;I have never been approached by so many girls in one night. It was insane. I got 8 numbers, a good night for me is 3 at the most and that&#x27;s a really good night.\\&quot;  In retrospect, that review is just too good to be true.  In a crowded party, a woman from across the room approaches you because you smelled sexy and she could just tell from a distance that the smell was yours and not one of the other guys?  To date, the only product that this guy has reviewed is PherX.  I&#x27;m guessing that the review is just advertising from Zyloo Research Labs posing as a review, but maybe it&#x27;s a real guy that&#x27;s very susceptible to the placebo effect.      I selected the Amazon reviewers that appear to be real people because they&#x27;ve review products that are not from Zyloo Research Labs.  Not one of these people gave the product five stars.  One of the five-star reviews came from \\&quot;Rick Jacobs\\&quot; who also gave five starts to a Zyloo Research Labs pheromones for women (to attract men).  Now I know that I&#x27;ve been duped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money .Smell is good but absolute no results. Save your money and just buy regular cologne .i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone .</li>
            <li> As with the other one (oil-based) I&#x27;m not exactly  being mobbed by hordes of admirers, but it seems to make a difference in everyday interactions.</li>
            <li> seems to get attention, subtle but noticed some women wanting to talk more, opening up to conversation faster? maybe its psychological but it seems to work :)</li>
            <li> Woman will tend to be more talkative and smile more at you, it is true you also get more glances from the woman around you, but the rest is all on you.</li>
            <li> The pheromone oil has a nice scent to it however it is a bit more greasy than the cologne since it is oil based.  The cologne also comes with a spray nozzle which is more convenient and rations are more equal allowing for additional usages.</li>
            <li> i purchased this product and it didnt do anything, left a 2 star feedback and asked for refund. guess what it got removed, no wonder it only shows 5 and 4 star feedback at their seller rating. this product is aa a total scam, it says on the bottle it consists of human pheromones, really??? how is it possible? did they extracted them from humans? you only can have synthetic pheromones, what a loud of nonsense!!!</li>
            <li> So I have used two other Pheromone cologne&#x27;s before. I have used both Scent Of Eros (My favorite) and Shikari. I ran out of both these so I decided to try something new, this had a lot of reviews so why not?  I might add to this review later but I thought I&#x27;d give some comments so far. I decided to wear this out to a crowded bar last night out for a friends birthday. LOTS of great looking girls at this place and many women I&#x27;ve met through friends. One girl in particular I&#x27;ve had some conversation with on and off in the past, we had spoken on Facebook a few times but nothing really progressed. The last two times I saw her at large gatherings with friends I hardly spoke to her, merely a \\&quot;hello, how are you doing?\\&quot; and nothing more.  Well last night she was at the bar, as soon as I noticed her she made a lot of eye contact with me from a distance. Within probably 5-10 minutes of being in the bar she came over and started talking to me, we ended up chatting for nearly the whole night over 2 hours~ and I felt overall more confident and comfortable talking to her, I was able to flirt a bit and really keep the eye contact and conversation going. Granted, this may not be entirely from the cologne.. I did notice a lot more eye contact from around the room more so than usual. I am so far satisfied with my purchase. I ended the night with getting a phone number and my friends jealous of me.</li>
            <li> This product is garbage. Do not waste your money. It does NOTHING CLOSE to what it says it does. You&#x27;re better off without it.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and works.  Simple yet effective.  I would definitely recommend to my friends.  Keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> I bought the Pherx bottle for an early Christmas gift this year and the results were definitely noticeable. Women around me were more talkative and interested in getting to know me, though it is worth knowing how to keep a conversation going with a girl before you spray the stuff on. Chemical pheromones only do half the job. Still, I&#x27;ll be recommending this to any of my guys looking for an icebreaker!</li>
            <li> I, like I&#x27;m sure many of you are, was very skeptical at first. I spent a couple of hours reading and researching and settled on PherX.&lt;br /&gt;The Smell - Not bad by itself, sort of like a light aftershave. You could wear it by itself, though I usually combine it with a little of something else.&lt;br /&gt;The Price - Nothing to get super excited about, but better than most.&lt;br /&gt;Now the important part, The Performance - I &amp;#34;tested&amp;#34; it out in two main places, at work and just general living. If you want something to make the women crawl all over you then you just need to get off the internet, because that’s not possible. I noticed two things, people were generally more pleasant and approachable and I had more confidence. The biggest thing I noticed is that people around the office that were usually stand-offish or crabby etc. were much more friendly. Dating wise, I didn&#x27;t have any more women approach me than normal; but the women I went to talk to opened up and were more friendly a lot quicker and the conversations went better. Which also helped my confidence.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I won&#x27;t guarantee anything but what I experienced I feel that it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product but im a firm believer and everyone needs to get a hold of this product.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this scent does work.I dont ever have problems with getting the attention of ladies, but this product has made life easier and a lot of fun for sure.Thanks</li>
            <li> Seems to def. help conversation start up with females. I would def recommend but feel other products might be stronger.</li>
            <li> I tried it out for a night on the town and instantly started noticing smiles from afar. Lets just say it ended up being a great night with the extra desired touches.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Pherx bottle for myself a few weeks ago to see if it would help me with the attraction. I have noticed some differences when I go out and results were noticeable,  however this is not a panty dropping product and one who purchases this must keep that in mind. Women around me were more talkative and it seemed that women close by were interested in getting closer to me and or the conversation. I think this product is great for bringing women in closer but the rest is up to you, your charisma and physical attraction.&lt;br /&gt;I also want to emphasize that the customer service from the company is excellent and the shipping was very quick. I also e mailed them inquiring possible allergens and received prompt courteous service. I definitely think this sets them apart from other Amazon sellers.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected. This product was awesome awesome and I used it during my school and it attracted many women. Unfortunately, I did not get any chance to talk with anyone.</li>
            <li> Only tried it a couple of times but I think I am getting an edge. It is still too soon to know for sure if it is my imagination or the product but I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was great it was something new to try on a girlfriend , an it worked magnificently, I will Definately buy more</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work even a little</li>
            <li> This product came in pretty fast. I was pretty excited. I opened it and the smell was nice, slightly powerful. I wore it to one of classes and the exchange student beside, who I have tried to push past the \\&quot;classroom friends\\&quot; started talking to me more and now we are going to a park in the mountains! So I&#x27;d say that this has it&#x27;s benefits.</li>
            <li> Cheapest than any of my colognes, but it still smells like it could be one. Works great!  And for $27 it&#x27;s a totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I mix it with my cologne for an added boost women seem to be more easily approachable and chatty. I give it a thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I bought for my husband. This is very noticeable! Someone mentioned to us: the smell made my heart beat fast! We were laughing so hard. It is powerful for man.</li>
            <li> Definitely caused a noticeable shift in behavior with the girls in college. They&#x27;ve become more touchy and flirty so making a move is so much easier now. The company also sent me another free bottle of my choice. If this isn&#x27;t working for you then you honestly have no social skills. You still gotta me a man and approach because most women aren&#x27;t gonna throw themselves at you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it fairly consistently for the past couple of weeks squirting behind each ear and to be totally honest I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in terms of my social interactions with the opposite sex. Have not noticed any increase in attention or anything of that sort.&lt;br /&gt;Not saying it doesn&#x27;t work due to the other 5 star reviews but it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Just want to put it out there.</li>
            <li> This product is a very affective when it comes to attracting the ladies it performance is 100% a must for a guy thats in the dating scene.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work as described - I have noticed people react differently to me when I&#x27;m wearing it and I definitely receive more attention.  Smells good regardless, I spray it on after I shower in the morning - subtle smell stays on me all day.  Doesn&#x27;t have an oily feel, nice &amp; crisp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1 star because package was slightly leaking on arrival.</li>
            <li> Its the first time am using this product and it really give off a expression. Ladies just keep on asking what cologne are you wearing,they even rubbed their body on me.thanks to zyloo lab research</li>
            <li> I put on this product before I went to work and when I got to my office I instantly felt the women drawn to me, not in crazy &amp;#34; I want to be on top of you &amp;#34; way but they wanted to be around me and ask me questions, I also tried to see if it would work without it and didnt get the same results until I wore it again. I think it does work but not as much as the women will be taking off their panties to be with you. It really helps you feel comfortable being around women so I will keep using and taking advantage of this little magic attractant.</li>
            <li> bought this to try it and so far it seems to be working how to keep trying a longer to see how well it does workdefinitely were trying</li>
            <li> Recommend this product. It both increased confidence and attracted females. I will buy additional product. It appears to break down resistance but does not overwhelm the woman.</li>
            <li> Package came in really intact and on time!&lt;br /&gt;In general the product is really good! I noticed a little bit difference in the way the ladies acted around me (in a good way).&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must try!</li>
            <li> Product seams to work better then my average body spray, I have noticed that within the two days that I&#x27;ve been using the product that females do seam to slow down and look more then before, I&#x27;ve also sparked up a few conversations with strangers who just wanted to say hi. I would only recommend one spray every 3 hours or so, after that the scent starts to fade. Anymore then that seams to make me feel sick for a short time and usually I&#x27;m not one to have problems with a strong scent of any kind. All and all, this would be a product I would recommend if you need a little more of a edge to start a conversation while keeping them interested in you. Everything helps when you want some numbers!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product as a whole. If anything, look at is a cologne that works and smells good. I will always have doubts regarding the actual pheromones themselves, however I will say that girls do seem to like it. It might be placebo, but they seem more responsive when I am wearing PherX. As for Zyloo Research Labs- the item was shipped promptly. 4/5 stars</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Don&#x27;t buy it you&#x27;ll just end up throwing away money.  I suggest doing a little research first.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband, he used it a couple of times without telling me when and i didn&#x27;t notice anything different. Afterwards he said he used enough to kill an elephant and I didn&#x27;t notice.&lt;br /&gt;But I do notice when he is using he Nautica Blue, then I am all over him... but this product blah, don&#x27;t waste your $ on it.</li>
            <li> This product does work, but there are many variables to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duration- Like any spray or cologne, it does not last forever. This is especially true if you sweet a lot. I once sprayed it, worked out, then saw the duration went from 6 hours to 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location- Now, if you are wearing this outside, the effectiveness lessens, especially if it is really windy. I found that this works best indoors, the smaller the room the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who smells it- I don&#x27;t know about you, but my nose is clogged 24/7. I did research online, and the part of your body that responds to pheromones is in your nose, so there may be a small percent of the population who doesn&#x27;t respond to it. I also found that the people who you rate as a 5, 6, or 7, lower on the scale, respond higher to this. It still works on 10&#x27;s, but they don&#x27;t jump down your pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amount- For cost effectiveness, 2 prays is sufficient. I just do 2 on the neck, but if you are going out to something big i would spray 2 more times on your wrists. Obviously the more you have on, the easier it is for them to get attracted to you. You just have to determine how fast you want to buy the next bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, The product works. I noticed more looks, more friendly faces, and a little more contact. I would say it increased my pick up rate from 40% to 55%. So for me, it is just a small boost, but for others less experienced it can make a big difference. I would of gave this a 5 if it was more potent (the more human pheromones, the more potent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note-The company was really fast shipping. The delivery estimate said the 15-24th, and I got it on the 10th.</li>
            <li> It works well enough, but you never know if its the placebo effect. maybe it gives you the confidence to think it&#x27;s working. either way you and up with what you&#x27;re seeking.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as advertise. It has been used in several social settings and I have received a couple of positive comments on the cologne I was wearing.</li>
            <li> PherX is great~~ I feel that women feel an increased attraction to me , I notice women checking me out more</li>
            <li> I would just caution, don&#x27;t let this go to your head. it is a functional product, but you&#x27;re not going to be swimming in poon wherever you go.&lt;br /&gt;other than that, it is functional. has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> Well, tried this product on and off for the past two weeks as an experiment.  Definitely, observed women giving me more looks, and being more communicative.  My wife even said I smelled nice and has been more aggressive and attentive.  Am I being more confident?  Maybe, tried to not change how I acted, so as not to skew the results.  This product is convenient to use in the spay form when you’re in a hurry.  I think less is more, better to be subtle then obvious.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. In line at the store and a woman blurted out &amp;#34;you smell so good what is that your wearing?&amp;#34; It does also seem to make the women I interact with more relaxed and comfortable.</li>
            <li> People started complimenting me on my hair, they would come up to me and ask if they can touch it.  The same make up that i wear everyday was asked what i did that was different?  People in general were drawn to me in a mysterious way.  It is an amazing product.  I would recommend it to anyone needing a boost in confidence. I am well pleased.  Thank You for making it!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product at first. I thought I was just going to get burned. As of right now its too soon to tell if this stuff really works on attracting women. Although, I have noticed a lot of interaction with women lately, and it has improved my mood and charisma. This is no lie, but like I said my experimentation is still in its preliminary stages. its really hard to explain this products effects or if its just a placebo effect, but it seems to be a legit product. if you have the extra money its definitely worth a try. Also I will note that it does smell a little bit like perspiration after its cover smell goes away.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but and seems as little effective but by no means as strong as its oil based substitute from the same company.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased and thought I would test the efficacy.  Average looking guy who could lose a few pounds, so I kept track of who sat next to me on the subway for a week prior to first wearing the item. Then the next week gave a couple sprays and checked who sat next to me.  Week one (no pheromones) almost always men or empty space.  Week two (pheromones) 80 percent ladies sat next to me.</li>
            <li> No difference all in the mind</li>
            <li> This stuff is effective.  This paired with a bit of confidence goes a long way.  It also combines well with EDT and/or cologne as a top layer (around the neck and wrists).</li>
            <li> Does this work?  I know I DO get more play. But is it a psychological thing for me giving me more confidence or does it really work on women?  That being said, does it really matter?  lol  Pleasant scent - but like another reviewer said, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long...  I have yet to find myself in a situation where there are a lot of women to try this on... But when I do, I will post additional comments on what I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID receive this item free of charge to give an honest review...  I guess the most honest review I could give is that I would gladly pay for another bottle once this one is gone.  Something about this works....  for me anyway.</li>
            <li> Good product, smell good.</li>
            <li> So nothing not even a smells good i think it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> The PherX is a good product overall.  No noticeable smell, easy pump, and decent amount for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admittedly haven&#x27;t had many chances to use it yet, but I have noticed a lot more attention from girls when I do.  They don&#x27;t just drop their panties at one whiff, but at least you catch their eye with it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and doesn&#x27;t even know. Wore it the first day and it got her attention. Worked like it should.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, just with couple of days using it. I should wait longer to see best results.</li>
            <li> Product really does work fellas!!! girls ask me what I&#x27;m wearing all the time!!!&lt;br /&gt;a spray in back of the ears and neck and wrists and your all set for the night!!</li>
            <li> Smells ok but it&#x27;s not going to get you a dates</li>
            <li> I like it, it seems to work decently or not at all; still figuring it out. It does smell good its not musky it smells soapy and more sweet and citrus rather than musky. I think it does work- I notice when I sniff it my heart beat goes a little quick and I feel a little clarity or something! Try it- it at least will give you a confidence boost, and with all the good reviews it seems like it works. I say buy it and go out often you&#x27;d be crazy and stupid not to, I see ugly guys with hot girls all the time fools! Go now! Put it on your left palm lol whatever my hands smell like like I smell like, another good place is right on the side of your abdomen and on your clothes seems good try not to rub it in, rather let it air dry Next, I am going to try to Pherx extra strength 20mg. and Arouse Rx.</li>
            <li> Works great!, after I threw it in the garbage and dug up the courage to talk to a women myself instead of relying on some fake miracle get laid quick product!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! It is absolutely making my life alot easier. I am a shy person and I must honestly say it makes talking to people alot easier</li>
            <li> smells good, havent had a chance to try it yet, will post another review after I try it out .</li>
            <li> i mix a cocktail of sents together and finish up with the pherx...i don&#x27;t know about attracting women but i will say this... i noticed that the girls i work with have been treating me differently. laughing and joking with me and i do noticed a few of them standing alittle closer to me than usual... now i won&#x27;t say for sure that it&#x27;s my homemade cologne, but it does make you wonder....doesn&#x27;t it???</li>
            <li> have no idea if it works or not</li>
            <li> This works wonders as a female attractant.  I first purchased the oil version of this and now have the spray.  The 3/3 times that i have used this, I have immediately noticed results from females.  They become more social, touchy, and comfortable in the presence of this scent.  I am very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product because I found its claims to be intriguing.  I found it does seem to be causing for more conversations with strangers but am not certain I can solely attest it to the product or my amazing personality.  Either way no complaints and for full disclosure-  I was sent a offer by the manufacturer to post a review for a free extra bottle.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! It works and it smells great.</li>
            <li> This product definitely helps getting any women&#x27;s attention! I highly recommend this product if you want to standout more than the average Joe! Give it a shot you got nothing to lose works great on me!</li>
            <li> This product SUCKS. it has no smell ( except for the strooong alcohol scent you smll when u spray it) i bought it b/c it looked just like another bottle of pheremones i had but couldnt remember the brand name. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell great, although it&#x27;s not offensive in any way.  just don&#x27;t waste your money thinking this will cure your loneliness.</li>
            <li> Promp service. Received it 3 days after ordering. However after opening the bottle and spraying some on I instantly was familiar with the smell. I knew right away that it wouldn&#x27;t work but I still gave it a shot last night. I saw no results and I was even annoyed at the smell of it. I had bought some hair gel about a year ago that had \\&quot;pheromones\\&quot;  in it and it smelled exactly like this and Im sure they use the same bulk pheromone that Got2Be uses. Save your money don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> Cheap prize , this pheromone is working is well , iam the pheromone lover I have different types pheromone&#x27;s buyed from all that this is pheromone 100% safe , this I am giving 3 rd place in world ,( ( 2nd place is men spicy scent pheromones ) over apply it may dangerous to eyes), ( ( PherX Pheromone Cologne for Men (Attract Women) - The Science of Attraction - 18mg Human Pheromones (Health and Beauty) it 100% safe even drop full in eyes nothing happen ) ) for 5 spray married women&#x27;s are attracting very depth looking nice , I like it so much , girls are attracting but not in powerful way, to attract girls need more than 5 spray ; now iam using along with (max attraction gold ) it use to attract girls &amp; women but it cost is high some times neck is pain is coming ,( I reguired to do not buy pherone v-5,M-11,D-17x, I wasted my money ) ; few men&#x27;s are attracting , if u have any Question ask seller , the seller tells fast , one day I applyed 9 spray&#x27;s  all girls &amp; women&#x27;s are seeing without breaking eyes there trying to kiss &amp; wanted sex with me , I am P.RAVIKIRAN from India.</li>
            <li> I have recently ordered the PherX product for men and have found it to be a good product  I have just starting using but the results have been good.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product three times now because I believe it works.  I dont have a problem attracting women, I just like the extra confidence boost it gives.  I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;ll be a chick magnet all of a sudden, but do expect looks and more conversation.</li>
            <li> I have noticed more attention and touching  after only two uses although I do not really notice a scent that pherX is supposed to have. I was glad it is not strong because I have my own preferred cologne that i can wear with it.  Definitely seems to work!</li>
            <li> just got this product in today...used it at the gym...and can already tell the ladies making more of an attempt to get my attention...very nice indeed...will update later on results at the club this weekend</li>
            <li> it help you in your relations,when i start new relation i need some attract for femals,this kind of products give you help because it works like biology attract,but i think it works diffrent ways from one to another,i mean it may work for me and do not work for sombody else,but you can try</li>
            <li> Folks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the main feature of this cologne is that it can increase confidence if you are susceptible to the powers of suggestion. The scent is pretty good and when I use it my girlfriend does comment that I smell nice (she tends to snuggle closer). As an experiment I have switched back and forth between this and other colognes and the differences seem tiny if any. I think if you are not a big cologne person and want a fairly light cologne that might boost your confidence - this is a good choice. Do not think it will get you laid immediately or at all. It doesn&#x27;t take the work out of dating etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the scent is good and it does last a fairly long time if you apply it correctly. One bottle has lasted me quite a long time. It is nice to have such a small bottle in case you don&#x27;t want to travel with a larger cologne bottle.</li>
            <li> Another Snake Oil...Please dont Purchase these kind of snake oils which just eat up your money and do nothing..It smells of Urine..It didnot work for me and i tried this in many environments..I tried this for many days and NO RESULTS..Waste of money..</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if this works. Have used it off and on and haven&#x27;t seen any results.  Not sure if I use enough or how much to use.  Also notice the spray doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, just wondering how effective this sort of product could be. Im a masculine gay guy and can be confused for straight, but I have women tripping over me to talk. A lady tried to pick me up in the GAY grocery store in Wilton Manors one night. She only stopped when I told her I&#x27;m gay. Gay men were also more than friendly every time I have worn it. Try it! It works for me!</li>
            <li> Interesting results! ......I&#x27;ve been using for several weeks and getting more attention and dates by the opposite sex..keep you posted on my progress!!!</li>
            <li> There is no way to say it 100%, it might be also a placebo effect, but certainly when I wear the product i notice a difference in the way women interct with me. I think it&#x27;s worth trying. The smell is good anyway.</li>
            <li> I sprayed randomly and it didnt have any effect on my wife.  I do not recommend to anyone.  Try something else. Wasnt what I thought.</li>
            <li> So far so good... I think this product helps but With the feramax man a i recieved an unsolicited compliment from my wife that I smelledl good. but that stuff is way expensive and not much in the bottle.</li>
            <li> When i first looked around to purchase a reliable honest product i figured this would be a place to buy. I decided to purchase this perfume and when i tried it for the first time i didn&#x27;t notice any effects. This happened at work and around friends and relatives. I decided i will give it another try when i go out on the weekend. It was amazing! I was being checked out by girls as soon as i passed by them. I didn&#x27;t think it was a big deal but then later on in the night it got worse i was chilling with a friend at the bar having a drink and this girl looked at me and started talking like she knew me or something. The whole night she was all over me and asked me for my number! Im not sure if it was a lucky night for me but i did notice a crazy weird effect. Honestly the smell is not noticeable but the effect was. I hope this helps and cant wait to try it again next weekend and see what happens.</li>
            <li> Its the best product I&#x27;ve tried so far. Women will be at your mercy. Got to have good game also.</li>
            <li> Noticed more attention from women at work and my wife. Beware not Prime even though advertised as such.  Took a week to receive.</li>
            <li> Recieved my order very fast. Tried out the spray the next day and i can say it does turn some heads. Noticed more women talked to me throughout the day on my route. Do have to say doesnt really smell like much. The ladies love the smell though</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work as often as I thought it would. But when it does work...oh boy does it work. While wearing this cologne, I went to a small gathering of friends where I met a girl who was a friend of a friend. During the night while we were all talking and having some beers, she comes close to me and whispers in my ear \\&quot;I know I just met you, but I would definitely like have to sex with you.\\&quot; However, on the times that it doesn&#x27;t always work, I have to express my theory that perhaps some girls are just too shy or don&#x27;t want to say anything--even if the pherx spray is working on them. There was another time when I was with a group of friends while wearing the cologne. After I had gone home, I received a text from a female friend of mine who was there. It said \\&quot;You seemed different tonight. In a good way tho. I should have said this while you were here but you wanna chill sometime just you and me?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyways, it DOES tend to work. Just don&#x27;t expect girls to throw themselves at you just like that. Consider it as bait. You just gotta wave it in front of them. ;)</li>
            <li> I ordered the cologne and received it a few days ago. I was afraid it might not smell very good, but i was pleasantly surprised. It smells very good and I like to wear 1-2 sprays underneath my regular cologne. I immediately started getting compliments on the way that i smelled, even though I have been wearing my other cologne for years. Certainly worth the money, and definitely helped boost my confidence. I am totally satisfied and will be buying another bottle very soon.</li>
            <li> This cologne really works. You only need one spray and it smells great and definitely gets you more attention from the opposite sex. Also just people in general. Most women will pay more attention to you and even get excited/nervous. Now it&#x27;s not a miracle worker; you still need to look presentable and be able to act normal and have a little game. It definitely helps though. Works as advertised, is fairly cheap and free fast shipping. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> works well and surprised at how nice it smells, would recommend it to any guy, noticed a big change in responses of women, ( of all ages !!).</li>
            <li> I bought this product with high expectations, it is a total lie. This product doesn&#x27;t turn woman on and the return guarantee is fake. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, It is a total rip off!</li>
            <li> I was skeptic about buying this product but after opening it, I think it was a good purchase. It smells good, not overpowering. I went out with it and got compliments on my smell. Only down side was that it did not last the whole night. Have to reapply every few hours.</li>
            <li> i am not gonna put my neck on a block but i have been using this product a few days and i do notice a difference in the women around me ,most of them who don&#x27;t keep long conversations just happens to stick around longer much longer further when i pass girls on the street i can most definitely see them starring at me . of course it  is not going to have every woman in the city block running behind you but it is definitely a scent ladies like lastly i am not a \\&quot;sleep around person\\&quot; but really curious to find out if it actually gets ladies turned on</li>
            <li> As others have said in previous comments, I too was skeptical at first over this product and if it could really work. After using it for only a short time I have already noticed a difference in the way women look at me, while also having a higher self-confidence knowing that I have this stuff on. The shipping was fast and I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> This is the product of the century...women become more aware of my presence and caused immediate changes in their behavior, they were more talkative, affectionate and had a better sense of humor with me which gave me more confidence and women love that, only positive reaction I got from this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pheromones are volatile!!! don&#x27;t wait to get yours....</li>
            <li> what a joke. seriously. come on. I cannot believe i fell for it. don&#x27;t do it. a big waste of money!</li>
            <li> Like most others I too was skeptical about this product, but it truly does work and I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> The effects are subtle but noticeable.  Much better price than other similar products I have used.  The spray container is really handy.</li>
            <li> I have tried other pheremone cologne&#x27;s that I feel worked better.  I don&#x27;t feel like this one get&#x27;s the reaction and attention from women like another one I have tried.  But it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than the other stuff!</li>
            <li> Well i only have to say that this one smells good, it doesn&#x27;t do any miracles but I guess a little help is always good.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work very well.  The attraction that it brings confuses the women.  They just can&#x27;t understand what is going on with them and why the feel the way that they do.  All that is needed now is to develop a soap of some kind with this product.</li>
            <li> Women do seem to light up a bit when I am around them. I like this stuff!I will definitely order it when my supply runs out. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I feel that this product definitely gives me more of an edge. As I pass by good looking girls they turn around more often and some even try to strike up conversations. Which is rare for me. But you need to put yourself out there. Show them you&#x27;re interested. Otherwise you&#x27;ll be disappointed with the results. Good product overall.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;science&amp;#34;, or merely the confidence I have when I spray it, but i mix it with my normal cologne, and it seems to attract women, like they wanna be close to me.  Will keep purchasing.</li>
            <li> great stuff, last long and gives you confidence. I was skeptical at first, but women will notice you more with this on.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to Try It yet so I can only give it 3 stars. The smell is not too bad so that is good. I would wear it out on the town.</li>
            <li> I was offered the opportunity to test and review this product.  I think it works very well.  I liked the scent and it seemed to last for a decent amount of time.  As to attracting the opposite sex, I feild tested it at a recent conference I attended.  I wore it and noticed that people there were friendly and talkative to me.  I sat next to a girl at lunch and spoke with her for a few minutes.  After lunch, when I went back to the conference room, I noticed that she had moved her seat and was now sitting next to me.  Was it a coincidence? Possibily, but i think it was strange that someone would move their seat farther back, where the veiw was not as good as where they were previously sitting.  So in my opinion, the product was working on some level.</li>
            <li> Pherx cologne is the best thing i have ever tried .This product is great and i would reccomend it to several friends and family members</li>
            <li> This product did not have any effect on women at all.  It smelled like soap and it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Smell funny  like someones piss. i used it once and felt all day like i had dirty cloth on. not good.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice scent that is not overpowering.  Women like the subtle scent - yet this isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;Tear down the Walls - Get you lots of women&amp;#34; answer to scents or colognes.  You will get a few more women that notice you smell &amp;#34;Nice&amp;#34; which is a good conversation starter.  As with anything else - the rest is up to you.  Definitely better than an &amp;#34;Axe&amp;#34; body spray or Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Attract flies..!! Does not work..</li>
            <li> I was sceptical but it works. The reason I bought it was because I had done reasearch on pheromones. Obviously these guys know what they&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Smells horribly. Does not work either.&lt;br /&gt;I showed it to a girl and told her a family member had given me a cologne and she told me to throw it away cuz it was awful. Needless to say that she didn&#x27;t feel attracted at all.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks a bit short for full review. Not like I am going to mating spree every day...&lt;br /&gt;Though I used just one spray at a time it does work somewhat for me. I see a ladies a bit more open and friendly and easier to deal with. (I am a serviceman and talk with lots of people every day)&lt;br /&gt;Also it will evaporate and stop smell (at least for me) after about 4 hours. But it may do not mean much. Everyone is different men or women. Some just won&#x27;t feel pheromones at all.</li>
            <li> Nice scent to it my lady love it not greasy or oily, I would recommend it to my friends out there.</li>
            <li> I havent seen much change from my wife, but she did without her knowing I had it on said I smelled good. So far its working ok.</li>
            <li> the scent is something to be disired kind of a genaric scent i have purchesed the oil without scent[[ASIN:B004SO2SVI PherX Pheromone Oil for Men (Attract Women) - The Science of Attraction - 20mg of Human Pheromones]] and much happyer with that its not bad but i dont ware colone very offten so i might be bias</li>
            <li> Noticed  girls smiling and feeling comfortable around and tend to touch more often.. definitely adds to your personality..&lt;br /&gt;use it with your regular perfume ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rate it as good!!..</li>
            <li> I was always curious about pheromones so I  finally looked around and decided to try Pherx Pheromone Cologne. I was pleasantly surprised how good it smelled. I have only been using it for a about  a week  now and have really noticed a marked increase of attention from my female coworkers.  I would say give it a try. Shipping was extremely fast.  Overall for the money give it a try.</li>
            <li> Ive used it several times. Haven&#x27;t sensed much difference as far as attract more woman. Mabe it just could have been my surroundings. Not sure how this product claims its MO.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly. Spray bottle makes application quite easy.  It will take a while to determine the product&#x27;s effectiveness. I&#x27;m curious to compare it against pheromone oil.</li>
            <li> Used in a controlled physiology lab experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: inconclusive, but makes for a cool story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. smells a wee bit like DEET. Maybe use as mosquito repellent?</li>
            <li> Very nice and subtle smell. Noticed that women were more attentive around me as well as wanting to get closer to me.</li>
            <li> I have no objective means to truly access the effect of this product on women.  But I get the sense it works well - it&#x27;s easy to use - has a subtle but pleasant scent - and I do get the sense at times that it is a plus in interactions with the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> so far, a pleasant chemistry.</li>
            <li> I somehow feel like the formula/scent has changed. Maybe I ordered something different before. This one seems a bit more &amp;#34;misty&amp;#34;. The previous one I ordered was a little more oily which made it last longer and scent was much nicer. So I have to say this review is for the a previous order which worked like a dam love potion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times, but it seemed to make more women approach me at the parties I went to. Even ones I knew had boyfriends. Hopefully it continues.</li>
            <li> I would like to say that this product is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;100% work and also worth the money, we went to a party at the night when i got it, and the girls went crazyy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t second guess. Just buy now cause its either a placebo or this stuff works.  My wife thinks it smells good in a much different way than cologne.</li>
            <li> probably this is my first review ever, I think this product will not do too obvious effect. If you wear strong enough you&#x27;ll see that girls will be more willing to talk to you and pay more attention to you. ( generally, I don&#x27;t wear that much fragrance stuffs, so maybe to me strong enough might be the normal amount.) Anyways, it&#x27;s a interesting cologne to have, you will see the change.</li>
            <li> This item does seem to loosen the ladies up around me. Even women who don&#x27;t really like my look (masculine, muscular, rough around the edges) and prefer more feminine pretty boys seem to approach me as well. Pheromones do work, an this product is an effective pheromone.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered on time and in perfect condition. However, I have had no results at all. I wonder if its just cologn without pheromones.</li>
            <li> The ladies are defiantly giving me a second glance when I go out wearing this. Even my lady friends complement me on how good I smell. This is a good product that really works.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it. and I love it. really works and really does great as said. Love it. and recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> as advertised. good price.</li>
            <li> I really put this product to the test and my girlfriend didnt know I purchased it. The first night I wore it I deffinitely could tell a difference. She wouldnt leave her hands off me and she is never an initiator!! Also, the cat, (which doesnt even like me) was rolling on me. I dont know if it has anything to do with it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product,I wore it on the bed for my girl friend and she did not allow me to sleep for the night at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She had been in great excitement during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pheromone had great influence on her definitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> So I get the cologne and it dosen&#x27;t work, right out of the box new. The bottle came to me half empty,and wet. You can&#x27;t get a refund either, it&#x27;s considered hazardous to ship. Funny thing is there wasn&#x27;t any hazard shipping labels on the box. So I got half the product at full price and can&#x27;t spray it on. The plastic nozzle leaks, too bad. So from my experience ( see other reviews) Chikara Cologne for men is the best both by packaging and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> This products works well but I really don&#x27;t like its scent. Hopefully the scent gets removed so I can wear any of scents I like.</li>
            <li> When I first read about this product I didn&#x27;t have much believe in it. But decided to try based on many online reviews... And it really works. I got a lot of compliments from women the very first day when I start using it. I could definitely see the difference on how women behave near you when you have such an awesome smell. I would definitely recommend to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Just try and you&#x27;ll see the difference!</li>
            <li> I bought this with skepticism but was pleasant surprised by the reaction from my wife.  She has been a lot more flirty since I&#x27;ve been using this!</li>
            <li> I had never heard of using products like these until recently and I decided to give it a shot. The first day I used it I did notice more interactive conversations from women in comparison to the usual small talk I receive from acquaintances. I haven&#x27;t tested this product out completely, it could have just been a fluke. The next day I did not wear it and I received the normal amount of attention I usually get, whether it is the product or just my confidence I am still not sure. However, there have many been days prior to this product that I had confidence and I still wasn&#x27;t given as much attention that I received that day. I definitely think this product maybe on to something.</li>
            <li> Fake all not true. I have tried it and i gave it to different people to get their feedback but non of them notice any good results.</li>
            <li> Smells strange.  Very strong alcohol smell too.  Not a fan.  I like the oil better.  I won&#x27;t order this again.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it seems to work pretty well so far.</li>
            <li> i just got this 2 days ago, i sprayed some on and had a female friend come over, i had just made some enchiladas so the kitchen was smelling greasy, anyways as soon as my friend walked in, first words she said were: \\&quot; it smells good, what is that? vanilla? \\&quot;  i was kind of amazed cause it definitely  did not smell like vanilla, i also did notice she would stare at me more, and she would keep making more eye contact, also at work i did notice female co-workers seemed nicer and more talkative, i dont know if its the spray that works or its a placebo effect, but for now i do think it has some effect, it does smell good as well, almost a light musk smell, i will keep trying and update.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m married and my wife gave birth about 2-1/2 years ago. Since then she has lost her interest in romance at that \\&quot;intimate\\&quot; level. After many many months of not being receptive to romance, I was interested in testing the product which just arrived. Well I did a quick spritz and left it at that. That next morning I was pleasently surprised to have a uninterupted minute of romance before our child came around...I&#x27;m curious if statistically I was just lucky. I&#x27;ll have to spritz again one night when we can enjoy some quiet time to see if PherX is really making romance come alive...</li>
            <li> Love the product works like it says!  Will buy again for sure!  It&#x27;s great for going out to the club and bars and will get you alot of female attention.</li>
            <li> Did not know what to really expect from this product, so my expectation where low and I am a very skeptical person.  I have only been using this product for about two weeks and so far I would say it really works.  I am married, so I really just wanted to see how my wife would respond after applying it.  Would her mood change, would her drive increase? I have found that just applying during the day does not change much.  But for the best results I found apply a little at bed time and let it work its magic.  The next day I found things to be much different.... and for the better.</li>
            <li> This item came in the mail very quickly, only took about three or four days. Sealed very well and protected. I used it two nights later prior to going out, it has a nice smell on it&#x27;s own, and applied to neck etc, but I also sprayed some cologne on my chest as normal, needless to say it seemed as if it worked! Using very sparingly, maybe I&#x27;ll try a little more next time as it just sprays out so you don&#x27;t use too much anyway, hoping to get a good 6 months or more out of this product. Thanks very much, will buy again!</li>
            <li> The product works great I can already tell that I am flirted with more and girls show me more attention.  Could be just mine but my bottle leaks if it is stored upside down, but besides that it works great!</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product more or less for the fun of it and to see if it could actually work. To my surprise it smelled very good so I put it on and went to work. I had been talking to a girl I worked with for about a month and I could never tell if I was in the friend zone or not and after wearing this product, I can say with confidence that I am no longer in the friend zone.</li>
            <li> This Cologne doesn&#x27;t work!!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I had women falling over to get me (and I don&#x27;t want them to as I&#x27;m happily married) but I can say the wife does appear to be more touchy feely when I wear this.  Placebo affect, I don&#x27;t think so but who knows - however I will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be unhappy with the results the attention is excellent.</li>
            <li> This product really works!! It smells great and when used it makes you attract women. Before I went out the other day I sprayed some of this on my wrists and neck and u can really tell the difference!! Girls notice the smell instantly!</li>
            <li> To be honest i purchased this item as a joke amongst friends! But to my surprise i actually saw a difference in the way women reacted around me! Not only did it boost my confidence around women, it seemed like it helped women feel like i was more approachable. Really great product! 4 stars!</li>
            <li> Stop showing this in my &amp;#34;buy it again&amp;#34; recommendations!</li>
            <li> I was curious about pheromones, so I decided to purchase this product just to try it out.  It was shipped fast and I got it just three days after ordering.  The smell is pleasant, not overpowering or potent.  I&#x27;ve worn it a couple times and haven&#x27;t noticed any real change in people&#x27;s behavior toward me.  I want to believe that it works, but as a man of science, I have yet to see proof that it does.  Nevertheless, this product smells pretty good and I plan to continue testing it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased and impressed with PherX&#x27;s scent.  Many pheremone products have an extreme musk to them.  PherX is lighter than all of them.  I have to say, I surprised my girlfriend at work and she lit up.  She said \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know what it is, but you look hot today.\\&quot;  Ha!  I love science.</li>
            <li> This is a Great product! Worked just as described. Even If the Pheromone part doesn&#x27;t work it atleast gives you confidence.</li>
            <li> I cannot confirm for sure that the product works, but I feel that women feel an increased attraction to me while wearing the product.  I notice women checking me out more often and I feel an increase in confidence while wearing.  Once again I cannot confirm for sure, it may just be psychological, but at the end of the day the product certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt or ruin your chances with the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> Nice to try once and then up to you.&lt;br /&gt;I personaly like this product. can be used in party or office or anywhere where you feel its required.</li>
            <li> This product really seems to work. I used it only once but it seemed that the females were much more open to conversation and made more eye contact. It may have been coincidental, so I will test it out a few more times to make sure.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, got it before expected, product so far so good, I may update my review after a while of using it to give details about result..... a+</li>
            <li> Great product ,I have had several women walk up out of the blue and introduce them selves. First day and very positive results so far.</li>
            <li> There is nothing to this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money on it. Plus it is considered &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; by Amazon so returning it is basically impossible.</li>
            <li> Hahaha! It was fun to experiment and see that it didn&#x27;t work at all just another thing to prove science of attraction wrong. I&#x27;m always around chick&#x27;s none of them got close or even talk to Me i am incredibly shy but no I didn&#x27;t see anything new. good way to make a living thou.</li>
            <li> At first I just wanted to try it for laughs and where it around the office, but i realized most of the women the i didnt really talk to started coming up to me and asking how my day was etc. And the more i wear it the more i feel women look at me.  I feel like it mentally helps me talk to women and that women want to talk to me. I really think it works, Also five drops seems to be a good amount.&lt;br /&gt;Men i really recommend trying it for yourself and experience what i had, a good ass time with the hottest brunette in the office.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and gets you a lot of smiles and hello&#x27;s from the lady folk!!</li>
            <li> Product did exactly what it was intended to do. I plan on using this product with much success in the future!</li>
            <li> This product will not make women tear your clothes off, but it will definitely get them to bring down any defensive walls. I notice when I use this that women are more willing to accept conversation engagements or may even place themselves to be in a conversation with you. That&#x27;s really all you need to expect out of this product, and totally what I wanted out of it. Definitely a buy is this is the result you are expecting. Anything more, then you may want to consider paying a dating coach, haha.</li>
            <li> Seems good! I love the smell, hopefully it will work for me soon, I just haven&#x27;t had a ton of opportunities to try it out yet. It smells amazing though...like expensive cologne.</li>
            <li> Does nothing smells ok but in no way does this do what it says it does.This is a fake product and needs to be taken down false advertisement.They got my money don&#x27;t let them get yours over a hope women will be attracted to you it&#x27;s all a lie and a big one at that.Good luck hope this comment helps someone.</li>
            <li> good smell. It makes me feel more confident/</li>
            <li> dont buy this product its a scam</li>
            <li> It works! Great product!</li>
            <li> this product nreall helps ,i am glad to have tried it and will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> I was hoping this stuff would work, it does not, it also has a funny smell that kind of burns my nostrils</li>
            <li> A waste of time and money ,it&#x27;s not working for me .is there a money back guarantee? ??????</li>
            <li> Scientific fact scientists have not discovered a sex pheromone. It doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t exist but I promise it&#x27;s not in this bottle. If it works it&#x27;s because it makes you believe more in your abilities. Not a bad thing but if your sceptical it will not work at all. If pheromones do exist in humans we probably cover them up and maks them with all the other smelly stuff we put on. I have actually had much more success after switching to unscented products and lengthening times between showers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the hype!  Just eat right. Exercise. See a doctor if there is a &#x27;issue&#x27;. The product is just a fad.</li>
            <li> Who knows if this product works, there&#x27;s too many variables, but I like the smell. It mixes well with other colognes and adds a little spice. I feel like I have seen better responses from women (but who knows if that&#x27;s the placebo effect). But if you want to take a shot, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> So I have tried Pheromone products in the past and never really saw any results. Today I tried PherX for the first time and I have to say I am really pleased with the results. I rarely have any success with the ladies but this stuff was magic. I picked up to girls in the city and got numbers. For me that has never happened before so I have to say this stuff works. The product doesn&#x27;t really have a smell so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest just using it as a cologne but if you are looking for that extra edge I would have to say order a bottle of this stuff asap.</li>
            <li> I was a shy, awkward kind of guy. However, this product worked wonders for the ladies attraction to me. All the girls were coming up to me and talking to me.</li>
            <li> Recently got this in the mail and have had pretty good responses so far.  I put a spray on each wrist, one on the neck, and sometimes a little behind my ears.  I am not sure whether this is the placebo effect or not, but I have been pretty confident when I spray this stuff on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it works as well as for you too.</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff on and I immediately noticed the results. Women were definitely more attracted to me. I can&#x27;t believe how good this stuff works. I love the scent and obviously women love it too. I&#x27;ll definitely plan to order more.</li>
            <li> My wife appears to act positively to this product.  She is totally unaware that I&lt;br /&gt;Purchased it.  I can&#x27;t say why it works, it just does.  One bottle just will not be enough.&lt;br /&gt;Mark me as a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> This is a scam. I have had this and used it for a couple of months now and it never worked. One week after I received this in the mail, I got an email from their Customer Service requesting me to leave a good review of this product on Amazon and promised to send me the PherX Oil for free. I started doubting the potency of this product right that moment. I have used both the oil and cologne for a couple of months now, they don&#x27;t work as you expect them to. They smell nice and that&#x27;s it. If I were to spend more than $30 on cologne then I would rather buy a branded cologne for that amount of money.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the Phermones really work or not, but my girlfriend definitely seems to be more eager to have some private time.  Whether that&#x27;s related to the phermones or not i&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely nicer than the other one PherX sells. It smells better and applies easier!</li>
            <li> I will combine this with my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> it is a great product and i love it. it has a nice smell and it does not smell too strong and gives people headaches. this cologne is great ladies love it</li>
            <li> I bought the pherx oil and was given this pher spray with it to try it out. I have to say, the ladies around me have become more &amp;#34;chatty&amp;#34; and with occasional bumping of shoulders. I did not change anything in my routine, take a shower, put your deodorants, some cologne, shave, look at the mirror make sure u look okay. I&#x27;d say I am satisfied with it. Will have to use it longer to better see if it is 100% working. There&#x27;s only one way to really find out... Go try it out.</li>
            <li> did not do a damm thing for me, its all a bunch of garbage, i don&#x27;t know how they get away with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Wear this thing and I have people kissing my ass for no reason, I got a lot of stare from girls, they can&#x27;t stop twisting their hair upon seeing me, some of them transfered into one night lay, hope you won&#x27;t be out of business, if you would, notify me so I can buy 100 of them and sell it to other chumps who have no success with women at incredulous high price.</li>
            <li> Wow!! This is the third product of PherX that I&#x27;ve tried and I love them all!! They all smell great!! And definitely work for me!! A lifetime customer!!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;It actually attracts women, when combined with a quality cologne, they will definitely notice your cologne and comment on it. And, it&#x27;s not that expensive on amazon.......</li>
            <li> I tried the pherx cologne with skepticism . To my surprise I couldn&#x27;t help but notice a little more intensity in my lady&#x27;s love making . I have to assume the stuff really makes an impact</li>
            <li> Great product... Since I&#x27;ve started using this product, girls are much more receptive to my \\&quot;moves\\&quot; and that has given me all the confidence in the world.</li>
            <li> Since I have begun using this product my girlfriend seems very intriqued about how much she is attracted to my masculinity. She makes comments about my virility---postitive comments filled with lust.</li>
            <li> This item smells very good and I do feel it does work. I can tell a differece in peoples reactions as whether to talk to me or not. Very good product, keep on producing it. Thanks</li>
            <li> The actual fragrance is a little bit odd or cheap or something, so I added a few drops of my favorite citrus aftershave. Now it&#x27;s great. I get a lot of smiles from the opposite sex when I wear this, from business contacts to waitresses. Also, it seems to be more effective on younger women, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive that there would be a musk type smell in a product like this.  Much to my surprise and delight it is a very nice&lt;br /&gt;scent that I would expect in a top of the  line product.</li>
            <li> This product smells nice. When it first arrived the pump was broken and I had spray pump that fit it and was ok. I&#x27;m not sure when I tried it that I got a false sense of security but women loved the smell and was very friendly. It did seem to make it easier to talk to women. I&#x27;m still trying it on and off. Will update</li>
            <li> It has a subtle scent that goes well with a light cologne or after shave.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not just for single guys, it&#x27;s also great for that date night with your wife too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young guy. I&#x27;ve always been rather quiet and shy, but when I wear this, my confidence is raised a LOT! It burns a little bit when you spray it on, but that dissipates quickly. I started getting more looks from the women around me. You won&#x27;t have women flocking to you begging to have sex with you, but it definitely improves your chances! It works best when you spray it on your neck.</li>
            <li> Now, let&#x27;s not think this is love potion number 9 and all women will drop to their knees for you...but the product DOES do as it says.  There was an actually recognizable difference from the amount of attention women I work with paid to me.  3 of the attractive girls whom I work with spent a significantly larger amount of time visiting me at the bar (I&#x27;m a bartender)...and actually, my tips were better too now that I think of it.</li>
            <li> If you are like me sometime in the past you&#x27;ve heard of attractant pheromones,or used them before,and maybe wondering to yourself,&#x27; ..do these things really work?..&#x27; While they are not a magic love potion that will make all the eye candy fall hopelessly under your spell,I do find that they have the ability to boost your own attraction levels,and magnify the range of chemistry between those who would share it.</li>
            <li> I received this product really fast. 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;It works.&lt;br /&gt;my boyfriend sprayed it on and so did my brother and my brother had 2 girls come up to him saying he smelled really good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before with limited but positive results, so I ordered some more from Amazon and got it yesterday and put some on when I went out to play trivia at the local pub. I am 46, but I&#x27;m well-known there by the younger waitresses who are mostly college students and am friends with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the waitresses who is a good friend only was standing near me and started playing with her hair while talking to me, a sure sign she&#x27;s attracted. We&#x27;ve only been friends before. When another waitress came up to speak to her, she actually started leaning into me and making hip-to-hip, leg-to-leg, and elbow-to-elbow contact with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d move my arm and she&#x27;d slide her&#x27;s over to continue touching!</li>
            <li> I have noticed females being more friendly towards me, and giving me more attention. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It works for me.  I seem to get more attention from women when I wear PherX.  This is especially true at dance parties when the women have more time to be around me and smell the cologne.</li>
            <li> You know I haven&#x27;t been able to tell if this works. I work at a school where there are many smells to compete with it. But as far as I know it does smell good. Perhaps i need to do some more testing. To complete this review.</li>
            <li> I have had a number of other products much like this one, but not nearly with similar results. I strongly recommend buying this and using it as often as possible.</li>
            <li> I had lot of doubts before ordering the product. But i ordered it &amp; totally like it. It smells good &amp; my girl friend love it a lot. I too love it !!!</li>
            <li> Will receive at 15 to 30 November 2012, but i receive this things at 13 November 2012. Just WOW!!! Thanks...</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work, waste of money!</li>
            <li> I tried this to entice my overworked doctor girlfriend into more lovemaking. She swears it&#x27;s NOT the pheromones, but we went from once a week to every other night. The day I started wearing this. I think it works.</li>
            <li> I am 68 yrs old, it is hard for me to be reviewing a product that is for the younger crowd!! But here goes. I have been purchasing this product for yrs at least 10. I can&#x27;t say if it has a effect on my wife, BUT!!!! we are still active in our love dept. Also anytime I can get my wife to talk or watch TV together and NOT her playing on her cell phone (candy crush)! Is a plus!! Whether it is the (PherX) or not I cannot say for my wife is not the elaborate kind of women! With all that I said here I can only hope (Amazon) accepts this review! I previously reviewed this product with 2 words (GOOD STUFF), was not good enough for amazon policies! Thugs that they are. BUUUUUUUUUUUUUt. The seller and I made a agreement for a free product  if I reviewed again. The seller shipped the free product as they promised, With that said here is my review. Martin</li>
            <li> i got this and it wasn&#x27;t as good as it seemed i tried this one and a few others  on different days this one was not as good as the other and then i brought my friend over to help rate it and she didn&#x27;t like is as much as the others  it smells great but dont work i also tried the oil in this product i give it a 5 she truned in to a freak cuddle with them and let them get close to ur neck maybe even kiss the area were it is and a few mins later sit back and enjoy lol but for the spray didnt help  so save ur money and get the oil</li>
            <li> It was a beautiful smile and you will definitely notice how girls going to be nice with you and talk with you. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great smell! The scent is just like a cologne!</li>
            <li> It is very good, we love so much !!!!!!!!!!11</li>
            <li> Seems to make &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; a little easier!! :)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t so sure what to think when I got this, I have never really used a cologne before but the allure of pheromone ones tempted me.  It seems like a small amount of product for what you pay but maybe this is how most colognes are.  Anyway, it smells good, I haven&#x27;t noticed any of the pheromone effects but I will keep testing an in the mean time I have a pretty good smelling cologne so I like that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how to &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; this. Smells kinda funny.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my wife, and a couple of other friends(didn&#x27;t tell them what it was) to see if it affected them in anyway, and they all said no.</li>
            <li> Product works well, I&#x27;m in sales and my clients are always far more receptive when I use it.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and every time I wore it, I seemed to attract the opposite sex. Smells good even as an addition to you&#x27;re usual Cologne. I highly recommend it for anyone, men or women.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product and used daily for a couple of week but I did not notice any results from this product.</li>
            <li> When I use this product it seems that women are more comfortable around me, quite a bit more talkative, and more intrusive of personal space</li>
            <li> I have been using PherX Pheromone Cologne for Men(Attract Women)for a few days now, but so far I have not seen any effect. The cologne has an OK scent to it, but I was a bit disapointed because the ingridients did not describe what phermone it contained.</li>
            <li> This product did not work as advertised, maybe snake oil would be a better name or antagonizer would be more precise, attracts old fat chicks with kids</li>
            <li> Ok, I just received this product on Tuesday. Very fast shipping by the way. But anyway, I work in sales and go into different offices all day. So I thought it would be cool to see if I got a reaction from some of the women I normally interact with. And it&#x27;s weird but I have to say it seems like this stuff works. I&#x27;m asking myself do I like better today, am I being more charming, confident, and maybe so but I doubt it. This stuff  seems like it makes women want to speak to you and smile. Some sort of comment will def happen the same day. It sprays out a good amount and I just mix a little cologne with it. I think it smells pretty good by itself. I haven&#x27;t gone out to a club or bar or anything.. Just bc I don&#x27;t want to but I did have some company and it was a nice evening haha. Anyway that&#x27;s it</li>
            <li> Long lasting fresh scent - I like it just for that !</li>
            <li> Seems to have desired effect as far as I can tell, will definitely leave complete review at a later date</li>
            <li> nice item. has a great smell. i bought it because i have a buddy that uses it and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Bought this and tried it. You can tell women feel more comfortable when the around me when I&#x27;m wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;You have to apply it constantly as it looses it smells, the oil based one is the one I much preferred.</li>
            <li> Best buy, great product.&lt;br /&gt;I keep buying more. Good buy and good experience.&lt;br /&gt;I will enjoy what I bought</li>
            <li> It did worked. My girl friend like it. I won&#x27;t guarantee anything but what I experienced I feel that it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> I have used PherX oil before and I really liked it. I am pretty sure it works in the way it says it does, plus it has the added benefit of boosting your confidence, which is also helpful. I really like this sprayable form because it is easier to apply, and I also like that it is very mildly scented, so that I can use it along with any of my favorite cologne and it does not ruin the smell, but rather compliments it. It is a really mild scent. I think i will be getting the spray over the oil in the future.</li>
            <li> I like the spray more than the oil,  I&#x27;ll go thru a bottle about once a year. The scent may have changed since my last order but i still get amazing result with the ladies :)</li>
            <li> Not bad at all for the price. I get a lot of attention when wearing it out at clubs. good deal</li>
            <li> has helped a little! smells like after shave. but overall nice smell. I got it as a gag gift for my friend, he liked it too!</li>
            <li> I bought these product recently...not 100% sure about the efficacy of the product yet but seems like it works for most people. The company has great customer service. Answered the question, resolved the issues promptly. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The product is so amazing!!!! It works like a charm with most women but not all women are the same so don&#x27;t expect attention from all ladys.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this just for the hell of it may have been me but there were no noticeable differences with the ladies towards me. Product was however shipped and received quickly.</li>
            <li> yes it product worked</li>
            <li> As for the smell of the product &#x3D; pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still in the trials phase of seeing if I can notice it producing a stronger attraction in the opposite sex...will report back later.</li>
            <li> I have noticed nothing using this as opposed to regular cologne or even just deodorant. Take my word for it, take a shower! It works just as good if not better and girls tend to like that.</li>
            <li> Just bought this, you&#x27;re betting off going to buy some quality cologne. Yes this product has a scent that is somewhat enticing, however, it doesn&#x27;t stick in you, females, including one of my close girlfriends saw little or no difference.</li>
            <li> Not sure that I&#x27;ve noticed any difference in wearing this product over any other good cologne I&#x27;ve worn, but I can say that it does have a pleasing scent, and I will update this review if any noticeable effects do really reveal themselves from the pheromones.</li>
            <li> This pheromone looks to be among the few effective one. It can literally serve as a fragrance while attracting your girlfriend. I have tried it with my girlfriend and we are both happy with the results. It will be best used on erogenous points of body. It also does last for a good while. I will update this review once I used the product more.</li>
            <li> Was not a show stopper,,, but it is real. in between 2 or 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This cologne is great it smells really good. The girl Iv been after for a long time really liked it too. She couldn&#x27;t get enough of it. It was great. We have been on and off for years. Now we are deffinetly on</li>
            <li> I really like this product. the first day it was applied I had people talk my ear off and I hardly got anything done at work .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any different reaction of people around me</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much when I bought this but I am pleasantly surprised. I think the product smells nice. I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This product. Could have used. More kick but. It was easy to apply I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference. In attention</li>
            <li> This item is amazing. working 100%&lt;br /&gt;Try it you will be happy&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised when i use it for first time it was wonderful</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. Ive noticed a difference in when I put in on. Smeels good and blends in with your natural scent.</li>
            <li> PherX definitly works as advertised. It has a uniqe, long lasting, mild fragrence that adds the element of attraction and an overall scence of confidence. I would recamend this product to anyone looking to get a little more out of the art of scent accesories.</li>
            <li> Works all the time.&lt;br /&gt;By far one of the best products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it had a bigger size though.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try since I couldn&#x27;t decide on a mainstream cologne and have read other good reviews. I can&#x27;t be sure on its actual &amp;#34;effects&amp;#34; but I love the scent regardless. I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> The PherX Pheromone Cologne for Men has a noticiable effect.  Conversations with women start spontaneously and in a friendly manner.  What happens after that is up to you.  I recommend this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I tryout it that be good and cool&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again when I done it.&lt;br /&gt;Smell of this product is ok too&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and delivery be good and fast to me.</li>
            <li> This product works in two ways...the first way is that it relaxes the people around you so they feel a certain amount of comfort around you and the second way it works is by boosting your confidence and making you more talkative...its hard to explain but when you try it you will know what I mean....you will get more smiles...and people staring into your eyes with this for sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a show stopper by any means but, I have noticed the wife being a lot more touchy feely and wants to be closer to me all the time so I will in fact buy again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooooo good like a magic . I used a few  times amd working every single time . always end with a wild atraction</li>
            <li> Nice clean and pleasant scent. I normally wear it with a splash of my other cologne. I really didn&#x27;t buy to attract other women, just wanted to see if my wife noticed me smell different and possibly pay a little more attention. This is the first time buying this type of product and I&#x27;m still in the testing phase. I&#x27;m very happy with the results so far. Recently the company sent me a sample of this product in the &amp;#34;Oil&amp;#34; version, the smell is much stronger so a little goes along way. I recommend trying the oil, it lasts all day and smells great.</li>
            <li> The product has a pleasant smell once it settles and made me feel more confident. It may be a plesabo effect but it definitely contains the human pheromone. i put generally 3 sprays to get a a good reaction. its a great product to buy if ur just starting off!</li>
            <li> Tried it with wife.  Didn&#x27;t see any glaring positive results.  the scent is decent.  Not over powering, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve order this product and been using it for a few days now. This product does work. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the illy all the girls in the club wana rub and tug on my rug if you know what i mean</li>
            <li> Quick shipping... received it before the shipping status said it has left the facility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for if it works... I am still on the fence about it. Someday it seems to have more of an affect than others. The smell is not so great and would prefer if it was unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only been using it for a short time, so I will try to update this review if I notice any  major affects. I am experimenting with different people in different situations to see just how close you need to be for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good. I have yet to really see any results, but I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
            <li> I tried the spray and was told it smells great. Also, I did notice an increase in confidence... I hope to have more of an reaction when I go out to parties.</li>
            <li> My classmate (girl) keep asking me what perfume I am using. I told her \\&quot;SECRET\\&quot;. I know its not the perfume which attracts her but the PherX Pheromone Cologne I recently bought.</li>
            <li> Smells good.  Only have worn it twice now and I can&#x27;t quite tell yet.  Something seems different with the women I talk too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the spray works or not. I have been wearing it around lately, but it seems that you need to be close for them to smell it. I did ask a few girls to smell it straight out and nobody has said it smells bad. I actually have trouble smelling it, I just get a very faint sweet smell. The girls that have smelled seemed to be noticing it more than I do. I haven&#x27;t had anybody be overly aggressive, but I do seem to get more attention. Its not a magnet, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt. I&#x27;d say try it for yourself, like always results may vary.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok..it doesn&#x27;t last long on you but that&#x27;s ok just wear it when you know there&#x27;s going to be ladies around..and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at..</li>
            <li> It shows that really work I love it and the offers are incredibly good I&#x27;m almost about to buy a new one</li>
            <li> I got some of this stuff called PherX here on amazon . Not only did it work for me it worked great. The smell is nice not over powering . It got to me 3 days faster than the date i was given and i had to try some out so i put some on and went next door to see my single  neighbor . She was vary pleasant to me . she is not that nice most of the time and even ask me to stay and talk for a time . Something she has never done . I will be getting some more of this PherX !</li>
            <li> I have used both the spray and the oil. The spray has a light fragrance that is pleasant. The oil seems to have less fragrance and is easier to apply to pulse points. I can mix it with my favorite cologne and it does not interfere. The effect is subtle. It feels like people are more comfortable meeting me when I wear it. I think it is better to err on the side of caution and apply less rather than more. Some people might be sensitive to a strong signal so in that case it might work against you. Overall, I think there is a definitely an upside to this product and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered PherX 4 times and it arrives in a couple days.  Super quick shipping.  It works, too.  My social life has advanced immensely.  I have ordered a 3 pack one time.  My tip, save $20 or $55 bucks by ordering 3 or 6 at once.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first,then when i tried it for the first time i definitely noticed females being more social toward me and not having to exert any extra effort!and as for the smell i think it has a faint but fresh scent.definitely NOT offensive.and a little does go a long way,im jus finishing up my first and. current bottle...an bought it back in november &#x27;12!</li>
            <li> A simply brilliant product, wether you believe in it or not - it believes in you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haha, corny yes. Honestly though, you can&#x27;t argue with the results it&#x27;s given me. Even if it happens that humans do NOT detect pheromones, what is established as scientific fact is that placebos work. EVEN without you actually believing it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells manly, not like sweat, but ruggish. It&#x27;s a pleasant smell, kinda reminds me of my dad (in a non creepy way). I honestly believe the manish smell helps with women besides the pheromones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price in my opinion. Best of luck :)</li>
            <li> Very good smell.  Works well.  More intimate love.  Really attracts the women to come to you .  Very very effective. Hightly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product and several of the competitors comparable products and PherX is the best by far. Yes, I&#x27;ve gotten more attention from the opposite sex with other products but the other products I&#x27;ve used have either had a sweat odor that I could smell or just weren&#x27;t as effective. When used in equal doses over a period of two weeks time I had far more interactions using PherX.  I highly recommend this product and the added bonus is that it costs far less than the other brands.</li>
            <li> Definitely got some attention from some good looking women. Love it, we&#x27;ll worth the small investment. They also give you a free product if its your first time purchasing. Mad swag</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me at all. I kept spraying it and spraying it, and she acted about the same as if I wouldn&#x27;t have it on. It smells like bod man spray in my opinion, would give zero stars if I could .</li>
            <li> i have had no change when using this product gave it to my friend to see if he could use it he needed it more than me.</li>
            <li> Used at work and didnt notice anything new from co-worker. Im going to give this product another try and write another review.</li>
            <li> I purchased this \\&quot;on a whim\\&quot; thinking it&#x27;s only thirty dollars.  To be honest I thought nothing would be noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you,  that seems to really not be the case.  I have more random encounters with woman than I have ever had,  they seem to want to talk to me more and stand alot closer during the conversation.&lt;br /&gt;Gas stations,  grocery stores,  even doc office now seems to be a playground for attraction.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that you purchase this,  and it opens the doors for you as it has for me.</li>
            <li> They are fooling everyone with this. It doesn&#x27;t make any difference. I was way better before using this. Now hardly any girl talk to me after applying to this. Useless</li>
            <li> I was skeptical , but after a few days of using it, started to notice it working: Women , looking and smiling . I don&#x27;t know how this works but it does certainly , the weird part is that I got attention from women that are a considerable distance from me ( around 10 meters ) does the scent reach that distance ?? Anyway, I would recommend this! Note: As I said started to work after a few days using it. Cheers!</li>
            <li> DO NOT GET IT IT DOES NOT WORK. ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MONEY. GOT TOLD I SMELLED BAD, NOT GOOD! ITS A SCAM</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this just to see if my wife would act differently.  When I put it on it had the smell of CHEAP cologne.  That smell that takes your breath away.  My wife was actually repulsed by the smell.  People are either lying or we received a bad bottle.  It was a fun experiment but would not put this stuff on again for anything.  If people are paying more attention to you when wearing this PherX its probably because they smell you coming a mile off and want to go the opposite direction.</li>
            <li> Great product and chicks dig it. Great fragrance and doesnt require too many sprays.  Not bad for $30. Do you have a superenhanced version?</li>
            <li> Only 2nd day, so I&#x27;m still trying different doses. Product smells nice. 4 stars because, as I said, it&#x27;s a bit early in the process for me to make a call on its effectiveness. If you&#x27;re just starting with pheromones, the price seems about right.</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell. Don&#x27;t go overboard as it is a strong scent. Drys fast and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue behind. I&#x27;ve noticed increased attention from the opposite sex. Whether this is from the scent, pheromones, or the increased confidence it really seems to be working. Try it out.</li>
            <li> Does not have any affect on women, its like spraying water on your neck or whereever you decide to try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product over the past year and have received many compliments about the nice smell. I would recommend this pheromone as a stand alone cologne.</li>
            <li> I will say this about the product. It smelled nice and it made me more confident. My girlfriend liked the smell which I think might have influenced the effectiveness of the product. I would definitely mix it with some other cologne as the smell dissipates after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Looks and money aren&#x27;t everything.  Nor are clever one-liners and having a fancy sports car.  To find women interested in you, sometimes you don&#x27;t need anything more than the provocative scent of manly pheromones to get women to come on to you.  This happened before to me when I first tried and used PherX Pheromone Cologne.  Same now. When I walk into a supermarket or visit the library, women stare at me, smile at me, and sometimes even cast me that enticing glance that says: \\&quot;Come on over and talk to me.  I want you.\\&quot;  This I have experienced with PherX in the past, and it&#x27;s happening again with my second order of this amazing product.  So apparently, you also don&#x27;t need to join online dating sites or hang out at night clubs to meet women and really do nothing but just sit there and let them come to you.  This is what happens to me when I spray some PherX on myself.  So definitely, when something works, and works this well, I&#x27;m not going to fix what ain&#x27;t broken!  Nope, I&#x27;m sticking with PherX Pheromone Cologne.  You might want to as well.  You think?</li>
            <li> The smell is very nice, it makes me feel more confident around the opposite sex. Easily masked by another cologne. It seems to work well. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell to it. I have used it now for about a month and really didnt see a difference.</li>
            <li> Superb, This is a great pheromones by pherex. i have used different kinds of pheromones but pherex is absaloute. i reccomnded this for all. one time use you will love that have everytime use.</li>
            <li> I have to say I did doubt it much at first but the price was so good i had to try it. It is priced half as much as the normal cologne I wear anyway. The big difference is the smell,I have tried other pheromone colognes in the past and they were so heavy in smell. They were like an old gym bag, but PherX actually smells like a normal cologne. I did notice the first day how women seemed to get closer to talk to me in public places, I was at Starbucks the first morning and this older women was practically sitting on my lap to have a conversation. I have orderd more , it is priced well and would continue to use it . It was also shipped and delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product . I&#x27;ve been getting many compliments and attention about how I smell. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought this not telling my Fiance and she become more touchy-feely. It wont work miracles but I defiantly see a difference in behavior.</li>
            <li> This stuff does not work.  It&#x27;s a complete waste of money and is the ultimate &amp;#34;placebo&amp;#34; for marks like myself who bought it.  I saw no improvement.  It smells okay for a mild cologne.  I wish I could give it less than one star.  The oil of the same name doesn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> It worked great.it works great with my own Cologne and I had received alot of attention.thank you&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain how wonderful this product has been thus far. I normally am in the room alone where my wife usually is hanging out with the children watching tv. I did a test to see what the haps is all about. Well, lately, my wife is taking more of an interest in what I&#x27;m saying, &amp; will occasionally give me a soft pat on the hand. At first in my mind I&#x27;m like \\&quot;Yeah Right, a placebo effect huh\\&quot;. But then I noticed she keeps coming back to the room &amp; ask how I&#x27;m doing &amp; seems more friendly. Any other time it&#x27;s the kids or nothing. I&#x27;ll keep you posted on how things turn out, but I am noticing a more pleasant wife who actually is starting to appreciate my attention just as much as the boys.</li>
            <li> :smells good ,going to try it for a week , but would like to try PherX Pheromone Oil for Men (Attract Women) - The Science of Attraction - 20mg of Human Pheromones.</li>
            <li> I received the spray on time and in perfect condition. I&#x27;m mostly trying it out of curiosity and it seems to have good reviews. It smells good also. I tried it for the first time and seemed to get more looks from women. I can&#x27;t wait to try it again.</li>
            <li> After trying this product out for a while I have noticed being noticed a bit more. As others have said before, this isn&#x27;t going to fix all that is wrong with you and magically make all your women problems vanish, but you will at least get noticed more which could lead to something over not being noticed at all.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would have to be the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but not really a scent I would choose on purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Over all great product though, fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been able to use the product a few times but I like it. Can&#x27;t say for sure if it works or not but I feel like when I wear it I seem to strike the interest of females more often.</li>
            <li> I bought it to try it out and see how it really works. I sprayed it on at work (sweat a lot) and was surprised how long it stayed on and I was able to smell it on for almost the whole work day.&lt;br /&gt;I then tried it on at home with the girlfriend. To me it has a weird musky and yet sweet smell to it. I then put some on my wrist (be careful when pumping the bottle. It sprays pretty hard) and would then pass it over her face a bit while we were laying on the couch. I was surprised that she didn&#x27;t complain about the scent, (I can&#x27;t say if what happened next was because of the spray, since it&#x27;s normal in a relationship.) since she is sensitive to smell. I then tried it with cologne and she could smell the cologne but not the spray.&lt;br /&gt;Now she doesn&#x27;t know that I bought this, so I didn&#x27;t tell her about it.&lt;br /&gt;I then sprayed in on my wrist another day, while hanging with my friend (She is gay) and to my surprise she couldn&#x27;t smell it either. I then asked her two sisters to smell my wrist and to surprise, I got the same response from them. The boyfriend of one of them could smell it, so I am guessing that men are able to really pick up that scent but woman can&#x27;t, or at least as much as we can.&lt;br /&gt;Now I of course didn&#x27;t try anything on them, so I can&#x27;t say if they were aroused by the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I do know that animals give off pheromones and it comes to play more when they are in heat and from what I heard, it will work best when a woman is on her cycle. The smell is supposed to be sweat to them when they are menstruating.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to try this out when that comes around and then will see how this product works with that type of test subject.&lt;br /&gt;As of for now, it is a product that I would love to think works as it is supposed to but now to figure out, when and how to best use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps out..</li>
            <li> It does have an effect on women. They seem to be friendlier and more responsive than usual. This has a nice smell to it, but is gone in a few hours. If you go out bring it with you to respray. All in all I give it five stars because it is working, smells good, and shipped amazingly fast. Keep in mind that there is not a miracle spray out there to make every girl want you, because you have to do some work yourself. For instance good hygiene, having confidence, and being a fun person. That spray will get the girl, but the stuff I mentioned will keep her.</li>
            <li> We tested this and one other similar attractant over the course of a week.  Our jobs take us into office buildings routinely, so that was our main test.  3 of us (2 had an attractant, 1 had a control) went into offices over the course of that week, and noted any reactions we received.  At the end of the week we found out which one of us had the scents for those days. A few women were told about the test ahead of time to see if they could recognize any noticeable differences, and give us a different perspective.  The evenings were also tested, in restaurants and bars/clubs.&lt;br /&gt;We also had access to a K9 trained to locate missing people.&lt;br /&gt;Our individual notes, showed a little over half of the women, both in the offices and in clubs, reacted more friendly when we had the attractant on.&lt;br /&gt;Of the woman who knew about the test, all 10 picked the attractant out almost immediately.  Though only one acted any differently.  When asked about it, the majority of them said even though they &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; a curious reaction about us at that particular time, they knew it was a test, but that they also notice a difference from time to time in most men.  Some days more attractive then others, and it was rather normal.&lt;br /&gt;Several of the office men were also more talkative during these tests as well, asking mostly about an opinion on something, or requesting help with what we do for the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The K9 test was positive every time, although the handler said the dog didn&#x27;t hit strong, and acted unsure about what it located.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, both appear to have an affect of women, in that they can detect a difference, which did lead to more chatting.&lt;br /&gt;In clubs, when randomly talking to women, the attractant wearer was almost always the focus of the women when talking.&lt;br /&gt;But seemed to only be a sort of ice breaker.  It got their attention, but after that it was up to us to keep them interested.&lt;br /&gt;Trying to single out one particular woman didn&#x27;t do much, andworked better when a small group was gathered for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it does work to get the attention of a woman.  But is not a magic potion.  Women are not going to fall over with their legs in the air because you wore this.  It MAY give you a slight edge to get them interested, but you still have to able to talk to them comfortably to close the deal so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re too shy to talk to women, this is NOT going to help you.&lt;br /&gt;But, this might get her to turn her head for a moment, enough time for you to step up, and make your case.</li>
            <li> I got this item curiosly. I would expect in effect from this one. Bucause I prefer to make a relationship with opposite sex.</li>
            <li> Nice mild scent. I don&#x27;t know what sort of effect it has on females in regards to sexual attraction, but I have noticed that the women around me have been friendlier lately.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Amazon.com online and recived timely, this is awesome product. Its aroma is so fantastic that can really attrect women. I love to use this daily.</li>
            <li> At first results are subtle... But I started noticing the extra attention! It&#x27;s basically an automatic ice breaker&lt;br /&gt;But u might want to wear it with another cologne cuz it barely has a scent of its own</li>
            <li> Use it  at work, and I had a few girls get closer and said I smell nice..&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see where it goes from there</li>
            <li> I had only have it for a week.</li>
            <li> They turn to me with no effort made</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very mediocre man, but with alot of confidence to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently lost my girlfriend, whom I felt took away my confidence by being reserved towards me.  That&#x27;s not necessarily something that&#x27;s her fault, but I felt the hit when she left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this because I&#x27;m looking for ways to improve my confidence.  I think it just helped with knowing I&#x27;m worth a girl&#x27;s attention.  Placebo affect maybe....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, it&#x27;s all about the search for help and understanding, if this is what you&#x27;ve got to buy in order to continue that, please feel free to buy it.  It does smell nice!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just recouping after losing someone I liked alot....and someone else I loved.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty unique I guess, in relation to the hole in my life I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe just spend 6 months, half a year working out and restoring your confidence.....Your entire life can change in the span of 6 months with that kind of decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck men, and don&#x27;t let the craziness of life pull you all down!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;I think...\\&quot; part is due to the fact that attraction and the reasons for it are hard to quantify. There&#x27;s the placebo factor to consider in any such product, which is that a man who feels like he&#x27;s attractive is more likely to project that image, and women like men who have confidence. That said, what I&#x27;ve noticed over the past few weeks are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It smells good. The pheromones are masked by the cologne, which has a very good, masculine scent. I&#x27;d use this for the scent alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Women have been gravitating to me more than usual. They seem to get closer, stay longer, and be friendlier, even flirtier. I don&#x27;t think this is just placebo effect. In fact, I&#x27;d recommend using this with a little caution and only around the kind of women you want to attract. Based on experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer remarked that he thought a lot of the reviews of this product were either faked or imagined. I can only vouch for my own. However, one thing to understand is that pheromones like any hormones are very potent, and the reason they work in nature is that they&#x27;re potent at very dilute levels. Therefore it makes sense that the base of this product is something inert: water and alcohol. Wearing a spritz of straight pheromones be would ridiculous overkill. Animals don&#x27;t produce pheromones by the bucket, and they&#x27;re not designed to be used that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as mentioned above, a lot of factors combine to produce attraction. Using this product, as others have said, will not get women to shed clothing at your mere approach. This is just one tool in the toolbox. Other tools are required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells great; the ladies love it!</li>
            <li> It made me smell really good, girls love it, and my one gay friend haha, over all I would keep buying it</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say but as far as I was able to tell this product has no effect on women. I tried it both with my own cologne and without and both showed no reaction with women</li>
            <li> OK except the smell is strong!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t magic, let&#x27;s be real here. BUT I have noticed a slight increase in attention when I wear this out. Women seem to have a better response to what I&#x27;m saying in conversation and seem more interested in me. It definitely helps you feel more confident. Not sure why but I feel like it when wearing it. I&#x27;m an athletic &amp;#34;good looking&amp;#34; guy but haven&#x27;t had time to date until recently and was curious to see how this would do. Just remember, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This actually works, I noticed more attention and even some women acting nervous / aroused. The body language they had was a clear giveaway. It&#x27;s not magical like some seam to expect! I advise not to wear to heavy a cologne or body spray with it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t put my finger on it.  Smell is pleasant and subtle.  There is something to it.  Boosts my confidence and women seem more at ease.  I&#x27;m gonna keep wearing it....</li>
            <li> Quality! Can&#x27;t believe how this works, but it does!</li>
            <li> Need I say more? it smells like piss and it has other fragrances that make it hard to mix with other colognes to get a better smell. I don&#x27;t recommend. My friend bought some other pheromone colognes from a sex shop and it smelled much better so it&#x27;s not just pheromone colognes in general that smell bad.</li>
            <li> I have tried both Pherazone and this. I have to say, this is priced cheaper and works better. This is not magic, women won&#x27;t jump on you, but it does makes them attract to you, it does makes women behave nicely with you when they are around you. So, try it out</li>
            <li> have used other pheromone products and this one is comparable at a better price. would recommend to anyone wanting a pheromone supplement.</li>
            <li> I Received a $10 Certificate from this Company if I gave them a positive feed back, this is Very wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I think most of the feed back on amazon for this product was done by bribery .&lt;br /&gt;How ever I used this Cologne for the last 2 weeks, and I truly think the only one that notice it is me.</li>
            <li> Since using PherX for Men I have noticed that women are more positive and engaging to me. it gives you an edge, works best meeting someone for the first time, really adds to the first impression I make, most women size you up in about 5 seconds its either yes or no. Using pherX improves your chances</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars just because I personally think it smells good, maybe a bit subtle, but (like the oil) I think that is part of the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the title says, I&#x27;m not sure if it just game me confidence or actually attracted her, but seems to have worked. Met a super cute redhead for a first date this past weekend and wore the cologne. The first date ended up lasting 6 hours, nothing naughty happened, but we had loads of fun and she texted me the next day at lunch to say &amp;#34;Hi&amp;#34; and we ended up going out again that evening. And now 2 days later we&#x27;re going out a third time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great .... i gave it to my friend and he used it with his wife and he said &#x27; Cool &#x27;</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in the behavior of the opposite sex.  It has a very pungent smell that should be masked with a moree desirable aroma.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, easy to use, smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many co workers and girls noticed the new smell, told me it smells great! use it every day, lasts forever, and at such a low price why spend $100 on a perfume. The smell lasts all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would suggest anyone to use it!</li>
            <li> not sure if it really worked or not. I have been out of the game so long, I might have forgotten how to close the deal.</li>
            <li> This worked great the first few times I used it.  However I have found many women who seem to be able to resist it.  But all in all my results were very good.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and easy to wear. No headaches like some other colognes. People do seem to be very friendly and relaxed when wearing this product. Will order more.</li>
            <li> Wish I could write a positive review because i was hoping this product actually worked. And according to many on here it does, but I didn&#x27;t notice anything at all. It was shipped fast though. I received it in two days I think it was. Used it numerous times, but there was no notice change. It had a feminine perfume smell to it as well, but was easily covered up with the normal cologne i use. If you are thinking of purchasing this product, don&#x27;t let my review deter you, being as there are many it works for. Just didn&#x27;t work for me at all that I noticed. If for some reason something would change, Ill change my review to suit the changes</li>
            <li> It smelled decent, but I never got any compliments or enhanced attraction out in social encounters. I got way more compliments and attention using a Bath and Body Works NOIR body spray than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Get a bottle of that and try it out. You&#x27;ll thank me. Get the body spray over the cologne version though, it works much better. Here&#x27;s a link http://www.amazon.com/Bath-Body-Works-Collection-Deodorizing/dp/B003RY3RFQ/ref&#x3D;sr_1_cc_3?s&#x3D;aps&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1361563064&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3-catcorr&amp;keywords&#x3D;Bath+and+body+works+NOIR</li>
            <li> I purchased PherX Pheromone Cologne and decided to test it out just the other night at the local bar. I couldn&#x27;t help to notice increased interest as well as more openness from ladies. I really believe that this product works! It also gives you confidence knowing that you have biology on your side. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance. I was a little skeptical at 1st,  but after using it I would seriously recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this cologne, but I don&#x27;t notice any different reactions from women.</li>
            <li> It has a good subtle smell not over powering or funny smelling, which I was worried about.  I&#x27;ve notice a lot more smiles and conversations.</li>
            <li> I tried this product out of simple curiosity. I was curious about how it would work, and if it works, what reactions were to happen. The first day I wore it in the office, I notices all the women started saying hello, asking me about my day and week, what were my plans for the weekend and stuff like that. These were women that had never spoken to me before. Then, at the end of the day one invited me for drinks and at the bar 2 more girls were interested in me and hung around with us. This thing is great! It doesn&#x27;t pull panties down, but it definitely outs you in their radar.</li>
            <li> I had previously used pheromone colognes and additives from a well-known website, but had been put off by their customer service and decided to try elsewhere.  I found this product on Amazon and thought that at the price it was worth a try.  I have had mixed results with trying new pheromone products but was hopeful about this one after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew this product was a winner as soon as I sprayed it on.  It smells great.  I feel energized and much more confident while wearing it and my co-workers complement my wardrobe and my cologne when I&#x27;m using it.  One spray on my chest and another at a pulse point yields great results.  Used this way, the product lasts for a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all pheromone products, Pher-X is not going to make people throw themselves at you, and it doesn&#x27;t work on everyone.  that&#x27;s the nature of pheromones.  What you need to know is that this is a pheromone product that works as advertised, and if you do your part, (dress nicely, smile, act police, keep your teeth free of chives, don&#x27;t smoke and don&#x27;t over-do it with coffee) it will help others to notice all the good things that you have going on.  The rest is up to you.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the pheromones really work to attract women, however this product has increased my confidence when going into social settings.  It smells great and is a good cologne.  Not sure if it&#x27;s a placebo effect, but when I wear this cologne I feel that I have received more positive attention from people.  Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the review I got very curious and I decided to buy the product and test it out.&lt;br /&gt;This product has improved my chances to talk to any girl out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has worked for me am sure it can work for you too!!</li>
            <li> smells great not over powering at all. As for attractions of the opposite sex, it does get more looks but it could be cause of a sense of confidence. Idk but I like it I&#x27;d get this again</li>
            <li> This product actually works. I wore it on top of my cologne on a night out in the city. We visited some clubs and every time I was in close proximity of a girl, I commanded extra attention. Highly recommended :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this product last night and I already saw a slight improvement. The girl was all over me and everything seemed a bit easier than usually. I&#x27;ll let you know how things develop further.</li>
            <li> Product has been used once and appears to enhance social interactions. Smell is fine and could be used simply as a cologne - my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> You have to be in extreme close proximity in order for the scent to be recognized.  At that point you should already be closing the deal.  LOL</li>
    </ol>
