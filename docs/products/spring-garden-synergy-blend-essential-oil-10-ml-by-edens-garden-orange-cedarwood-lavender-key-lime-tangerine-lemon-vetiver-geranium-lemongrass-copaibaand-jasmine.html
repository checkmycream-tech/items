            <li>The bottle size is nice.</li>
            <li>Nice scent</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, but started to smell skunky.</li>
            <li>its okay but not one of my favorite</li>
            <li>for me the Ylang Ylang is too prominent which does not promote the &#x27;adoration&#x27; feel.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not in love with the scent</li>
            <li>This oil smells like potent herbs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of herbal ointment smell than anything.</li>
            <li>My favorite of the oils.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more Ylang Ylang and just a hint of patchouli.</li>
            <li>I love the blend.</li>
            <li>and I love that soap.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and it seems to be a quality</li>
            <li>I use all of Eden&#x27;s Garden aromatherapy oils - they are fantastic!</li>
            <li>Not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I use this in my oil burner and it goes a very long way and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>The packaging was good and it arrived fast  </li>
            <li>Has a sweet nice sweet smell.</li>
            <li>, however I was hoping for more or a Sweet Orange and Patchouli scent.</li>
            <li>i have many of the Edens Gardens blends which i really do love but this one i dont care for much and does not make me think or feel Adoration.</li>
            <li>It is more &amp;#34;flowerly&amp;#34; than I expected, but I don&#x27;t consider that to be anybody&#x27;s fault; I just mix more cedarwood and patchouli with it.</li>
            <li>I used it right away in one of my soaps</li>
            <li>Not as good as young living essential oils</li>
            <li>Very earthy!</li>
            <li>Love the combo of essential oils.</li>
            <li>Nostalgic and delicious.</li>
            <li>Nice scent to use in my lotion and other body products.</li>
            <li>I do feel the fragrance is nice quality,  and would buy other scents from Edens Garden.</li>
            <li>I expected more from its name.</li>
            <li>The aroma is strong, so be careful.  </li>
            <li>In general, I am pleased with this product however the Ylang Ylang seemed to over power the other oils.  </li>
            <li>I put a few drops of Adoration in it and not only does it smell better, it works longer too!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend if you like a soft scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to pick a favorite blend -</li>
            <li>this one, to me, smells like something i&#x27;d clean my kitchen with or is missing something.</li>
            <li>Subtle yet slightly sweet aroma gets you in the meditation mood.</li>

            <li> I was hoping for more Ylang Ylang and just a hint of patchouli. So it&#x27;s the opposite for me.  Gave it to a friend who loves patchouli and she loves it! I do feel the fragrance is nice quality,  and would buy other scents from Edens Garden.</li>

            <li> I use all of Eden&#x27;s Garden aromatherapy oils - they are fantastic! It&#x27;s hard to pick a favorite blend - they burn well, they ship well and they last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Has a sweet nice sweet smell. Not too overwhelming. I actually mixed it in with a Vetiver EO Deodorant spray. The deodorant worked well on it&#x27;s own, but started to smell skunky. I put a few drops of Adoration in it and not only does it smell better, it works longer too!</li>
            <li> Love Edens Garden! Also don&#x27;t have to shake like a mad woman to get a drop out! Thumbs up</li>
