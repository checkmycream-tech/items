            <li>Smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Reminds me fleetingly of Stella McCartney&#x27;s Stella which is a rose musk scent.</li>
            <li>Scent is mild &amp; pleasant.</li>
            <li>love love love this product</li>
            <li>My favorite at a bargain</li>
            <li>Be sure and rinse the razor well.</li>
            <li>This Age Defying bodywash and the Ultra Moisture shea butter bodywash are my favorite washes.</li>
            <li>I have used it many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>Will probably buy alot alot more of these for a while.</li>
            <li>love this body wash, and love that I can buy in a pack of 3.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin healthy and leaves me feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Would like to see more American bath and hair products that smell this nice, i.e. not of syrupy fruity berries.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and it really works for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using the body wash since receiving it and it has a nice light smell and think it is good for my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great everyday, all season, body wash.</li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference in my skin so smooth now.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also nice to get several at a time.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel soft and sexy</li>
            <li>Apparently, this is her favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>This is good to use daily and it helps keep skin soft</li>
            <li>and I take showers that are too hot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
            <li>On my 2nd bottle of this &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>The Age Defying Wash lathers well, cleans well and leaves your skin feeling clean and soft, unlike so many others that leave you dry.</li>
            <li>In other words it&#x27;s a total win.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have too much of a concern for that at the moment.</li>
            <li>HAha  </li>
            <li>Super product, I have been using it for quite sometime now and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li>Not harsh very moisturizing and no smell.</li>
            <li>I have used this body wash continually for the past eight years and I am very pleased with the results,  It leaves me feeling refreshed after my shower, and although I am 78 by skin looks as though I am much younger, according to the complements I receive from my friends.</li>
            <li>The shave is smooth, the face is less lined, and softer to the touch.</li>
            <li>After a shower, there is no greasy film left on your body, yet it feels really silky &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li>Which makes my skin feel like a baby silky soft skin.  </li>
            <li>and once in a while I try something new, I go back to Olay..</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, take showers that are hotter than they should be, and in the summer I spend lots of time outside in the sun and salty air.</li>

            <li> This stuff coupled with the Olay Quench lotions serve me well in very dry Middle East locations.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the new \\&quot;improved\\&quot; version of this product is _very_ fragrant.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> This body wash does not ever irritate my skin - instead, it soothes when I&#x27;ve been in the sun too long, or in the very dry winter months when the air is so dry</li>
            <li> Nop, it makes my skin very dry; and as per the age defying part, oh lord, it&#x27;s a scam!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this works for some other people</li>
            <li> I used this body wash for a while, and then had a hard time finding it in local stores.  </li>
            <li> I keep the unused portion under my sink as an emergency backup in case I run out of less stinky soap.</li>
            <li> Maybe some MBA genius decided that anyone who buys \\&quot;age defying\\&quot; products is old, and therefore suffers diminished olfactory sensitivity?  </li>
            <li> Makes me want to shower in flowers everyday!  </li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking that it would at least moisturize my body.</li>
            <li> You may find it less expensive in a retail store.</li>

            <li> Super product, I have been using it for quite sometime now and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 20 yrs.  and once in a while I try something new, I go back to Olay..decided to stick with it as nothiing beats this.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! it&#x27;s also nice to get several at a time.</li>
            <li> I have used this body wash continually for the past eight years and I am very pleased with the results,  It leaves me feeling refreshed after my shower, and although I am 78 by skin looks as though I am much younger, according to the complements I receive from my friends.</li>
            <li> This is a good-smelling body wash.  It provides a long-lasting good scent.  However, the age-defying part is just marketing.  Don&#x27;t buy it for that claim.  Shop around locally for pricing too.  You may find it less expensive in a retail store.</li>
            <li> Nice body wash very good for your skin.</li>
            <li> My favorite at a bargain</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel soft and sexy</li>
            <li> Yeah it works for both. Be sure and rinse the razor well. The shave is smooth, the face is less lined, and softer to the touch.</li>
            <li> This Age Defying bodywash and the Ultra Moisture shea butter bodywash are my favorite washes. The Age Defying Wash lathers well, cleans well and leaves your skin feeling clean and soft, unlike so many others that leave you dry. This stuff coupled with the Olay Quench lotions serve me well in very dry Middle East locations.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing body wash! Keeps my skin healthy and leaves me feeling fresh. I have sensitive skin, take showers that are hotter than they should be, and in the summer I spend lots of time outside in the sun and salty air. This body wash does not ever irritate my skin - instead, it soothes when I&#x27;ve been in the sun too long, or in the very dry winter months when the air is so dry and I take showers that are too hot. The product smells nice and is not at all overly perfumed. Great everyday, all season, body wash.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and it really works for me. I have dry skin and this helps leave it feel moist without leaving the shower or tub with a film on them. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Olay is an excellent  product.  I have used it many years.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice. Roses but not cloying or old-ladyish. Reminds me fleetingly of Stella McCartney&#x27;s Stella which is a rose musk scent. This body wash left my skin dewy. It&#x27;s not expensive. In other words it&#x27;s a total win. Would like to see more American bath and hair products that smell this nice, i.e. not of syrupy fruity berries.</li>
            <li> A must have - nothing comes close. Great moisturizing power and a great after- shower feel.. Good fragrances across the line but the Age Defying version is the best</li>
            <li> I have been using the body wash since receiving it and it has a nice light smell and think it is good for my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Award-winning, leaves skin moist, aromatic!</li>
            <li> good stuff, what else can I say</li>
            <li> On my 2nd bottle of this &amp; I love it. I was using the regular Olay body wash before then I switched to Dove because I heard good reviews but I didn&#x27;t like it so I ended up with this. I&#x27;m so glad I tried it. Scent is mild &amp; pleasant. I really noticed a difference in my skin so smooth now. I don&#x27;t have how anti aging it is but I&#x27;m only 31 so I don&#x27;t have too much of a concern for that at the moment.</li>
            <li> I have already written a review for this product!  This is the best and most moisturizing wash I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> I used this body wash for a while, and then had a hard time finding it in local stores.  It feels good on my skin, lathers well, and rinses cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find it online, though I noticed the packaging had been updated.  Unfortunately the new \\&quot;improved\\&quot; version of this product is _very_ fragrant.  Maybe some MBA genius decided that anyone who buys \\&quot;age defying\\&quot; products is old, and therefore suffers diminished olfactory sensitivity?  Whatever the reason, I have found the increased level of fragrance intolerable and no longer use the product.  I keep the unused portion under my sink as an emergency backup in case I run out of less stinky soap.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that they made an age defying body wash. I was just using the regular Olay quench. ABSOLUTELY love it!  After a shower, there is no greasy film left on your body, yet it feels really silky &amp; moisturized. Will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> This Olay Age is really good stuff!  Makes me want to shower in flowers everyday!  HAha  IT goes on eZ and wash off EZ.  You can still feel the moisturizing after you get out of the shower.  Which makes my skin feel like a baby silky soft skin.  Will probably buy alot alot more of these for a while.</li>
            <li> This is good to use daily and it helps keep skin soft</li>
            <li> love this body wash, and love that I can buy in a pack of 3. Still wish it was on the Subscribe and Save program, but Amazon took it off.</li>
            <li> Not harsh very moisturizing and no smell. I love it.</li>
