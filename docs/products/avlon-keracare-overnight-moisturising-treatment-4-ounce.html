            <li> Adds a lot of moisture to my hair and definitely will purchase again and again as long as this product is sold.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that when hair contains too much of any cream, it will dry to a brittle and hard texture.</li>
            <li> I ordered the overnight moisturizing treatment for my dry, dull hair and it really helps my hair look healthier.</li>
            <li> I used it overnight as instructed hoping my hair would not be as dry in the morning.  </li>
            <li> However, my hair always still felt dry.</li>
            <li> I have very thin relaxed hair, however, my hair is super dry.</li>
            <li> I put a little on my hair and some on my scalp even though it is not necessarily for the scalp.</li>
            <li> only a little is needed</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous deep conditioners, from the least expensive and natural to the most expensive ones out there.</li>
            <li> Not really noticing a difference between this product and any other night cream.</li>
            <li> Looks as if it had been opened it was melted and leaking out on the other two products that were with it</li>
            <li> I typically keep my product in a close drawer at room temperature</li>
            <li> , it is heavy though so</li>
            <li> I really think I had a bad jar but either way</li>
            <li> I not sure if this product works, I couldn&#x27;t handle the smell.</li>
            <li> I had the dried and frizzy cut off!  </li>
            <li> I do not like putting moisturizing creams in my hair because it weighs my thin hair down.</li>
            <li> ...this moisturizer is no good.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid that it would weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy because it is creamy, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick corse hair that is prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair is worse after using this product.  </li>
            <li> and I have never experienced that.</li>
            <li> Its actually been cold in the mornings here in Baltimore so it couldn&#x27;t have been the heat that make the product go bad.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping this is not a product of Affirm and that I was sold a fake version.</li>
            <li> This is awful, it dried my hair out and made it itchy!</li>
            <li> I think those products are bad in terms of expiration date or something.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> While I like the product the packaging was terrible.  </li>

            <li> OMG!!! My hair is worse after using this product.  I used it overnight as instructed hoping my hair would not be as dry in the morning.  This product did more damage to my hair.  It was so brittle  I was scared to use a comb.  I am hoping this is not a product of Affirm and that I was sold a fake version.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous! I have very thick corse hair that is prone to frizz. I used this in my hair, tied on my silk scarf and woke up with amazingly soft hair the next day! I was hooked after the first use and will always keep this product in my regimen. It smells amazing too like cinnamon custard.  My hair stylest told me about this product and I am so glad she did, now I tell all my friends about it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a 4.5. No product is perfect, but I REALLY like this. It has made a huge difference in texture and manageability. I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to use so much of it! My hair drinks it up!</li>
            <li> excellent product. Adds a lot of moisture to my hair and definitely will purchase again and again as long as this product is sold.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product is like any other cholesterol, though it has a better small. Queen Helene&#x27;s cholesterol is better. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> ...this moisturizer is no good.  I ordered it and it seemed fine.  About two weeks later it had separated.  the oil was floating at the top.  I really think I had a bad jar but either way, I sent it back!!  Its actually been cold in the mornings here in Baltimore so it couldn&#x27;t have been the heat that make the product go bad.  My hair is natural and I do not buy into all the natural hair products, but I like KeraCare so I thought I would try it but it turned out to be a flop.  If I want to do an overnight treatment, I just rely on my old stand-by which is Conditioner and Castor Oil, mixed; and of course I steam my hair but otherwise, this overnight moisturizer is not for me.  (May,  2015)</li>
            <li> Just discovered these products in the fall of last year.  When I started going to another Hairdresser that was much closer to home.  I try to use the overnight  oisturizing treatment---two times a week (sometimes I forget).  Makes my natural hair softer &amp; it has a clean scent, for those that are allergic or can&#x27;t tolerate perfume like scents.</li>
            <li> Excellent  product.  Keeps my hair moist and the texture  is soft.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product. I have very thin relaxed hair, however, my hair is super dry. I do not like putting moisturizing creams in my hair because it weighs my thin hair down. I have tried numerous deep conditioners, from the least expensive and natural to the most expensive ones out there. When it comes to my hair, I do not cut corners. However, my hair always still felt dry. So my stylist recommended this product and I bought it from the salon. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!! It hydrates my hair, keeping it super soft without weighing it down. I put a little on my hair and some on my scalp even though it is not necessarily for the scalp. I read some comments about the product separating. I think those products are bad in terms of expiration date or something. I typically keep my product in a close drawer at room temperature and I have never experienced that. Additionally, for those who says that the products make your hair more brittle, maybe you should try using less. I have noticed that when hair contains too much of any cream, it will dry to a brittle and hard texture.</li>
            <li> Experience hair breakage after use.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair moistured and hold the set overnight.  And is smells wonderful!!!  Will be ordering it again soon!</li>
            <li> Use every night...great for the hair.</li>
            <li> I read and was recommended to buy this product by my stylist but each time I order this product it was open from the company twice. So now, I have 2 open container and never use them. I really don&#x27;t know weather or not if they safe to use.  Amazon was good about refunding my monies twice but, I would have prefer the product. I heard it&#x27;s a great product !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> While I like the product the packaging was terrible.  Because the contents of the jar had separated (oily substance and crème) the contents leaked out of the container.  It looked liked it was an old container of moisturizer that was shipped.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great smell, leaves hair feeling very soft</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help with the moisture needed for my hair. Well its not a bad product and you only need a little to take you a long way. After purchasing another Keracare product (creme hairdress) I think I will go with this moreso than the overnight. Both products are very light on the hair and you will keep your body BUT the sheen and moisture in the creme hairdress seems to outshine the Overnight.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff on my natural twa, it helps my head to stay moisturized throughout the night with my other regime.</li>
            <li> I not sure if this product works, I couldn&#x27;t handle the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad it&#x27;s just a very strong overbearing smell.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery great product!</li>
            <li> I ordered the overnight moisturizing treatment for my dry, dull hair and it really helps my hair look healthier. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product!</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizing treatment several nights a week under my satin scarf and I wake up with my hair feeling really good.  I was afraid that it would weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy because it is creamy, but it doesn&#x27;t.  When I get up in the morning, my hair is soft and feels really moisturized.  Best of all, there is no mineral oil or petrolatum in it! It is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Not really noticing a difference between this product and any other night cream. (heavy/thick)</li>
            <li> great for restoring moisture in natural hair.</li>
            <li> Great product! I could feel the difference in my hair the moment I used it and the day after it was really soft, it is heavy though so only a little is needed</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It leaves my hair deeply moisturizer, and gives it a Natural shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 nights so far and it really had my hair looking hydrated the next day each time I use it. I really love this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t have your hair looking or feeling really greasy at all. Just feeling hydrated and looking silky smooth. Just remember to use once every other night high and not every night.</li>
            <li> Arrived really quick. I was kinda surprised to pick it up from the post office so soon. And I just love how soft it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> The cream in my jar had oil on top of the product. It looked liked it needed mixing up.I took a spoon and stirred it well. It seemed  to blend together a whole lot better afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is awful, it dried my hair out and made it itchy! I had the dried and frizzy cut off!  The other products in this line work very well.</li>
            <li> Looks as if it had been opened it was melted and leaking out on the other two products that were with it</li>
            <li> I love this product as I&#x27;ve used it before but the product I received seemed as though it was either old or had been exposed to extreme temperatures. The product ingredients are separated. I didn&#x27;t return it because shipping it back would incur additional money. I don&#x27;t want to pay more for this product.</li>
            <li> Noticable difference to my hair the morning after</li>
