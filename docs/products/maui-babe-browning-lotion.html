            <li>It&#x27;s so good and makes ur skin feel like ur19  again! ♡</li>
            <li>Plus it smells like coffee which is great since I&#x27;m not a fan of coconut</li>
            <li>Works GREAT as a moisturizer and they claim that the caffeine helps reduce the chance of skin cancer to form which is also amazing!</li>

            <li>Bought it for my vacation to Mexico &amp; we loved it.</li>

            <li>well i love it</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love that I can get it in the mainland</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m thinking it was more of a stain.</li>
            <li>But with this stuff its so easy.</li>
            <li>With coffee being a major ingredient..it has caffeine in it which is great for the skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really accelerates tanning, but it gives a nice brown tint when used.</li>
            <li>Came back to the US nice &amp; tanned!</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend for the type of person who either burns easy or loves to lay in the sun!</li>
            <li>, i&#x27;ve only had it for a day stayed out in the sun for most of the day and already see results</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>t. Booths.don&#x27;t really do sun anymore!  </li>
            <li>Natural results!!!</li>
            <li>Sticky- have to wash my hands after use as I can&#x27;t stand how sticky it feels on my skin; don&#x27;t particularly like the smell--smell like a coffee pot; seemed to tan</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally tan but don&#x27;t get out in the sun as much as I used to.</li>
            <li>only downside is that if not applied very throughly and evenly it will leave orange looking streaks that can be removed with some exfoliating</li>
            <li>Be careful when you first open because it squirted across the room!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who have a hard time tanning. But with this stuff its so easy. Plus it smells like coffee which is great since I&#x27;m not a fan of coconut (which is what all the other tanning oils tend to smell like) Its a combination of oil and a lotion.   I will never use anything else for my tanning needs!!</li>
            <li> Love this wonderful product! The smell is delicious especially if you love the smell of coffee. With coffee being a major ingredient..it has caffeine in it which is great for the skin. I brown in the sun with Maui Babe, instead of burn. Also great for a tanning bed lotion!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells a little weird but that&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m not used to rubbing coffee on my body. Works GREAT as a moisturizer and they claim that the caffeine helps reduce the chance of skin cancer to form which is also amazing! I would HIGHLY recommend for the type of person who either burns easy or loves to lay in the sun! But careful stains clothing... coffee...</li>
            <li> product works well i love it , i&#x27;ve only had it for a day stayed out in the sun for most of the day and already see results and it does not make me orange like other products i have tried will keep buying this product</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described. Does smell funny but not offensively bad. Natural results!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping. A&amp;#34;+++</li>
            <li> Awesome Tan w/this lotion!! Bought it for my vacation to Mexico &amp; we loved it. Came back to the US nice &amp; tanned!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best ever! ! 1/2hrs in sun.u look like u were in the islands for ever! U just look glowing! Im 55, don&#x27;t do t. Booths.don&#x27;t really do sun anymore!  It&#x27;s so good and makes ur skin feel like ur19  again! ♡</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally tan but don&#x27;t get out in the sun as much as I used to. I was hoping this would accelerate my color but although it seems to protect me well, it hasn&#x27;t impacted me skin tone.</li>
            <li> Favorite tanning/browning lotion! Love that I can get it in the mainland</li>
            <li> This stuff is well known to help you tan.  Well, whatever to that.  I found that if I put this on WITH sunscreen, then I am less likely to burn.  Hours in the sun can sometimes still burn ya despite SPF, but SPF combined with this makes me ALMOST unburnable.</li>
            <li> Sticky- have to wash my hands after use as I can&#x27;t stand how sticky it feels on my skin; don&#x27;t particularly like the smell--smell like a coffee pot; seemed to tan but I&#x27;m thinking it was more of a stain.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really accelerates tanning, but it gives a nice brown tint when used. I will order again.  Be careful when you first open because it squirted across the room!</li>
            <li> Love this product! This truly helps deepen your tan. If you are on the fence about this product, hope this helps your decision!</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion I have ever purchased for its price // only downside is that if not applied very throughly and evenly it will leave orange looking streaks that can be removed with some exfoliating Do invest in , great product!</li>
