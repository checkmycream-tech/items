            <li> but I think its too expensive and the rivet is becoming loose 1 week after using it.</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;ll go a long ways.</li>
            <li> After a few months of regular use, the rivet loosens and allows the pocket clip to rotate.  </li>
            <li> Just need to be careful with it</li>

            <li> Goes through my tough beard with ease.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I was looking for that for a while! good buy!</li>
            <li> Not bad, exactly what I wanted. However after only 4-5 uses the gold paint is already coming off. Which leads me to think it  will break sooner than later.</li>
            <li> I love this - I wish I could find the locally.  It makes carrying a comb so much easier, especially since I have to carry it in my front pocket.  I did modify it a bit - I put some silicone glue so that the clip wouldn&#x27;t catch on things anymore.</li>
            <li> Very cool comb. Has good weight and is perfect for my beard which by the way is really thick.</li>
            <li> I love this comb! But then again it&#x27;s a Kent. Long lasting,well made, you can&#x27;t go wrong! Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> nice and compact, although the teeth are a bit shallow. Easy to use, it&#x27;s a bit tight at first but it loosens up later (makes me worry about long-term loosening). I don&#x27;t use the clip for fear it might break, but I don&#x27;t need it anyway. Really completes the greaser look. Would recommend</li>
            <li> I use the larger Kent combs every day and always carry one of these for a \\&quot;touch-up\\&quot; if it gets windy.  The size is perfect and the sawed teeth are a definite improvement over the typical, cheap molded pocket comb.  The well designed folding cover keeps the comb fee from dust and pocket lint and always ready for instant use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb would rate \\&quot;5\\&quot; stars except for the single-rivet attachment of the pocket clip. After a few months of regular use, the rivet loosens and allows the pocket clip to rotate.  That can cause the comb to release from one&#x27;s pocket and simply disappear.  A minor re-design of the chip with (2) rivets would eliminate this tendency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I keep replacing the lost Kent pocket combs (I&#x27;m now on my third Kent pocket comb) so maybe it&#x27;s a designed-in feature to maintain sales of replacement combs.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Wonderful quality and craftsmanship</li>
            <li> My son loves it for his beard, so much that I had to order another when it was lost at a wedding reception.</li>
            <li> A nice looking tool that engenders interesting comments. Does a great job of combing my thinning hair as well (who&#x27;da thunk it?).</li>
            <li> Really like the product but I think its too expensive and the rivet is becoming loose 1 week after using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent comb. Would definitely recommend. Goes through my tough beard with ease.</li>
            <li> clip broker off three days after receiving it..</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a fine pocket comb and this one is amazing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay open very well when you&#x27;re combing. It needs to somehow be made so it&#x27;s stiffer when open.</li>
            <li> Great comb! I use it for beard and mustache grooming.</li>
            <li> Very useful. Just need to be careful with it and it&#x27;ll go a long ways.</li>
            <li> Excellent comb. It brushes my hair quite nicely and doesn&#x27;t poke or scrap my scalp. I highly recommend to gentlemen of all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ken</li>
            <li> Bought for Movember beard maintenance. Excellent and compact. Wish the comb was finer though.</li>
            <li> Very nice comb! work great, looks great and is of fantastic quality.</li>
            <li> Great foldable comb, I was pleased it came on time. Thanks feels and looks very smooth. I would recommend you buy this product.</li>
            <li> I think I use this comb daily. does a good job of staying clipped to my pocket too. would recommend</li>
