            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure sure how to use all of these tools, but was very impressed with the quality of them.  </li>
            <li>Would&#x27;ve liked tweezers included, but it&#x27;s still a good kit for the price.</li>
            <li>and I was able to read it, and use it immediately!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve filled the directions and have had great results.</li>
            <li>But here you can see the product below, it looks really nice and well presented.</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discounted price for this honest opinion and this will not change my view on these items.</li>
            <li>I use a warm damp cloth afterwards and apply moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The tools appear to be of quality material and effective.  </li>
            <li>Works great and price is right!</li>
            <li>The pouch is really good to keep the tools clean and arrange them neatly.</li>
            <li>, Iâ€™m sure you can understand.</li>
            <li>Surely one of the easiest ways to remove these annoyances from your skin.</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more for gifts for the holidays.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my hands and make sure to scrub my nails.</li>
            <li>The smaller, circular tools are best for whiteheads and blackheads.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic kit!</li>
            <li>Great high quality product.</li>
            <li>My skin felt very clean after using these tools.</li>
            <li>I am NOT a paid review just a real person looking for a good product.</li>
            <li>Using this kit prevents the whiteheads from morphing into full blown acne!  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle and use.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>I did not receive the free &amp;#34;how-to&amp;#34; booklet in my package</li>
            <li>The angled loop extractor is ideal for harder to reach areas</li>
            <li>Mine came free of defects.</li>
            <li>This whole kit is your best arsenal to keep your face blemish-free, or at least deal with them more effectively.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>After learning that that is a unsanitary and not the best way to get rid of blackheads, I invested in a cheap blackhead tool but was not satisfied with the outcome.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have to rate this right now, it&#x27;s gonna get 5 stars!</li>
            <li>The zipper on the case broke quickly</li>
            <li>These really are surgical quality and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>And, the owner of the company personally reached out to me to get my feedback and make sure I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and very useful.</li>
            <li>This will be worth your investment.  </li>
            <li>I was able to clear my pores completely so that they were able to heal faster with the help of antiseptics and face masks.</li>
            <li>They are safely and professional packaged with a discreet and streamlined design, so you can take them anywhere.</li>
            <li>I thought that it would always be too hard to use a blackhead tool extractor or blackhead tool remover, but after getting this set and using the easy to understand free guide, my skin has never looked better!  </li>
            <li>It came with a how to guide sent right to my email</li>
            <li>Had to make a special request to get the promised instructions emailed to me, but once we got the instructions, my wife really loves this tool kit.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I was kinda scared at first, thought I was going to have to do surgery on my face, but not at all.</li>
            <li>Deep, cystic pimples or more severe acne should be treated by a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that in the first place.</li>
            <li>Excellent set of tools to clear up those icky stuff on your face!</li>
            <li>They also arrived very promptly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be so much easier than trying to squeeze it with my fingers.</li>
            <li>The tools are very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>The tools worked very well at getting the impurities off my face.</li>
            <li>But they haven&#x27;t rusted in the month I&#x27;ve had them, and they are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Seemed to be made of high quality stainless steel.</li>
            <li>Kind of not sure what to do with these but some help and others feel like a blade on my skin.</li>
            <li>I did not know there were so many different types of remover tool and for different uses.</li>
            <li>The point on the pointy tool isn&#x27;t especially pointy, but it can certainly be sharpened.</li>
            <li>I have ongoing adult acne problems and don&#x27;t have the option to just leave it alone until it heals every time, not only is there too much</li>
            <li>Professional look</li>
            <li>Open up your pores (hot shower, steaming face, or hot wet towel for 2-3 minutes)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Place it around the target area and gradually apply pressure until the sebum (oily secretion) is completely removed&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and have severe scarring on my face.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday on a clean face, especially on both sides of my nose and chin area.</li>
            <li>I just applied pressure and scraped a little with one of the bigger loops and it came right out.</li>

            <li> With these, aside from the fact that you&#x27;re avoiding getting any further dirt from your hands into your pores, it&#x27;s also a million times easier to clear your complexion of any blackheads, etc in a few swipes.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve been dealing with blackheads for a very long time.</li>
            <li> If the whitehead doesnâ€™t pop, carefully use the Lancet/Spoon Extractor</li>
            <li> No instructions included, though the seller did send a message with some minimal instructions attached.</li>
            <li> I found this Blackhead &amp; Blemish Remover Tool Kit to be quite handy when it comes to removing these annoying pimples and blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other then</li>
            <li> No doubt itâ€™s hard to keep it that way when these pesky blackheads keep coming back.</li>
            <li> The black case keeps all your tools together and organized.</li>
            <li> A small, sharp lancet&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; Puncture whitehead to release the sebum&lt;br</li>
            <li> But when I was young, I never learned the correct way to remove them and just carelessly squeezed it with my fingernails.</li>
            <li> If sebum is not easily being released, refrain from over-attempting as it may lead to scarring.</li>
            <li> A small spoon with a hole in the middle&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to put, but they work.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointing, especially when it&#x27;s one of the bullet points in the &amp;#34;about the product&amp;#34; section.</li>
            <li> My face is definitely bound to grow a few ugly ones.</li>
            <li> They squeeze out all the dirty things clogging up your pores in one go.</li>
            <li> I donâ€™t want to leave a picture of the nasty situation</li>

            <li> Great quality and great value.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the free &amp;#34;how-to&amp;#34; booklet in my package so I&#x27;m going to have to read online about how to use the tools properly. A bit disappointing, especially when it&#x27;s one of the bullet points in the &amp;#34;about the product&amp;#34; section.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve been dealing with blackheads for a very long time. Always looking for ways to remove them and keep my face looking healthy and beautiful. No doubt itâ€™s hard to keep it that way when these pesky blackheads keep coming back. With all the stress of having 5 boys, working from home and of course taking care of the house. My face is definitely bound to grow a few ugly ones. I found this Blackhead &amp; Blemish Remover Tool Kit to be quite handy when it comes to removing these annoying pimples and blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have to rate this right now, it&#x27;s gonna get 5 stars! It came with a how to guide sent right to my email and I was able to read it, and use it immediately! I donâ€™t want to leave a picture of the nasty situation, Iâ€™m sure you can understand. But here you can see the product below, it looks really nice and well presented. I was kinda scared at first, thought I was going to have to do surgery on my face, but not at all. Surely one of the easiest ways to remove these annoyances from your skin. Youâ€™ll just have to be the judge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a snippet from my blog and you can read it over here: http://sosmartreviews.com/blackhead-blemish-remover-tool-kit-review/</li>
            <li> This is the best blemish remover kit ever. I grew up with lots of blackheads and pimples. But when I was young, I never learned the correct way to remove them and just carelessly squeezed it with my fingernails. After learning that that is a unsanitary and not the best way to get rid of blackheads, I invested in a cheap blackhead tool but was not satisfied with the outcome. So when I got this remover kit, it was life changing. I did not know there were so many different types of remover tool and for different uses. I can&#x27;t believe that I never knew and purchase these products before. They squeeze out all the dirty things clogging up your pores in one go. This will be worth your investment.  I received this product at a discounted price for this honest opinion and this will not change my view on these items. I will recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Works as it should.  Very good quality.</li>
            <li> Had to make a special request to get the promised instructions emailed to me, but once we got the instructions, my wife really loves this tool kit.  She says it does everything she needs.</li>
            <li> The tools seem to be of very good quality. I have just used one of them since i got it 3 days ago. The pouch is really good to keep the tools clean and arrange them neatly. Would definitely recommend buying this. As mentioned in some of the comments there was no instructions sent with the tools but i received some information through a mail i received from the seller:&lt;br /&gt;INSTRUCTIONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash your face thoroughly to remove oil/dirt&lt;br /&gt;2) Open up your pores (hot shower, steaming face, or hot wet towel for 2-3 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;3) Sanitize instruments before using them (soap/water works)&lt;br /&gt;4) For whiteheads/blackheads/pimples, choose the Loop Extractor that best fits the size of your blemish. Place it around the target area and gradually apply pressure until the sebum (oily secretion) is completely removed&lt;br /&gt;5) If the whitehead doesnâ€™t pop, carefully use the Lancet/Spoon Extractor&lt;br /&gt;6) Sanitize your face and instruments&lt;br /&gt;INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED:&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Loop Extractors (3):&lt;br /&gt;o Apply pressure to target area&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; Various sizes to choose from&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Lancet/Spoon Extractor (1):&lt;br /&gt;o Side 1: A small, sharp lancet&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; Puncture whitehead to release the sebum&lt;br /&gt;o Side 2: A small spoon with a hole in the middle&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; Apply gentle pressure to the area to push out trapped sebum&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Angled Extractor (1):&lt;br /&gt;o The angled loop extractor is ideal for harder to reach areas&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; Examples: outer ear, side of nose, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Deep, cystic pimples or more severe acne should be treated by a dermatologist. If sebum is not easily being released, refrain from over-attempting as it may lead to scarring.</li>
            <li> Got this and used it the same day. The instructions were simple to follow. I like the various sizes of the tools and the case. Would&#x27;ve liked tweezers included, but it&#x27;s still a good kit for the price.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and very useful.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried all the acne stuff out there and still unsuccessful, try this kit.  I have adult acne and have severe scarring on my face. I just purchased this kit and have been using the tools for a week now.  I use it everyday on a clean face, especially on both sides of my nose and chin area. I use a warm damp cloth afterwards and apply moisturizer.  Using this kit prevents the whiteheads from morphing into full blown acne!  The tools appear to be of quality material and effective.  You can&#x27;t beat the price either.  I plan to purchase more for gifts for the holidays.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery! Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Everything works really great. The guide was helpful and I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Mine came free of defects. Seemed to be made of high quality stainless steel. The zipper on the case broke quickly but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that in the first place. Note: did not actually come with any sort of instructions. I am NOT a paid review just a real person looking for a good product. I thought I might have been taking a gamble on this but came away happy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure sure how to use all of these tools, but was very impressed with the quality of them.  And I like the case.  As an added bonus, I received an email from the seller with a pdf attachment that explains all of the tools and how to use them.  They also arrived very promptly.  I would definitely order these again should the need arise.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve filled the directions and have had great results. Plus the seller had great communication</li>
            <li> I have ongoing adult acne problems and don&#x27;t have the option to just leave it alone until it heals every time, not only is there too much but I can&#x27;t stand not getting rid of it. I&#x27;ve been using my hands and make sure to scrub my nails. With these, aside from the fact that you&#x27;re avoiding getting any further dirt from your hands into your pores, it&#x27;s also a million times easier to clear your complexion of any blackheads, etc in a few swipes. I was able to clear my pores completely so that they were able to heal faster with the help of antiseptics and face masks.</li>
            <li> These really are surgical quality and easy to clean. They are safely and professional packaged with a discreet and streamlined design, so you can take them anywhere. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times now, but it works wonders!! Now I don&#x27;t have to spend 15 minutes trying to get the sebum and gunk out of my nose pores. I just applied pressure and scraped a little with one of the bigger loops and it came right out. The smaller, circular tools are best for whiteheads and blackheads. This whole kit is your best arsenal to keep your face blemish-free, or at least deal with them more effectively. I can&#x27;t wait to use this on my mom&#x27;s recurring back blackhead. It&#x27;ll be so much easier than trying to squeeze it with my fingers. And, the owner of the company personally reached out to me to get my feedback and make sure I was satisfied. As someone who works in customer service, THAT is top-notch customer service!!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.  The description of the product was spot on. Bought product based on the product description and customers reviews, which were excellent.</li>
            <li> Kind of not sure what to do with these but some help and others feel like a blade on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality tools. I was very impressed when I opened the handy case.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Thank you..</li>
            <li> Good variety of tools and they seem sturdy. The point on the pointy tool isn&#x27;t especially pointy, but it can certainly be sharpened. No instructions included, though the seller did send a message with some minimal instructions attached.</li>
            <li> Awesome Kit. Loves it.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic kit! The tools are very sturdy and well made. The black case keeps all your tools together and organized. The tools worked very well at getting the impurities off my face. My skin felt very clean after using these tools. Also worked great at getting a splinter out of my sons foot. Lots of options for use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to put, but they work. I always get grossed out when I remove my whiteheads with it though. Ugh. But they haven&#x27;t rusted in the month I&#x27;ve had them, and they are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Excellent set of tools to clear up those icky stuff on your face! Easy to handle and use. Love it!</li>
