            <li>Awesome cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream is the best.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy and is easy to find in almost any store.</li>
            <li>It is very clean and good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have no wrinkles or fine lines.  </li>
            <li>but my wife loves only this cream for the face and say that is great.</li>
            <li>It is a light cream for the face.</li>
            <li>I really do enjoy this face cream.</li>
            <li>just rinse my face with water in the shower in the morning, and then use a light application of the Ponds Cream.</li>
            <li>About the consistency of sunblock, goes on smooth, moisturizes quite well, and smells like a clean grandma.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying this cream, bought it on recommendation from a friend and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I have found this product to be a good replacement for Paquin&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream (with Aloe), which is no longer marketed.</li>
            <li>No need to go to the higher priced \\&quot;designer\\&quot; products!</li>
            <li>Fresh, powdery smell.</li>
            <li>really nice basic cream...</li>
            <li>A skin classic, great for dry skin especially during winter months, Not available in Europe anymore , so great to be able to obtain it on Amazon , thank you .</li>
            <li>The cream is hypo-allergic and it is great for my sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>But later it absorbs and is OK.</li>
            <li>But as any other cosmetics, you have to be sure that it is the right one for you.</li>
            <li>My skin is fairly sensitive and I have to use a mild non-allergic laundry detergent.</li>
            <li>like the large packages because it lasts me longer.</li>
            <li>I guess there&#x27;s a reason this is a classic!  </li>
            <li>makes your face look very oily...   </li>
            <li>I have tried many products ,some very expensive,Ponds works just as well if not better than most for dry skin.</li>
            <li>A classic.</li>
            <li>This really helps moisturize my skin very well for hours after application and its not super strong on the smell factor scale.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t rub in very well, dries fast, I don&#x27;t really get enough time to spread it all because I don&#x27;t like using a lot at a time, but does moisturize.</li>
            <li>But, it was gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Gives you that petroleum jelly effect naturally!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and tried other brands that cost much more, only to end up with irritated skin or a rash.  </li>
            <li>At night I wash my face before bed with Clean and Clear Sensitive Skin face wash, and then apply the Ponds Cream a little more heavily on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just right for someone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and a solid product without all the not needed bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>I was using it for 2 weeks straight and still had dry flaky skin on my forehead</li>
            <li>so the same amount will last much longer.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I run out ill buy more!</li>
            <li>I personally have very dry skin and many times have dead skin hanging from my face.</li>
            <li>The skin cream definitely helps moisturize my dry skin with almost no irritation, as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use this cream religiously, i have dry sensitive skin this cream makes my face feel heavenly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and was getting dry patches as well as occasional pimples.</li>

            <li> I need much less of this product to get the same moisturizing effect as my old cream</li>
            <li> I used this product for a long time in my teenage years.</li>
            <li> works wonders especially since I moved to a really dry state from the east coast.</li>
            <li> I recently had a photofacial treatment that left my skin red and slightly burned.  </li>
            <li> Be careful to use just a tiny dab</li>
            <li> IN LARAMIE DRY CONDITIONS, CAN&#x60;T BE WITHOUT IT.&lt;br /&gt;LALI</li>
            <li> I have really dry and oily (combination) skin.</li>
            <li> so I ran with that advice as my face can get dry.</li>
            <li> My dry skin is gone, and I&#x27;m not breaking out at all.</li>
            <li> My one negative is that if I accidently get it near my eyes it causes them to tear and be irritated.</li>
            <li> other words, I like the product</li>
            <li> I like the formula because it has that slight oil feeling which works with my skin type.</li>
            <li> and I still have half a jar</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for a little over two years now.</li>
            <li> But it is heavy..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on department store brands!</li>
            <li> So, I am not sure what the effect will be on oily</li>
            <li> Company is slow to ship.</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick and creamy</li>
            <li> I had been using an expensive cream (at least three or four times the price of Pond&#x27;s), but now have to economize.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moisturized in this cold, harsh winter.</li>
            <li> (sorry for the visuals)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find something to work well on my combination skin.</li>

(sorry for the visuals) this cream smoothened my skin beyond belif. I will stick to this cream!!!</li>
            <li> Great for moisturizing.  Smells good.  I feel pampered when I use it.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rub in very well, dries fast, I don&#x27;t really get enough time to spread it all because I don&#x27;t like using a lot at a time, but does moisturize.</li>

            <li> Love the product because it is a great product that gently softens your skin.  Company is slow to ship.</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick and creamy but when you put it on your face it feels as if it does not moisturize. I was using it for 2 weeks straight and still had dry flaky skin on my forehead so I&#x27;m going to switch back to my Shiseido.</li>
            <li> very good product , fast shipment</li>
            <li> The skin cream definitely helps moisturize my dry skin with almost no irritation, as I have sensitive skin. I use this along with Insta Naturals Vitamin C serum and my skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Europe, where we have a fantastically good creams but my wife loves only this cream for the face and say that is great. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My skin is fairly sensitive and I have to use a mild non-allergic laundry detergent. I&#x27;ve even had problems with Dove soap for my skin. So I was glad to find Ponds. It keeps my skin moisturized in this cold, harsh winter. It is not greasy and is easy to find in almost any store. My one negative is that if I accidently get it near my eyes it causes them to tear and be irritated.</li>
            <li> I have found this product to be a good replacement for Paquin&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream (with Aloe), which is no longer marketed. No need to go to the higher priced \\&quot;designer\\&quot; products!</li>
            <li> IN LARAMIE DRY CONDITIONS, CAN&#x60;T BE WITHOUT IT.&lt;br /&gt;LALI</li>
            <li> I used this product for a long time in my teenage years. I have really dry and oily (combination) skin. This lotion temporarily moisturized but also left my skin feeling greasy. But, it was gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Target for about $4. It smells good (much better than their anti-wrinkle cream) and not as pungent. I like the formula because it has that slight oil feeling which works with my skin type. Read a review about the cancer warning stuff but I&#x27;m not that worried about that.... when you die you die. Anyway, give this a go. It&#x27;s cheap, nice size, and WORKS!</li>
            <li> I use Ponds all the time for the last 5 years and since then I constantly get compliments for my skin. The cream is hypo-allergic and it is great for my sensitive and dry skin. I noticed that my skin looks oily when I initially put the cream on my face. But later it absorbs and is OK. So, I am not sure what the effect will be on oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the large packages because it lasts me longer. When I travel I just put some cream in a smaller container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, I like the product and I recommend it. It is very clean and good for sensitive skin. But as any other cosmetics, you have to be sure that it is the right one for you.</li>
            <li> A classic. I use it as a body cream after a shower. Fresh, powdery smell. It is a light cream for the face.</li>
            <li> My favorite. The best for dry skin. I use it day and night. Absolutely amazing on its&#x27; own or under foundation.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products ,some very expensive,Ponds works just as well if not better than most for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin. This works wonderfully. Fast delivery and a solid product without all the not needed bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> this cream is great for overnight use... apply on your face and go to sleep and next day your face feels awesome.. But it is heavy.. makes your face look very oily...   really nice basic cream... works great as a hand cream as well. Be careful to use just a tiny dab</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because I needed some coverup for a cosplay con I went to. This was recommended and I&#x27;m glad I listened. You get great coverage for a great price. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy this face cream. My buddies girlfriend mentioned it was good stuff so I ran with that advice as my face can get dry. This really helps moisturize my skin very well for hours after application and its not super strong on the smell factor scale. I have used this stuff for a little over two years now.</li>
            <li> I use this cream religiously, i have dry sensitive skin this cream makes my face feel heavenly and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Awesome cream for dry skin.</li>

            <li> I was desperate to find something to work well on my combination skin. I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and was getting dry patches as well as occasional pimples. I asked a friend of mine what she used and she said that this was the best. Considering the low price, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. It is fantastic! My dry skin is gone, and I&#x27;m not breaking out at all. My skin feels healthy and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I just rinse my face with water in the shower in the morning, and then use a light application of the Ponds Cream. At night I wash my face before bed with Clean and Clear Sensitive Skin face wash, and then apply the Ponds Cream a little more heavily on my face and neck. I wish I had discovered this cream 15 years ago!</li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream is the best.  In my family we have been using Ponds for generations and our skin looks wonderful!!&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Good product but Oil of Olay Regenerist is better</li>
            <li> I have been using Ponds for about 20 years and it is awesome.  I&#x27;m 35 and use this on my face daily.  I have no wrinkles or fine lines.  I have sensitive skin and tried other brands that cost much more, only to end up with irritated skin or a rash.  I always go back to Ponds.  My grandmother used it for decades and once I tried it, I was sold.  I won&#x27;t try another brand again.</li>
            <li> I recently had a photofacial treatment that left my skin red and slightly burned.  I stared rummaging through my cabinet for a face cream without all the additives (SPF, anti-wrinkle ingredients, etc).  My mom lent me her Ponds and it saved the day.  Had to order one for myself too.</li>
            <li> About the consistency of sunblock, goes on smooth, moisturizes quite well, and smells like a clean grandma. 10/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> Beautiful - great price &amp; arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I actually have been using it on my legs at night and you wouldn&#x27;t believe how conditioned and moisturized they are during the day! Gives you that petroleum jelly effect naturally! Also great as a night cream to hydrate your skin. Doesn&#x27;t have the best ingredients, but for a drugstore brand and for the price, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> A skin classic, great for dry skin especially during winter months, Not available in Europe anymore , so great to be able to obtain it on Amazon , thank you .</li>
