            <li>I love this scent since it came out in 1994.</li>
            <li>Better than outlet mall perfumaina or the alike stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is such a priceless experience to be enveloped in this heavenly scent!  </li>
            <li>Mi wife love this</li>
            <li>When I did it was a lot more than I wanted to spend.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I believe i have use the product for more then 10 years.</li>
            <li>I start shopping at amazon to get a better price.</li>
            <li>Would most def recommend</li>
            <li>This is my mothers favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>love chloe narcisse</li>
            <li>I find that I can get the better value when I purchase the set with 6.7 oz body lotion and the 3..4 oz eau de toilette from bigdiscountfragrance for $35.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>i must  buy some more of it..</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite fragrances, in fact I think my favorite.</li>
            <li>Glad to find a fragrance that was discontinued.</li>
            <li>LOVE NARCISSE</li>
            <li>Have been stopped by people wanting to know the scent name many, many times over the years.</li>
            <li>Love my perfume and I get lots of compliments</li>
            <li>love the scent  </li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Do I Love it....</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;ll be able to continue purchasing it at a better cost.</li>
            <li>a great scent that enhances my lovely woman natural scent...</li>
            <li>I have always loved the smell of this perfume and haven&#x27;t really been able to find it in department stores in years and as soon as it came</li>
            <li>WHAT A GREAT DEAL and the shipping is super FAST (2-3 days)!</li>
            <li>From the second this precious juice hits my skin, my nose is inundated with fresh, dewy, delicious daffodils!  </li>
            <li>I will continue to provide to her till the end of time and its still available</li>
            <li>But this latest bottle smells not quite right.</li>
            <li>It smells great long into the evening.</li>
            <li>This (I believe) is the original one.</li>
            <li>The perfume comes with its original box and plastic wrapper (includes bottle cap)&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended.</li>
            <li>The scent is the original, not a copy.</li>
            <li>It is hard to improve a perfect daffodil, but this beauty pulls it off.</li>
            <li>It is the warmest most seductive scent that I have been able to find...besides Versace Red Jeans.</li>
            <li>HOW QUICKLY I RECEIVED IT AT HOME</li>
            <li>20 years later, I am still in love with this sweet, honey-floral scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is any time or occasion that this would be inappropriate for, but I do think this is a strong enough fragrance that the wearer must spray lightly to avoid overpowering those around her.</li>
            <li>I get so many accomplishment from others on its soft and gentle floral smell.</li>
            <li>Its mild and distinct at the same time.</li>
            <li>Very distinctive.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product many times, usually always from a different company but am always pleased with the fast service and of course the product.</li>
            <li>I also get a distinct hint of sweetness unfolding as well, but my nose can&#x27;t identify which individual sweet or fruity notes are in the mix, only that it is absolutely intoxicating.</li>
            <li>This is the most glorious, highly sensual, extremely feminine, and exceedingly enjoyable fragrance I have encountered in a long, long time - perhaps ever.  </li>
            <li>Get some for your old lady now!</li>
            <li>Too soft, if that makes sense?</li>
            <li>she was so surprised when it came</li>
            <li>I can smell the bitter quality I have read mentioned in other people&#x27;s reviews, but to me it is gentle and not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>It is soft and simple, and not at all over powering.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO!!!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite.  So I got it for her as a gift  She&#x27;s happy so I&#x27;m happy.  Just the size bottle she likes</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for 22 years!! I&#x27;m an walking ad for this perfume! People always say that I smell good.</li>
            <li> great bottle size for the price, I was pleasantly surprized by how large it was. I have always loved the smell of this perfume and haven&#x27;t really been able to find it in department stores in years and as soon as it came I had to spray it...mmmm! AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for over 10 years. It used to be my sister&#x27;s favorite. But this latest bottle smells not quite right. Too soft, if that makes sense?</li>
            <li> Smell is very specific to individuals. I love this scent since it came out in 1994. Amazon has the best price. Better than outlet mall perfumaina or the alike stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are into floral, this is the one to get. Very distinctive.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it!  Happy wife &#x3D; Happy life!</li>
            <li> Caught this scent on a waitress at the Perfect Landing Restaurant in Denver. Had my daughter ask her about it. Got it within 3 days from Amazon, the greatest shopping site in the world. Get some for your old lady now!</li>
            <li> This is the most glorious, highly sensual, extremely feminine, and exceedingly enjoyable fragrance I have encountered in a long, long time - perhaps ever.  This scent is such a treat for both the wearer and those around her.  From the second this precious juice hits my skin, my nose is inundated with fresh, dewy, delicious daffodils!  I didn&#x27;t even know how in love with daffodils I am!  The scent continues to unfold and just gets richer and richer from there.  It is hard to improve a perfect daffodil, but this beauty pulls it off. I definitely detect other florals, specifically a creamy gardenia. I also get a distinct hint of sweetness unfolding as well, but my nose can&#x27;t identify which individual sweet or fruity notes are in the mix, only that it is absolutely intoxicating. I can smell the bitter quality I have read mentioned in other people&#x27;s reviews, but to me it is gentle and not unpleasant. I would have expected to hate that part, but I don&#x27;t. To me it seems like it is just part of the spice profile. I have to admit something: I can&#x27;t stop smelling my wrists!  I&#x27;m hopelessly addicted, and have been literally from the first spray. If possible, I plan to never allow this perfume to escape my collection.  It is such a priceless experience to be enveloped in this heavenly scent!  I don&#x27;t think there is any time or occasion that this would be inappropriate for, but I do think this is a strong enough fragrance that the wearer must spray lightly to avoid overpowering those around her. Enjoy this impeccable beauty!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 30 years I guess and wouldn&#x27;t change a thing. Everytime I tried something else my kids said I smelled different. They don&#x27;t like change. It is soft and simple, and not at all over powering. Great product</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it, it is now one of her favorites</li>
            <li> Mi wife love this she was so surprised when it came</li>
            <li> Purchased as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my mom. This is her &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34; and she loved it.</li>
            <li> i have worn this for years,and years, and every time, someone asks me \\&quot;what are you wearing?\\&quot;, not only that but people will comment on the scent at 5 or 6 at night when i put it on at 6am., so anything that still smells that good after so many hours has got to be a hit.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a birthday gift for my sister. I think they might not be making this scent anymore as I had a hard time finding it in the stores. When I did it was a lot more than I wanted to spend. This was a great deal.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product many times, usually always from a different company but am always pleased with the fast service and of course the product.</li>
            <li> Perfect if u like strong sweet flower like i do</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for years.  I am a teacher and every year I get a student or two that says, &amp;#34;I want to sit by you because you smell so good!&amp;#34;  How cute.  I have been in the checkout lane at the store and the clerk has asked what I am wearing.  I love this stuff.  I will wear it as long as I can!!!!!  It smells great long into the evening.</li>
            <li> I believe i have use the product for more then 10 years. I get so many accomplishment from others on its soft and gentle floral smell. I start shopping at amazon to get a better price.</li>
            <li> Couple years ago i was introduced this fragrance and finally found it back. Its mild and distinct at the same time. Lasts the entire day and i&#x27;m always being asked what perfume i&#x27;m wearing. Would most def recommend</li>
            <li> This is my mothers favorite perfume. It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find locally, Ty amazon for making life easier.</li>
            <li> love chloe narcisse i have used it for over 15yrs, its great it stays with you all day</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance!!!!</li>
            <li> I received my first small bottle in 1994 to wear to my Junior Prom. 20 years later, I am still in love with this sweet, honey-floral scent. It is the warmest most seductive scent that I have been able to find...besides Versace Red Jeans. LOL! I find that I can get the better value when I purchase the set with 6.7 oz body lotion and the 3..4 oz eau de toilette from bigdiscountfragrance for $35. WHAT A GREAT DEAL and the shipping is super FAST (2-3 days)!</li>
            <li> People always ask what I&#x27;m wearing. It smells so good, it&#x27;s mild. I will recommend it. Love it.</li>
            <li> Just a lovely scent !! I used Chloe Narcisse  years ago..i got many compliments wearing this wonderful scent..i must  buy some more of it.. no substitute for this one..Thank you Amazon for being an excellent source to order from &amp; good delivery timing for the items i  have ordered.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances, in fact I think my favorite. I always get compliments when wearing Chloe and people what to know what fragrance and where I purchase it. Also, the fragrance last and last!</li>
            <li> Glad to find a fragrance that was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Yes met expectations and arrived when it was suppose to</li>
            <li> Just what I remembered as a teen.</li>
            <li> Great value. You get what you paid for. Beware of some imitations around. This (I believe) is the original one.</li>
            <li> I WAS TRYING TO FIND THIS PRODUCT IN SAN DIEGO&lt;br /&gt;AND IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE NARCISSE BECAUSE ITS A WONDERFUL PARFUME&lt;br /&gt;I WAS AMAZED HOW QUICKLY I RECEIVED IT AT HOME&lt;br /&gt;I WILL DEFINITELY PURCHASE ONLINE AGAIN.</li>

            <li> Love my perfume and I get lots of compliments</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! The perfume comes with its original box and plastic wrapper (includes bottle cap)&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended. The scent is the original, not a copy.</li>
