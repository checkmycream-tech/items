            <li>This product is probably best for women with straight hair.</li>
            <li>i do not know what this peachy nice smell is that</li>
            <li>I personally love the smell and have had compliments on how good my hair smells (hugging family members).</li>
            <li>Good product, wish there were more directions, like how often to use,</li>
            <li>Still the best leave in conditioning syling product on the market, a classic for a reason.</li>
            <li>And smells so awesome - highly recommend</li>
            <li>/&gt;very very easy to overdo it.</li>
            <li>my hair is very fine,</li>
            <li>I do have to use it with some gel as I have a ton of curly hair and this product is very light weight.</li>
            <li>and i am so glad</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This product makes your hair silky smooth!</li>
            <li>My husband can&#x27;t stop touching my skin and continues to tell me my skin feels like silk.</li>
            <li>I have used it for about 7 years and have not found anything that works better for my hair.</li>
            <li>I used to think things like this were made for mostly females, until I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I hope I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>A beautician recommended I try this and boy am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>It keeps my over-processed, heat-damaged hair looking healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have typical caucasion hair and this is wonderful stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have heard lots of great things about this product and thought it would be good to order the small bottles to try out.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use as a light shine for my hair</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Great for tangles and dry, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product and that I rcvd it so fast!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very smooth &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; serum that really penetrates the ends of hair to keep them from getting frizzy.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff I have been using it for years, and this is the real stuff.  </li>
            <li>Like others have stated, a dime-nickel size amount is more than enough for most hair styles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other smoothing products, but this is by far the best at any price.</li>
            <li>My hair has become fairly brittle, and dry.</li>
            <li>This was a great value to find as this product is not cheap in stores.</li>
            <li>I have seen it make frizzy real and extensions looks smooth.</li>
            <li>The Biosilk serum makes my hair so soft, smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel healthy and look shiny without an oily weighted down look.</li>
            <li>Have bought before at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;smells exactly like rave hair spray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so expensive in the stores and to find it on amazon is truly amazing!!!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, actually feels like silk absorbing into your skin</li>
            <li>Great for wet hair detangling after washing, or can be used on dry hair as well when needed on fly-away days.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair amazingly silky without feeling heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t add too much or u look oily</li>
            <li>It really does do wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used too much and the result was a greasy look.</li>
            <li>Once completely dry, I go over my hair with a straightener to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for everyone.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I probably could find something similar in the local stores but this was easy to order.</li>
            <li>Live this product for my hair and even for my skin.</li>
            <li>But it makes my hair very soft and shiny without being greasy.</li>
            <li>After my normal washing routine I add this serum and it makes my hair extremely soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, just a tiny dime size squirt rub hands together to even out and gently apply to dried and styled hair to remove friz every time.  </li>
            <li>I normally use this serum when I dry off my hair right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>its quality is good but size is too small than I expected.</li>
            <li>It has the great smell and it calms my crazy fizzy hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;super soft hair&lt;</li>
            <li>I actually skip all my hair styling products for this serum alone, which I find is much healthier for my hair as well as my scalp.</li>
            <li>I might use this to keep my hair straight after a flat iron process, but then again I don&#x27;t straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>This product should only be used after flat ironing/pressing your hair to keep it straight.</li>
            <li>As others have noted you do have to be careful not to use too much, or it weighs your hair</li>

            <li> flyaway, slightly wavy, easily tangled, breakage prone, split ends, slow to grow, and i dont dye or heat style my hair.</li>
            <li> I use a heat protector spray when my hair is wet and then put biosilk on my dry hair before I straighten it and it makes my hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> but i havent been using it long enough..</li>
            <li> I like this product for use before using my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the container should really allow it to dispense some other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;weighs hair down (pro for me, but con maybe for some curly haired girls)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i initially tried this on dry hair years ago and thought it was</li>
            <li> You can buy the larger one to refill the 2 smaller ones when they are empty.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and only need maybe a dime size worth and even less than that when my hair is straightened.</li>
            <li> I used it in my 4C hair and it dried it out completely and made the curls tighter.</li>
            <li> I use this on my damp, towel dried hair and then let my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li> Back to my previous brand, I guess.</li>
            <li> Also, if I let my hair go a few days without washing and the ends start to look dry, I use Biosilk on the ends and it brings my hair back to life.</li>
            <li> then i read reviews and tried it on wet hair</li>
            <li> use a dime size or less even on long hair, trust me.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve tried this dry and disliked it, try it wet.</li>
            <li> i also have extremely oily roots.</li>
            <li> other people smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You might as well go to store and buy a big bottle for the price you get on this for two small ones.</li>
            <li> would not purchase this again due to these reasons.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Could be fake, I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> flyaway hair down (a pro for me)&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair way less frizzy</li>
            <li> i only  wish that the price was lower or that the bottle was larger because it is too expensive</li>
            <li> Just need a little bit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it hasnt dried out my hair yet</li>
            <li> Very little is needed when you use it, works so well when you mix with gel to style hair.</li>
            <li> Very little is needed.  </li>
            <li> use a VERY little ....</li>
            <li> So my advice is to start with very little and add if needed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d hate to always have to divide a certain amount.</li>
            <li> My hair that is very thin, is very dry and this restores moisture to my hair before I style it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the former brand I had been using (Chi), and am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> really* bad.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> best product, best price, wonderful shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  In addition to the wonderful effect it has on my dry hair, the price was excellent.  It was delivered in great shape and within the time frame promised.  Definitely will go back to this vendor.</li>
            <li> Have bought before at a much higher price. Always leaves hair silky. This product/ seller is legitimate. Good deal!</li>
            <li> This product should only be used after flat ironing/pressing your hair to keep it straight. I used it in my 4C hair and it dried it out completely and made the curls tighter. I might use this to keep my hair straight after a flat iron process, but then again I don&#x27;t straighten my hair. This product is probably best for women with straight hair.</li>
            <li> my hair is very fine, flyaway, slightly wavy, easily tangled, breakage prone, split ends, slow to grow, and i dont dye or heat style my hair. i also have extremely oily roots. now onto the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;makes hair shiny&lt;br /&gt;makes hair way less frizzy&lt;br /&gt;makes my hair straighter and healthier looking&lt;br /&gt;super soft hair&lt;br /&gt;weighs flyaway hair down (a pro for me)&lt;br /&gt;does not make my hair greasy (the way i use it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;smells exactly like rave hair spray. i do not know what this peachy nice smell is that other people smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the container should really allow it to dispense some other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;weighs hair down (pro for me, but con maybe for some curly haired girls)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very very easy to overdo it. use a dime size or less even on long hair, trust me. dont apply to roots especially if you have oily hair but thats obvious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it breaks me out on my neck, back and sides of jaw but not sure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it hasnt dried out my hair yet but i havent been using it long enough..i initially tried this on dry hair years ago and thought it was *really* bad. then i read reviews and tried it on wet hair and i am so glad i did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;ve tried this dry and disliked it, try it wet. i only give it four stars because its not foolproof, you have to tweak your method until it works for you.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE using this silk therapy serum! I dye my hair and it tends to start drying after a couple months, and I use the silk serum to help hydrate and get moisture back into my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue and I have some what oil hair too!</li>
            <li> You might as well go to store and buy a big bottle for the price you get on this for two small ones.</li>
            <li> Love this serum!  I have typical caucasion hair and this is wonderful stuff.  It smells great and it tames frizz in a zap.  You only need to use a dime size amount and rub it between your hands to &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; it up and then run your fingers through your hair and voila!  Perfectly glossy and amazing smelling hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> Works well, gives my hair some bounce &amp; shine.  Just need a little bit.  I probably could find something similar in the local stores but this was easy to order.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Serum!  My hair that is very thin, is very dry and this restores moisture to my hair before I style it.</li>
            <li> i have always loved this i only  wish that the price was lower or that the bottle was larger because it is too expensive</li>
            <li> Very nice product and unbeatable price!</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that will work on my bushy hair.  I lve the size too to take with me on trips.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product and I love it. It&#x27;s a very smooth &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; serum that really penetrates the ends of hair to keep them from getting frizzy. It&#x27;s also a wonderful hand and body lotion that absorbs into the skin without any greasy feeling. I bought the 2-pack and keep one each in the bathroom and bedroom. You can buy the larger one to refill the 2 smaller ones when they are empty.</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair silky smooth! My hairdresser used it everytime I got my hair done and I simply had to have it for at home. I highly recommend this product for everyone. Although if you do use this product I wouldn&#x27;t use conditioner this product takes the place of a conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li> its quality is good but size is too small than I expected. I want to order bigger size next time.</li>
            <li> I use this on my damp, towel dried hair and then let my hair dry naturally. Once completely dry, I go over my hair with a straightener to smooth it out. The Biosilk serum makes my hair so soft, smooth and shiny! I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in the texture of my hair after using this. Also, if I let my hair go a few days without washing and the ends start to look dry, I use Biosilk on the ends and it brings my hair back to life. Really love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I use a heat protector spray when my hair is wet and then put biosilk on my dry hair before I straighten it and it makes my hair soft and shinny. Don&#x27;t add too much or u look oily lol</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the former brand I had been using (Chi), and am disappointed.  It leaves my hair and scalp feeling oily and itchy.  Back to my previous brand, I guess.</li>
            <li> Very little is needed when you use it, works so well when you mix with gel to style hair. The price is good compared to buying it at a beauty salon.</li>
            <li> Great deal on an awesome product. Took through TSA on an international trip without an issue. Excellent for curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other smoothing products, but this is by far the best at any price. I got the two pack &amp; gave one to my Mom. It leaves your hair amazingly silky without feeling heavy or oily. Great for wet hair detangling after washing, or can be used on dry hair as well when needed on fly-away days.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have heard lots of great things about this product and thought it would be good to order the small bottles to try out. I bought this to use as a light shine for my hair but I never knew you could use this on your skin. Initially bought this for my hair but have been using it on my skin. My husband can&#x27;t stop touching my skin and continues to tell me my skin feels like silk. It really does do wonders for my skin. Now I need the big bottle!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, actually feels like silk absorbing into your skin&lt;br /&gt;without feeling greasy!!  great product, I want it always!!!</li>
            <li> This product is of good quality. I love the way it makes my hair feel healthy and look shiny without an oily weighted down look. I have used it for about 7 years and have not found anything that works better for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It&#x27;s so expensive in the stores and to find it on amazon is truly amazing!!! I will be ordering again!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I have been using it for years, and this is the real stuff.  It has the great smell and it calms my crazy fizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Does nothing for my hair. Could be fake, I really don&#x27;t know. But Paul Mitchell skinny serum works wonders.</li>
            <li> Love this hair product!  Makes my hair shiny and very healthy looking.  Very little is needed.  The price is excellent compared to buying it at a beauty salon.</li>
            <li> I like this product for use before using my flat iron.  This is a good price.  Takes the tiniest amount for each use. Don&#x27;t overdo it or you&#x27;ll have greasy hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product and that I rcvd it so fast!</li>
            <li> I normally use this serum when I dry off my hair right out of the shower. I used to think things like this were made for mostly females, until I decided to give it a try. My hair has become fairly brittle, and dry. After my normal washing routine I add this serum and it makes my hair extremely soft and pliable. I only condition twice a week. Like others have stated, a dime-nickel size amount is more than enough for most hair styles. I actually skip all my hair styling products for this serum alone, which I find is much healthier for my hair as well as my scalp. There are two bottles that come in this pack, and that&#x27;s a great perk for me, because I travel a lot for work and I&#x27;d hate to always have to divide a certain amount. Try it, you&#x27;ll be happy you did!</li>
            <li> I saw this on the TV show Celebrity Apprentice and just had to try it! My daughter is doing my hair today. I hope I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> This was everything i thought I would be. Very great customer service, arrived on time. I would work with this company again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, just a tiny dime size squirt rub hands together to even out and gently apply to dried and styled hair to remove friz every time.  And smells so awesome - highly recommend</li>
            <li> this product is too oily and it&#x27;s order is unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase this again due to these reasons.&lt;br /&gt;If you choose to buy it use a VERY little .... it&#x27;s grease</li>
            <li> This is a great hair and skin conditioning product.  This was also a great price and Amazon makes shopping for these items so convenient.</li>
            <li> Great for tangles and dry, fine hair.</li>
            <li> love this product and wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it!!</li>
            <li> Love this! The smell is great and it&#x27;s so silky on your hair.. My hair feels and smell great!</li>
            <li> Got this item to use on my pool cues after cleaning them. It does a great job polishing my cues, it is cheaper than the cue polishing products you can get from pool suppliers.</li>
            <li> This was a great value to find as this product is not cheap in stores. I have seen it make frizzy real and extensions looks smooth.</li>
            <li> Live this product for my hair and even for my skin.</li>
            <li> Still the best leave in conditioning syling product on the market, a classic for a reason.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I do have to use it with some gel as I have a ton of curly hair and this product is very light weight. But it makes my hair very soft and shiny without being greasy. I have long, thick hair and only need maybe a dime size worth and even less than that when my hair is straightened. I have used too much and the result was a greasy look. So my advice is to start with very little and add if needed. I personally love the smell and have had compliments on how good my hair smells (hugging family members). I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good product, wish there were more directions, like how often to use,</li>
            <li> A beautician recommended I try this and boy am I glad I did.  My hair truly is like silk now.  It has tamed the frizzies as well!  As others have noted you do have to be careful not to use too much, or it weighs your hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and this is a great deal here at Amazon for 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> Love this. It keeps my over-processed, heat-damaged hair looking healthy and shiny.  Kept one bottle and shared one with my sister who also likes it a lot.</li>
