            <li> durable synthetic brush bit not hard or stiff.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft while still being firm.</li>
            <li> Use it under my eyes and for minor imperfections.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always checking out brushes at stores, such as Sephora and Ulta, and I have yet to find brushes other than Sigma that has piqued my interest.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day, whereas before I got the brush I basically never used it out of frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a little too small to use for the eye area though I ended up buying the sigma large concealer brush for that purpose.</li>
            <li> This one is a little bit bigger than I like for applying eyeshadow</li>
            <li> the brush was of the highest quality and arrived on the expected date.  </li>
            <li> I struggled with the application a lot, switching between a few different brushes and my fingers until I almost gave up.  </li>
            <li> Maybe suggest the next size up, unless you know you will use this for small areas</li>
            <li> I use it with my Bobi Brown corrector and concealer/powder due</li>
            <li> but we always face the shredding problem so what I did was pulling as hard as possible from the bristles and nottttthing</li>
            <li> I received this brush (and the other one I ordered) within just a few days.</li>
            <li> Now I find I use less product and its not cakey looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a very expensive one that never did the job right.</li>
            <li> If you have someone that uses make-up, I recommend you pick up this little brush.</li>
            <li> Some of the hairs have fallen out during cleaning but no more than any other brand i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I use it with Laura Mercier&#x27;s under eye concealer to cover the green veins on my under eye area.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the bristles but feel that the size of the head is too small for applying concealer.</li>
            <li> There is no need to buy expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t think it could blend a thick creamy base.</li>

            <li> Well made, soft brush.  Arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific concealer brush. I use it every day. It is just the right weight and stiffness. Great.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush. Some of the hairs have fallen out during cleaning but no more than any other brand i&#x27;ve used. The brush is very soft while still being firm.</li>
            <li> I have used many brushes and this by far is the best concealer brush I have ever used.  I plan on future purchases and regret I didn&#x27;t buy the whole set.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good for the small areas like when u wanna hide one acne . Definitly not for the area under the eye</li>
            <li> At first I wasnt sold on it but you have to get use to using it. Now I find I use less product and its not cakey looking. I use it with my Bobi Brown corrector and concealer/powder due</li>
            <li> Its perfect to put concealer with it, I think I have pretty eye when I use it than using my hand</li>
            <li> This concealer brush is really awesome, it makes concealing blemishes really easy. Its a little too small to use for the eye area though I ended up buying the sigma large concealer brush for that purpose.</li>
            <li> This brush made the concealer flawless. I like that the brush is very soft and manageable. I love love love the brush highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This brush came quickly. It works well and is easy to clean.Glad I ordered it. That says it all as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  I use it to apply concealer under my eyes and primer on my eyelids.  It blends a lot better than the makeup sponge that I used to use.</li>
            <li> very high quality brush, as is all of Sigma&#x27;s brushes. I won&#x27;t own any other brush. Received fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; very soft, great size, not too small not too big. I just love it!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!! It&#x27;s perfect for applying concealer around your nose and mouth! The best concealer brush, I totally recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> well, i like the brush of course but we always face the shredding problem so what I did was pulling as hard as possible from the bristles and nottttthing came out. Very nice to blend underneath the eyes by the way.</li>
            <li> Really like sigma brushes.  This one is a little bit bigger than I like for applying eyeshadow otherwise it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Perfect for concealer</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with my Sigma brushes, and this is no exception.  Soft, durable, and gets the job done.  I have four Sigma brushes, all but this one given to me as a gift.  I don&#x27;t know how I got along without the F80, my shadow brush (E55), blending brush (E40) and now this one.  These are all great brushes, for a fraction of what you&#x27;d pay for MAC.  SOLD!&lt;br /&gt;This is a completely unsolicited, independent review.  I was not compensated and do not work for Sigma or any cosmetics company.</li>
            <li> I think is a good price for the good performace you can get.&lt;br /&gt;But I donÂ´t use very frecuently, so I hope performance keeps great as so far.</li>
            <li> I love this detailer concealer brush, I use it especially to conceal under my eyebrows and in those are to get areas.</li>
            <li> I got the Bobbi Brown creamy concealer about 6 months ago and I just really didn&#x27;t way to spend a lot of money on yet another concealer brush.  I struggled with the application a lot, switching between a few different brushes and my fingers until I almost gave up.  Decided to give Sigma a try because of the awesome price point and the great things I&#x27;ve heard.  AMAZING.  Concealer goes on so smoothly and it looks perfect now!  I use it every single day, whereas before I got the brush I basically never used it out of frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use under eye concealer, this brush is a MUST HAVE!  You&#x27;re wasting your money if you apply it any other way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge Bobbi Brown brush snob, but I think that Sigma may just have converted me...</li>
            <li> After reading great reviews about Sigma brushes and seeing the Youtube gurus praising the brushes I decided to go ahead and purchase Sigma brushes for my new make-up collection (literally new, because although I&#x27;ve been using make-up all my adult life I only used basic make-up and just used the sponges the eyeshadows came with.) I now have five Sigma brushes and am looking to get a few more, because I now see how every single brush has its on purpose. This concealer brush is very useful in applying concealer to exactly where I need it. I use it with Laura Mercier&#x27;s under eye concealer to cover the green veins on my under eye area. I love this brush. Since my newfound interest in make-up I&#x27;m always checking out brushes at stores, such as Sephora and Ulta, and I have yet to find brushes other than Sigma that has piqued my interest.</li>
            <li> love, love this brush!...i would buy more of the these brushes, sigma are the way to go, very much worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love sigma! This brush is great. Smaller than a normal concealer brush, but it&#x27;s still great!</li>
