            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>The body of my hair is amazing and&lt;</li>
            <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t see a difference in my color.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I was able to get all of my hair covered and piled on top of my head.  </li>
            <li>I felt like I had a bowling ball on top of my head.  </li>
            <li>This is the best brand of henna I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used several...</li>
            <li>so I decided to go with henna because I love how healthy it</li>
            <li>I used coffee(the darker the better) and the apple cider vinegar and stood one hour under the heat.</li>
            <li>My hair is so freaking shiny and delightful, I get stopped for it constantly!</li>
            <li>I love this product because it has no chemicals</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s safe to use.  </li>
            <li>I leave it on for about an hour or more with no problems.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the time and effort to get good color</li>
            <li>It was a lot more manageable.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;the sink and put a lot more water on top of the henna.</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>Henna has so many benefits</li>
            <li>I love em&#x27;</li>
            <li>As I started to apply the product, I realized that I should have added even more water, as it was quite \\&quot;gloppy\\&quot; and didn&#x27;t have a smooth, pastelike texture.  </li>
            <li>Despite the messiness and heaviness, I am extremely pleased with this product and my hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>My hair is dark brown and this color matches perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get all of the \\&quot;grit\\&quot; out fairly quickly and easily this way.  </li>
            <li>I found a finely ground powder no twigs or leaves</li>
            <li>Great item, our second time using it.</li>
            <li>Great color I mixed with coffee 2 cups for 4 oz</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m never disappointed.  </li>
            <li>My hair is rich in color and full.  </li>
            <li>The color is rich and warm without being brassy and so far it&#x27;s not fading at all.</li>
            <li>It is true to color</li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t believe how shiny and full your hair looks.</li>
            <li>highly recommend when using this product mix with more water than directed.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the clean-up.</li>
            <li>I forgot how nice I looked without my grey hair.  </li>
            <li>It did tone down the reddish tint in my hair so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>the color doesn&#x27;t leech out as much as others, it is dark and rich, the henna is smooth and fine ground, and my hair feels extremely soft from the initial rinse (sometimes it takes a wash or two before you get that great henna softness - not with this henna).</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about it is that my hair has multiple tones to it.</li>
            <li>You have to rinse for quite a while to make sure you get all the extra dye off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My natural color is light brown, and I followed instructions with adding the coffee instead of water.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and mix with hot water and some vinegar</li>
            <li>This time before I started I made many sections with clips and worked from the back.</li>
            <li>The only modification I would make is to avoid the brewed coffee and maybe add some pleasant smelling spices or essential oils to the mixture.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, it&#x27;s a natural product that is actually good for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have very long, thick hair, so the three containers together gave me the perfect amount.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this multi-pack to add to another container I had already purchased at Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>I believe the amla powder really helped the color to stick to my grays.  </li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>I use this stuff about every 3-4 weeks because my hair grows so fast.</li>
            <li>My medium-dark brown hair turned a deep, cool brown and is very silky.</li>
            <li>When coming my hair many dark flecks fell into the sink.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes out creamier and you are left with more than enough to go through the hair again.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and for the most part it covers grey pretty well if you follow the instructions properly.</li>
            <li>On a clean dry head, pack it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s messy and smelly (not in a gross way), but it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>so if you do not want a dark brown get the med or light brown.</li>
            <li>I also got a cheap, corded to the wall heating cap which I wear for about half of that time.</li>
            <li>I covered my hair with a disposable shower cap and then used an old washcloth to wipe off my neck, ears, and forehead.  </li>
            <li>I then wrapped my head in an old t-shirt to prevent any drips, and I sat under a portable heating cap for about 45 minutes (set at medium).  </li>
            <li>You also have to remember that it can take several usages for your hair to really start to absorb the color.  </li>
            <li>I look in my early 30&#x27;s instead of early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and know it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>My package arrived a week early.  </li>
            <li>DIssatisfied that this product doesn&#x27;t cover gray as much even though I left it in longer as instructed.</li>
            <li>I very quickly discovered that this is a messy, messy process.  </li>
            <li>I ended up adding extra water, because this is a super thick, coarse mixture.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I ended up adding extra water, because this is a super thick, coarse mixture.  </li>
            <li> Last time my hair ended is a big massive wad because my hair is long.</li>
            <li> My mother has used this brand to condition and dye her white hair auburn for over a decade, so I used her recipe, only with the dark brown.</li>
            <li> It covers ALL my grey hair in one application.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have grey hair, but I damaged and lightened my hair when I submerged it in a bath with some bath salts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely allergic to all traditional hair dye but not this product.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I followed the dosage and after 1 hour my hair was too dry.</li>
            <li> Never going back to regular dyes and harsh chemicals again.  </li>
            <li> This time I used dark brown and a different brand.</li>
            <li> I was trying to be as neat as possible, because I am a clean freak, but it was just impossible.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I would hesitate to give this a five-star rating is that it&#x27;s unbelievably messy.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, no business</li>
            <li> Due to the cost of this product, I am also planning on buying bulk indigo, henna, and amla and making the mixture myself.  </li>
            <li> and I usually have some left over.  </li>
            <li> Other than that this stuff is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more of the brown in a bottle flat color.</li>
            <li> The result is a dark brown with coco highlights.</li>
            <li> so yes dark</li>
            <li> maybe if you used water instead of coffee it would be lighter but I like the dark and was going for that.</li>
            <li> I used the dark brown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark to begin with.</li>
            <li> Even if you highlight 6 - 12 months down the road it will still happen.</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair black a lot and am no stranger to dark hair</li>
            <li> this is about 2 shades lighter than black</li>
            <li> Only negative I would say is it is a bit messy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking I may need black if I want it darker.</li>
            <li> So think long and hard.</li>
            <li> Bought the dark brown color and it turned my virgin non coloured hair green.</li>
            <li> The arduous rinsing process takes place with copious amounts of conditioner only.</li>
            <li> I wrapped it in plastic wrap and blow dried it off and on, using a wool cap to keep the heat in while my dryer cooled down, for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy and you have to rinse</li>
            <li> I could not believe how HEAVY the mixture was...</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this, unless you want green hair.</li>
            <li> I added brewed coffee instead of plain distilled water, and I used about 3/4 cup of apple cider vinegar instead of 2 Tbsp (to compensate for the addition of the amla powder).  </li>
            <li> I had read that henna can be extremely difficult to rinse out, so I opted to rinse my head upsidedown under the bathtub faucet prior to getting into the shower.  </li>
            <li> Although my kids said it looked like I had baby poop on my head, and I smelled like green tea for a few day (there are much worse things to smell like)</li>
            <li> When she has used it according to the instruction her hairs became GREEN!!!</li>
            <li> It does smell weird and looks disgusting but the way your hair feels after is just all worth it.</li>
            <li> poor hair hasn&#x27;t been dyed in years</li>
            <li> There is tons of information online regarding how to do this, so it shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this about a month ago. I used coffee &amp; apple cider vinegar to mix with the powder, then applied to my hair as directed. I wrapped it in plastic wrap and blow dried it off and on, using a wool cap to keep the heat in while my dryer cooled down, for 45 minutes. Although my kids said it looked like I had baby poop on my head, and I smelled like green tea for a few day (there are much worse things to smell like) this is easily the best hair color I&#x27;ve ever used. The color is rich and warm without being brassy and so far it&#x27;s not fading at all. It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks since I used it. My favorite thing about it is that my hair has multiple tones to it. No more of the brown in a bottle flat color. Give this stuff a shot. It&#x27;s messy and smelly (not in a gross way), but it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ll definitely be keeping a stash of it at my house.</li>
            <li> Great item, our second time using it. Once you learn the technique it&#x27;s a snap</li>
            <li> leaves hair shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this multi-pack to add to another container I had already purchased at Whole Foods.  I have very long, thick hair, so the three containers together gave me the perfect amount.  This dye is a mixture of indigo and henna.  I also added 1/3 cup of amla powder since I have hard-to-color grays.  I added brewed coffee instead of plain distilled water, and I used about 3/4 cup of apple cider vinegar instead of 2 Tbsp (to compensate for the addition of the amla powder).  I ended up adding extra water, because this is a super thick, coarse mixture.  As I started to apply the product, I realized that I should have added even more water, as it was quite \\&quot;gloppy\\&quot; and didn&#x27;t have a smooth, pastelike texture.  I sectioned off my hair in 2-inch sections and started applying the glop on the hair at the nape of my neck.  I very quickly discovered that this is a messy, messy process.  I was trying to be as neat as possible, because I am a clean freak, but it was just impossible.  The next time I \\&quot;henndigo\\&quot; my hair I will sit in our bathtub and use a portable mirror.  Adding the additional water probably would have helped.  Regardless, I was able to get all of my hair covered and piled on top of my head.  I could not believe how HEAVY the mixture was...I felt like I had a bowling ball on top of my head.  I covered my hair with a disposable shower cap and then used an old washcloth to wipe off my neck, ears, and forehead.  I then wrapped my head in an old t-shirt to prevent any drips, and I sat under a portable heating cap for about 45 minutes (set at medium).  I had read that henna can be extremely difficult to rinse out, so I opted to rinse my head upsidedown under the bathtub faucet prior to getting into the shower.  This worked out well.  I was able to get all of the \\&quot;grit\\&quot; out fairly quickly and easily this way.  I didn&#x27;t shampoo, but I did pile on the conditioner in the shower and then rinsed, rinsed, rinsed.  You have to rinse for quite a while to make sure you get all the extra dye off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color fully oxidizes after 48 hours, and I am just stunned at how beautiful and shiny my hair looks.  I believe the amla powder really helped the color to stick to my grays.  You also have to remember that it can take several usages for your hair to really start to absorb the color.  I love it!  The only modification I would make is to avoid the brewed coffee and maybe add some pleasant smelling spices or essential oils to the mixture.  The coffee smell didn&#x27;t leave my hair for days, and I just wasn&#x27;t into it at all.  Due to the cost of this product, I am also planning on buying bulk indigo, henna, and amla and making the mixture myself.  There is tons of information online regarding how to do this, so it shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult.  Despite the messiness and heaviness, I am extremely pleased with this product and my hair looks fantastic.</li>

            <li> This is the best brand of henna I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used several...the color doesn&#x27;t leech out as much as others, it is dark and rich, the henna is smooth and fine ground, and my hair feels extremely soft from the initial rinse (sometimes it takes a wash or two before you get that great henna softness - not with this henna). I&#x27;m converted.</li>
            <li> Bought the dark brown color and it turned my virgin non coloured hair green. My natural color is light brown, and I followed instructions with adding the coffee instead of water. I do not recommend this, unless you want green hair.</li>
            <li> It turned my hair green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My poor hair hasn&#x27;t been dyed in years so I decided to go with henna because I love how healthy it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looked horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily a refund was made and the dye was only semi permanent.</li>
            <li> Got this order with no invoice, no instructions how to use and no phone number to find out.  I had to google and then found out I needed something else to make it work so it&#x27;s still in the box.  At this point will not order again.</li>
            <li> Great color I mixed with coffee 2 cups for 4 oz and I used balsamic vinegar 2 table spoons. I le tit sit for an hour applied and let it stay on 6 hours. The result is a dark brown with coco highlights. Zero red and I have a lot left for touch ups. I found a finely ground powder no twigs or leaves so I have no clue if they changed since reviewers did. It is true to color so if you do not want a dark brown get the med or light brown. I have colored my hair black a lot and am no stranger to dark hair this is about 2 shades lighter than black so yes dark maybe if you used water instead of coffee it would be lighter but I like the dark and was going for that.</li>
            <li> I cannot handle the chemicals contained in semi-permanent dyes.  So I decided to go the herbal route and chose to do a Henna treatment.  This product is fantastic.  I forgot how nice I looked without my grey hair.  My hair is rich in color and full.  I look in my early 30&#x27;s instead of early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried henna before and I have to say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results. My hair is soft and for the most part it covers grey pretty well if you follow the instructions properly. I used coffee(the darker the better) and the apple cider vinegar and stood one hour under the heat. Results were great. It&#x27;s a little messy and you have to rinse really well but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. I will purchase this item again in a heartbeat. Never going back to regular dyes and harsh chemicals again.  Thank you Henna!! 👍😊</li>
            <li> I use this stuff about every 3-4 weeks because my hair grows so fast. I mix in a spoon of the red henna by the same brand. My recipe is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Container of Henna&lt;br /&gt;- 2 cups of brewed coffee&lt;br /&gt;- 1 TBS. Apple Cider Vinegar&lt;br /&gt;- 2 TBS. Coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix that all together with a wooden spoon in a glass container, cover and let sit for 24 hours. On a clean dry head, pack it on. There are tons of videos on this. I let mine sit on my head, covered in a plastic cap for between 6 and 7 hours. I also got a cheap, corded to the wall heating cap which I wear for about half of that time. The arduous rinsing process takes place with copious amounts of conditioner only. My hair is so freaking shiny and delightful, I get stopped for it constantly!</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my hair, one star because I could not give zero</li>
            <li> I love this product because it has no chemicals and it&#x27;s safe to use.  I&#x27;m extremely allergic to all traditional hair dye but not this product.  It covers ALL my grey hair in one application.  I have very long hair so I purchase two containers and I usually have some left over.  My hair is dark brown and this color matches perfectly.  Only negative I would say is it is a bit messy but I&#x27;m so used to applying it that I don&#x27;t mind.  I have a system I stick to and I&#x27;m never disappointed.  I leave it on for about an hour or more with no problems.  It&#x27;s well worth the time and effort to get good color and know it&#x27;s all natural.  Follow the directions and mix with hot water and some vinegar and you won&#x27;t believe how shiny and full your hair looks. I&#x27;m talking...double the volume of your hair after you&#x27;re done!  I will definitely continue to purchase this product and I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have grey hair, but I damaged and lightened my hair when I submerged it in a bath with some bath salts. (Who knew?) My mother has used this brand to condition and dye her white hair auburn for over a decade, so I used her recipe, only with the dark brown. She always left hers in overnight, but I got nervous when a blob that I dropped on my arm left a /green/ spot, so I washed it out after 45 minutes. I am very happy with the results. My medium-dark brown hair turned a deep, cool brown and is very silky. The only reason I would hesitate to give this a five-star rating is that it&#x27;s unbelievably messy. It didn&#x27;t stain anything in my bathroom, though it did get on /everything/. On the other hand, it&#x27;s a natural product that is actually good for my hair. It&#x27;s definitely worth the clean-up.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife, that has brown hairs. When she has used it according to the instruction her hairs became GREEN!!! See Photo!!!</li>
            <li> If your hair needs a pick me up this is great, color and conditioner and lasts for months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this henna before on someone else hair. It always came out great. It does smell weird and looks disgusting but the way your hair feels after is just all worth it. I used the dark brown. Honestly I don&#x27;t see a difference in my color. I&#x27;m dark to begin with. I&#x27;m thinking I may need black if I want it darker. It did tone down the reddish tint in my hair so that&#x27;s good. Other than that this stuff is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend when using this product mix with more water than directed. It comes out creamier and you are left with more than enough to go through the hair again.</li>
            <li> I used medium brown color before and my hair turned red. This time I used dark brown and a different brand. Last time my hair ended is a big massive wad because my hair is long. This time before I started I made many sections with clips and worked from the back. It was a lot more manageable. The manufacture recommended coffee to control red. I followed the dosage and after 1 hour my hair was too dry. I went under&lt;br /&gt;the sink and put a lot more water on top of the henna. After 3 hours I washed it off. When coming my hair many dark flecks fell into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Either I did not mix it properly or the mixture did not have enough liquid. I love the color. There is no red. The body of my hair is amazing and&lt;br /&gt;shiny. I am a customer for life.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Henna has so many benefits but YOU CANNOT BLEACH OR USE REGULAR COLOR OVER IT. It will turn green/turquoise/purple, depending on what colors you are have used and are using. Chemical color over henna will literally disintegrate your hair. So think long and hard. Even if you highlight 6 - 12 months down the road it will still happen. You have to grow it all the way out. If you darken with henna bleach is the only way to lighten which you cannot do. No salon can fix it either</li>
            <li> My package arrived a week early.  I love em&#x27;</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, no business</li>
            <li> DIssatisfied that this product doesn&#x27;t cover gray as much even though I left it in longer as instructed.</li>
