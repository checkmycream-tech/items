    <ol>
            <li>This is an awesome product line --I</li>
            <li>I was buying this product as a gift for a friend of mine who thinks this is the greatest eye treatment around.  </li>
            <li>Great price too!</li>
            <li>being said, the price here on Amazon is the best deal.  </li>
            <li>this product its wonderful because it really good for under eye</li>
            <li>So happy with results.</li>
            <li>It seems like a great idea, all those ingredients to de-puff your eyes.</li>
            <li>This is great to reduce puffiness under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great for an occasion.  </li>
            <li>I hope to continue seeing great results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this product has worked great for me, and the results overcame my caution about spending close to $70 on 12 pair of ampules.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know HOW this works, but it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>This worked good</li>
            <li>After cleansing with my Yes to Blueberries cloth, I dab this under my eyes (one pot fits both eyes, so each pack is good for 2 uses).  </li>
            <li>but looks good.  </li>
            <li>But, when I want to look good, I give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I look like Rocky Balboa after a good beating from Dolph Lundgren.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The brand&#x27;s own website often runs spectacular deals, so always check there before buying elsewhere!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>

            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>the skin around my eyes look bright and healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice cooling eye mask but my puffy eyes are still puffy......</li>
            <li>It would be nice if this was a product that improves that part of your eye the longer you use it.  </li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>and I liked that, because I felt like it was working.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a great way to look fresher quickly.</li>
            <li>Thrilled with product, ordering more now.</li>
            <li>Not terribly, but somewhat.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>This eye treatment is okay.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will keep using it until it&#x27;s gone, but won&#x27;t order any more.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This makes the eye area nice and smooth and tighter looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it until box runs out and know more then.</li>
            <li>Regardless I&#x27;ll probably purchase again :)</li>
            <li>am sold on this product and will make sure to keep it stocked in my vanity.</li>
            <li>love the service and product&lt;</li>
            <li>I love that I can already see a difference.</li>
            <li>Love all Glamglow products ...</li>
            <li>a week on a special occasion etc, is a nice treat.</li>
            <li>After about 10-15 minutes, it wipes off easily.  </li>
            <li>Im glad I didn&#x27;t pay full retail otherwise</li>
            <li>The darkness is still there and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have some fine lines under my eyes that are genetic and not from age, I knew that the mud would not take care of these.  </li>
            <li>Reduces puffiness and fine lines.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and take off, it smells great and only takes 3 min!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference after using these.</li>
            <li>Works fabulously.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for those mornings when you need something that really works!!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change.</li>
            <li>Seems to make a significant difference in the area around my eye.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on them again, it&#x27;s pretty pricey for something I didn&#x27;t feel did anything more than tingle a bit.</li>
            <li>I only wish it was more affordable, then I could use it more often!</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this from Sephora, and I was excited about it because I like the THIRSTYMUD.</li>
            <li>Traditional serums tend to yield more favorable results in my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>On application, it is cool and tingly.  </li>
            <li>in love with it ,, but its not affect that much ,, it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d pay full price for this again tho.</li>
            <li>It comes in a cool looking box, but the product just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li>I really like the GlamGlow face mask, so I was very excited to try this eye treatment.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re perfect for early mornings or a morning after a few too many adult beverages:)</li>
            <li>I first saw this product at Neiman Marcus  when I received it as a free sample.  </li>
            <li>The results are so much better than when going to a professional salon</li>
            <li>On use, it leaves your &amp;#34;occular&amp;#34; skin fresh and dewy.  </li>
            <li>I found that if I don&#x27;t follow with a warm washcloth, some of it stays around and gets mixed in with my under eye cover up.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth it</li>
            <li>one &amp;#34;tub&amp;#34; works fine for two eyes and that makes the product (which isn&#x27;t exactly cheap) last much longer!</li>
            <li>having been said, I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>I like how I look in the first hour or so....</li>
            <li>Makes the entire eye area look better and</li>
            <li>I am able to use one side of the eye containter for both of my eyes to make it last longer.</li>
            <li>It makes my under-eye smooth and clear, helps with darkness.  </li>
            <li>When I first put it on there was tingling</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my first packet of Glamglow Brightmud Eye Treatment as part of the multi-product sample pack.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product I ever used that has made an impact on my under-eye bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really think it works!  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>i use them after a long day at work before dinner with my boyfriend and I look noticeably more awake.</li>
            <li>not sure if it&#x27;s good on that.  </li>
            <li>If I use them too often, that is when I can tell the area is a bit more dry and sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cost is a little more but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I like it because it works fast and lasts for about 2 1/2 days after using.</li>
            <li>The way to apply it is very novelty.</li>
            <li>I use another eye cream by Rodan &amp; Fields, which really makes my eyes pop.</li>
            <li>and I really like their masks.  </li>
            <li>pod will do both eyes, too much for one eye.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They really make a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t see that much of difference.  </li>
            <li>I dont see any difference after I consumed the whole thing.</li>
            <li>they really reduce the swelling around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It really brightens the eye area.  </li>
            <li>I used it again two days later before an important meeting, then again three days after that.  </li>
            <li>If you are thinking of trying it out, def buy from Amazon, it&#x27;s much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>This product really helps me to look refreshed so that I can go out in the evening and look rested.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.  </li>
            <li>I liked the treatment, but would not use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>are other brands that do much better than this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love these eye treatment pods, as well as other GlamGlow products.</li>
            <li>For me, this is not anything more than using a lot of other face creams and products.  </li>
            <li>okay, for the price, it is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li>I have noticed a change in my dark circles, the color has become lighter and the skin around my eyes more taught.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how effective this is for wrinkle correction but after each use my eyes look less puffy and more alert.</li>
            <li>I bought this with such success with Glam Glow mask treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are worth every last penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i only use one eye&#x27;s worth on both eyes.</li>
            <li>My other eye is not nearly as bad, and did not notice much of a difference there at all.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li>Not for anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Each time you use it is like the first time only.</li>
            <li>I tried this as a sample first (got it from the local mall).  </li>
            <li>The effect is most intense while the product is on the eye area, and then there is a very, very slight tingle for a short time after removing the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a lasting overall treatment, just a quick fix remedy when you need it.</li>
            <li>I wiped it off and tried to soothe my skin with some pure coconut oil, but I have red puffy bags now that I&#x27;m praying will be gone in the morning.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not one to be daunted after two tries... and the box does arrive with dozen little double eye dots, so again I attempt the bright eyed insta-glow promised... to wait, what, backstage results?</li>
            <li>So, you can get double the use out of each whole package.</li>
            <li>some people said and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I opened it, as I was expecting a cream.  </li>
            <li>This is the only thing that has ever accomplished it</li>
            <li>Whenever I use it I only need to apply one section of the packet, it is more than enough, plus it makes it last twice as long.</li>
            <li>Got this in my latest ipsy bag and was very excited to try it, but this stuff burns like crazy!</li>
            <li>I know this isn&#x27;t a huge issue and probably only a few people will be affected, but with applying it to an area so close to my nose</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d compare the under-eye tingle to apply lotion to freshly exfoliated (or slightly windburned) skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing, but I really didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my eyes being less puffy or diminished dark circles, which I have plenty of both thanks to allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but apparently it does nothing to it.</li>
            <li>I get dark circles under my eyes sometimes and this product really does make me look refreshed!  </li>
            <li>36 YO female, moisturized my face my whole life, haven&#x27;t spent time in the sun in about 8 years.</li>
            <li>I understand there is mild tingling expected as the active ingredients do their job, but I am nervous to try this again.  </li>
            <li>But, alright, the first usage my eye are felt a little tingly, but didn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li>I try to be very gentle with the skin around my eyes, and this was too harsh.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very dry winter climate.</li>
            <li>Or maybe it&#x27;s a placebo due to the ridiculously high price.</li>
            <li>This product definitely pulled the skin tight because there wasn&#x27;t as much movement under the eye when I tested it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t notice a difference using this stuff, and it did burn my skin a little.</li>

            <li> i use them after a long day at work before dinner with my boyfriend and I look noticeably more awake.</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s good on that.  </li>
            <li> If I use them too often, that is when I can tell the area is a bit more dry and sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cost is a little more but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I like it because it works fast and lasts for about 2 1/2 days after using.</li>
            <li> The way to apply it is very novelty.</li>
            <li> I use another eye cream by Rodan &amp; Fields, which really makes my eyes pop.</li>
            <li> and I really like their masks.  </li>
            <li> pod will do both eyes, too much for one eye.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They really make a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see that much of difference.  </li>
            <li> I dont see any difference after I consumed the whole thing.</li>
            <li> they really reduce the swelling around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It really brightens the eye area.  </li>
            <li> I used it again two days later before an important meeting, then again three days after that.  </li>
            <li> If you are thinking of trying it out, def buy from Amazon, it&#x27;s much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> This product really helps me to look refreshed so that I can go out in the evening and look rested.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied.  </li>
            <li> I liked the treatment, but would not use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> are other brands that do much better than this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love these eye treatment pods, as well as other GlamGlow products.</li>
            <li> For me, this is not anything more than using a lot of other face creams and products.  </li>
            <li> okay, for the price, it is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li> I have noticed a change in my dark circles, the color has become lighter and the skin around my eyes more taught.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how effective this is for wrinkle correction but after each use my eyes look less puffy and more alert.</li>
            <li> I bought this with such success with Glam Glow mask treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are worth every last penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i only use one eye&#x27;s worth on both eyes.</li>
            <li> My other eye is not nearly as bad, and did not notice much of a difference there at all.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li> Not for anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Each time you use it is like the first time only.</li>
            <li> I tried this as a sample first (got it from the local mall).  </li>
            <li> The effect is most intense while the product is on the eye area, and then there is a very, very slight tingle for a short time after removing the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a lasting overall treatment, just a quick fix remedy when you need it.</li>
            <li> I wiped it off and tried to soothe my skin with some pure coconut oil, but I have red puffy bags now that I&#x27;m praying will be gone in the morning.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not one to be daunted after two tries... and the box does arrive with dozen little double eye dots, so again I attempt the bright eyed insta-glow promised... to wait, what, backstage results?</li>
            <li> So, you can get double the use out of each whole package.</li>
            <li> some people said and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I opened it, as I was expecting a cream.  </li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has ever accomplished it</li>
            <li> Whenever I use it I only need to apply one section of the packet, it is more than enough, plus it makes it last twice as long.</li>
            <li> Got this in my latest ipsy bag and was very excited to try it, but this stuff burns like crazy!</li>
            <li> I know this isn&#x27;t a huge issue and probably only a few people will be affected, but with applying it to an area so close to my nose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d compare the under-eye tingle to apply lotion to freshly exfoliated (or slightly windburned) skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing, but I really didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my eyes being less puffy or diminished dark circles, which I have plenty of both thanks to allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but apparently it does nothing to it.</li>
            <li> I get dark circles under my eyes sometimes and this product really does make me look refreshed!  </li>
            <li> 36 YO female, moisturized my face my whole life, haven&#x27;t spent time in the sun in about 8 years.</li>
            <li> I understand there is mild tingling expected as the active ingredients do their job, but I am nervous to try this again.  </li>
            <li> But, alright, the first usage my eye are felt a little tingly, but didn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li> I try to be very gentle with the skin around my eyes, and this was too harsh.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very dry winter climate.</li>
            <li> Or maybe it&#x27;s a placebo due to the ridiculously high price.</li>
            <li> This product definitely pulled the skin tight because there wasn&#x27;t as much movement under the eye when I tested it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t notice a difference using this stuff, and it did burn my skin a little.</li>
            <li> eye area is sensitive and I have to be very careful what products I use.</li>
            <li> When you take out a pod set, only open one side and apply it to both eyes - there is plenty there - and then save the other pod for next time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is enough product in each single pod to do both eyes.</li>
            <li> I really get the circles when I&#x27;ve been working too hard all day long.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone is medium to dark, and I don&#x27;t normally wake up with dark circles...</li>
            <li> I am 30 year old with eye bags and dark circles, while it may not help with the dark circles, it can provide a temporary fix for eye bags, especially if you have to go out on the day itself, but its not a product I see working for long term or removing eye bags.</li>
            <li> I waited three minuets, and looked in the mirror for my minor moisturizing miracle, and there was none.&lt;br /&gt;Okay</li>
            <li> At the minute and a half mark I could actually see that my skin was getting red and swollen</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I can really see the puffiness under my eyes decrease, other times, I&#x27;m not sure I see anything at all.</li>
            <li> You can feel the very slight tingle - my eyes are extremely sensitive and this does not bother them - and should remove it after the 3 minutes as stated in the instructions.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from deep under-eye bags since I was a teenager, and as I get older they only get worse.  </li>
            <li> There is ample product to use one single ampule (one half of the package) on both eyes for me, so the product actually stretches to double the use in the package.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I understand from other reviews that this effect is cumulative and overall puffiness improves as you use the product, so</li>
            <li> After I had used it I looked at the reviews and lots of other people had a similar reaction.</li>
            <li> they are a very strange texture and they sting after a minute.</li>
            <li> They can tend to dry out the eye area if used too often.</li>
            <li> clear dark circles and even dark patches on my face!</li>
            <li> Overall the circles seem diminished and less puffy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste an entire container on one use, a lot of reviewers claim this irritated their eyes.</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Any product with caffeine can do what this one promises minus the hype.</li>
            <li> Not what I had expected based on reviews</li>
            <li> Cue, the wet wipes and mirror miracle check.</li>
            <li> The product is not overwhelmingly scented, what scent there is is slight and natural.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement under my eyes.</li>
            <li> However, I never received it and had to buy her something else due to the time factor.</li>
            <li> I am the type of person who will invest in longer-term beauty treatments, like laser treatments or peels, before I spend on lotions and potions, having been disappointed by so many of them in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little dry.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t dark circles, so I can&#x27;t attest to its efficacy in eradicating those.  </li>
            <li> (I was hoping it would shrink under eye bags and help with dark circles.)</li>
            <li> For what it costs, not worth over using.</li>
            <li> One of my eyes has been chronically puffy and dark for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ingredients include moisturizers for lines &amp; caffeine which can help dark circles.</li>
            <li> It may work for some people but it&#x27;s not worth the price for me.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I thought this eye treatment will help reducing my under eye dark circles</li>
            <li> I might have waited longer than three minuets, which is enough time for it to dry into a thick hard to wipe off goo.</li>
            <li> I use half a container for both eyes, and it works as it should.</li>
            <li> I was basically looking for a tighter skin under the eyes because when I run my finger under there, my skin is not super taught.  </li>
            <li> I came home and found it on Amazon and purchased it (less than at NM).  </li>
            <li> I dislike wiping around my eye, and typically avoid it</li>
            <li> I did feel some tingle, but it was not a bad or painful feeling.</li>
            <li> and I am still shocked at how quickly it worked.  </li>
            <li> but I found it a little pricey</li>
            <li> Helped a little, but did not do what it promised.</li>
            <li> I almost think the bags look a little puffier.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> the result shows after few seconds</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It feels a little tingly, and i usually leave it for about 20 mins until it hardens and soften it with water and massage it into my eyes before washing it off.</li>
            <li> but right now am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was too lazy to return it, so I just threw it away.</li>
            <li> The texture is a thick gel with dried herbs.</li>
            <li> , maybe it takes a few uses!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I need this</li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed by how much it burned on application.  </li>
            <li> use this every time I go out or at least once a week for work.</li>
            <li> All in all, not impressed, not worth the what I paid</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel tight as in an uncomfortable way, but it looks tighter, firmer.</li>
            <li> This product was very irritating and after using it for a few days my undereyes looked darker rather than lighter.</li>
            <li> had read the reviews and was a little afraid because I had seen where it had burnt one of the customers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t promise long-time changes and I&#x27;m afraid it might speed up aging if you were to use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I think it is very expensive for what you get, but that is typical of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I feel the need to lay down because the smell makes me sick.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if anything, it made me worse.</li>
            <li> seems it doesn&#x27;t work for me a lot, may my eyebags are too black :-(</li>
            <li> , sorry.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Lots packaging for a mediocre product.</li>
            <li> and it means ill</li>
            <li> Such a nasty product, I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this to an eye product before.</li>
            <li> was so disappointed with the results and spending 69.00.&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li> Tried it and hated it.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A lot of money and no changes. It&#x27;s a nice cooling eye mask but my puffy eyes are still puffy......</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Works really well.</li>
            <li> Recommend it to all, amazing product. . . . . . . . . ., , , , , , , ,</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product line --I have all of their masks for face and eyes and I can&#x27;t live without them. The results are so much better than when going to a professional salon --and I have been to many.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every time I go out or at least once a week for work.</li>
            <li> This worked good but I found it a little pricey</li>
            <li> 4 stars b/c it&#x27;s pricey.  That having been said, I like this product very much.  It has a gel-like consistency with visible herbal bits.  On application, it is cool and tingly.  After about 10-15 minutes, it wipes off easily.  The product is not overwhelmingly scented, what scent there is is slight and natural.  Oh, and you needn&#x27;t use both tins at once, one is sufficient for both eyes.  On use, it leaves your &amp;#34;occular&amp;#34; skin fresh and dewy.  I haven&#x27;t dark circles, so I can&#x27;t attest to its efficacy in eradicating those.  I always feel refreshed afterwards.</li>
            <li> This product refreshes the eyes and will reduce any puffiness. I like it because it works fast and lasts for about 2 1/2 days after using. I can see the effects immediately and takes only 3 minutes per eye. I also like that the eye product is individually wrapped -- a plus for any eye product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pricey eye cream product. The way to apply it is very novelty. Other than that, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement under my eyes. The darkness is still there and fine lines. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Temporary fix to permanent eye bags. I am 30 year old with eye bags and dark circles, while it may not help with the dark circles, it can provide a temporary fix for eye bags, especially if you have to go out on the day itself, but its not a product I see working for long term or removing eye bags. It comes in mini foil containers for the two eyes, but one of the two seems to be sufficient for one eye. It feels a little tingly, and i usually leave it for about 20 mins until it hardens and soften it with water and massage it into my eyes before washing it off.</li>
            <li> Got this in my latest ipsy bag and was very excited to try it, but this stuff burns like crazy! Not for anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Oh my word. Amazing product. How does it work? I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t care. So happy with results.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for the puffiness under my eyes</li>
            <li> I was buying this product as a gift for a friend of mine who thinks this is the greatest eye treatment around.  However, I never received it and had to buy her something else due to the time factor.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any improvement in puffiness. Would not repurchase</li>
            <li> I get bags in the morning from allergies, that&#x27;s why I bought this. It seems like a great idea, all those ingredients to de-puff your eyes. Unfortunately, if anything, it made me worse. I was probably allergic to something in this.</li>
            <li> clear dark circles and even dark patches on my face!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend recommended it. I&#x27;ve been prepping my skin for my upcoming wedding (even have my fianc&amp;eacute; using it). Works fabulously. Great price too!</li>
            <li> I really like the GlamGlow face mask, so I was very excited to try this eye treatment.  However, I was disappointed by how much it burned on application.  I understand there is mild tingling expected as the active ingredients do their job, but I am nervous to try this again.  I try to be very gentle with the skin around my eyes, and this was too harsh.  I think I&#x27;ll just stick to the mask.</li>
            <li> 36 YO female, moisturized my face my whole life, haven&#x27;t spent time in the sun in about 8 years. I live in a very dry winter climate. I really couldn&#x27;t notice a difference using this stuff, and it did burn my skin a little. Not terribly, but somewhat. I&#x27;m moving on to the next thing. (I was hoping it would shrink under eye bags and help with dark circles.)</li>
            <li> this product its wonderful because it really good for under eye the result shows after few seconds i love it</li>
            <li> I like how I look in the first hour or so....the skin around my eyes look bright and healthy. but it does not last. It would be nice if this was a product that improves that part of your eye the longer you use it.  But it&#x27;s temporary. Each time you use it is like the first time only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give you one tip though-- one &amp;#34;tub&amp;#34; works fine for two eyes and that makes the product (which isn&#x27;t exactly cheap) last much longer!</li>
            <li> in love with it ,, but its not affect that much ,, it</li>
            <li> Definitely use sparingly. Don&#x27;t waste an entire container on one use, a lot of reviewers claim this irritated their eyes. I use half a container for both eyes, and it works as it should. For what it costs, not worth over using. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d pay full price for this again tho.</li>
            <li> This product is a dud. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I use another eye cream by Rodan &amp; Fields, which really makes my eyes pop. It comes in a cool looking box, but the product just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> works well - I think it is a lot for each eye and sometimes use one side of treatment bubble for both</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others of the Galmglow line and I really like their masks.  This eye treatment is okay.  It&#x27;s moisturizing, but I really didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my eyes being less puffy or diminished dark circles, which I have plenty of both thanks to allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it until it&#x27;s gone, but won&#x27;t order any more.</li>
            <li> I bought this with such success with Glam Glow mask treatments.&lt;br /&gt;It works okay, for the price, it is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Each pod will do both eyes, too much for one eye.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed softer skin under my eyes, but did nothing for bags and darkness.&lt;br /&gt;Did not \\&quot;brighten\\&quot; my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I was so disappointed with the results and spending 69.00.&lt;br /&gt;There are other brands that do much better than this.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy the face masks but not this, sorry.</li>
            <li> One of my eyes has been chronically puffy and dark for years. It has been one of my biggest beauty issues. This came in a sample in one of my monthly sample boxes. Used last night for NYE and could not believe the difference in the one eye. My other eye is not nearly as bad, and did not notice much of a difference there at all. Thrilled with product, ordering more now.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Got a sample in a shipment of products and tried it. Works in just minutes to get rid of that morning puffy/tired look and I can&#x27;t do without it. Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;use every day&amp;#34; to see results product. It&#x27;s for those mornings when you need something that really works!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I like this product very much. It&#x27;s ingredients include moisturizers for lines &amp; caffeine which can help dark circles. I think it is very expensive for what you get, but that is typical of cosmetics. I knocked off a star for the pricing.</li>
            <li> I love these eye treatment pods, as well as other GlamGlow products. It is a brand that makes products that actually work. They are worth every last penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is enough product in each single pod to do both eyes. So, you can get double the use out of each whole package. When you take out a pod set, only open one side and apply it to both eyes - there is plenty there - and then save the other pod for next time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes the eye area nice and smooth and tighter looking. It doesn&#x27;t feel tight as in an uncomfortable way, but it looks tighter, firmer. Makes the entire eye area look better and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use these occasionally. They can tend to dry out the eye area if used too often. I did feel some tingle, but it was not a bad or painful feeling. I liked it actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eye area is sensitive and I have to be very careful what products I use. These do not cause any irritation or inflammation. If I use them too often, that is when I can tell the area is a bit more dry and sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a week on a special occasion etc, is a nice treat. They really make a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brand&#x27;s own website often runs spectacular deals, so always check there before buying elsewhere!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this I have used it and I don&#x27;t feel it does what it was advertised to do</li>
            <li> This is great to reduce puffiness under the eyes.  I am able to use one side of the eye containter for both of my eyes to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference after using these. It didn&#x27;t burn like some people said and I have sensitive skin. It may work for some people but it&#x27;s not worth the price for me.</li>
            <li> This product was very irritating and after using it for a few days my undereyes looked darker rather than lighter. I was too lazy to return it, so I just threw it away. It was a total waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money. I do not recommend leaving residue on after tissuing product off. Made my eyes look puffier and kind of like a crazy person. Any product with caffeine can do what this one promises minus the hype. Im glad I didn&#x27;t pay full retail otherwise I would have returned it. Traditional serums tend to yield more favorable results in my honest opinion. The cost is a little more but the results are worth it. All in all, not impressed, not worth the what I paid plus it took longer to arrive than I expended. Bummer</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know HOW this works, but it&#x27;s amazing! After cleansing with my Yes to Blueberries cloth, I dab this under my eyes (one pot fits both eyes, so each pack is good for 2 uses).  After 3 minutes I wipe it off and continue with moisturizer and makeup. It makes my under-eye smooth and clear, helps with darkness.  I don&#x27;t have bags, so not sure if it&#x27;s good on that.  I only use it when I&#x27;m going out - it isn&#x27;t a regular treatment (don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s cumulative in effect) but it&#x27;s great for an occasion.  Will keep it on hand!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try some products from glamglow and I got a sample of this eye mask treatment.  I was surprised when I opened it, as I was expecting a cream.  It is a muddy-looking gel, hence the name &amp;#34;bright mud.&amp;#34;  I have some fine lines under my eyes that are genetic and not from age, I knew that the mud would not take care of these.  I was basically looking for a tighter skin under the eyes because when I run my finger under there, my skin is not super taught.  This product definitely pulled the skin tight because there wasn&#x27;t as much movement under the eye when I tested it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the price here on Amazon is the best deal.  I would pay 40 dollars for this product if I had a really big problem with my under eyes, but I would NOT pay 69 for it.  When I first put it on there was tingling and I liked that, because I felt like it was working.  I liked the treatment, but would not use it everyday.  It doesn&#x27;t promise long-time changes and I&#x27;m afraid it might speed up aging if you were to use it everyday.  However, there&#x27;s no information on the longevity of this product.</li>
            <li> I used it one time and i notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I am the type of person who will invest in longer-term beauty treatments, like laser treatments or peels, before I spend on lotions and potions, having been disappointed by so many of them in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my first packet of Glamglow Brightmud Eye Treatment as part of the multi-product sample pack.  I was skeptical.  I have suffered from deep under-eye bags since I was a teenager, and as I get older they only get worse.  I have never used a product that made an impact.  This is the first product I ever used that has made an impact on my under-eye bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things I have found in using this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There is ample product to use one single ampule (one half of the package) on both eyes for me, so the product actually stretches to double the use in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There is a tingle.  For me, this is not anything more than using a lot of other face creams and products.  I&#x27;d compare the under-eye tingle to apply lotion to freshly exfoliated (or slightly windburned) skin.  The effect is most intense while the product is on the eye area, and then there is a very, very slight tingle for a short time after removing the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve used 4 applications of this product 2 days apart.  As soon as I apply the product, I can see a noticeable decrease in puffiness.  I understand from other reviews that this effect is cumulative and overall puffiness improves as you use the product, so I hope to continue seeing great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product has worked great for me, and the results overcame my caution about spending close to $70 on 12 pair of ampules.</li>
            <li> Still trying to decide if it&#x27;s working for me. Jury remains out. I&#x27;ll give it until box runs out and know more then. Halfway through it.</li>
            <li> Meh. Not worth the price. Lots packaging for a mediocre product. Helped a little, but did not do what it promised.</li>
            <li> a little dry. but looks good.  didn&#x27;t see that much of difference.  I guess it will take time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the holiday season hoping it would help with lack of sleep and hangover eyes. I really think it works!  I only use one pod but I can use it on both eyes twice.</li>
            <li> I dont see any difference after I consumed the whole thing.</li>
            <li> i have no idea how these work. they are a very strange texture and they sting after a minute. i only use one eye&#x27;s worth on both eyes. i think thats all i need and it means ill get 2x the uses out of the box. i use them after a long day at work before dinner with my boyfriend and I look noticeably more awake. they really reduce the swelling around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it helped my eyes at all!</li>
            <li> it works but only last for one day</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any different, even after multiple uses.</li>
            <li> Seems to make a significant difference in the area around my eye. Overall the circles seem diminished and less puffy. Or maybe it&#x27;s a placebo due to the ridiculously high price. Regardless I&#x27;ll probably purchase again :)</li>
            <li> I first saw this product at Neiman Marcus  when I received it as a free sample.  I came home and found it on Amazon and purchased it (less than at NM).  I LOVE this product!  It really brightens the eye area.  It lasts a couple of days too.  I have also found that I can use one cup for both eyes which makes the product last longer.  I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing! This is the only product I can actually see a diffrence with.</li>
            <li> I have tried for years to find a product that gets rid of the bumpy &amp;#34;chicken&amp;#34; skin under my eyes.  This is the only thing that has ever accomplished it and I am still shocked at how quickly it worked.  After removing the mud (and I followed the advice of others and used just one pod for both eyes) I moisturized then started applying my makeup.  The bumpiness was almost entirely gone soon after removal of the product, and entirely gone by the time I applied my finishing powder!  I used it again two days later before an important meeting, then again three days after that.  I&#x27;m three days out from that now and will probably use it tomorrow morning.  However, I believe the bumpy texture has improved over where it was to begin with so I am hopeful that will continue.&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on this product and will make sure to keep it stocked in my vanity.</li>
            <li> I thought this eye treatment will help reducing my under eye dark circles but apparently it does nothing to it. However, i did feel my under eye become smoother after the treatment.</li>
            <li> Read about this product in a magazine and it sounded like it might work.  Read some reviews on Amazon and it appears to have worked for some.  For one thing, you only leave the goop on for 3 minutes then wipe off.  You are supposed to get instant results.  Well, I guess we are all different but it did NOT work at all.  I almost think the bags look a little puffier.  Will give it another try tomorrow but right now am disappointed.</li>
            <li> love the service and product&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s changed my life!!!</li>
            <li> The smell makes me nauseous. I know this isn&#x27;t a huge issue and probably only a few people will be affected, but with applying it to an area so close to my nose I feel the need to lay down because the smell makes me sick. Had no results from using this.</li>
            <li> Not what I had expected based on reviews</li>
            <li> Immediately see a difference. I don&#x27;t think it lasts but it&#x27;s a great way to look fresher quickly. Reduces puffiness and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I love that I can already see a difference. Would definitely get this again</li>
            <li> One word, yuck. The texture is a thick gel with dried herbs. The instructions say to pat on, wait three minuets and wipe off. I dislike wiping around my eye, and typically avoid it so I don&#x27;t tug at the skin. But, alright, the first usage my eye are felt a little tingly, but didn&#x27;t sting. I waited three minuets, and looked in the mirror for my minor moisturizing miracle, and there was none.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, maybe it takes a few uses! So I tried again. I might have waited longer than three minuets, which is enough time for it to dry into a thick hard to wipe off goo. Cue, the wet wipes and mirror miracle check. Again with the nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m not one to be daunted after two tries... and the box does arrive with dozen little double eye dots, so again I attempt the bright eyed insta-glow promised... to wait, what, backstage results? Maybe my problem is I&#x27;m not a model. :/&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I didn&#x27;t get the results from this that I was hoping, or thought I would. I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on them again, it&#x27;s pretty pricey for something I didn&#x27;t feel did anything more than tingle a bit.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference. In fact, it irritated my eye area. Boo!</li>
            <li> As all the reviews say, it works for about 2-4 hours. Sometimes, I can really see the puffiness under my eyes decrease, other times, I&#x27;m not sure I see anything at all. But, when I want to look good, I give it a shot. You can feel the very slight tingle - my eyes are extremely sensitive and this does not bother them - and should remove it after the 3 minutes as stated in the instructions. I found that if I don&#x27;t follow with a warm washcloth, some of it stays around and gets mixed in with my under eye cover up.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is easy to apply and take off, it smells great and only takes 3 min! Whenever I use it I only need to apply one section of the packet, it is more than enough, plus it makes it last twice as long. I have noticed a change in my dark circles, the color has become lighter and the skin around my eyes more taught. I only wish it was more affordable, then I could use it more often!</li>
            <li> seems it doesn&#x27;t work for me a lot, may my eyebags are too black :-(</li>
            <li> The delivery time was fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I had read the reviews and was a little afraid because I had seen where it had burnt one of the customers.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had that issue.&lt;br /&gt;However , I have only used the product a couple of times and it Seems to work until you put your makeup on.&lt;br /&gt; The instructions indicate that you can use under makeup but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well after you apply your makeup.</li>
            <li> Received a sample of this product through Ipsy.  Tried it and hated it.  It burned my skin when I put it on and they next day my eyes looked swollen and burned around and the skin around my eyes hurt to touch. I look like Rocky Balboa after a good beating from Dolph Lundgren.  I do not recommend this product. After I had used it I looked at the reviews and lots of other people had a similar reaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30. I&#x27;m not sure I need this but I like the masks so I thought to buy it. I don&#x27;t see any difference. If you are thinking of trying it out, def buy from Amazon, it&#x27;s much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I could not tell this did anything.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this from Sephora, and I was excited about it because I like the THIRSTYMUD. Within 10 seconds of me applying just one of the pods under both eyes, it started burning. At the minute and a half mark I could actually see that my skin was getting red and swollen so I rinsed it off immediately. I wiped it off and tried to soothe my skin with some pure coconut oil, but I have red puffy bags now that I&#x27;m praying will be gone in the morning. Such a nasty product, I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this to an eye product before.</li>
            <li> I love these! They&#x27;re perfect for early mornings or a morning after a few too many adult beverages:) It&#x27;s not a lasting overall treatment, just a quick fix remedy when you need it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some of the reviews on this product and they&#x27;re all over the chart.  I tried this as a sample first (got it from the local mall).  It works very well for me.  I get dark circles under my eyes sometimes and this product really does make me look refreshed!  My skin tone is medium to dark, and I don&#x27;t normally wake up with dark circles... I really get the circles when I&#x27;ve been working too hard all day long.  This product really helps me to look refreshed so that I can go out in the evening and look rested. ;)  I only use 1/2 at a time which does help make it last longer.  I also only use it a couple of times per week (as instructed).  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how effective this is for wrinkle correction but after each use my eyes look less puffy and more alert. I find that one side is plenty for both eyes so a 30 day supply lasts me two months</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth it</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied.  Did not work on my puffy eyes at all.  Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Love all Glamglow products ...</li>
