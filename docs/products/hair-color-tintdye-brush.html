            <li> this made it harder to apply the color on the ends because i have really long hair. It did help with mixing the dye and applying on my roots and bangs. I prefer just using rubber gloves in general though.</li>

            <li> Works great and has a lot of control.</li>
            <li> My daughter applied the color to  my hair and prefers not to use the brush.  No rating at this time.</li>

            <li> I got this, but I never needed to use it. For that reason, I cannot really make a worthwhile review.</li>
            <li> I just wish that the brush is a bit softer, it would be easier for applications. I does it&#x27;s job so it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Good service, I received the tint brush promptly and its a good one. Thankyou very much I will get good use of it, they dont sell these here in a small town.</li>
            <li> I got this a while ago and it&#x27;s lasted very well it&#x27;s great for dyeing hair especially with manic panic and it&#x27;s a good product I recommend</li>
            <li> Was able to spread my hair dye easily with it.</li>

            <li> I think this brushes did the job quite efficiently, definitely will be using mine whenever I dye my hair at home!</li>
            <li> Works well; easier than using the bottle tip and your fingers to spread the dye. No problem to clean up.</li>
            <li> It is a hair coloring brush..did its job.  I cleaned it and will use again. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> These are inexpensive and work very well.  Makes all the difference when you are dying your hair at home. I think you can get the dye into your roots better.</li>
            <li> I bleached, then colored my hair violet.  I used the brush for the bleaching process, not the put the color in my hair.  It needed to to be worked into my hair more then the brush could do.</li>
            <li> Loved this brush.Did the job well !!</li>
            <li> Very cheap made, but gets the job done.</li>
