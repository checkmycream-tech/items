            <li>Very good thanks</li>
            <li>good product, fast shipping, happy customer :)</li>
            <li>As an avid coffee, tea and wine drinker, I&#x27;m happy to report that both products whitened my teeth considerably better in a shorter period of time.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I defy you to show me some better toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>(However, the tube could include more toothpaste-</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>They should come out with more flavors.</li>
            <li>We have been using Rembrandt for years and love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a more premium toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I switched to this brand after using Crest for many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 3 days with this toothpaste (and the accompanying mouthwash, which I also LOVE) and my teeth are already noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li>You might consider investing your hard-earned money into a more quality toothpaste.</li>
            <li>But,in this case buying at the store is probably the better bet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon has them.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering them more.</li>
            <li>My wife and I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve tried many).  </li>
            <li>The taste is also our favorite of all the toothpastes we have had.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through so many others.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sincerely telling you the truth...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been following the best recommended use</li>
            <li>so I used a home remedy that worked better</li>
            <li>my teeth are going to get more and more</li>
            <li>But i  notice most places that carry this are eithr way pricey-er</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is really excellent for helping eliminate stains from coffee, tea, red wine, etc.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than any of the many toothpastes I have tried.  </li>
            <li>So glad to get this quality, will buy again.</li>
            <li>but stll ok to try</li>
            <li>But this honestly didn&#x27;t work as significantly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Rembrandt is the best and you can have a concrete proof right from when you start using it!&lt;br /&gt;Dyno</li>
            <li>Enjoy the idea of being able to order as many tubes that I want.</li>
            <li>If this is true, they certainly made a drastic mistake by discontinuing their most successful and well-liked product.</li>
            <li>Great product and shipped professionally</li>
            <li>and so glad it is available on line.  </li>
            <li>And the most convenient with guaranteed of genuine product.</li>
            <li>I have enjoy using it and  love the mint flavor.</li>
            <li>If it is a cost saving change, they will probably wind up losing some very loyal customers.</li>
            <li>I love how clean it makes your mouth feel.</li>
            <li>And I love that my mouth still feels clean when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>Does a great job at removing stains, much better than regular whitening toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>yes, great price, great item, getting harder to find in my local shops so ideal really.</li>
            <li>Strong mint flavor.</li>
            <li>Works okay nothing special...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so impressed with the fact the flavor is not overpowering like other brands but get your teeth almost squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s handy to be able to buy several at a time at a pretty good price.  </li>
            <li>whitener available for a self application by toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;Forget</li>
            <li>Well I honestly tell you, after one months use morning and night faithfully, I haven&#x27;t noticed much diffference at all.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled to find this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>The fact that Johnson &amp; Johnson is marketing this as still a premium brand in the original box at a premium price makes me feel cheated.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve gotten significantly whiter, I probably would have noticed.</li>
            <li>This did not make my teeth sensitive, yet cleaned the coffee stains better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for years and loved it - it keeps my pearly whites white.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even bother with white strips anymore because this combined with a good electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>This toothpaste keeps my teeth white and tastes good.</li>
            <li>They are full with air instead of toothpaste and when I took out the air</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really curious as to why a very effective and user-friendly product would be discontinued.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal user for years now.</li>
            <li>I bought the Intense at drugstore.com and got the Peroxide Plus as a free sample.</li>
            <li>I drink tons of coffee, Rembrandt has kept my teeth stain free and much whiter.</li>
            <li>but well worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the Intense should be reformulated to make it more of a paste, or else repackaged in an upright bottle with a smaller, more controlled applicator.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth your money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far our favorite</li>
            <li>I had to occasionally place my warm tongue over them to stop the hurting on occasion.  </li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I got it and used it right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about clean teeth, &amp; also not harming them with abrasive products.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothpaste for whitening especially if you drink coffee, tea, red wine.</li>
            <li>This works great for getting my teeth very white in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about the product was that it had a very, very runny texture.</li>
            <li>I have used used a variety of different toothpastes, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used a toothpaste for more than a month.</li>
            <li>So, I was pretty hesitant in ordering a 3 pack.</li>
            <li>With Rembrandt toothpaste, I&#x27;ve been able to keep the stains at bay and keep my teeth mostly white.  </li>
            <li>Really helped my husbands coffee stains!</li>
            <li>Keeps my mouth fresh for hours--teeth feel really clean, and breath really fresh hours later.</li>
            <li>but maybe you&#x27;ll be one of those folks who get instant bright white teeth!  </li>
            <li>I could not see any difference in efficacy between Intense and Plus Peroxide and they have a similar mint flavor, which I love.</li>
            <li>I really like the Rembrandt Intense Stain Toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Any time I try to use another toothpaste I pretty much freak out and have to brush my teeth again.</li>
            <li>The new list was more like my wife&#x27;s regular Colgate toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I was kind of hesitant to purchase due to the high price.</li>
            <li>First of all, I love that the paste foams up as soon as you start brushing; unlike other pastes, where I find myself in need of a lot of water to get a foamy consistency.</li>
            <li>Use the intense toothpaste and Rembrandt intense toothpaste twice a day.  </li>
            <li>So much for saving a couple dollars.</li>
            <li>It really does what it says, and, refreshes one&#x27;s mouth very well.  </li>
            <li>Yet with Rembrandt Intense Stain, I could see a difference after just one brushing.</li>
            <li>When I used it my mouth burned so much that I threw out all the remainder.</li>
            <li>Intense stain has a gentle amount of abrasion, and yet cleans and whitens.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too high!</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t really paid attention to whether my teeth look whiter or not.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is not helping with intense coffee stains.  </li>
            <li>It literally takes the coffee stains out without too much brushing.  </li>
            <li>I am very unsatisfied by the product.</li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed and I will never buy again.</li>
            <li>Didnt notice much improvement in tar stains from this toothpaste</li>
            <li>far the toothpaste continues to be worth the price point for me.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Even though it costs a little more, I wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
            <li>A terrific product that used by sold far more prominently in supermarkets, pharmacies, and other outlets in the &#x27;90s.  </li>
            <li>I am on my second order, still I haven&#x27;t seen any significant result.</li>
            <li>and I think it works better than the other whitening pastes out there</li>
            <li>After using my latest tube of Rembrandt Intense Stain toothpaste for a month my teeth were getting yellower, I thought, so I compared the new tube with an old one- different shape.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I could buy this thru Amazon prime when it was less than 13.00 for a pack of 3.</li>
            <li>My dentist was so pleased with its low abrasion percentage, and said I could use it daily without harm.</li>
            <li>But this is hard to find in the stores, so was nice to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, the taste is fresh.</li>
            <li>EXCEPT lately the toothpaste seems to run out of the tube rather than squeeze out in a nice bead.  </li>
            <li>One theory is that Rembrandt changed hands and the new owners re-evaluated the stock.  </li>
            <li>I just started using this new toothpaste</li>
            <li>I finally found the only solution was to put the dab of toothpaste directly INTO my mouth then spread it around with the brush very quickly.</li>
            <li>And my teeth feel much cleaner in general.</li>
            <li>I compared the ingredients in the new formulation with the old.  </li>
            <li>Even though this specific version doesn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;cancer sore prevention&amp;#34; on the box, it certainly does minimize the occurrence.</li>
            <li>I hope they get this problem fixed soon.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>It did however cause my front teeth surfaces to be sensitive and ache, so</li>
            <li>Think I&#x27;ll be trying a natural toothpaste now.  </li>
            <li>Same price as in the store and a whole lot easier to get when it comes to your home.</li>
            <li>I will never waste money on this again.</li>
            <li>The last time I had dental cleaning was 6 months ago and my teeth still look amazingly clean and stain free (just tiny little spotting on the back of the teeth).</li>
            <li>Needless to say I trashed that junk right away and invested in something better.</li>
            <li>On top of that, my teeth are rough and stain easily due to the asthma inhalers I used as a child.  </li>
            <li>I would probably try a single tube first before buying the multi-pack but</li>
            <li>Rembrandt Intense Stain toothpaste is not bad, but no whitener approaches Rembrandt&#x27;s Dazzling White toothpaste 5-pack of past years...which is now impossible to find.</li>
            <li>but I have not noticed any major changes in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>And yes, I am an avid drinker of dark teas.</li>
            <li>seems to keep them as white as they can naturally be</li>
            <li>It also quickly helped my two youngest daughters to have no more canker sores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m serious about keeping my teeth- stain free and white.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using intense stain for a little over a week now, and am just starting to notice the results.</li>

            <li> (However, the tube could include more toothpaste-</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> They should come out with more flavors.</li>
            <li> We have been using Rembrandt for years and love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a more premium toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I switched to this brand after using Crest for many years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 3 days with this toothpaste (and the accompanying mouthwash, which I also LOVE) and my teeth are already noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> You might consider investing your hard-earned money into a more quality toothpaste.</li>
            <li> But,in this case buying at the store is probably the better bet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Amazon has them.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering them more.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve tried many).  </li>
            <li> The taste is also our favorite of all the toothpastes we have had.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through so many others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sincerely telling you the truth...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been following the best recommended use</li>
            <li> so I used a home remedy that worked better</li>
            <li> my teeth are going to get more and more</li>
            <li> But i  notice most places that carry this are eithr way pricey-er</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is really excellent for helping eliminate stains from coffee, tea, red wine, etc.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than any of the many toothpastes I have tried.  </li>
            <li> So glad to get this quality, will buy again.</li>
            <li> but stll ok to try</li>
            <li> But this honestly didn&#x27;t work as significantly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Rembrandt is the best and you can have a concrete proof right from when you start using it!&lt;br /&gt;Dyno</li>
            <li> Enjoy the idea of being able to order as many tubes that I want.</li>
            <li> If this is true, they certainly made a drastic mistake by discontinuing their most successful and well-liked product.</li>
            <li> Great product and shipped professionally</li>
            <li> and so glad it is available on line.  </li>
            <li> And the most convenient with guaranteed of genuine product.</li>
            <li> I have enjoy using it and  love the mint flavor.</li>
            <li> If it is a cost saving change, they will probably wind up losing some very loyal customers.</li>
            <li> I love how clean it makes your mouth feel.</li>
            <li> And I love that my mouth still feels clean when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> Does a great job at removing stains, much better than regular whitening toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> yes, great price, great item, getting harder to find in my local shops so ideal really.</li>
            <li> Strong mint flavor.</li>
            <li> Works okay nothing special...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with the fact the flavor is not overpowering like other brands but get your teeth almost squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s handy to be able to buy several at a time at a pretty good price.  </li>
            <li> whitener available for a self application by toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;Forget</li>
            <li> Well I honestly tell you, after one months use morning and night faithfully, I haven&#x27;t noticed much diffference at all.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled to find this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> The fact that Johnson &amp; Johnson is marketing this as still a premium brand in the original box at a premium price makes me feel cheated.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve gotten significantly whiter, I probably would have noticed.</li>
            <li> This did not make my teeth sensitive, yet cleaned the coffee stains better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for years and loved it - it keeps my pearly whites white.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even bother with white strips anymore because this combined with a good electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> This toothpaste keeps my teeth white and tastes good.</li>
            <li> They are full with air instead of toothpaste and when I took out the air</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really curious as to why a very effective and user-friendly product would be discontinued.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal user for years now.</li>
            <li> I bought the Intense at drugstore.com and got the Peroxide Plus as a free sample.</li>
            <li> I drink tons of coffee, Rembrandt has kept my teeth stain free and much whiter.</li>
            <li> but well worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the Intense should be reformulated to make it more of a paste, or else repackaged in an upright bottle with a smaller, more controlled applicator.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far our favorite</li>
            <li> I had to occasionally place my warm tongue over them to stop the hurting on occasion.  </li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I got it and used it right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about clean teeth, &amp; also not harming them with abrasive products.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste for whitening especially if you drink coffee, tea, red wine.</li>
            <li> This works great for getting my teeth very white in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the product was that it had a very, very runny texture.</li>
            <li> I have used used a variety of different toothpastes, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used a toothpaste for more than a month.</li>
            <li> So, I was pretty hesitant in ordering a 3 pack.</li>
            <li> With Rembrandt toothpaste, I&#x27;ve been able to keep the stains at bay and keep my teeth mostly white.  </li>
            <li> Really helped my husbands coffee stains!</li>
            <li> Keeps my mouth fresh for hours--teeth feel really clean, and breath really fresh hours later.</li>
            <li> but maybe you&#x27;ll be one of those folks who get instant bright white teeth!  </li>
            <li> I could not see any difference in efficacy between Intense and Plus Peroxide and they have a similar mint flavor, which I love.</li>
            <li> I really like the Rembrandt Intense Stain Toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Any time I try to use another toothpaste I pretty much freak out and have to brush my teeth again.</li>
            <li> The new list was more like my wife&#x27;s regular Colgate toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I was kind of hesitant to purchase due to the high price.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love that the paste foams up as soon as you start brushing; unlike other pastes, where I find myself in need of a lot of water to get a foamy consistency.</li>
            <li> Use the intense toothpaste and Rembrandt intense toothpaste twice a day.  </li>
            <li> So much for saving a couple dollars.</li>
            <li> It really does what it says, and, refreshes one&#x27;s mouth very well.  </li>
            <li> Yet with Rembrandt Intense Stain, I could see a difference after just one brushing.</li>
            <li> When I used it my mouth burned so much that I threw out all the remainder.</li>
            <li> Intense stain has a gentle amount of abrasion, and yet cleans and whitens.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too high!</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t really paid attention to whether my teeth look whiter or not.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is not helping with intense coffee stains.  </li>
            <li> It literally takes the coffee stains out without too much brushing.  </li>
            <li> I am very unsatisfied by the product.</li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed and I will never buy again.</li>
            <li> Didnt notice much improvement in tar stains from this toothpaste</li>
            <li> far the toothpaste continues to be worth the price point for me.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Even though it costs a little more, I wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
            <li> A terrific product that used by sold far more prominently in supermarkets, pharmacies, and other outlets in the &#x27;90s.  </li>
            <li> I am on my second order, still I haven&#x27;t seen any significant result.</li>
            <li> and I think it works better than the other whitening pastes out there</li>
            <li> After using my latest tube of Rembrandt Intense Stain toothpaste for a month my teeth were getting yellower, I thought, so I compared the new tube with an old one- different shape.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I could buy this thru Amazon prime when it was less than 13.00 for a pack of 3.</li>
            <li> My dentist was so pleased with its low abrasion percentage, and said I could use it daily without harm.</li>
            <li> But this is hard to find in the stores, so was nice to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, the taste is fresh.</li>
            <li> EXCEPT lately the toothpaste seems to run out of the tube rather than squeeze out in a nice bead.  </li>
            <li> One theory is that Rembrandt changed hands and the new owners re-evaluated the stock.  </li>
            <li> I just started using this new toothpaste</li>
            <li> I finally found the only solution was to put the dab of toothpaste directly INTO my mouth then spread it around with the brush very quickly.</li>
            <li> And my teeth feel much cleaner in general.</li>
            <li> I compared the ingredients in the new formulation with the old.  </li>
            <li> Even though this specific version doesn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;cancer sore prevention&amp;#34; on the box, it certainly does minimize the occurrence.</li>
            <li> I hope they get this problem fixed soon.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> It did however cause my front teeth surfaces to be sensitive and ache, so</li>
            <li> Think I&#x27;ll be trying a natural toothpaste now.  </li>
            <li> Same price as in the store and a whole lot easier to get when it comes to your home.</li>
            <li> I will never waste money on this again.</li>
            <li> The last time I had dental cleaning was 6 months ago and my teeth still look amazingly clean and stain free (just tiny little spotting on the back of the teeth).</li>
            <li> Needless to say I trashed that junk right away and invested in something better.</li>
            <li> On top of that, my teeth are rough and stain easily due to the asthma inhalers I used as a child.  </li>
            <li> I would probably try a single tube first before buying the multi-pack but</li>
            <li> Rembrandt Intense Stain toothpaste is not bad, but no whitener approaches Rembrandt&#x27;s Dazzling White toothpaste 5-pack of past years...which is now impossible to find.</li>
            <li> but I have not noticed any major changes in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> And yes, I am an avid drinker of dark teas.</li>
            <li> seems to keep them as white as they can naturally be</li>
            <li> It also quickly helped my two youngest daughters to have no more canker sores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious about keeping my teeth- stain free and white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using intense stain for a little over a week now, and am just starting to notice the results.</li>
            <li> Although Rembrandt toothpastes are more expensive, I think in the long run they will save me time and money in terms of fewer/shorter visits to the hygienist.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s in your mouth, it lasts long enough for a thorough brushing, but</li>
            <li> It drips down my toothbrush and is completely unusable.</li>
            <li> Brush everyday, use enough on the toothbrush to work up both a cleansing and polishing action.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more expensive than other toothpastes out there.)</li>
            <li> My teeth are naturally prone to a little discoloration even though I don&#x27;t drink coffee or smoke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Rembrandt Intense and the Rembrandt Plus Peroxide toothpaste for at least a month each.</li>
            <li> Curious to see how my dentist will react on my next visit</li>
            <li> after 2 months use (that&#x27;s how long the 3 pack lasted), I didn&#x27;t get any improvements.</li>
            <li> Have bought several times and it always shows up as expected.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rembrandt several years now and have not found any other that whitens, brightens or cleans my teeth as well.</li>
            <li> If you wish to try the toothpastes before subscribing to Amazon, buy single packs at Rite Aid/drugstore.com or Target.</li>
            <li> All I can see are dollars pouring down the drain when I open the tube!</li>
            <li> I am English in origin and drink LOTS of black tea throughout the day.</li>
            <li> that when I take the cap off, I have to be careful not to tip it downward or the toothpaste pours out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience these empty tubes that others complain about.</li>
            <li> The tubes are almost empty.</li>
            <li> It was so empty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using this product for a few days now and the hurting surfaces have stopped hurting and will probably donate the other two unopened tubes to a relative.  </li>
            <li> Runny to the extreme</li>
            <li> Other toothpastes cause foaming in the mouth.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t contain and abrasives or &amp;#34;granules&amp;#34; like some other toothpastes that whiten.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m grateful for this toothpaste that cleans, refreshes, and all without hurting my teeth, gums, or causing a rash or canker sores in my mouth like other toothpaste does.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they put into this toothpaste, unless it is an excess of water, but whatever it is causes the toothpaste to be extremely runny.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves my mouth and teeth feeling cleaner than other toothpastes</li>
            <li> if whitening toothpaste doesn&#x27;t usually bother you then this should be a solid choice.</li>
            <li> The tube was half empty.</li>
            <li> That said, I prefer Plus Peroxide because the Intense is watery and difficult to apply on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Usually, the product is a moderately firm paste, but the last 2 tubes I&#x27;ve purchase have been runny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rembrandt for years and my teeth are white and the enamel has not been negatively affected by using it.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t chew, I have average teeth color for my age.  </li>
            <li> I stored it upside down.</li>
            <li> I feel like I am throwing my money down the drain.</li>
            <li> My Dental Hygienist even asked what I was using, and wrote it down to recommend to her patients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of other \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpastes with little to no result.  </li>
            <li> I just got through my previous tube</li>
            <li> this lightened the stains in less than a week.</li>
            <li> less fillings.</li>
            <li> It also worked out to be slightly cheaper ordering here than buying in the store (if you can find it).  </li>
            <li> I have seen it in stores, but a lot less often than I used to see it.  </li>
            <li> Does lighten a little bit.</li>
            <li> But even at that price, this formula was a waste of money.     </li>
            <li> I had never tried Rembrandt before a few months ago when a friend let me borrow theirs on a trip.</li>
            <li> After a few days, I was hooked.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I notice a difference within a few days of using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> (I think the hygienist will have less cleaning to do!).</li>
            <li> Hard to find this toothpaste in grocery pharmacy area</li>
            <li> , I could hardly get any toothpaste out at all.</li>
            <li> At least it is to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rembrandt toothpaste ... mint flavor:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thin that it won&#x27;t hardly stay on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read all about why Rembrandt works, and I know all the science behind it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to have wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt is rather expensive for the amount you get as it is.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothpaste, which was sold by Amazon LLC, and immediately noticed it had a weird consistency, but figured it was the formulation.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find this toothpaste in the drug stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I found it impossible to put it JUST on my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when I found out the prise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the worst toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works magic!  I am a stickler about the whiteness and cleanliness of my teeth.  I will never use anything else on my teeth.  Use the intense toothpaste and Rembrandt intense toothpaste twice a day.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I defy you to show me some better toothpaste. I love this stuff. Pricy, but well worth it in my opinion. If you get stains from coffee or tea, this stuff keeps your teeth shiny &amp; white. Non abrasive and a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for years and loved it - it keeps my pearly whites white. I jumped in and ordered a pack from Amazon. I just got through my previous tube so opened it outside of the return window for Amazon, but the product was like water instead of toothpaste. It drips down my toothbrush and is completely unusable. So much for saving a couple dollars.</li>
            <li> Great brand I re ordered</li>
            <li> I have used used a variety of different toothpastes, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used a toothpaste for more than a month. So, I was pretty hesitant in ordering a 3 pack. The first thing I noticed about the product was that it had a very, very runny texture. I would squeeze the tube and it would drench my brushhead in liquid. Eventually I got used to it. After using all 3 bottles I can honestly say that I do think my mouth felt a lot cleaner and my teeth were definitely whiter. It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but it&#x27;s the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Rembrandt Intense and the Rembrandt Plus Peroxide toothpaste for at least a month each. As an avid coffee, tea and wine drinker, I&#x27;m happy to report that both products whitened my teeth considerably better in a shorter period of time. Years of using Crest or Colgate whitening toothpaste never satisfactorily removed tea stains. Rembrandt did. Curious to see how my dentist will react on my next visit (I think the hygienist will have less cleaning to do!). I could not see any difference in efficacy between Intense and Plus Peroxide and they have a similar mint flavor, which I love. That said, I prefer Plus Peroxide because the Intense is watery and difficult to apply on the toothbrush. Perhaps the Intense should be reformulated to make it more of a paste, or else repackaged in an upright bottle with a smaller, more controlled applicator. Although Rembrandt toothpastes are more expensive, I think in the long run they will save me time and money in terms of fewer/shorter visits to the hygienist. I am eager to try the famed mouthwash next. If you wish to try the toothpastes before subscribing to Amazon, buy single packs at Rite Aid/drugstore.com or Target. I bought the Intense at drugstore.com and got the Peroxide Plus as a free sample.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste.  I read some reviews about it being watery.  When I got them I mixed them up within the tube by compressing it back and forth several times and I had NO problem! :)  Very good thanks</li>
            <li> After using this for two months, I went to the dentist, who was amazed that it had reversed and eliminated my gum bleeding. This stuff works.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was recommended by my dentist to avoid staining from medications.  Works amazing! My teeth have never been whiter.</li>
            <li> I am a daily coffee drinker and wine enthusiast.  On top of that, my teeth are rough and stain easily due to the asthma inhalers I used as a child.  With Rembrandt toothpaste, I&#x27;ve been able to keep the stains at bay and keep my teeth mostly white.  My wife even noticed the difference!  I&#x27;ve tried a number of other \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpastes with little to no result.  I&#x27;ll be buying Rembrandt from now on!</li>
            <li> good product, fast shipping, happy customer :)</li>
            <li> A terrific product that used by sold far more prominently in supermarkets, pharmacies, and other outlets in the &#x27;90s.  It really does what it says, and, refreshes one&#x27;s mouth very well.  A great clean all the way!</li>
            <li> Rembrandt Intense Stain toothpaste is not bad, but no whitener approaches Rembrandt&#x27;s Dazzling White toothpaste 5-pack of past years...which is now impossible to find. I&#x27;m really curious as to why a very effective and user-friendly product would be discontinued. One theory is that Rembrandt changed hands and the new owners re-evaluated the stock.  If this is true, they certainly made a drastic mistake by discontinuing their most successful and well-liked product.</li>
            <li> I saw the commercial for Rembrandt&#x27;s toothpastes and decided to give them a try- the commercial told of not just 1 layer of staining on teeth, but two and that this paste especially helps to get rid of staining. And yes, I am an avid drinker of dark teas. First of all, I love that the paste foams up as soon as you start brushing; unlike other pastes, where I find myself in need of a lot of water to get a foamy consistency. Secondly, the taste is fresh. I like the fact that you can eat after brushing with this paste because the mint flavor does not stay in your mouth for an hour. People are different- so don&#x27;t expect results instantly. Be patient. I&#x27;ve been using intense stain for a little over a week now, and am just starting to notice the results. I&#x27;ve read all about why Rembrandt works, and I know all the science behind it. Trust this! It&#x27;s worth your money. (However, the tube could include more toothpaste- it&#x27;s more expensive than other toothpastes out there.) *If the paste is runny- mix up the tube! It has been sitting in a stockhouse/ warehouse! I bought mine in a store so it wasn&#x27;t runny.*</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the worst toothpaste I have ever used. The paste came out like running water. By the time I put the toothpaste on the brush and put the cap back on the tube, 90% of the toothpaste that was on the toothbrush had dripped off into the sink. Buyers beware of watery toothpaste; you&#x27;ve been warned!!</li>
            <li> Great product and shipped professionally</li>
            <li> beats crest and aquafresh who claim to make your teeth the whitest.  This stuff really works and even for everyday coffee drinkers.</li>
            <li> Nice taste, seems to do well whitening.  Cheaper on Amazon.  Saves me trips to the store, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rembrandt several years now and have not found any other that whitens, brightens or cleans my teeth as well. However, Rembrandt must have an issue with quality control. Usually, the product is a moderately firm paste, but the last 2 tubes I&#x27;ve purchase have been runny. Runny to the extreme that when I take the cap off, I have to be careful not to tip it downward or the toothpaste pours out of the tube. It&#x27;s so thin that it won&#x27;t hardly stay on the toothbrush. I hope they get this problem fixed soon. Rembrandt is rather expensive for the amount you get as it is. All I can see are dollars pouring down the drain when I open the tube!</li>
            <li> I am English in origin and drink LOTS of black tea throughout the day. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to remove the stains and overall yellowish tone but nothing seemed to work. Yet with Rembrandt Intense Stain, I could see a difference after just one brushing. And my teeth feel much cleaner in general. I am thrilled to find this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  Other toothpastes cause foaming in the mouth.  This tootpaste doesn&#x27;t and it tastes great.  It also keeps my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> I am actually on automated shipping for this product which is delivered every 6 months. I&#x27;ve received the first set (pack of 3) and they&#x27;re great! They taste amazing and do not irritate the corner of my lips. I have also used the mint flavored Rembrandt toothpaste and liked that too, but wanted a change. They should come out with more flavors.</li>
            <li> After using my latest tube of Rembrandt Intense Stain toothpaste for a month my teeth were getting yellower, I thought, so I compared the new tube with an old one- different shape.  I compared the ingredients in the new formulation with the old.  The new list was more like my wife&#x27;s regular Colgate toothpaste.  The fact that Johnson &amp; Johnson is marketing this as still a premium brand in the original box at a premium price makes me feel cheated.</li>
            <li> I ordered one thing. A different thing came. I reordered. Another different thing came. I ordered again. The correct\\&quot; appearing\\&quot; item came. When I used it my mouth burned so much that I threw out all the remainder.</li>
            <li> Since I started using Rembrandt toothpaste I no longer have those unsightly coffee stains on my teeth. I would never go back to another brand, I am Rembrandt for life!</li>
            <li> We have been using Rembrandt for years and love it EXCEPT lately the toothpaste seems to run out of the tube rather than squeeze out in a nice bead.  If it is a cost saving change, they will probably wind up losing some very loyal customers.</li>
            <li> Goodbye Crest and Colgate. I was kind of hesitant to purchase due to the high price. It&#x27;s definitely a more premium toothpaste. Anyway, I got it and used it right away. I&#x27;m so impressed with the fact the flavor is not overpowering like other brands but get your teeth almost squeaky clean. It also doesn&#x27;t contain and abrasives or &amp;#34;granules&amp;#34; like some other toothpastes that whiten. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t always find this in the stores.  It&#x27;s handy to be able to buy several at a time at a pretty good price.  I&#x27;ve used Rembrandt for years and my teeth are white and the enamel has not been negatively affected by using it.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is truly the best at whitening. I switched to this brand after using Crest for many years. On my recent dental cleaning my hygienist told me to stop using Crest since it was embedding plastic specks deep into my gums! Needless to say I trashed that junk right away and invested in something better. My teeth are naturally prone to a little discoloration even though I don&#x27;t drink coffee or smoke. It&#x27;s been 3 days with this toothpaste (and the accompanying mouthwash, which I also LOVE) and my teeth are already noticeably whiter. I will never go back. I didn&#x27;t experience these empty tubes that others complain about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m grateful for this toothpaste that cleans, refreshes, and all without hurting my teeth, gums, or causing a rash or canker sores in my mouth like other toothpaste does. It also quickly helped my two youngest daughters to have no more canker sores. Intense stain has a gentle amount of abrasion, and yet cleans and whitens. My dentist was so pleased with its low abrasion percentage, and said I could use it daily without harm.</li>
            <li> After using this toothpaste for about 3 weeks, I had people asking me if I&#x27;d had my teeth whitened. It really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I could buy this thru Amazon prime when it was less than 13.00 for a pack of 3. But even at that price, this formula was a waste of money.     I don&#x27;t know what they put into this toothpaste, unless it is an excess of water, but whatever it is causes the toothpaste to be extremely runny. I found it impossible to put it JUST on my toothbrush. No matter how I tried, it ran over the sides and into the sink. I kneaded it up thinking that might mix up the contents. I stored it standing up. I stored it upside down. I even put the container into the refrigerator overnight thinking it might thicken up, to no avail.    I finally found the only solution was to put the dab of toothpaste directly INTO my mouth then spread it around with the brush very quickly. Once it&#x27;s in your mouth, it lasts long enough for a thorough brushing, but after 2 months use (that&#x27;s how long the 3 pack lasted), I didn&#x27;t get any improvements. My teeth have the same stains they had in May of this year.    You might consider investing your hard-earned money into a more quality toothpaste. This is not it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothpaste, which was sold by Amazon LLC, and immediately noticed it had a weird consistency, but figured it was the formulation. At some point it occurred to me to look at the expiration date and I discovered that the expiration date was in the month before I bought the item. If I ever buy something like this again via Amazon, I will definitely check the dates as soon as I receive it. But,in this case buying at the store is probably the better bet.</li>
            <li> Best that I have tried. Removes coffee tea stains, gum, epoxy, wax build up, sludge, and nail polish. jk</li>
            <li> Rembrandt is really good toothpaste,  but  I payed 6€ or 7€ in paris. now it&#x27;s over and decided to find it here... I was really disappointed when I found out the prise.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s too high!</li>
            <li> Great whitening toothpaste. Really helped my husbands coffee stains! Will buy again after running out.</li>
            <li> I really like the Rembrandt Intense Stain Toothpaste! I had never tried Rembrandt before a few months ago when a friend let me borrow theirs on a trip. After a few days, I was hooked. I love how clean it makes your mouth feel. And I love that my mouth still feels clean when I wake up in the morning. I didn&#x27;t buy it for the whitening properties so I haven&#x27;t really paid attention to whether my teeth look whiter or not. But I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve gotten significantly whiter, I probably would have noticed.</li>
            <li> I feel like I am throwing my money down the drain. I am on my second order, still I haven&#x27;t seen any significant result.</li>
            <li> I just started using this new toothpaste so I don&#x27;t  have  any results yet but it is very refreshing.! I will update soon.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves my mouth and teeth feeling cleaner than other toothpastes and I believe it leaves my teeth looking whiter also.  Even though it costs a little more, I wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this toothpaste in grocery pharmacy area and so glad it is available on line.  This is fair in removing stain.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  I&#x27;m glad Amazon has them.  I will be ordering them more.</li>
            <li> I have been using Rembrandt toothpaste since about 1990.  It was recommended to me by my dentist to prevent/minimize cancer sores.  Even though this specific version doesn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;cancer sore prevention&amp;#34; on the box, it certainly does minimize the occurrence.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective toothpaste against plaque and stains I have found to date! Taste great and cleans you mouth as well.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is great. It cleans and whitens the teeth amazingly. All my family is very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> this is great for whitening toothpaste.  great on stains as well.  i had coffee stains along the gums on my bottom gums.  this lightened the stains in less than a week.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has been amazing for me. I drink tons of coffee, Rembrandt has kept my teeth stain free and much whiter. My Dental Hygienist even asked what I was using, and wrote it down to recommend to her patients.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this toothpaste.  It&#x27;s by far our favorite and we have been using it for years now.  I don&#x27;t even bother with white strips anymore because this combined with a good electric toothbrush seems to keep them as white as they can naturally be and I think it works better than the other whitening pastes out there (I&#x27;ve tried many).  The taste is also our favorite of all the toothpastes we have had.  If you have sensitive teeth I would probably try a single tube first before buying the multi-pack but if whitening toothpaste doesn&#x27;t usually bother you then this should be a solid choice.</li>
            <li> Ordered 17th November and arrived in Greece on 6th December! As stated. Also expiry date of toothpaste for May 2014!!! Always top quality!!! Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> The answer is no!!! Rembrandt is the best and you can have a concrete proof right from when you start using it!&lt;br /&gt;Dyno</li>
            <li> Works for me&lt;br /&gt;Best whitener available for a self application by toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;Forget the trays and expense&lt;br /&gt;Just brush like always</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is not helping with intense coffee stains.  I use it several times a day but I have not noticed any major changes in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Well, before I bought, I read the reviews, some folks said it was terrific, others said it didn&#x27;t work.  Well I honestly tell you, after one months use morning and night faithfully, I haven&#x27;t noticed much diffference at all.  I even got the whitening mouth wash too.  Now I don&#x27;t drink coffee, and I don&#x27;t smoke, I don&#x27;t chew, I have average teeth color for my age.  But this honestly didn&#x27;t work as significantly as advertised.  It did however cause my front teeth surfaces to be sensitive and ache, so I had to occasionally place my warm tongue over them to stop the hurting on occasion.  I&#x27;ve stopped using this product for a few days now and the hurting surfaces have stopped hurting and will probably donate the other two unopened tubes to a relative.  Think I&#x27;ll be trying a natural toothpaste now.  I&#x27;ve been through so many others.  I&#x27;m sincerely telling you the truth...but maybe you&#x27;ll be one of those folks who get instant bright white teeth!  Who knows.  There&#x27;s no gaurantee.</li>
            <li> Same price as in the store and a whole lot easier to get when it comes to your home. I&#x27;ll use this method again.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste for whitening especially if you drink coffee, tea, red wine. Recommend</li>
            <li> This toothpaste keeps my teeth white and tastes good.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been following the best recommended use and I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. I was disappointed to have wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> Most toothpastes irritate my gums--this does not--has a great flavor and might even whiten my teeth. great product for people with sensitivities</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find this toothpaste in the drug stores anymore. My dentist recommended this years ago after I decided to have my teeth whitened as it would help keep them looking great. You need to try it to see the differences,</li>
            <li> I have finished the entire tube and, after brushing twice a day, my teeth aren&#x27;t any whiter. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I have ever used.  It literally takes the coffee stains out without too much brushing.  I also have the mouthwash, but I do not think it is necessary.</li>
            <li> Have bought several times and it always shows up as expected.</li>
            <li> product actually works with regular brushing.  My teeth are whiter and easier to maintain.  No need to bleach as often.</li>
            <li> I am very unsatisfied by the product. The tubes are almost empty. They are full with air instead of toothpaste and when I took out the air it remained a bit of toothpaste inside. I am very dissapointed and I will never buy again. I also want my products replaced</li>
            <li> At least it is to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rembrandt toothpaste ... mint flavor: Tastes great ... less fillings. Get it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards!</li>
            <li> Great and worked as described.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is the best I have experienced. Thank you for helping my teeth to whiteness. I will be hooked on this stuff</li>
            <li> Works okay nothing special... Didnt notice much improvement in tar stains from this toothpaste so I used a home remedy that worked better</li>
            <li> Any time I try to use another toothpaste I pretty much freak out and have to brush my teeth again. Strong mint flavor. Noticeable grit. Teeth feel very clean after use and you will notice that it does a fair job at stain removal. However, I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now and it&#x27;s not like my teeth are going to get more and more white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far the toothpaste continues to be worth the price point for me.</li>
            <li> This works great for getting my teeth very white in a short amount of time. I notice a difference within a few days of using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great product. Nothing else like it on the market and it seems to have disappeared from any store shelves so stock up!</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;m a smoker and coffee drinker. I&#x27;m serious about keeping my teeth- stain free and white. Before finding this toothpaste, I couldn&#x27;t last 3 months without dental cleaning because of the stains. The last time I had dental cleaning was 6 months ago and my teeth still look amazingly clean and stain free (just tiny little spotting on the back of the teeth). So now, I can have my dental cleaning done twice a year rather than 4 times.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I had want to get to a grocery store to just pick it up. But i  notice most places that carry this are eithr way pricey-er or they look like they been collecting dust untouched. So decided to look online and this has been the best pricing w/value. And the most convenient with guaranteed of genuine product. Really good buy.</li>
            <li> Brush everyday, use enough on the toothbrush to work up both a cleansing and polishing action.</li>
            <li> This works splendidly!  I&#x27;m very picky about clean teeth, &amp; also not harming them with abrasive products. This did not make my teeth sensitive, yet cleaned the coffee stains better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried! Love it! It cleans amazing over all!</li>
            <li> The product matches the description.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> Great seller- Great value-Great Experience.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite toothpaste.  Does a great job at removing stains, much better than regular whitening toothpastes.  But this is hard to find in the stores, so was nice to find it on Amazon.  It also worked out to be slightly cheaper ordering here than buying in the store (if you can find it).  I would recommend for anyone wanting a deeper cleaning toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Does lighten a little bit.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste on the market.  Effective in removing stains and at a competitive price. I am a loyal user for years now.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is really excellent for helping eliminate stains from coffee, tea, red wine, etc.  it&#x27;s better than any of the many toothpastes I have tried.  I have seen it in stores, but a lot less often than I used to see it.  So glad to get this quality, will buy again.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommend me to use this toothpaste.  I have enjoy using it and  love the mint flavor. Enjoy the idea of being able to order as many tubes that I want.</li>
            <li> yes, great price, great item, getting harder to find in my local shops so ideal really.</li>
            <li> no as good as everyone said... but stll ok to try</li>
            <li> I will never waste money on this again. The tube was half empty. It was so empty, I could hardly get any toothpaste out at all.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth paste!!  whitens my teeth as well as freshens my breath, while tasting like good!!</li>
            <li> Bought for wife. She loved it</li>
            <li> I have veneers and Rembrandt is the best to use for stains, like coffee, tea,etc. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my mouth fresh for hours--teeth feel really clean, and breath really fresh hours later. I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
