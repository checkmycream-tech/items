            <li>This lotion is good for you if you want a more orange look.</li>
            <li>so it leaves a nice silky feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li>After 1 week of my &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34;, I am nicely tanned.</li>
            <li>The color however is nice.</li>
            <li>Tans evenly and goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>This lotion is just great, it applies perfect and I will be using this in the future.</li>
            <li>works well, gives a nice color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an older woman, so it&#x27;s wonderful to see this effect.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy Darksyde and am super happy I did.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best tanning lotion that my girlfriend ever used according to her, the smell of it is very attracting and the effect of tanning is very quick and effective.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and most people liked this lotion</li>
            <li>Goes in very smooth and not to greasy.</li>
            <li>Skin feels very smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>It does spread easily tho which is nice</li>
            <li>I bought both of these products based on how great the reviews were, and now I know why they were so unusually positive.</li>
            <li>This just impressed me personally.</li>
            <li>This has become my favorite bronzer.</li>
            <li>Also, the lotion is lovely going on.</li>
            <li>Not awful</li>
            <li>; smell like many tan products do.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I am definitely pleased with the performance of this lotion.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the Great product.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I know I will be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>my favorite part is the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love love love the coconut scent.  </li>
            <li>Worked great, very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It helped keep a deeper more even looking tan.</li>
            <li>Coconut smell is awesome, doesn&#x27;t leave your hands looking like you cleaned them with mud, and definitely darkens you up.</li>
            <li>This product will give you a stunning canella</li>
            <li>but I would add some more fragrance.</li>
            <li>I works better then</li>
            <li>If you wipe your hand and feet after it is ok.</li>
            <li>Love the coconut smell.</li>
            <li>Within a week I noticed a nice bronze coating and it sticks, no water was washing this golden tan away!</li>
            <li>I look so much tanner and the scent of Coconut is amazing!</li>
            <li>Smells good at first</li>
            <li>Excited to try this tonight when I go tan!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an experienced tanner and thought I&#x27;d try a new lotion..</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and gives amazing color after just a few tans.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the lotion is thinner than most tanning lotions and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This had great reviews and I was really excited when it came so fast.</li>
            <li>Unlike most tanning lotion this actually smells really good!</li>
            <li>Please be more accurate with the description and change it to a self-tanner.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s got a great smell and really gets you a nice bronze color fast.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice golden brown to where I felt like this lotion had an orange tint.</li>
            <li>My girlfried loved this lotion, it made her very tan</li>
            <li>I have used SO MANY tanning accelerators over the years, and hands down, this product smells THE BEST out of anything</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t emphasize enough how important the lotion is in tanning, and this one has great color and effectiveness, and smells neither super-girly nor like playdoh like almost all others, so it&#x27;s a perfect middle ground.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great product, just make sure you rub it in well - and keep away from your eyes</li>
            <li>it does have a bit of a strong smell, but that goes away once applied to the body.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product and I will be sure to buy up a few more when I run out!</li>
            <li>and it seems to soak up pretty good too and not leave me super greasy.  </li>
            <li>After only 2 uses I was a beautiful bronze color.</li>
            <li>Kind of made me feel really hot (like temperature).  </li>
            <li>It went on easy and didn&#x27;t leave me super slippery like most silicone lotions do.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li>After the first application, my skin looked remarkably darker and it&#x27;s not a fake looking tan but</li>
            <li>I recently bought this for the first time and was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>so thats a huge plus.</li>
            <li>but after a couple of hours in the sun a huge difference is seen by me.</li>
            <li>I do think it&#x27;s an important member of my lotion collection as it is the highest DHA content</li>
            <li>and I liked it very well</li>
            <li>Let me start buy saying I wasnt paid to buy this product or sent a free bottle.  </li>
            <li>and she seems to enjoy it</li>
            <li>Great for instant color.</li>
            <li>not an enjoyable scent or a good lasting feeling on the skin, but for the price and quantity...</li>
            <li>You better bet it will be right by my side at the pool all summer.</li>
            <li>The lotion rubs on easily and absorbs quickly-</li>
            <li>and I can easily use a more gentle one on my face (Swedish Beauty is my pick).</li>
            <li>I am the type of person that gets burnt more easily than tan, but when i started using this you could really see a difference.</li>
            <li>Not too thick, smells good, good vamue</li>
            <li>Maybe good for some one who is just starting out in the tanning bed, but not for me.</li>
            <li>Everyone kept saying how good the office smelt, and later that night I was with a friend who said I smelt like Disney World.  </li>
            <li>Good solid lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more very soon.</li>
            <li>it is thick and wonderful.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s full of PARABENS.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best tanning lotion, hands down.</li>
            <li>It a much more light weight than other silicone tanning lotions which was nice.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product due to the fairly great reviews...</li>
            <li>/&gt;You really need to try this, it will give you results in little to no time, and for me, this is the best anti aging lotion</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t fell dry or peel after using this lotion , I would recommend this lotion to every one, VERY fast Delivery time and GREAT PRICE .....</li>
            <li>love this lotion, highly recommend</li>
            <li>This is an unproven company soliciting falsified reviews through Green Web (which, if you take a look at the products they sell, is not the most reputable or respectable company selling on Amazon).</li>
            <li>It has a very smooth texture and a soft fragrance that isn&#x27;t too overpowering.</li>
            <li>Rubs onto the skin really well and just leaves a fine sheen over the skin.</li>
            <li>It is so hard to find a good tanning lotion- Darksyde give you a deep color and smells GREAT.</li>
            <li>Everything about this lotion was great except that the day after I went tanning, I realized the bronzing agent in the lotion left huge streaks on the back side of my arms.  </li>
            <li>I threw the bottle away after two uses because I want a more natural tan.</li>
            <li>I saw that the reviews might have been fluffed but decided for the price it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>Worth it of the price.</li>
            <li>Seems to leave nice even tone and will leave further reviews once I have used for about another month!</li>
            <li>Darksyde Pitch Black was amazing!  </li>
            <li>the actual shipping had been fast certainly and the product just impressed me personally due to the fact We&#x27;ve never ever noticed something that way.</li>
            <li>I am personally a bodybuilder and this is my favorite tanning product EVER.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li>The only one that seemed to work okay was the tingle one</li>
            <li>Have tried over a dozen different types of tanning lotion and some work better than others but</li>
            <li>At first I was reluctant but after using it I can see the changes.</li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>After one use I noticed I was so much darker!</li>
            <li>I will def be buying more in the future</li>
            <li>purchase that you will not regret in your whole life!</li>
            <li>and i have to say i was surprised at how smooth and well this product worked.</li>
            <li>After searching around for a decent tanning product, i came across this for the Mrs. Smells great and is really thin and smooth.</li>
            <li>Nice lite smell, nothing like other sunning lotions that I&#x27;ve bought off the shelf in stores.</li>
            <li>It could be used for many purposes, such as getting a tan and getting that summer body, or tanning up yourself to get ready for a bodybuilding contest.</li>
            <li>it made me look fresh, healthy, slim and just on top of my game.</li>
            <li>The only one I wasn&#x27;t happy with was Black Storm.</li>
            <li>So far I think i really like it, it might even be worthy of five stars for the price.</li>
            <li>I had rubbed the product in very well and wasn&#x27;t able to see any evident streaking until the next day - and it was too late to rub the lotion in or remove the streaking on my own.  </li>
            <li>and I use pretty decent level 3 beds.</li>
            <li>It is hard to explain how good this lotion is.</li>
            <li>However it works very well at tanning you.</li>
            <li>It was great to finally find a product that not only delivered the tan but extra benefits that are skin needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>now she seems very happy and for the $18 I spent compared to the other crazy prices I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>Not only that, but after using the just ONE TIME, I was able to notice a major difference in color!</li>
            <li>Got me dark and tan really quick!!</li>
            <li>I suspect that there is some sort of self tanner in it as well,  because after the first use I did not wash it off of my hands and they were stained orange for nearly a week.</li>
            <li>and to the conclusion what is main in this product.</li>
            <li>Darksyde is incredibly cheap and has turned my skin from pale ghost to golden god in a matter of a week.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because of it&#x27;s high DHA content.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend purchasing this to get tan this summer.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is a large bottle and the price is far cheaper than you&#x27;d find at a tanning salon.</li>
            <li>I love the color it gives me after using it just a few times.</li>
            <li>No complaint from her no complaints from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but thought i would try something new.</li>
            <li>just a new texture from what im used to.</li>
            <li>The color looks very natural, just like I was at the beach.</li>
            <li>to first got it currently</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and GLOWING!</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of tanning lotions out there, and I&#x27;m usually not picky</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone and I will be definitely buying more soon in the future.</li>
            <li>Overall, it provides an even brownish tan color, no fake orange glow.</li>
            <li>Different than all the other products, skin looked remarkably darker and not that fake looking tan that most products tend to do on your skin.  </li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;d spend as much or more on the tanning lotions as I did on the membership to the beds themselves.  </li>
            <li>This is better than the lotions they sell at the salon for over 100$ and the bottle is big and is lasting me a long time!</li>
            <li>, the biggest downside is having to carry around such a large bottle every time i tan.  </li>
            <li>In just a few hours I noticed a huge difference in my tan</li>
            <li>As far as color results from it, I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference.</li>
            <li>Does not make you orange and looks really natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tanned after just 1 application, and it does last so you wouldnt need too much at one go.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and brown.</li>
            <li>It will make your skin feel soft, and you will probably get some eyes on you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is made with natural ingredients, and it has infused vitamins, that will give your skin the properties it needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; that won&#x27;t give you not even near</li>
            <li>: - soft skin&lt;br</li>
            <li>- natural supplement&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells like bread dough or old bread or something.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this high quality brand to everyone, don&#x27;t loose more time trying other &amp;#34;tanning lotions&amp;#34</li>
            <li>and I actually got a decent tan.</li>
            <li>I just recently started tanning and was getting red but not darkening much.  </li>
            <li>major</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the mess.</li>
            <li>The consistency is strange, seems high in silicone because when I apply it its like im rubbing lube all over me.  </li>
            <li>It smells ok, nothing special about the smell, but doesn&#x27;t have that after tan yuck smell to bad either,.</li>
            <li>After using Darksyde Pitch Black I&#x27;m already noticing a large difference after just one session!  </li>
            <li>(I am fare skinned, usually tan lightly after initial sunburn).</li>
            <li>not great, just okay.</li>
            <li>I am very pale and this lotion helps me acquire a great base tan with its tint before i start to build a more solid tan.</li>
            <li>black and other variations of those cheap 13ounce brands on here.</li>
            <li>and I got very bronzed ( natural ) with this lotion with in a few sessions.</li>
            <li>Darksyde was the winner due to its low price and large bottle size.</li>
            <li>It is really different than other products, this is one of the bests wich really works.</li>
            <li>It is thinner than other lotions I have used, but I consider this a plus as it will last much longer.</li>
            <li>It does leave me a slight orangish color if I use too much at once.</li>
            <li>I would say watch out for this, it can be a good thing and a bad thing, good because you know you will get color but bad because it can leave your hands sorta</li>

            <li> Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion is good for you if you want a more orange look.</li>
            <li> so it leaves a nice silky feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> After 1 week of my &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34;, I am nicely tanned.</li>
            <li> The color however is nice.</li>
            <li> Tans evenly and goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> This lotion is just great, it applies perfect and I will be using this in the future.</li>
            <li> works well, gives a nice color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older woman, so it&#x27;s wonderful to see this effect.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy Darksyde and am super happy I did.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best tanning lotion that my girlfriend ever used according to her, the smell of it is very attracting and the effect of tanning is very quick and effective.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and most people liked this lotion</li>
            <li> Goes in very smooth and not to greasy.</li>
            <li> Skin feels very smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> It does spread easily tho which is nice</li>
            <li> I bought both of these products based on how great the reviews were, and now I know why they were so unusually positive.</li>
            <li> This just impressed me personally.</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite bronzer.</li>
            <li> Also, the lotion is lovely going on.</li>
            <li> Not awful</li>
            <li> ; smell like many tan products do.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I am definitely pleased with the performance of this lotion.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the Great product.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I know I will be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> my favorite part is the smell.  </li>
            <li> I love love love the coconut scent.  </li>
            <li> Worked great, very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It helped keep a deeper more even looking tan.</li>
            <li> Coconut smell is awesome, doesn&#x27;t leave your hands looking like you cleaned them with mud, and definitely darkens you up.</li>
            <li> This product will give you a stunning canella</li>
            <li> but I would add some more fragrance.</li>
            <li> I works better then</li>
            <li> If you wipe your hand and feet after it is ok.</li>
            <li> Love the coconut smell.</li>
            <li> Within a week I noticed a nice bronze coating and it sticks, no water was washing this golden tan away!</li>
            <li> I look so much tanner and the scent of Coconut is amazing!</li>
            <li> Smells good at first</li>
            <li> Excited to try this tonight when I go tan!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an experienced tanner and thought I&#x27;d try a new lotion..</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and gives amazing color after just a few tans.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the lotion is thinner than most tanning lotions and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This had great reviews and I was really excited when it came so fast.</li>
            <li> Unlike most tanning lotion this actually smells really good!</li>
            <li> Please be more accurate with the description and change it to a self-tanner.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s got a great smell and really gets you a nice bronze color fast.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice golden brown to where I felt like this lotion had an orange tint.</li>
            <li> My girlfried loved this lotion, it made her very tan</li>
            <li> I have used SO MANY tanning accelerators over the years, and hands down, this product smells THE BEST out of anything</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t emphasize enough how important the lotion is in tanning, and this one has great color and effectiveness, and smells neither super-girly nor like playdoh like almost all others, so it&#x27;s a perfect middle ground.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great product, just make sure you rub it in well - and keep away from your eyes</li>
            <li> it does have a bit of a strong smell, but that goes away once applied to the body.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product and I will be sure to buy up a few more when I run out!</li>
            <li> and it seems to soak up pretty good too and not leave me super greasy.  </li>
            <li> After only 2 uses I was a beautiful bronze color.</li>
            <li> Kind of made me feel really hot (like temperature).  </li>
            <li> It went on easy and didn&#x27;t leave me super slippery like most silicone lotions do.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li> After the first application, my skin looked remarkably darker and it&#x27;s not a fake looking tan but</li>
            <li> I recently bought this for the first time and was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> so thats a huge plus.</li>
            <li> but after a couple of hours in the sun a huge difference is seen by me.</li>
            <li> I do think it&#x27;s an important member of my lotion collection as it is the highest DHA content</li>
            <li> and I liked it very well</li>
            <li> Let me start buy saying I wasnt paid to buy this product or sent a free bottle.  </li>
            <li> and she seems to enjoy it</li>
            <li> Great for instant color.</li>
            <li> not an enjoyable scent or a good lasting feeling on the skin, but for the price and quantity...</li>
            <li> You better bet it will be right by my side at the pool all summer.</li>
            <li> The lotion rubs on easily and absorbs quickly-</li>
            <li> and I can easily use a more gentle one on my face (Swedish Beauty is my pick).</li>
            <li> I am the type of person that gets burnt more easily than tan, but when i started using this you could really see a difference.</li>
            <li> Not too thick, smells good, good vamue</li>
            <li> Maybe good for some one who is just starting out in the tanning bed, but not for me.</li>
            <li> Everyone kept saying how good the office smelt, and later that night I was with a friend who said I smelt like Disney World.  </li>
            <li> Good solid lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more very soon.</li>
            <li> it is thick and wonderful.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s full of PARABENS.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best tanning lotion, hands down.</li>
            <li> It a much more light weight than other silicone tanning lotions which was nice.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product due to the fairly great reviews...</li>
            <li> /&gt;You really need to try this, it will give you results in little to no time, and for me, this is the best anti aging lotion</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t fell dry or peel after using this lotion , I would recommend this lotion to every one, VERY fast Delivery time and GREAT PRICE .....</li>
            <li> love this lotion, highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is an unproven company soliciting falsified reviews through Green Web (which, if you take a look at the products they sell, is not the most reputable or respectable company selling on Amazon).</li>
            <li> It has a very smooth texture and a soft fragrance that isn&#x27;t too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Rubs onto the skin really well and just leaves a fine sheen over the skin.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find a good tanning lotion- Darksyde give you a deep color and smells GREAT.</li>
            <li> Everything about this lotion was great except that the day after I went tanning, I realized the bronzing agent in the lotion left huge streaks on the back side of my arms.  </li>
            <li> I threw the bottle away after two uses because I want a more natural tan.</li>
            <li> I saw that the reviews might have been fluffed but decided for the price it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> Worth it of the price.</li>
            <li> Seems to leave nice even tone and will leave further reviews once I have used for about another month!</li>
            <li> Darksyde Pitch Black was amazing!  </li>
            <li> the actual shipping had been fast certainly and the product just impressed me personally due to the fact We&#x27;ve never ever noticed something that way.</li>
            <li> I am personally a bodybuilder and this is my favorite tanning product EVER.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> The only one that seemed to work okay was the tingle one</li>
            <li> Have tried over a dozen different types of tanning lotion and some work better than others but</li>
            <li> At first I was reluctant but after using it I can see the changes.</li>
            <li> haha!</li>
            <li> After one use I noticed I was so much darker!</li>
            <li> I will def be buying more in the future</li>
            <li> purchase that you will not regret in your whole life!</li>
            <li> and i have to say i was surprised at how smooth and well this product worked.</li>
            <li> After searching around for a decent tanning product, i came across this for the Mrs. Smells great and is really thin and smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice lite smell, nothing like other sunning lotions that I&#x27;ve bought off the shelf in stores.</li>
            <li> It could be used for many purposes, such as getting a tan and getting that summer body, or tanning up yourself to get ready for a bodybuilding contest.</li>
            <li> it made me look fresh, healthy, slim and just on top of my game.</li>
            <li> The only one I wasn&#x27;t happy with was Black Storm.</li>
            <li> So far I think i really like it, it might even be worthy of five stars for the price.</li>
            <li> I had rubbed the product in very well and wasn&#x27;t able to see any evident streaking until the next day - and it was too late to rub the lotion in or remove the streaking on my own.  </li>
            <li> and I use pretty decent level 3 beds.</li>
            <li> It is hard to explain how good this lotion is.</li>
            <li> However it works very well at tanning you.</li>
            <li> It was great to finally find a product that not only delivered the tan but extra benefits that are skin needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> now she seems very happy and for the $18 I spent compared to the other crazy prices I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Not only that, but after using the just ONE TIME, I was able to notice a major difference in color!</li>
            <li> Got me dark and tan really quick!!</li>
            <li> I suspect that there is some sort of self tanner in it as well,  because after the first use I did not wash it off of my hands and they were stained orange for nearly a week.</li>
            <li> and to the conclusion what is main in this product.</li>
            <li> Darksyde is incredibly cheap and has turned my skin from pale ghost to golden god in a matter of a week.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because of it&#x27;s high DHA content.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend purchasing this to get tan this summer.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle and the price is far cheaper than you&#x27;d find at a tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I love the color it gives me after using it just a few times.</li>
            <li> No complaint from her no complaints from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but thought i would try something new.</li>
            <li> just a new texture from what im used to.</li>
            <li> The color looks very natural, just like I was at the beach.</li>
            <li> to first got it currently</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and GLOWING!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of tanning lotions out there, and I&#x27;m usually not picky</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone and I will be definitely buying more soon in the future.</li>
            <li> Overall, it provides an even brownish tan color, no fake orange glow.</li>
            <li> Different than all the other products, skin looked remarkably darker and not that fake looking tan that most products tend to do on your skin.  </li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;d spend as much or more on the tanning lotions as I did on the membership to the beds themselves.  </li>
            <li> This is better than the lotions they sell at the salon for over 100$ and the bottle is big and is lasting me a long time!</li>
            <li> , the biggest downside is having to carry around such a large bottle every time i tan.  </li>
            <li> In just a few hours I noticed a huge difference in my tan</li>
            <li> As far as color results from it, I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference.</li>
            <li> Does not make you orange and looks really natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tanned after just 1 application, and it does last so you wouldnt need too much at one go.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and brown.</li>
            <li> It will make your skin feel soft, and you will probably get some eyes on you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is made with natural ingredients, and it has infused vitamins, that will give your skin the properties it needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; that won&#x27;t give you not even near</li>
            <li> : - soft skin&lt;br</li>
            <li> - natural supplement&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells like bread dough or old bread or something.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this high quality brand to everyone, don&#x27;t loose more time trying other &amp;#34;tanning lotions&amp;#34</li>
            <li> and I actually got a decent tan.</li>
            <li> I just recently started tanning and was getting red but not darkening much.  </li>
            <li> major</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the mess.</li>
            <li> The consistency is strange, seems high in silicone because when I apply it its like im rubbing lube all over me.  </li>
            <li> It smells ok, nothing special about the smell, but doesn&#x27;t have that after tan yuck smell to bad either,.</li>
            <li> After using Darksyde Pitch Black I&#x27;m already noticing a large difference after just one session!  </li>
            <li> (I am fare skinned, usually tan lightly after initial sunburn).</li>
            <li> not great, just okay.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and this lotion helps me acquire a great base tan with its tint before i start to build a more solid tan.</li>
            <li> black and other variations of those cheap 13ounce brands on here.</li>
            <li> and I got very bronzed ( natural ) with this lotion with in a few sessions.</li>
            <li> Darksyde was the winner due to its low price and large bottle size.</li>
            <li> It is really different than other products, this is one of the bests wich really works.</li>
            <li> It is thinner than other lotions I have used, but I consider this a plus as it will last much longer.</li>
            <li> It does leave me a slight orangish color if I use too much at once.</li>
            <li> I would say watch out for this, it can be a good thing and a bad thing, good because you know you will get color but bad because it can leave your hands sorta</li>
            <li> I rotate it with natural bronzers (from AG and JWOWW), intensifiers (JWOWW and Designer Skin), a tingle, and one other DHA bronzer (both Swedish Beauty).</li>
            <li> usually I don&#x27;t get much of a tan</li>
            <li> Instant tan that lasts for long.</li>
            <li> so the bottle should last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I usually am not the one to buy tanning lotion but all my friends recommend I get this since I have such pale skin.</li>
            <li> Super thin almost watery.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered a second bottle of the other scent and will see how I like that.  </li>
            <li> This one clearly has bronzers because my nails and in between my fingers can get stained since I leave it on a few hours after the tanner.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would improve on it the smell, there&#x27;s not much of a scent to it at all - kinda like coconut</li>
            <li> I am going back to the Solid Black</li>
            <li> - you need only a little amount of product on each use, it will almost last forever!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> plus, i have dry skin and worked wonders moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t gone back to any of my other indoor tanning lotions since I purchased this one!</li>
            <li> First off most smell horrible</li>
            <li> After applying let dry completely before dressing, no color transfer to clothing at all (or at least not for me).  </li>
            <li> This will get you DARK, however, the darkness is likely due to the bronzer in the lotion, rather than increasing your exposure to UV.</li>
            <li> I am an active tanner and was using the Solid Black 100X</li>
            <li> It goes on thin and doesn&#x27;t feel very nourishing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Australian Gold, Designer Skin, Millennium Black Storm and now Darksyde Pitch Black.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way-</li>
            <li> Will let you know how I like the other scent.</li>
            <li> Tried this just as it is a bit cheaper than some of the other lotions out there, and this works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After looking at tons of other lotions, I decided to go  for this one.</li>
            <li> any other one I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;jon</li>
            <li> Works really well on everyone who&#x27;s tried it and with $32 off, you can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> Dark.</li>
            <li> It was like watered down oatmeal.  </li>
            <li> The lotion, is a little thin, but it make&#x27;s your skin feel so soft &amp; silky,</li>
            <li> This product irritated my face (slight burning) and it makes me slightly orange.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get me color at all after using it for a week and a half</li>
            <li> My wife was tanning with some lotion given by her friend at work that made her look a little orange.</li>
            <li> consistency is a little thin but does not affect performance, if anything, makes it last longer.  </li>
            <li> I waited awhile before posting a review because I wanted to see how my skin looked after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on Darksyde products.</li>
            <li> Please take your money elsewhere, and don&#x27;t trust any reviews for Darksyde lotion sold by Green Web Inc.</li>
            <li> I picked up this tanning lotion a few days ago at the recommendation of a friend.</li>
            <li> I think it does make me dark though, hard to tell because I use such a high level tanning bed, but I&#x27;m really disappointed in what the consistency has done.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time tanning and keeping my tan, but with this lotion i could go a few times a month and look way</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> strange looking, its not as horrible as a sunless tanner product and shouldnt stain clothes but be aware of it.  </li>
            <li> I had DARK BROWN streaks all over my legs for a week!!!  </li>
            <li> This product is super watery and smells awful.</li>
            <li> but that does me no good when I&#x27;m not getting color</li>
            <li> I have EVER TRIED in the past!!</li>
            <li> but I thought it was too thin, did not moisturize while tanning</li>
            <li> the lotion is so silly and doesn&#x27;t leak a thick sticky residue.</li>
            <li> Goes on thin</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now, and I will say that I can see a dramatic difference in my color.</li>
            <li> The bronzer is very subtle and isn&#x27;t noticeable going on</li>
            <li> and I hated seeing people I knew after the tanner, hugging them, then remembering I had to remind them their face might burn off in the next 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> By far the worst lotion I have ever used!</li>
            <li> i was so sad when i ran out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very very thin..</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t smell like nasty burnt skin like some other lotions.</li>
            <li> and I looked like I had a bad case of spray tanning with splotches of orange all over me.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad--</li>
            <li> The scent isnt bad, kinda beachy, its</li>
            <li> Not to bad to tan with,</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> and this did absolutly nothing for me :(</li>
            <li> This lotion was awful!!! :(  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but this product is simply awful.</li>
            <li> but once you apply it the smell is  terrible</li>
            <li> Disgusting.</li>
            <li> Horrible lotion!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Hate it!  </li>
            <li> The smell is awful and lingers.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product because of it&#x27;s high DHA content. I rotate it with natural bronzers (from AG and JWOWW), intensifiers (JWOWW and Designer Skin), a tingle, and one other DHA bronzer (both Swedish Beauty). I currently do not use a facial bronzer as my present lotions do not irritate my face. This product irritated my face (slight burning) and it makes me slightly orange. I do think it&#x27;s an important member of my lotion collection as it is the highest DHA content and I can easily use a more gentle one on my face (Swedish Beauty is my pick). It goes on thin and doesn&#x27;t feel very nourishing. It&#x27;s a good lotion though.</li>
            <li> To me and to two of my friends, who are also fellow tanners, it smells like cake batter. It works great and I haven&#x27;t gone back to any of my other indoor tanning lotions since I purchased this one!</li>
            <li> loved it! it worked like a dream and smelled amazing! major plus, i have dry skin and worked wonders moisturizing.  i was so sad when i ran out. it made me look fresh, healthy, slim and just on top of my game. def. suggest it to my friends</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now, and I will say that I can see a dramatic difference in my color. I actually noticed a drastic difference after only one use. It does leave me a slight orangish color if I use too much at once. I suspect that there is some sort of self tanner in it as well,  because after the first use I did not wash it off of my hands and they were stained orange for nearly a week. All-in-all, a good product if used sparingly.</li>
            <li> I love the color it gives me after using it just a few times.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this product. I am an active tanner and was using the Solid Black 100X and I liked it very well but thought i would try something new. I read the reviews and most people liked this lotion but I thought it was too thin, did not moisturize while tanning and I didn&#x27;t like the color it gave. I am going back to the Solid Black 100X. It gives a nice golden brown to where I felt like this lotion had an orange tint. Everyone likes things in a different way but I would not recommend this lotion. Sending mine back for refund.</li>
            <li> The lotion, is a little thin, but it make&#x27;s your skin feel so soft &amp; silky, so thats a huge plus. It smells ok, nothing special about the smell, but doesn&#x27;t have that after tan yuck smell to bad either,. As far as color results from it, I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference. I like the way it makes my skin feel, but probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Maybe good for some one who is just starting out in the tanning bed, but not for me.</li>
            <li> After only 2 uses I was a beautiful bronze color. This definitely helps speed things along. Love this stuff! and it smells really good too, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Not too thick, smells good, good vamue</li>
            <li> The lotion smells good while putting it on but doesn&#x27;t seem to stay smelling good in your body. There is a lot off bronzer in this lotion and I looked like I had a bad case of spray tanning with splotches of orange all over me. I threw the bottle away after two uses because I want a more natural tan. This lotion is good for you if you want a more orange look.</li>
            <li> Bought this item after reading wonderful reviews. Im a tanner I know good tanning lotion when I find it and this did absolutly nothing for me :( didn&#x27;t get me color at all after using it for a week and a half and I use pretty decent level 3 beds. It smells great but that does me no good when I&#x27;m not getting color</li>
            <li> smells like playdoh and doesn&#x27;t help my tan.</li>
            <li> This stuff turned into a chunky jell and is no longer a lotion texture. It&#x27;s also very very thin..probably won&#x27;t buy again. I think it does make me dark though, hard to tell because I use such a high level tanning bed, but I&#x27;m really disappointed in what the consistency has done.</li>
            <li> Good quality tanning lotion. This will get you DARK, however, the darkness is likely due to the bronzer in the lotion, rather than increasing your exposure to UV. That&#x27;s fine by me. The consistency of the lotion is thinner than most tanning lotions and is easy to apply. The smell isn&#x27;t bad-- it reminds me of Pina Colada. My only recommendation is that you are extra thorough in massaging this into your skin. Because the bronzer does dye the skin, any area that is not rubbed in well has a tendency to streak. This is a large bottle and the price is far cheaper than you&#x27;d find at a tanning salon.</li>
            <li> not an enjoyable scent or a good lasting feeling on the skin, but for the price and quantity...</li>
            <li> Got me dark and tan really quick!! I just bought a month at the tanning salon and I&#x27;m already 3-4 shades darker. Really happy with results, and I didn&#x27;t burn which I&#x27;m amazed by. I always burn</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best tanning lotion, hands down. It could be used for many purposes, such as getting a tan and getting that summer body, or tanning up yourself to get ready for a bodybuilding contest. I am personally a bodybuilder and this is my favorite tanning product EVER. Instant tan that lasts for long.</li>
            <li> Only bought that just like couple of days again in addition to first got it currently the actual shipping had been fast certainly and the product just impressed me personally due to the fact We&#x27;ve never ever noticed something that way. This just impressed me personally. Along with I&#x27;ll definitely buy a brand-new bottle.</li>
            <li> It is really different than other products, this is one of the bests wich really works. before this product i used different lotions but when i use this i fell geniune difference. after use it needs just 1 hover to intensife a skin color. smells very good and i felt a nature. and to the conclusion what is main in this product. it has no side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great and gets you quite a bit darker immediately after use. Goes in very smooth and not to greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Bronzer has silicone so it leaves a nice silky feeling on my skin. No oily or greasy residue. Lotion is thinner than regular lotion, so alittle goes along way. Shake the bottle well before using. The bronzer is very subtle and isn&#x27;t noticeable going on but after a couple of hours in the sun a huge difference is seen by me. (I am fare skinned, usually tan lightly after initial sunburn). Nice lite smell, nothing like other sunning lotions that I&#x27;ve bought off the shelf in stores. No streaking either. I put it on in the morning after my shower (just like I would a skin lotion), I even apply it to my face, no fumes or burning the eyes noticed, then around noon or so I reapply before heading outside to lay out in the sun for 2-3 hours. After applying let dry completely before dressing, no color transfer to clothing at all (or at least not for me).  After 1 week of my &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34;, I am nicely tanned. This has become my favorite bronzer.</li>
            <li> smells amazing and gives be a beautiful tan! love this lotion, highly recommend</li>
            <li> I waited awhile before posting a review because I wanted to see how my skin looked after a few weeks of use. My skin is soft and GLOWING! I&#x27;m an older woman, so it&#x27;s wonderful to see this effect. Also, the lotion is lovely going on. It has a very smooth texture and a soft fragrance that isn&#x27;t too overpowering. Time to reorder!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I feel like I really need to on this one and save someone else the trouble. This had great reviews and I was really excited when it came so fast. My excitement was short-lived: this product is basically a self-tanner...leaves you orange and streaky even after rubbing it in meticulously. And I can&#x27;t seem to get it off even after scrubbing and exfoliating. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I have tried a lot of tanning lotions out there, and I&#x27;m usually not picky but this product is simply awful. Please be more accurate with the description and change it to a self-tanner.</li>
            <li> After hours in the burning sun I gave up, my skin didn&#x27;t look like it had tanned at all. I decided to buy Darksyde and am super happy I did. I put it on and almost instantly I could notice the difference. I look so much tanner and the scent of Coconut is amazing! I love this lotion and would definitely buy it again! It did was the sun couldn&#x27;t do in seconds!!!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is one of the best i&#x27;ve ever purchased! The lotion smells good and helps to accelerates the tanning process. A must buy for those who are trying to get tanned, this lotion helps to fasten the process!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product. I usually am not the one to buy tanning lotion but all my friends recommend I get this since I have such pale skin. After the first application, my skin looked remarkably darker and it&#x27;s not a fake looking tan but one as if you were getting it from the sun. I definitely recommend this product to anyone and I will be definitely buying more soon in the future.</li>
            <li> Let me start buy saying I wasnt paid to buy this product or sent a free bottle.  I saw that the reviews might have been fluffed but decided for the price it was worth a shot.  So far I think i really like it, it might even be worthy of five stars for the price. I actually ordered a second bottle of the other scent and will see how I like that.  The scent isnt bad, kinda beachy, its not great, just okay. The color however is nice. Before this i used paint it black and other variations of those cheap 13ounce brands on here. The only one that seemed to work okay was the tingle one and I hated seeing people I knew after the tanner, hugging them, then remembering I had to remind them their face might burn off in the next 20 minutes. So to save the embarrassment I decided to find a not tingle tanning lotion that worked to give me color.  This one clearly has bronzers because my nails and in between my fingers can get stained since I leave it on a few hours after the tanner.  I would say watch out for this, it can be a good thing and a bad thing, good because you know you will get color but bad because it can leave your hands sorta strange looking, its not as horrible as a sunless tanner product and shouldnt stain clothes but be aware of it.  The consistency is strange, seems high in silicone because when I apply it its like im rubbing lube all over me.  Not awful just a new texture from what im used to. It does spread easily tho which is nice and it seems to soak up pretty good too and not leave me super greasy.  Over all for the size and price I like it, the biggest downside is having to carry around such a large bottle every time i tan.  Will let you know how I like the other scent.</li>
            <li> SMELLS AMAZING! I have used SO MANY tanning accelerators over the years, and hands down, this product smells THE BEST out of anything I have EVER TRIED in the past!! Doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;after tan&amp;#34; smell like many tan products do. Not only that, but after using the just ONE TIME, I was able to notice a major difference in color! I will definitely be buying this again and again!!</li>
            <li> Have tried over a dozen different types of tanning lotion and some work better than others but Darksyde Pitch Black was amazing!  First off most smell horrible and this smells very good, no worrying about tanning before work or a meeting.  Within a week I noticed a nice bronze coating and it sticks, no water was washing this golden tan away!</li>
            <li> Turned me orange despite others&#x27; reiviews that said it didn&#x27;t do that to them. Probably just my skin type or my tanning bed.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the incredible smell - MY WORD!  Everyone kept saying how good the office smelt, and later that night I was with a friend who said I smelt like Disney World.  Definitely a compliment in my book!  I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of Mystic/airbrush tanning and this lotion is the perfect companion.  You better bet it will be right by my side at the pool all summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already contacted Amazon to red flag Green Web Inc. When people buy this lotion, Green Web sends out a note in the package to write a review telling their &amp;#34;success stories&amp;#34; with this product and they will receive a free bottle of the Darksyde self tanner. I bought both of these products based on how great the reviews were, and now I know why they were so unusually positive. Don&#x27;t waste your money on Darksyde products. This is an unproven company soliciting falsified reviews through Green Web (which, if you take a look at the products they sell, is not the most reputable or respectable company selling on Amazon). Please take your money elsewhere, and don&#x27;t trust any reviews for Darksyde lotion sold by Green Web Inc.</li>
            <li> 5 big stars for this lotion. Works really well on everyone who&#x27;s tried it and with $32 off, you can&#x27;t go wrong here. Feels great on the skin and the smell is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> This lotion was awful!!! :(  I&#x27;m an experienced tanner and thought I&#x27;d try a new lotion.. I had DARK BROWN streaks all over my legs for a week!!!  I could not believe it!  I give 0 stars!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it&#x27;s got a great smell and really gets you a nice bronze color fast.</li>
            <li> At first I was reluctant but after using it I can see the changes. Will share with my friends and continue using!</li>
            <li> I am the type of person that gets burnt more easily than tan, but when i started using this you could really see a difference. Another plus is that it smells great and it works well. Would highly recommend purchasing this to get tan this summer.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best tanning lotion that my girlfriend ever used according to her, the smell of it is very attracting and the effect of tanning is very quick and effective. Worth it of the price.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time.  The smell reminds me of being at the beach. The color looks very natural, just like I was at the beach.</li>
            <li> I came across this product while looking for a moderately priced tanning lotion. Darksyde was the winner due to its low price and large bottle size. I am definitely pleased with the performance of this lotion. It is thinner than other lotions I have used, but I consider this a plus as it will last much longer. The lotion rubs on easily and absorbs quickly- I have never had any problems with streaking. Overall, it provides an even brownish tan color, no fake orange glow. This is a great product at a great price point. Try it!!</li>
            <li> Great product! !!  It smells so good,  just like coconut... and being on a beach. Tans evenly and goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> The coconut smell isn&#x27;t for everyone. It&#x27;s a bit over powering. However it works very well at tanning you. Does not make you orange and looks really natural. I use it in the tanning bed and also at the beach.</li>
            <li> Smells good at first but once you apply it the smell is  terrible</li>
            <li> After searching around for a decent tanning product, i came across this for the Mrs. Smells great and is really thin and smooth. Not to greasy. Rubs onto the skin really well and just leaves a fine sheen over the skin. Brings out a brilliant tan after a day at the beach. Thanks for the Great product.</li>
            <li> Unlike most tanning lotion this actually smells really good! In just a few hours I noticed a huge difference in my tan, now I gotta just go even out the lines haha!</li>
            <li> Tried this just as it is a bit cheaper than some of the other lotions out there, and this works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tanned after just 1 application, and it does last so you wouldnt need too much at one go.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product due to the fairly great reviews... it does have a bit of a strong smell, but that goes away once applied to the body.  Everything about this lotion was great except that the day after I went tanning, I realized the bronzing agent in the lotion left huge streaks on the back side of my arms.  I had rubbed the product in very well and wasn&#x27;t able to see any evident streaking until the next day - and it was too late to rub the lotion in or remove the streaking on my own.  I had to just let it fade way over 3-4 days.  Overall a great product, just make sure you rub it in well - and keep away from your eyes and it did make my eyes water a bit when applied to the face.</li>
            <li> This is better than the lotions they sell at the salon for over 100$ and the bottle is big and is lasting me a long time!</li>
            <li> My girlfried loved this lotion, it made her very tan and she seems to enjoy it :) You need it up here in the winter because no one likes going out and tanning when its 15 degrees!</li>
            <li> This lotion is just great, it applies perfect and I will be using this in the future. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good lotion with a GREAT price.</li>
            <li> Amazing tanning lotion. Different than all the other products, skin looked remarkably darker and not that fake looking tan that most products tend to do on your skin.  Really happy with results, and I didn&#x27;t burn my skin which I&#x27;m amazed by. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Dark. Great scent.  Kinda stingy. Can&#x27;t use on face.  Kind of made me feel really hot (like temperature).  Super thin almost watery.</li>
            <li> After looking at tons of other lotions, I decided to go  for this one. I have a hard time tanning and keeping my tan, but with this lotion i could go a few times a month and look way tan i love it! It works great, smells great!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion after reading all the reviews, Perfect , i am fair ( light ) skinned and I got very bronzed ( natural ) with this lotion with in a few sessions. I didn&#x27;t fell dry or peel after using this lotion , I would recommend this lotion to every one, VERY fast Delivery time and GREAT PRICE .....</li>
            <li> Huge Bottle, Great Price, Smells GREAT!! &#x3D;) Excited to try this tonight when I go tan!  All the reviews are so good I know I will be completely satisfied. Great Job Darksyde!</li>
            <li> Disgusting. Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> works well, gives a nice color. consistency is a little thin but does not affect performance, if anything, makes it last longer.  my favorite part is the smell.  has a yummy coconut smell that stays even after tanning so you don&#x27;t smell like nasty burnt skin like some other lotions.</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion, I used this lotion in the sun and I got  amazing color without burning I laid out for  an hour and a 1/2  on each side. As for Indoor tanning I did a session today and used this lotion all I could say is AMAZING!!! All my friends think I went away on vacation.</li>
            <li> I just recently started tanning and was getting red but not darkening much.  After using Darksyde Pitch Black I&#x27;m already noticing a large difference after just one session!  Seems to leave nice even tone and will leave further reviews once I have used for about another month!</li>
            <li> This lotion applied on nicely and works great in the tanning bed.  I love love love the coconut scent.  It smells so good,  I am very happy with this tanning lotion.  I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Good solid lotion. Smells great. Leaves skin soft and brown. Definitely value for money.</li>
            <li> leaves hands colored. Wash hands after applying lotion or it is there for several days. Not to bad to tan with,</li>
            <li> Great product! After one use I noticed I was so much darker! I have fair skin and don&#x27;t tan easy, but I did with this product! A must have!!</li>
            <li> It stains your skin. Shower immediately after you tan. Also the lotion is more of a weird smooshy liquid. It gives great color but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the mess.</li>
            <li> My wife was tanning with some lotion given by her friend at work that made her look a little orange. Come to find out it was expired. After review upon review I picked up this lotion for her and placed in her gym bag, she was very happy. She has been using this product for a month now she seems very happy and for the $18 I spent compared to the other crazy prices I&#x27;m happy. I will be ordering again once she gets close to the end of the bottle. Smells good and provides result. No complaint from her no complaints from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has two of her friends at the gym using the lotion also happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion based on reviews and it is wonderful! I was stuck on a plateau and this lotion got me over the hump I was noticeably darker after one use. The smell awesome and the lotion is so silly and doesn&#x27;t leak a thick sticky residue.</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion...girlfriend and I both love it!</li>
            <li> Worked great, very moisturizing.  The coconut smell is amazing.  Love this!  Would highly recommend this product. It helped keep a deeper more even looking tan.</li>
            <li> By far the worst lotion I have ever used! Smells like play-doh! Does not smell like coconut at all and leaves brown blotchy spots on my skin. Do not recommend!</li>
            <li> Coconut smell is awesome, doesn&#x27;t leave your hands looking like you cleaned them with mud, and definitely darkens you up. Skin feels very smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> I picked up this tanning lotion a few days ago at the recommendation of a friend. Being from a city where you can lay out on the beach and &amp;#34;get your tan on&amp;#34;. It was great to finally find a product that not only delivered the tan but extra benefits that are skin needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I will be sure to buy up a few more when I run out!</li>
            <li> Horrible lotion!!!!!!! It streaked my entire body!!!</li>
            <li> Just purchased it like few days back and got it today the shipping was fast indeed and the product just amazed me because I have never ever seen a product like that. This product just amazed me. So I would recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Australian Gold, Designer Skin, Millennium Black Storm and now Darksyde Pitch Black. The only one I wasn&#x27;t happy with was Black Storm. But Darksyde seems to get me darkest fastest. And the smell is amazing!! A++</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;d spend as much or more on the tanning lotions as I did on the membership to the beds themselves.  Darksyde is incredibly cheap and has turned my skin from pale ghost to golden god in a matter of a week.  I can&#x27;t emphasize enough how important the lotion is in tanning, and this one has great color and effectiveness, and smells neither super-girly nor like playdoh like almost all others, so it&#x27;s a perfect middle ground.  I&#x27;ll be buying more very soon.</li>
            <li> Darksyde is AMAZING! It is so hard to find a good tanning lotion- Darksyde give you a deep color and smells GREAT. A little goes a long way- it is thick and wonderful. I will def be buying more in the future (:</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It smells wonderful and gives amazing color after just a few tans. I can&#x27;t wait to continue using this lotion! You will not regret purchasing this lotion. 16oz for $12?? C&#x27;mon. You can&#x27;t pass that up!</li>
            <li> Great for instant color. Smells amazing. Goes on thin so the bottle should last you a long time. I will be buying more when I run out!</li>
            <li> This product is super watery and smells awful. I should&#x27;ve just returned it.</li>
            <li> Amazing tanning lotion. I am very pale and this lotion helps me acquire a great base tan with its tint before i start to build a more solid tan. Not only is it a bargain but it smells great as well. My go to tanning lotion for the summer.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is great it smells really good also it works great. I put some on for a couple days and I actually got a decent tan. usually I don&#x27;t get much of a tan but it is a great product.</li>
            <li> It is hard to explain how good this lotion is. It will make your skin feel soft, and you will probably get some eyes on you. This product will give you a stunning canella color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is made with natural ingredients, and it has infused vitamins, that will give your skin the properties it needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is Top Quality and it must be the best product out there on its category, 100% sure about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really need to try this, it will give you results in little to no time, and for me, this is the best anti aging lotion ever!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this high quality brand to everyone, don&#x27;t loose more time trying other &amp;#34;tanning lotions&amp;#34; that won&#x27;t give you not even near results!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: - soft skin&lt;br /&gt;  - natural supplement&lt;br /&gt;  - you need only a little amount of product on each use, it will almost last forever!&lt;br /&gt;  - the best tanning lotion you can get&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purchase that you will not regret in your whole life!</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and didn&#x27;t get to try it until today and i have to say i was surprised at how smooth and well this product worked.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this for the first time and was very happy with the results. It was a good price and came in 2 days. It a much more light weight than other silicone tanning lotions which was nice. It went on easy and didn&#x27;t leave me super slippery like most silicone lotions do. After using it s a couple times it seems to help me tan a lot and I like how lightweight it is. The only thing I would improve on it the smell, there&#x27;s not much of a scent to it at all - kinda like coconut but I would add some more fragrance.</li>
            <li> Hate it!  It was like watered down oatmeal.  I threw it in the trash after using 2 times</li>
            <li> The smell is awful and lingers. It smells like bread dough or old bread or something. And it&#x27;s full of PARABENS. No good… I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> I was shocked. No joke. I works better then any other one I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;jon</li>
            <li> If you wipe your hand and feet after it is ok. If not they are orange.</li>
            <li> Love the coconut smell. Good product</li>
