            <li>it is good for all types of pain &amp; ailments.</li>
            <li>Thunder Ridge puts out a good product.  </li>

            <li>This one was a great price, and with amazon&#x27;s shipping fulfillment, an even better deal.</li>

            <li>Dogs and cats love it too!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>I have a lot of skin problems and no matter what the dermatologist gave me it never worked, but when I tried the emu oil, my skin felt so amazing</li>
            <li>Its amazing</li>
            <li>We find it amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>They also have a nice spray oil that I use after a shower.  </li>
            <li>best results we were able to achieve was mosturizing with lotion right out of the bath followed by a layer of oil</li>
            <li>It is very nicely scented and rich.</li>
            <li>Emu is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever found for my sensitive, hyper-allergic skin.  </li>
            <li>one is more of an oil greasy feel than the DrEmu.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li>mark my word, once more people catch on to this stuff</li>
            <li>oh yeah, it&#x27;s way cheaper than all those potions you can buy at the Macy&#x27;s cosmetic counter that don&#x27;t really do much more than Pond&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The Emu Oil has made that feel much better,</li>
            <li>LOVE emu oil.</li>
            <li>The product itself is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Could those of you who have used it for more than a couple of months for your thinning hair update?    </li>
            <li>(hope it stays that way), my lips love it and don&#x27;t peel and crack.  </li>
            <li>no antibiotics have ever worked for more than a week or two.  </li>
            <li>Thought if it did all it said, I&#x27;d better buy the 8-ounce size because I could sure use it.   </li>
            <li>I use their body lotion (which is more like a cream) on my body.  </li>
            <li>I love how this product makes my face feel...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve done your research ...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many emus it takes to fill a bottle</li>
            <li>Fabulous product!</li>
            <li>I became interested in the Emu oil when i read it was good for eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely wonderful on extremely  dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It also heals cuts quickly, it truly is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This fantastic moisturizer will be great to use during the humid months of summer as well, no slick greasy, make you sweat bullets moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Additionally, his skin tore easily when working out in the yard.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly--</li>
            <li>this makes a great moisturizer and made my surgery scars barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>However is oily and can be dealt with just fine.</li>
            <li>So on that note, 4 out of 5 stars is more than adequate.</li>
            <li>So I spreads out nice for large body</li>
            <li>but I liked it so much</li>
            <li>When he began applications of the emu oil on a daily basis, both of these problems were greatly lessened.</li>
            <li>This stuff is a terrific moisturizer and great for achy muscles and joints.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>It really does do what they say!!!</li>
            <li>and I have not seen a significant difference in my hair scape bald area.</li>
            <li>I bought it originally for skin moisturizing, but read that some use it for joint and muscle pain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll buy Emu oil again because I use it with some of my essential oils, but I doubt I&#x27;ll order from this vendor again if that&#x27;s the kind of shipping they do!</li>
            <li>I looked it up Amazon and found that this was the most positively reviewed and made of 100% Emu oil.  </li>
            <li>I love that this brand (Thunder Ridge) is 100% pure.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing this stuff works this well, and it is completely natural.</li>
            <li>I gave this a 5 star because I have been hearing really good things about it, especially for thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>A friend of my mother&#x27;s suggested that my wife apply Emu oil while going through radiation treatment for breast cancer (caught early - treatment now complete - excellent prognosis) which is really damaging to the skin and underlying tissues.</li>
            <li>So the saying may be true...</li>
            <li>The stories are true.  </li>
            <li>But since I bought one bottle for myself my mom and aunt fell in love and I&#x27;ve bought several more for them.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling like satin.  </li>
            <li>quickly.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>It sank in quickly, didn&#x27;t leave an oily appearance and I received compliments on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely order more when I run out!</li>
            <li>I use it topically and it just feels amazing.</li>
            <li>So it is nice I can kind of compare the 2 products at least on</li>
            <li>Came on time fresh and well bottled.</li>
            <li>but is it worth killing an animal for?</li>
            <li>Upon opening, the oil was fresh and odor-free.  </li>
            <li>I also think that it will be good for other conditions as well, time will tell.</li>
            <li>Almost the whole family has tried it including myself and find that he is exactly right!</li>
            <li>A few drops of Pure Emu Oil greatly increase the range of motion in my arm and wrist, and also ease the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty greasy feeling...</li>
            <li>I first heard of emu oil while reading my Oxygen magazine.  </li>
            <li>I first tried it on my face, . .</li>
            <li>At first it will look greasy, but absorbs gradually.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be more conservative with the next bottle.</li>
            <li>I used emu oil with my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>keeps my skin smooth and silky soft.</li>
            <li>Thunder Ridge is the real thing!</li>
            <li>emu oil is the #1 in first aid applied with a Q-tip for burns, cuts, bug bites, sore muscles, &amp; I</li>
            <li>and we have tried many different kinds of mosturizers, lotions, creams and oils.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>on my second bottle, love it</li>
            <li>This product absorbs into the skin instantly and leaves it smooth and super moisturized.</li>
            <li>but it sure is worth the price of admission for my dry skin!</li>
            <li>The product itself is nearly odorless, clean and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>worth it; you really don&#x27;t need to use that much...</li>
            <li>He has had dry skin for many years and is the youngest of our 10 siblings.</li>
            <li>Well I have been using the Pure Emu Oil for almost 3 mos</li>
            <li>Some studies have shown it to aid internally in certain digestive problems- since we purchased this large of a bottle, we might give it a try for those as well.</li>
            <li>and I was immediately surprised how well this stuff goes right into you skin leaving it so super baby soft.  </li>
            <li>but this one really does.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS, and,</li>
            <li>I really didnt want to pay $30 for something that may be a flake, but I decided to take a chance.</li>
            <li>and she felt it really made a difference.  </li>
            <li>When I received the bottle and opened it, it was rancid and stunk to high heaven!</li>
            <li>because it all natural and not mass produced I&#x27;m willing to dish out the money for this product and support the USA farm.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on the high review ratings.</li>
            <li>she said that it mimics skin&#x27;s natural oils and absorbs better than any other oil.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any lotion for dry skin and wrinkle reduction, I was totally skeptic to try it, but it works as well as the claims.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was right on schedule and properly packed.</li>
            <li>This makes me wonder if I even got a new bottle or one</li>
            <li>This product is great for dry skin, also for thin skin of older adults.</li>
            <li>For the first time she actually felt a lot of relief.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m 8 mo pregnant and bigger than my first pregnancy and have no new stretch marks</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;100% Pure oil from the american emu&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Now as far as the uses</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s too early to tell who knows?    </li>
            <li>possibly put too much on my face??</li>
            <li>Absorbs and leaves skin extremely soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big oil fan, not so much on lotion, but like oils for my skin.</li>
            <li>My feet are soft as a baby&#x27;s now.  </li>
            <li>It takes the pain away from overworked muscles without leaving a burn or yucky residue, and the nicest thing is that after applying it to sore legs, you don&#x27;t have to run wash it off your hands because it just sinks right in and moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>I live in New York and have always had problems in the wintertime with chapped skin which led to open sores.   </li>
            <li>Just got back from Dominican Republic with red sunburns and Emu Oil helped to soothe it very fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to say with certainity that it was the Emu oil, but since then she has continued to use Emu oil as a moisturizer for dry skin and now my 16 year old daughter has her own bottle.</li>
            <li>I would definetily recommend this for anyone who has dry rough skin or who has a wrinkle or two to smooth out.  </li>
            <li>This is four times as much for only twice the price as my local health store.</li>
            <li>It should be noted that the bottles we have received are much prettier solid blue than the one shown in the Amazon picture.</li>
            <li>It last for up to a week after application and makes the skin very soft without the dryness.</li>
            <li>I would use it more regularly but it does have a mild chicken grease (Emu) smell to it.</li>
            <li>it then feels incredibly soft and that is a huge plus especially when dealing with hard water.  </li>
            <li>This product does moisturize your hair and make it feel sooooo soft and silky and that&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li>I probably expected too much after reading the reviews claiming this product relieves aching muscles and joints.  </li>
            <li>within minutes your skin feels soft and looks about a decade younger, with no oily residue.  </li>
            <li>Only recently purchased some and wow!</li>

            <li> A friend of my mother&#x27;s suggested that my wife apply Emu oil while going through radiation treatment for breast cancer (caught early - treatment now complete - excellent prognosis) which is really damaging to the skin and underlying tissues.</li>
            <li> So the saying may be true...</li>
            <li> The stories are true.  </li>
            <li> But since I bought one bottle for myself my mom and aunt fell in love and I&#x27;ve bought several more for them.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling like satin.  </li>
            <li> quickly.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> It sank in quickly, didn&#x27;t leave an oily appearance and I received compliments on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely order more when I run out!</li>
            <li> I use it topically and it just feels amazing.</li>
            <li> So it is nice I can kind of compare the 2 products at least on</li>
            <li> Came on time fresh and well bottled.</li>
            <li> but is it worth killing an animal for?</li>
            <li> Upon opening, the oil was fresh and odor-free.  </li>
            <li> I also think that it will be good for other conditions as well, time will tell.</li>
            <li> Almost the whole family has tried it including myself and find that he is exactly right!</li>
            <li> A few drops of Pure Emu Oil greatly increase the range of motion in my arm and wrist, and also ease the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty greasy feeling...</li>
            <li> I first heard of emu oil while reading my Oxygen magazine.  </li>
            <li> I first tried it on my face, . .</li>
            <li> At first it will look greasy, but absorbs gradually.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be more conservative with the next bottle.</li>
            <li> I used emu oil with my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> keeps my skin smooth and silky soft.</li>
            <li> Thunder Ridge is the real thing!</li>
            <li> emu oil is the #1 in first aid applied with a Q-tip for burns, cuts, bug bites, sore muscles, &amp; I</li>
            <li> and we have tried many different kinds of mosturizers, lotions, creams and oils.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> on my second bottle, love it</li>
            <li> This product absorbs into the skin instantly and leaves it smooth and super moisturized.</li>
            <li> but it sure is worth the price of admission for my dry skin!</li>
            <li> The product itself is nearly odorless, clean and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> worth it; you really don&#x27;t need to use that much...</li>
            <li> He has had dry skin for many years and is the youngest of our 10 siblings.</li>
            <li> Well I have been using the Pure Emu Oil for almost 3 mos</li>
            <li> Some studies have shown it to aid internally in certain digestive problems- since we purchased this large of a bottle, we might give it a try for those as well.</li>
            <li> and I was immediately surprised how well this stuff goes right into you skin leaving it so super baby soft.  </li>
            <li> but this one really does.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS, and,</li>
            <li> I really didnt want to pay $30 for something that may be a flake, but I decided to take a chance.</li>
            <li> and she felt it really made a difference.  </li>
            <li> When I received the bottle and opened it, it was rancid and stunk to high heaven!</li>
            <li> because it all natural and not mass produced I&#x27;m willing to dish out the money for this product and support the USA farm.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the high review ratings.</li>
            <li> she said that it mimics skin&#x27;s natural oils and absorbs better than any other oil.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Works better than any lotion for dry skin and wrinkle reduction, I was totally skeptic to try it, but it works as well as the claims.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was right on schedule and properly packed.</li>
            <li> This makes me wonder if I even got a new bottle or one</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry skin, also for thin skin of older adults.</li>
            <li> For the first time she actually felt a lot of relief.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m 8 mo pregnant and bigger than my first pregnancy and have no new stretch marks</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;100% Pure oil from the american emu&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Now as far as the uses</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s too early to tell who knows?    </li>
            <li> possibly put too much on my face??</li>
            <li> Absorbs and leaves skin extremely soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big oil fan, not so much on lotion, but like oils for my skin.</li>
            <li> My feet are soft as a baby&#x27;s now.  </li>
            <li> It takes the pain away from overworked muscles without leaving a burn or yucky residue, and the nicest thing is that after applying it to sore legs, you don&#x27;t have to run wash it off your hands because it just sinks right in and moisturizes.  </li>
            <li> I live in New York and have always had problems in the wintertime with chapped skin which led to open sores.   </li>
            <li> Just got back from Dominican Republic with red sunburns and Emu Oil helped to soothe it very fast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say with certainity that it was the Emu oil, but since then she has continued to use Emu oil as a moisturizer for dry skin and now my 16 year old daughter has her own bottle.</li>
            <li> I would definetily recommend this for anyone who has dry rough skin or who has a wrinkle or two to smooth out.  </li>
            <li> This is four times as much for only twice the price as my local health store.</li>
            <li> It should be noted that the bottles we have received are much prettier solid blue than the one shown in the Amazon picture.</li>
            <li> It last for up to a week after application and makes the skin very soft without the dryness.</li>
            <li> I would use it more regularly but it does have a mild chicken grease (Emu) smell to it.</li>
            <li> it then feels incredibly soft and that is a huge plus especially when dealing with hard water.  </li>
            <li> This product does moisturize your hair and make it feel sooooo soft and silky and that&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I probably expected too much after reading the reviews claiming this product relieves aching muscles and joints.  </li>
            <li> within minutes your skin feels soft and looks about a decade younger, with no oily residue.  </li>
            <li> Only recently purchased some and wow!</li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d put it in a jar, &#x27;cause it&#x27;s a bit too thick to easily come out of the little hole in the cap.  </li>
            <li> A bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Emu oil like many other natural oils should change consistency when it gets cold, it gets thicker.</li>
            <li> It can last a long time if used this way.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> my skin looks smoother and plumper and my wrinkles are far less noticeable.</li>
            <li> if your face is really dry, you can add a drop to your regular moisturizer (rather than use it</li>
            <li> the emu we started out daily and now have his dry skin managed with one to two applications</li>
            <li> so soft--- a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing the trick after minor surgery on my arm.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve since used it on muscle strains and other sore external areas.  </li>
            <li> Some other emu oils I&#x27;ve ordered (like one with an emu on the label &amp; or no ingredients listed) were fake...or mixed with something.</li>
            <li> My brother who is a physician&#x27;s assistant recommended to our family, who have inherited dry skin from our parents, to try Emu Oil.</li>
            <li> I hope if you have this problem of dry skin, you will try this product.</li>
            <li> During the winter nothing will take away my dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> but then it feels dry but moisturized.  </li>
            <li> My son has extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> I am suffering from dry, itchy winter skin and this is a god send!</li>
            <li> I used it on half of my nephews face and on one arm for 3 days to help his excema and it helped enormously.  </li>
            <li> (it lasted me only about 2 1/2 months, but we were both using it generously); it&#x27;s a little pricey -- but</li>
            <li> I used this post-surgery many years ago to heal the skin at the incision, and the doctors were shocked by the speed at which it healed.  </li>
            <li> It always itches and is wet...</li>
            <li> Be careful on ordering from this company.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> just know that a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this oil!</li>
            <li> Maybe it does relieve aching muscles and joints due to over-exertion but it didn&#x27;t do squat for the pain I was experiencing.  </li>
            <li> But neither did oxycontin, percocet or any other pain reliever</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical</li>
            <li> its really expensive and doesnt really do much.</li>
            <li> This is truly a hidden gem.</li>
            <li> I used a little on my face and put some on my hair</li>
            <li> And after the treatment was complete and a few weeks of healing, her skin seems to have little ill effect from the radiation.</li>
            <li> I just got this a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I got the product, the cap was missing and the oil was all over the packing.</li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes to melt into the skin</li>
            <li> They are killed for this oil.  </li>
            <li> I have a friend who mixes in lavender oil with it so that she can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Oz a few months ago.</li>
            <li> This brand has an oilier feel and takes longer to soak into my skin than another brand I have used in past, but this one costs less.  </li>
            <li> I used this on a bad wound i had and its Bacteria germ killing effects worked very well,</li>
            <li> i have always been quite skeptical of beauty products that claim to \\&quot;turn back the clock,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> unlike cold creams that gives me pimples because i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you that hard water is \\&quot;Killer\\</li>
            <li> bottle didn&#x27;t have anything to protect it from opening, so consequently at least 1/4 of it spilled in the box.</li>
            <li> Any help for my skin is a plus as I have a serious skin problem.</li>
            <li> So I am using this one (which is less expensive) on my body parts and DrEmu on my face and neck only.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the DrEmu.&lt;br /&gt;The oil inside of Thunder&#x27;s bottle is like a thin creamy lotion.</li>
            <li> and i swear there is a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> It IS expensive but</li>
            <li> I wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive because I am almost out of it.  </li>
            <li> so well it should be illegal.</li>
            <li> And the weird thing we tried is that my mom has had an ear problem for 2 years.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but tried it on my knees...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is four times as much for only twice the price as my local health store. Words great and great price.</li>
            <li> I like it but it&#x27;s pretty greasy feeling...just use small amounts it doesn&#x27;t soak or absorb as much as I&#x27;d like!~ Pricey yet much better than a bunch of chemicals!~</li>
            <li> I bought Emu Oil because read great reviews about acne scar miracles and etc.  I&#x27;m using this product 2nd week in a row and haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference.  Maybe it&#x27;s too early to tell who knows?    But, Emu oil is great for skin sunburn. Just got back from Dominican Republic with red sunburns and Emu Oil helped to soothe it very fast.  This is why I gave it a 3 star.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my phoriasis. It does help some. It is a very good value also. Any help for my skin is a plus as I have a serious skin problem.</li>
            <li> I first heard of emu oil while reading my Oxygen magazine.  One of the cover girls mentioned that she uses it on her skin.  So, . . I looked it up Amazon and found that this was the most positively reviewed and made of 100% Emu oil.  At first I was a little skeptical I&#x27;ve never heard of anything with the word \\&quot;oil\\&quot; in it that does not leave you feeling greasy.  I first tried it on my face, . . I have acne scars and I was hoping it would help.  I used a little on my face and put some on my hair and I was immediately surprised how well this stuff goes right into you skin leaving it so super baby soft.  Now I don&#x27;t know if it will help thicken my hair or help remove my acne scars but I am impressed with the hydration.  I deffinitely plan on using it regularily to see how well it works.  It IS expensive but because it all natural and not mass produced I&#x27;m willing to dish out the money for this product and support the USA farm.  This is truly a hidden gem.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful!  But you have to remember to shake the H out of it before you use it.  At first it will look greasy, but absorbs gradually.  A little goes a long way.  Try it on your face before you go to bed...it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> My brother who is a physician&#x27;s assistant recommended to our family, who have inherited dry skin from our parents, to try Emu Oil. He has had dry skin for many years and is the youngest of our 10 siblings. I am the oldest boy of 7. Almost the whole family has tried it including myself and find that he is exactly right! What a relief for our family to find such a product. It last for up to a week after application and makes the skin very soft without the dryness. I hope if you have this problem of dry skin, you will try this product.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give Emu Oil a try after a massage therapist told me that it was good for arthritis.  It seems to ease aching joints, it is very good for your skin also.  I use it after a workout at the gym and I put it on after a shower and before bed.  I wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive because I am almost out of it.  I also use it on my face because it is supposed to be good for wrinkles.  I recommend it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I just got this a few days ago. I also ordered DrEmu for my face. So it is nice I can kind of compare the 2 products at least on how it looks.&lt;br /&gt;This one is more of an oil greasy feel than the DrEmu. So I am using this one (which is less expensive) on my body parts and DrEmu on my face and neck only.&lt;br /&gt;I possibly put too much on my face?? But my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb it as well as the DrEmu.&lt;br /&gt;The oil inside of Thunder&#x27;s bottle is like a thin creamy lotion. So I spreads out nice for large body parts.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t know how well it works for a couple of months. Husband is also trying on hair line too. I am also putting on son&#x27;s dermitis on back of arms. So we will see!</li>
            <li> I just received the emu oil and I&#x27;m in love with it! During the winter nothing will take away my dry, itchy skin. This product absorbs into the skin instantly and leaves it smooth and super moisturized. This fantastic moisturizer will be great to use during the humid months of summer as well, no slick greasy, make you sweat bullets moisturizer. I also think that it will be good for other conditions as well, time will tell. I have acne prone skin and I surmise it will help with that. I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> my friend who recently finished esthetician school recommended this product to me. she said that it mimics skin&#x27;s natural oils and absorbs better than any other oil. i have been using it on my face at night for about four months now and i swear there is a dramatic difference. my skin looks smoother and plumper and my wrinkles are far less noticeable. i have always been quite skeptical of beauty products that claim to \\&quot;turn back the clock,\\&quot; but this one really does. I have never been so sold on something in my entire life. mark my word, once more people catch on to this stuff it&#x27;s going to be the next miracle treatment. IT REALLY WORKS, and, oh yeah, it&#x27;s way cheaper than all those potions you can buy at the Macy&#x27;s cosmetic counter that don&#x27;t really do much more than Pond&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> You can use this anywhere...if your face is really dry, you can add a drop to your regular moisturizer (rather than use it staight)...I add it to Eucerin.  Absorbs and leaves skin extremely soft.  I used it to help heal daughter&#x27;s eczema/breakout from reaction to water softener (I mixed it with Aquaphor or Eucerin)...but I liked it so much I kept it in my bathroom and used after every shower. I am ordering another bottle (it lasted me only about 2 1/2 months, but we were both using it generously); it&#x27;s a little pricey -- but worth it; you really don&#x27;t need to use that much...I&#x27;ll be more conservative with the next bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the high review ratings. I really didnt want to pay $30 for something that may be a flake, but I decided to take a chance. Well I have been using the Pure Emu Oil for almost 3 mos and I have not seen a significant difference in my hair scape bald area. This product does moisturize your hair and make it feel sooooo soft and silky and that&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 3 stars. But there are cheaper hair lotions out there that does the same thing. [...]</li>
            <li> I broke my forearm 11 years ago and still have a metal plate in there.  A few drops of Pure Emu Oil greatly increase the range of motion in my arm and wrist, and also ease the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I recently had another problem -- bursitis in my left shoulder.  Voila!  The Emu Oil has made that feel much better, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is odorless, non-greasy and lasts for hours.  I&#x27;m ordering another bottle today, in fact.</li>
            <li> Packaging is Gorgeous...changed from photo. LOVE emu oil. I&#x27;m a big oil fan, not so much on lotion, but like oils for my skin. Emu is mine and my families VERY favorite pick. This one was a great price, and with amazon&#x27;s shipping fulfillment, an even better deal. The product itself is fabulous! Ordering two more today!!</li>
            <li> So I decided I wanted to convert to Emu, and after extensive research in Man / Flightless Bird, I came up with the answer to all my problems was SQUAAAAAAAAAAWK</li>
            <li> Hi  My Doctor told me about this product.  I have Osteo, carpel tunnel and arthitis. I have used this product for months with good results.  I recomended this product to my massage theropist and my acupuncturist.  I also use Thunder Ridge Moisturizing Lotion.</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well it should be illegal. I have a lot of skin problems and no matter what the dermatologist gave me it never worked, but when I tried the emu oil, my skin felt so amazing and my skin cleared up. I use it for getting rid of my stretch marks and acne scars and they are all gone. I also use it on my scalp to make my hair grow faster and soften my hair. It is amazing this stuff works this well, and it is completely natural.</li>
            <li> This is the best emu oil.  I trust thunder Ridge</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry skin, also for thin skin of older adults. My husband&#x27;s hands were constantly bruised. Additionally, his skin tore easily when working out in the yard. When he began applications of the emu oil on a daily basis, both of these problems were greatly lessened.</li>
            <li> I got the product, the cap was missing and the oil was all over the packing. Don&#x27;t buy this from this seller.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 5 star because I have been hearing really good things about it, especially for thinning hair.  Could those of you who have used it for more than a couple of months for your thinning hair update?    I thank you in advance.</li>
            <li> I use this product for dry/chapped Irish skin.  I live in New York and have always had problems in the wintertime with chapped skin which led to open sores.   All that is gone now that I use the Emu Oil.  Thank you</li>
            <li> A friend of my mother&#x27;s suggested that my wife apply Emu oil while going through radiation treatment for breast cancer (caught early - treatment now complete - excellent prognosis) which is really damaging to the skin and underlying tissues. After looking at prices and reviews on Amazon, she decided to use Thunder Ridge. She was two weeks into her treatments when she started applying the Emu oil and she felt it really made a difference.  Her doctor was impressed by the health of her skin throughout the duration of the radiation treatment. And after the treatment was complete and a few weeks of healing, her skin seems to have little ill effect from the radiation. It&#x27;s hard to say with certainity that it was the Emu oil, but since then she has continued to use Emu oil as a moisturizer for dry skin and now my 16 year old daughter has her own bottle. It should be noted that the bottles we have received are much prettier solid blue than the one shown in the Amazon picture.</li>
            <li> I used this on a bad wound i had and its Bacteria germ killing effects worked very well,Healing that in two days!</li>
            <li> I used emu oil with my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.  I am prone to stretch marks as I have gotten them from just gaining weight.  I plan to use it again with my second pregancy.</li>
            <li> Works better than any lotion for dry skin and wrinkle reduction, I was totally skeptic to try it, but it works as well as the claims.  I would definetily recommend this for anyone who has dry rough skin or who has a wrinkle or two to smooth out.  My face has never been more acne free too, I am impressed.</li>
            <li> This brand has an oilier feel and takes longer to soak into my skin than another brand I have used in past, but this one costs less.  So the saying may be true...\\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\&quot;    Anyway, once the oil soaks into my skin it then feels incredibly soft and that is a huge plus especially when dealing with hard water.  Let me tell you that hard water is \\&quot;Killer\\&quot; on the skin....    So on that note, 4 out of 5 stars is more than adequate.</li>
            <li> Emu oil...a miracle oil?  Maybe.  But since I bought one bottle for myself my mom and aunt fell in love and I&#x27;ve bought several more for them.  So far I&#x27;m 8 mo pregnant and bigger than my first pregnancy and have no new stretch marks (hope it stays that way), my lips love it and don&#x27;t peel and crack.  I used it on half of my nephews face and on one arm for 3 days to help his excema and it helped enormously.  Of course he has never treated it with anything else, so I can&#x27;t say if regular lotion would have worked.  And the weird thing we tried is that my mom has had an ear problem for 2 years.  It always itches and is wet...no antibiotics have ever worked for more than a week or two.  So after reading the benefits, I suggested she dip a q-tip in the oil and put it in her ear.  For the first time she actually felt a lot of relief.  It wasn&#x27;t cured but definitely is on the mend.  The product itself is nearly odorless, clean and not greasy.  It takes a few minutes to melt into the skin but then it feels dry but moisturized.  Its amazing and I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this oil! I absolutely love it! I am suffering from dry, itchy winter skin and this is a god send! It was packaged properly so it arrived in tact! I will definitely order more when I run out!</li>
            <li> Still waiting for my emu oil to arrive.  I&#x27;ve tried emailing the company several times with no reply from them.  I will be filing a claim with Amazon to get my money back.    Be careful on ordering from this company.  Their customer service is non-existent.</li>
            <li> Read about the wonders of emu oil online and had to try it.  Thought if it did all it said, I&#x27;d better buy the 8-ounce size because I could sure use it.   The stories are true.  This stuff is a terrific moisturizer and great for achy muscles and joints.  It absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling like satin.  It takes the pain away from overworked muscles without leaving a burn or yucky residue, and the nicest thing is that after applying it to sore legs, you don&#x27;t have to run wash it off your hands because it just sinks right in and moisturizes.  Think Amazon has the best price on this product and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and love it.  I bought it originally for skin moisturizing, but read that some use it for joint and muscle pain. I was a bit skeptical, but tried it on my knees...don&#x27;t know why it works, but it does.  We&#x27;ve since used it on muscle strains and other sore external areas.  The relief is almost instant. We find it amazing.</li>
            <li> I became interested in the Emu oil when i read it was good for eyelashes. This emu oil is wonderful! No funky smell and my eyelashes are truly getting thicker and longer!  Great price on Amazon!! Will buy again but this may last forever!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  It works so well.  Skin feels hydrated.  Fewer lines and wrinkles.  No dryness.  Wish I could drink it</li>
            <li> I use it topically and it just feels amazing. It doesn&#x27;t smell. A bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for very dry skin.  My feet are soft as a baby&#x27;s now.  It takes the pain out of those cooking burns within minutes.  It heals cuts etc. quickly.  Just be careful.  Dogs and cats love it too!</li>
            <li> my girlfriend told me to get this for my dandruff. its really expensive and doesnt really do much. if you have dandruff i recommend head and shoulders CONDITIONER. not reg. head and shoulders. that stuff kicks ass</li>
            <li> I use the emu oil on my knees (which are actually knee replacements) every night and I think it helps with stiffness!  I use their body lotion (which is more like a cream) on my body.  It is very nicely scented and rich. I wish they&#x27;d put it in a jar, &#x27;cause it&#x27;s a bit too thick to easily come out of the little hole in the cap.  They also have a nice spray oil that I use after a shower.  Nice sellers, too!</li>
            <li> The Emu oil i recieved was in a blue bottle and not like the one displayed here!There was no safetly seal on the bottle either. Won&#x27;t order again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! Use it as my carrier oil with my EO&#x27;s and DMAE for my face - just know that a little goes a LONG way. Best massage oil for sore muscles - use it with Wintergreen, Sweet Marjoram and Lavender.  Recommended by my massage therapist.  Said it is good for inflammation.</li>
            <li> keeps my skin smooth and silky soft. unlike cold creams that gives me pimples because i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Seems to be doing the trick after minor surgery on my arm.  Also using it on my face and neck areas.</li>
            <li> I probably expected too much after reading the reviews claiming this product relieves aching muscles and joints.  I decided to try this after having arthroscopic knee surgery. Maybe it does relieve aching muscles and joints due to over-exertion but it didn&#x27;t do squat for the pain I was experiencing.  But neither did oxycontin, percocet or any other pain reliever I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flip side this makes a great moisturizer and made my surgery scars barely noticeable.  I would purchase again if this product was sold on store shelves but I won&#x27;t continue to order online having to pay shipping.</li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my face feel... so soft--- a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Came on time fresh and well bottled.</li>
            <li> Thunder Ridge is the real thing! Emu oil like many other natural oils should change consistency when it gets cold, it gets thicker. Some other emu oils I&#x27;ve ordered (like one with an emu on the label &amp; or no ingredients listed) were fake...or mixed with something. This product has 1 ingredient and I quote...&amp;#34;100% Pure oil from the american emu&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Now as far as the uses I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve done your research ...it is good for all types of pain &amp; ailments. For me &amp; the kids ...emu oil is the #1 in first aid applied with a Q-tip for burns, cuts, bug bites, sore muscles, &amp; I also use it sparing on my hair. It can last a long time if used this way.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Do you know where the oil comes from?  From the emu animal.  They are killed for this oil.  I&#x27;m sure it works great but is it worth killing an animal for?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing. I let my friend try it on her sore leg and she sent for two bottles the next day!</li>
            <li> My son has extremely dry skin and we have tried many different kinds of mosturizers, lotions, creams and oils.&lt;br /&gt;The best results we were able to achieve was mosturizing with lotion right out of the bath followed by a layer of oil daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the emu we started out daily and now have his dry skin managed with one to two applications weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> It is absolutely wonderful on extremely  dry skin.  However is oily and can be dealt with just fine. This is my 5th bottle of Thunder Ridge Emu 0il.  Delivery was right on schedule and properly packed.</li>
            <li> When I received the bottle and opened it, it was rancid and stunk to high heaven! Threw it in the trash immediately!</li>
            <li> This is especially great on sunburned skin. It also heals cuts quickly, it truly is amazing. I would use it more regularly but it does have a mild chicken grease (Emu) smell to it. I have a friend who mixes in lavender oil with it so that she can use it everyday. I haven&#x27;t tried that yet, but it&#x27;s on my list to try. I have used it on my face overnight and noticed a difference immediately. It really does do what they say!!!</li>
            <li> My husband suffered 3rd degree burns on his arms.  Doctor recommenced this product for help in scar reduction.  It does help moisturize the area.</li>
            <li> Emu is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever found for my sensitive, hyper-allergic skin.  It absorbs very quickly--within minutes your skin feels soft and looks about a decade younger, with no oily residue.  Thunder Ridge puts out a good product.  I don&#x27;t know how many emus it takes to fill a bottle but it sure is worth the price of admission for my dry skin!</li>
            <li> The oil itself is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping wasn&#x27;t!!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle didn&#x27;t have anything to protect it from opening, so consequently at least 1/4 of it spilled in the box. This makes me wonder if I even got a new bottle or one someone else had returned.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy Emu oil again because I use it with some of my essential oils, but I doubt I&#x27;ll order from this vendor again if that&#x27;s the kind of shipping they do!</li>
            <li> Does not work on my face, hair, or scar.  It&#x27;s a fake.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> on my second bottle, love it</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.  Upon opening, the oil was fresh and odor-free.  I initially purchased it for scars and it&#x27;s been helpful for that in softening them.  Over the winter, I combined this brand of emu oil with Vitamin E and rosehip seed oil and used it as a facial oil.  It sank in quickly, didn&#x27;t leave an oily appearance and I received compliments on my skin.  It&#x27;s replaced my face lotion!  Some studies have shown it to aid internally in certain digestive problems- since we purchased this large of a bottle, we might give it a try for those as well.</li>
            <li> I heard about emu oil from a dermatologist on Dr.Oz a few months ago. Only recently purchased some and wow! There is nothing like it. I&#x27;ll never buy over the counter moisturizers again. My son has psoriasis and emu oil works so well on his skin I ordered another bottle.  Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> Great for skin -- dryness and scars.  I love that this brand (Thunder Ridge) is 100% pure.  I used this post-surgery many years ago to heal the skin at the incision, and the doctors were shocked by the speed at which it healed.  I have been using emu oil, and specifically this brand, ever since.</li>
