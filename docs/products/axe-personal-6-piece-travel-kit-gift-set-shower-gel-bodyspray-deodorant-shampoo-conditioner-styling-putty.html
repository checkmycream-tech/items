            <li>and I went out confidently to my convention.</li>
            <li>The travel bag isn&#x27;t top shelf</li>

            <li>Nice for Christmas for my teenage nephew and a good value.  </li>
            <li>this is an awesome little carrying case and some sample sized products.</li>
            <li>HUGE PROBLEM is the bag, however well-made,</li>
            <li>They enjoy the gift.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, yet not too sweet.</li>
            <li>small.&lt;br /&gt;Ultra fast shipping and easy transaction!</li>
            <li>was expecting full size items</li>
            <li>There is a good amount of extra room for items that are not included.</li>
            <li>full package of axe products in travel bag no damage to anything and bag quite sturdy for reuse</li>
            <li>not a bad price either</li>
            <li>He loves Axe and this gave him a little bit of everything, plus the travel bag is great</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money you pay.</li>
            <li>It is a bit smaller than I expected however it is the perfect size for a flyer.</li>
            <li>Just right for scent.</li>
            <li>The item got to me very fast.</li>
            <li>I ordered this more than 30 days prior to the time I was going to need it.</li>
            <li>pretty cool little deal for sure.</li>
            <li>Shipped fats, arrived fast, and is exactly what the product shows.</li>
            <li>The products are certainly travel size and literally one-time-use.</li>
            <li>Nice little gift or travel pack.</li>
            <li>I got this for my little brother and it was a nice.</li>
            <li>The price is to high for the size!</li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag that it comes in is also very well-made.  </li>
            <li>Will purchase more in the near future.</li>
            <li>THis product is just the right scent for a young man.</li>
            <li>It was a good way to sample AXE products for comparison to other similar products used.</li>
            <li>actually product is nice but it would be good to have option to choose the contained quantity, which is very small what expected,</li>
            <li>The item was smaller, I guess I was looking more for a larger kit.</li>
            <li>I could almost love this little kit.  </li>
            <li>short, I would give this 10 stars for quality, variety, ability to try different products, etc., etc., but the smell of this is just a huge problem.  </li>
            <li>really should be ashamed to charge people this much for next to nothing</li>
            <li>I have washed the bag about 5 times (with Axe shower gel which is usually not a mild-smelling soap), and it still reeks.  </li>
            <li>Just be aware that these are your standard &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; sample sized containers.</li>
            <li>On a recent trip, this kit was very helpful.</li>

            <li> IT IS SMALLER THAN EXPECTED</li>
            <li> It has \\&quot;screen\\&quot; sides so any wet contents from the shower will dry.  </li>
            <li> and I think $14.00 for such little containers is steep.</li>
            <li> It is really hard to get travel size personal hygiene items out here too, so I had to scrounge up enough supplies from the chaplains office and friends</li>
            <li> I guess i should have expected that.</li>
            <li> it was plenty enough to get the average person through a few weeks</li>
            <li> It was convenient that it came in a little pouch to travel with.</li>
            <li> I got this for my little brother as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I usually receive stuff from Amazon in about 2 weeks since I am stationed in Afghanistan.</li>
            <li> but I was not sure of d size...</li>
            <li> he said the bottles are really small and the bag smells</li>
            <li> I was a small travel kit</li>
            <li> This was a stocking stuffer for a very weird little cousin of mine who at the age of 9 actually likes to receive cologne.</li>
            <li> The bag stinks up the bathroom even after a week of washes, and I had to put it outside.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that he still stinks.</li>
            <li> However the only problem with this product is it has a annoying plastic smell emanating from the plastic pouch and all the contents of the bag will absorb this</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong buying this product.</li>
            <li> The only problem was that the case had a horrible odor.  </li>
            <li> just stinks.  </li>
            <li> I cannot overstate how bad it smells.  </li>
            <li> It is so bad, that the odor absorbs into the plastic of all the contents and they, in turn, reek.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My son was so disappointed in this</li>

            <li> I bought this for my husband as we are traveling out of state and he doesn&#x27;t pay attention to what is allowed by TSA regulations. I bought this kit so he could pack it and not worry about it. He loves it.</li>
            <li> On a recent trip, this kit was very helpful. I smelled great and I went out confidently to my convention.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my son who was just starting to need deodorant and pampering products. He liked that he could sample a bunch of stuff and then tell me what he likes. It was convenient that it came in a little pouch to travel with. Nice little gift or travel pack. I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> I give as gifts to the guys in my life. They enjoy the gift. Will purchase more in the near future.</li>
            <li> I saw these Travel Kits on Amazon. We were going on vacation and I know my son and grandson like this product so I ordered 2 for them.  It was a good deal, convenient, and packed with several nice items.</li>
            <li> Nice product grouping in a kit. It was a good way to sample AXE products for comparison to other similar products used.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  All the boys will love it!  Have boys that needed things for stocking stuffers and they love Axe product!</li>
            <li> Items in the travel bag were tiny!  Smaller than travel sizes at a drug store.  I was disappointed.  Items online look much bigger.  Gave it as a thank you gift to a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;These cannot be used unless you are only going away for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;Too small.&lt;br /&gt;Ultra fast shipping and easy transaction!</li>
            <li> If you like AXE this is for you</li>
            <li> I got this for my little brother and it was a nice. the picture makes it look like they arefull size products but no just sampler or travel I guess i should have expected that.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money you pay. These items make a difference in hitting the target gift for anyone. You can&#x27;t go wrong buying this product. It a nice product to buy, It was a very nice Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> This was a stocking stuffer for a very weird little cousin of mine who at the age of 9 actually likes to receive cologne. The travel bag isn&#x27;t top shelf but it works just fine!</li>
            <li> was expecting full size items</li>
            <li> i liked most of these products that came with this.  i gave the body wash to a friend because i had a allergic reaction to it.  all the rest of the objects i can use.  that is why i gave it a four star.  everything else is great.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these for a gift and for the price I liked it.  The only problem was that the case had a horrible odor.  I sprayed it with disinfectant and set it outside to air.  That did not work so I used some of the AXE to change the odor,  That did not last long so I gave up.  I still gave them as a gift.</li>
            <li> this is an awesome little carrying case and some sample sized products. pretty cool little deal for sure. not a bad price either</li>
            <li> This is a great travel pack for the man in your life that likes Axe. My husband liked and used most of the products.</li>
            <li> The item got to me very fast. There is a good amount of extra room for items that are not included. Like your toothbrush and razor.</li>
            <li> this is great for a travel kit i used it when i went away it was plenty enough to get the average person through a few weeks</li>
            <li> Nice for Christmas for my teenage nephew and a good value.  He likes Axe so I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> my grandson loves this product, and that it is a carry travel case for his hockey games. THis product is just the right scent for a young man. Not too strong, yet not too sweet. Just right for scent.</li>
            <li> bought for my son whos always on the go and loves to smell nice for the women. he loves axe and mom found it.</li>
            <li> Son is going on a 2 1/2 day camp trip.  This is exactly the thing he needs not to small nor too big.  He loves axe lol Glad I was able to find this for him.</li>
            <li> I ordered this more than 30 days prior to the time I was going to need it. I usually receive stuff from Amazon in about 2 weeks since I am stationed in Afghanistan. This product never showed up and I never got a response from the seller when I contacted them. I got ignored. Amazon just ended up giving me a refund, so I assume that means they never sent it. It is really hard to get travel size personal hygiene items out here too, so I had to scrounge up enough supplies from the chaplains office and friends so I could take a shower on the way home. Way to support the troops.</li>
            <li> The products are certainly travel size and literally one-time-use. Not what I personally was expecting and I think $14.00 for such little containers is steep. Love axe for my husband but will not buy this again for him.</li>
            <li> great lil kit has all the things a men counld need to get ready for a great night out .</li>
            <li> The Travel Kit lead to be a bigger kit but it isn&#x27;t! The price is to high for the size!</li>
            <li> it is a value for money package. It has all the lotions one would need during a travel. However the only problem with this product is it has a annoying plastic smell emanating from the plastic pouch and all the contents of the bag will absorb this and they all smell the same.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my brother but I was not sure of d size...he said the bottles are really small and the bag smells but it is still cute for a one time use on the road.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for a birthday gift, and he loved it.  This travel kit is perfect to take on the plane when flying with no problems.</li>
            <li> full package of axe products in travel bag no damage to anything and bag quite sturdy for reuse&lt;br /&gt;happy to use this set as a trial for axe stuff</li>
            <li> IT IS SMALLER THAN EXPECTED BUT IT IS CUTE AND FITS PERFECT FOR MY WEDDING GIFT TO GROOMSMEN! AWESOME, CNAT FIND THESE IN STORES FOR THAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> My uncle travels quit a bit and this made a wonderful christmas gift for him.  This will come in handy for his Vegas trip.</li>
            <li> I got this for my little brother as a Christmas gift. He loved it! He loves Axe and this gave him a little bit of everything, plus the travel bag is great he still uses it to put his things in when he goes places. Also the price was really good, great value! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I could almost love this little kit.  It has 6 travel-sized products.  These are great as trials -- got me hooked on Lure conditioner -- or they are great for travel, or they are great to take to the gym without having to lug a huge amount of stuff with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag that it comes in is also very well-made.  It has \\&quot;screen\\&quot; sides so any wet contents from the shower will dry.  The zipper has a nice meaty, rubbery Axe pull tag on it.  Really nice looking, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s where the good stuff ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HUGE PROBLEM is the bag, however well-made, just stinks.  It is vile.  It smells like rotting rubber shoe insoles.  I cannot overstate how bad it smells.  It is so bad, that the odor absorbs into the plastic of all the contents and they, in turn, reek.  I have washed the bag about 5 times (with Axe shower gel which is usually not a mild-smelling soap), and it still reeks.  The bag stinks up the bathroom even after a week of washes, and I had to put it outside.  I even washed all the bottles/travel components, and finally after a week, the smell is reduced (but still there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I would give this 10 stars for quality, variety, ability to try different products, etc., etc., but the smell of this is just a huge problem.  The travel bag smell just contaminates everything.  I don&#x27;t see how this slipped through the Axe marketing department... or maybe that&#x27;s why you see these kits on clearance/liquidation.</li>
            <li> for what i paid and for what got didnt add up. I was a small travel kit and i thought it was going to be bigger and it wasnt. It lasted me only four days and paid $44 for the kit with shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> I have bought kits like this at Walmart for 20 dollars and it had fullsize products, the products in this kit were smaller than travel sizes that they sell for a dollar at walmart travel section. My son was so disappointed in this and I was too,&lt;br /&gt;You really should be ashamed to charge people this much for next to nothing</li>
            <li> Shipped fats, arrived fast, and is exactly what the product shows. It is a bit smaller than I expected however it is the perfect size for a flyer.</li>
            <li> actually product is nice but it would be good to have option to choose the contained quantity, which is very small what expected,</li>
            <li> Nice price. Bought it for my son for our up coming beach trip. Has all of the bath supplies he will need plus he loves axe products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the product I bought them because I wanted to raffle them for a party and thought this would be a great gift for men.</li>
            <li> My husband travel a lot so I figured this would be a great gift !!!!! And he loves axe it smells so good on him</li>
            <li> Just be aware that these are your standard &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; sample sized containers. I bought this for my teenage son. My only complaint is that he still stinks.</li>
            <li> I was just alittle upset with the order. The item was smaller, I guess I was looking more for a larger kit. It will work, however, I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again...</li>
