            <li>For the money, really, it&#x27;s about the best deal you can get.  </li>
            <li>, I liked that the plates moves and that it also has temperature control.</li>

            <li>I Love, Love,</li>
            <li>so glad I came upon this one.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It heated up very quickly and I was able to use it within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>It has lovely packaging and the flat iron works very nice.</li>
            <li>Product came super fast, looks good, and works fantastic on my hair</li>
            <li>this straightener is NOT going to work for you, it will make your hair not curly and not as huge, but it will not straighten it all the way.  </li>
            <li>but, honestly it doesn&#x27;t really bother me at all.</li>
            <li>The iron flowed through my hair smoothly and with ease.</li>
            <li>It straightens my hair without pulling and glides smoothly over the hair.  </li>
            <li>Does not go through hair smoothly at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m real buy!!!</li>
            <li>This a great flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Super excited when I received this in the mail.  </li>
            <li>I have wavy medium thick hair and it straightened my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>It heated up quickly and tamed my curls with ease.</li>
            <li>I love it so far, and it&#x27;s definitely worth a try for the price!  </li>
            <li>overall , it looks really nice honestly , and professional.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair really shiny and smooth, no frizz.</li>
            <li>It is totally worth the $10</li>
            <li>It was worth every dollar.</li>
            <li>It gets super hot and works great  on my thick hair!</li>
            <li>It would be more convienent to be on the outside</li>
            <li>Simple and elegant packing.</li>
            <li>when using it , the iron was really hot , but when using it on my hair , it was like the heat escaped and didnt straighten my hair .</li>
            <li>so I decided to look on Amazon first before going to a well known beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>is the first time that I found something that goes the high</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and evenly, moves smoothly through my hair, my hair never catches like it has on other irons I have used.</li>
            <li>I really recommended.</li>
            <li>My hair is really curly and it worked on my hair.</li>
            <li>this&#x27;s just what a girl wants</li>
            <li>When I opened the box everything was very well packaged and put together.</li>
            <li>It has a temperature dial, so it gives you more control over how much or how little heat you need.  </li>
            <li>It was soft, silky, and perfectly straight when I was done.</li>
            <li>I definitely got my moneys worth and will buy again when the need comes.</li>
            <li>I was in need of a new straightener</li>
            <li>The box looks very professional.</li>
            <li>I love this iron and would recommend it to anyone who is in the market for a new iron but, doesn&#x27;t want to spend crazy money of huge name brands.</li>
            <li>This was a HUGE waste of money.  </li>
            <li>The price makes it an even better deal:) I was in desperate need for a new straightener because my previous 3 broke</li>
            <li>Because of its high temperature makes it easier to straight my hair in less than 30 min</li>
            <li>; so I hope it doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s going to break easily.  </li>
            <li>When I received this , I opened the bok and saw a professional looking hot pink flat iron.</li>

            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> It does feel a little &amp;#34;light weight,&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I saw this brand (I was not familiar with it)</li>
            <li> Some other irons I have used in the past, I had issues with it breaking or getting caught on a few hairs.</li>
            <li> But , it was verrry small.</li>
            <li> To small for longer hair for mine anyway.</li>
            <li> If you have even remotely thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair</li>

            <li> Product came super fast, looks good, and works fantastic on my hair</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is simply amazing!  My daughter has thick, long, curly hair and none of the other irons I&#x27;ve used on her has made her hair straighter and sofert.  If you are looking for a straightener than this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> Brought this a while it ok for the price</li>
            <li> Great straightner, just wish had more metal to grab more hair.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased! It came in about 6 days. It has lovely packaging and the flat iron works very nice. The metal plates are a little smaller then what I would have wanted but I&#x27;m ok with that. It gets super hot and works great  on my thick hair! It is totally worth the $10</li>
            <li> I love it it works just like my CHI. It was worth every dollar. The box looks very professional. I really recommended. My hair is really curly and it worked on my hair.</li>
            <li> Because of its high temperature makes it easier to straight my hair in less than 30 min I&#x27;m in love with this straightener is the first time that I found something that goes the high the one I had was 400F and this is 460F this&#x27;s just what a girl wants</li>
            <li> This is an excellent straightener for the price! Beautiful packaging, fast shipping, and works amazing! It heated up very quickly and I was able to use it within 5 minutes. I straightened my hair one day and then used it for curls the next. It works well for both styles. I did not have any issues with it burning my hair, smoking, or giving off any funky smells like some other straighteners can do. The buttons and heat settings are on the inside handle of the iron, which I personally, did not have a problem with. It would be more convienent to be on the outside but, honestly it doesn&#x27;t really bother me at all. I have wavy medium thick hair and it straightened my hair perfectly. It was soft, silky, and perfectly straight when I was done. The iron flowed through my hair smoothly and with ease. Some other irons I have used in the past, I had issues with it breaking or getting caught on a few hairs. This iron went through my hair perfectly. I am actually in need of a haircut and have a few split ends, but this didn&#x27;t even catch on the ends. It just worked perfectly. I love this iron and would recommend it to anyone who is in the market for a new iron but, doesn&#x27;t want to spend crazy money of huge name brands. It works well to straighten AND curl the hair. Excellent product!! Thanks!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a discount for an honest review.</li>
            <li> This a great flat iron.  For the money, really, it&#x27;s about the best deal you can get.

            <li> This was a HUGE waste of money.  If you have even remotely thick hair this straightener is NOT going to work for you, it will make your hair not curly and not as huge, but it will not straighten it all the way.  The other big downfall is that the plates are not smooth and will tug your hair, which is not major, but is still annoying, and the plates do not get as hot as they say, or else it would probably work a little better.

            <li> It Is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> I Love, Love, Love my new straightener, one of the best that I have used I recommend it.  Great price, $$$$$$ saver and works great.</li>
            <li> Super excited when I received this in the mail.  Absolutely love it!  Best hair straightener I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> When I received this , I opened the bok and saw a professional looking hot pink flat iron. But , I saw a scratch. Not cool. But , it was verrry small. overall , it looks really nice honestly , and professional. when using it , the iron was really hot , but when using it on my hair , it was like the heat escaped and didnt straighten my hair . dissapointed and I already returned it and got my refund</li>
            <li> Does not go through hair smoothly at all.  Still felt it pulling hairs. To small for longer hair for mine anyway.</li>
            <li> Works great! The price makes it an even better deal:) I was in desperate need for a new straightener because my previous 3 broke and I did not want to pay over $100 for another one, so glad I came upon this one.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new straightener so I decided to look on Amazon first before going to a well known beauty supply store. I saw this brand (I was not familiar with it) but  after reading the customer reviews and the really great price I decided to give it a shot. The item shipped quickly, was beautifully packaged and I fell in love with it. It heats up quickly and evenly, moves smoothly through my hair, my hair never catches like it has on other irons I have used. I have thick, wavy hair and I have not had a problem with it burning my hair. I am so nappy with this purchase! I am going to buy another just to keep it on hand.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Bebella hair straightener! When I opened the box everything was very well packaged and put together. I used it the next morning after my hair had turned into a complete frizzy/curly mess. I was totally done with my hair in less than 25 minutes. It heated up quickly and tamed my curls with ease.
