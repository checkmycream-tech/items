            <li>The price was fantastic!!</li>
            <li>Great price, colors are accurate.</li>
            <li>But one can get equally good products with better service elsewhere.</li>
            <li>the fabric is nice.</li>
            <li>It´s nice but thinner tan I´d expacted</li>
            <li>This beautiful scarf is exactly as described by vendor.  </li>
            <li>amazingly she will be very happy to open this gift this Christmas.</li>
            <li>Good qality, very pretty colors.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Beautiful scarf, with vivid color!</li>
            <li>I Love to wear scarves.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love the colors of the scarf</li>
            <li>quite pleased-</li>
            <li>Once again this scarf looks better in person.</li>
            <li>I used it as a cover up in the summer. :)</li>
            <li>I will order more.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SCARF.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love peacock.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Will probably order more.  </li>
            <li>I received sooner than expected, nice quality scarf and very attractive colors.  </li>
            <li>Can easily be worn for dress up or just out with a pair of jeans.  </li>
            <li>They email you from the moment they believe you should have received their product, which is fine and understandable, but they will email you relentlessly.</li>
            <li>This product is fine.</li>
            <li>stitching on the hemmed edges is fine; again, this is a 2 dollar scarf...</li>
            <li>The scarf is nice much thinner than I thought.</li>
            <li>I will think twice for purchasing anything that doesn&#x27;t say free returns.</li>
            <li>Pretty and soft, very nice scarf.  </li>
            <li>though it is kind of lightweight, it is soft, and I think it looks great paired up with another scarf of the same weight.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous soft chiffon,  by and large my favourite.</li>
            <li>I received it much earlier than anticipated which was perfect because the humidity is starting to rise here in South Carolina.  </li>
            <li>What a gorgeoous peach with yellow and blue that harmonize perfectly.  </li>
            <li>very pretty scarf.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty.  </li>
            <li>The orange color pops and is very pretty.</li>
            <li>exactly like pictured...perfect!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, it appears that returns are more hassle than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>bright colors, poor stitching, the threads stick out at the ends, nice scarf for the price tho</li>
            <li>you are familiar with and like the scarves from Chinese sellers on Amazon, you will love this scarf.</li>
            <li>The scarf is large and could be worn over shoulders, or when folded, works nicely around the neck as any smaller scarf would.</li>
            <li>But it seems quite important to me, as a former retailer, to note that customer service is just as important in a sales relationship as the product itself.</li>
            <li>It is soft and as light as air.</li>
            <li>I used it over my sun hat, and  it decorated it pretty well.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty for the price..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is bigger than most of the other scarves shipped from China, the material is a soft, silky, synthetic chiffon, and the colors are bright and vibrant, just as in the photos.&lt;br</li>
            <li>silky, vibrant colors; arrived quickly - love it - second one I ordered - so I could give one as a gift</li>
            <li>Color is very vibrant.  </li>
            <li>like it very much, looks like from those high end store.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s absolutely lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>It is a real bargain.  </li>
            <li>Very feminine.</li>
            <li>Very versatile piece.  </li>
            <li>Nice scarf, long enough, and</li>
            <li>A few frayed threads at the corners and smaller than expected, but great scarf!</li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant just as shown in picture and quality of fabric is silky-like.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>pictured &amp; arrival time less than expected- appears to be good product for money-</li>
            <li>The fabric is very soft</li>
            <li>Colors are vivid and well made.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attempted an earlier review, but for some reason Amazon thought it was inappropriate (though it said exactly what this one does).</li>
            <li>Not fabulous, but it&#x27;s inexpensive, so it&#x27;s fine for the price.</li>
            <li>goes with all my outfits,, silky and soft .</li>
            <li>Soft as silk.</li>

            <li> The scarf is nice much thinner than I thought.</li>
            <li> Scarf is great.  Colors are vivid and well made. I Love to wear scarves.  I use some for the winter and even some to the beach.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect gift for my mother she loves the color orange and this is going to complement her complexion and haircolor amazingly she will be very happy to open this gift this Christmas. The fabric is very soft this is a very delicate scarf and very well-made.</li>
            <li> beautiful! goes with cobalt or turquoise well</li>
            <li> Great colors. A few frayed threads at the corners and smaller than expected, but great scarf!</li>
            <li> very pretty scarf.  Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This company will harass you. They email you from the moment they believe you should have received their product, which is fine and understandable, but they will email you relentlessly. Five, six times a day. When I emailed them privately to cease and desist, they not only didn&#x27;t read my email, but increased their harassing email campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attempted an earlier review, but for some reason Amazon thought it was inappropriate (though it said exactly what this one does). Perhaps that was because I focused on customer service over the product. But it seems quite important to me, as a former retailer, to note that customer service is just as important in a sales relationship as the product itself. This product is fine. Not fabulous, but it&#x27;s inexpensive, so it&#x27;s fine for the price. But one can get equally good products with better service elsewhere. If a company is unwilling to respect you as a person, this should be sufficient reason to shop elsewhere. It&#x27;s your money, and your choice to whom you offer it should be met with respect. This company does not give you that respect. Spend your money elsewhere where they will.</li>
            <li> Nice scarf, long enough, and though it is kind of lightweight, it is soft, and I think it looks great paired up with another scarf of the same weight.</li>
            <li> This scarf is beautiful. I received it much earlier than anticipated which was perfect because the humidity is starting to rise here in South Carolina.  It is soft and as light as air. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scarf!! love it!! Got one to give as a gift as well!! perfect!</li>
            <li> This wonderful scarf arrived today, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;For less than 2 bucks, you won&#x27;t find a nicer scarf anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;The stitching on the hemmed edges is fine; again, this is a 2 dollar scarf... and it&#x27;s absolutely lovely.&lt;br /&gt;It is bigger than most of the other scarves shipped from China, the material is a soft, silky, synthetic chiffon, and the colors are bright and vibrant, just as in the photos.&lt;br /&gt;If you are familiar with and like the scarves from Chinese sellers on Amazon, you will love this scarf.</li>
            <li> very poorly made.the sewing looks like a five year old made it.I sure hope not!!! I made the mistake of buying two scarfs one for a friend and one for myself .I am too ashamed to give it to her.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t like it once I received it.&lt;br /&gt;So far, it appears that returns are more hassle than it&#x27;s worth.  I will think twice for purchasing anything that doesn&#x27;t say free returns.</li>
            <li> I love the colors of the scarf but they advertise it as being longer and it&#x27;s not, so that was disappointing.</li>
            <li> goes with all my outfits,, silky and soft . its a good buy...... all white outfit or an all black outfit....... or just mix it up</li>
            <li> Not as long as th e picture depicts,</li>
            <li> Cute! Great price, colors are accurate.</li>
            <li> I bought several- sent several as gifts --for the price- quite pleased- Have not washed yet- but will update as to bleeding-&lt;br /&gt;As pictured &amp; arrival time less than expected- appears to be good product for money-</li>
            <li> Fabulous colors, very nice quality....get compliments over and over!</li>
            <li> bright colors, poor stitching, the threads stick out at the ends, nice scarf for the price tho</li>
            <li> like it very much, looks like from those high end store. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful scarf.  I have ordered about 12 scarfs from Amazon.  This is the most beautiful.  What a gorgeoous peach with yellow and blue that harmonize perfectly.  Great combo of colours.  Gave it as a gift and the receiver wears it all the time.  Gorgeous soft chiffon,  by and large my favourite. Nicer in person then in photo!! Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> exactly like pictured...perfect!</li>
            <li> I prefer my scarves long and wide so I can have a variety of styling options. This was isn&#x27;t long but it&#x27;s an average length and the fabric is nice. The color is beautiful and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Once again this scarf looks better in person.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scarf, with vivid color! I used it as a cover up in the summer. :)</li>
            <li> Beautiful scarf. Contrary to one review I have not been contacted by fulfilling company. I will order more.</li>
            <li> The length was shorter.</li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant just as shown in picture and quality of fabric is silky-like. The scarf is large and could be worn over shoulders, or when folded, works nicely around the neck as any smaller scarf would. I&#x27;m looking forward to wearing it today. It arrived on schedule and transaction was flawless!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SCARF. THANKS YOU</li>
