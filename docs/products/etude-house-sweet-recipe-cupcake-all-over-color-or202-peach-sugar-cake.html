            <li>But otherwise I&#x27;m in love with this!</li>

            <li>Love the texture and smell!</li>
            <li>As a blush it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Gives you a nice flushed/young look.</li>
            <li>tin is really nice, and the raised cupcake-looking top is</li>
            <li>thing I will note is that while these are marketed as &amp;#34;all over color&amp;#34;, I don&#x27;t think they are suitable on the lips.</li>
            <li>I bought it thinking the color would have a nice pink/peach color, but because of my olive complexion it comes out more of a nude color.</li>
            <li>Oh and the peach scent is very light and nice. :)</li>
            <li>When applied to the cheeks it looks like a very light flush of color.</li>
            <li>Easy to blend into my cheeks, and turns out as a wonderful, natural looking peachy-pink.</li>
            <li>Very pretty!!</li>
            <li>The packaging is really cute too.</li>
            <li>the packaging is also really cute, in a pastry-like gift box.</li>
            <li>as yes this is cute</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a better color payoff on the cheeks and lips</li>
            <li>Cute container</li>
            <li>smells lovely.</li>
            <li>but once it is on your face you won&#x27;t be able to smell it anymore.</li>
            <li>This product fades a bit on my cheeks throughout the day unless I top it with a powder blush.</li>
            <li>But, as a blush, I love the colour.</li>
            <li>I love Etude House.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a great blush and very moisturizing as well.</li>
            <li>love it regardless. :)</li>
            <li>It came in such a cute package :D</li>
            <li>Love the color, love the smell, love that I can use this for lipstick, blush AND eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>The tin was significantly smaller than I thought it would be, but the product inside is very nice!</li>
            <li>Natural and beautiful.</li>
            <li>It is a bit dry and as such does not look very good on my lips, but it works wonderfully as a cheek tint.</li>
            <li>These have a light peach fragrance that isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li>Very nice natural looking color</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply to my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I love Etude House product and this one is a great one, it has multiple uses like for lips, eye shadows and blush.</li>
            <li>a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;The product smells like peaches and is a pretty color.</li>
            <li>Super cute, but not at all practical.</li>
            <li>The vendor sent me some other nice samples too!!</li>
            <li>I am an NC20 with light hair</li>
            <li>The shipping was faster then what the seller said, it also came with free samples which was a plus.</li>
            <li>Smell is a light peach scent.</li>
            <li>It gives a beautiful peachy pink flush on the cheeks</li>
            <li>Its allright, nothing special.</li>
            <li>This shade is great for pale skin and results in a beautiful slightly flushed effect.</li>
            <li>Packaging was tiny, but this product is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big Korean beauty fan and etude house is one of my favorite brands!</li>
            <li>I have pretty fair skin with naturally light pink and golden undertones.</li>
            <li>very cute package, lasts a long time and u have the container after u use the item up.</li>
            <li>flushes your cheeks in natural peachy color, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Sweet smell, beautiful colouring and subtle pigmentation on the skin.</li>
            <li>Gives just the right amount of color to my lips and cheeks...</li>
            <li>This has a very nice peach smell,cute packaging and shows up on my skin as a very pretty natural pink look.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s the prettiest cream blush I&#x27;ve ever used and when used as a cream eyeshadow at the same time is very pretty.</li>
            <li>I really love the cute little packaging of this product.</li>
            <li>I will not allow myself to run out of this one for certain!</li>
            <li>I feel it would be perfect as a base for a nice peachy/nude pressed eye shadow color.</li>
            <li>It is kind of dry and powdery on lips but still pretty.</li>
            <li>The overall color is very light.</li>
            <li>Its really pretty.</li>
            <li>I will wear it very often though!</li>
            <li>but if I were to go to most any drug store in Asian.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s buildable though, easy to apply, smells AMAZING, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle, which is great.</li>
            <li>So pretty, smells so nice, a little glossy/oily, nothin u wouldn&#x27;t expect</li>
            <li>I use it on my cheeks right now and it gives just the right amount of color (not too dark but easily blended so you can build it up), and I&#x27;ve tried it on my lips as well.</li>
            <li>Ok I love the color, smell, and package but as for the cost ja that is the only down side.&lt;br /&gt;Seeing</li>
            <li>And if you don&#x27;t like the consistency or color, the container is a nice little decoration you can add to your vanity.</li>
            <li>I would say this may not be very good for darker skin tones as it&#x27;s very sheer and probably won&#x27;t show up unless you put a really thick layer.</li>
            <li>However on my lips it looks very nudish/pale.</li>
            <li>I also have the OR201 Orange color, which is very pigmented...</li>
            <li>So if your gonna spend money on any product I highly suggest this one!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like it on my eyelids though because it collects at the crease of my eyelids.</li>
            <li>and omg you really have to exfoliate your lips really well before putting this on.</li>
            <li>Very creamy when applied but disperses well.</li>
            <li>some reason this doesn&#x27;t really show on my cheeks</li>
            <li>The colors work well on my fair, cool-toned skin but they are subtle and may not work on people with darker complexions than mine.</li>
            <li>They also feel gross when worn as a lip product (kind of powdery and dry).</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s not a bad product or concept.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a vibrant peach</li>
            <li>The package also came with a free sample of a BB cream, which I absolutely adored and am seriously considering buying the full version of.</li>
            <li>Note: I have sensitive, combination skin and this works very well for me.</li>
            <li>It tends to get stuck in the dry patches and makes it more obvious.</li>
            <li>As an eye shadow it&#x27;s very very sheer, though and only provides a light wash of color.</li>
            <li>The packaging is cute as expected from Korean brands, though it is way smaller than i thought..</li>
            <li>I love these little pots!</li>
            <li>It looks really natural and smells like peach cake!</li>
            <li>Cute but small.</li>
            <li>a little thing; It is worn of easily if you sweat or after 3-4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>It is very pigmented, which makes it a really cool matte lip color, but also reveals every dead skin even smallest ones on your lips.</li>
            <li>On the cheeks they blend out and look very natural but on my lips they look chalky, patchy, and like something you&#x27;d get in one of those cheap makeup kits for little girls.</li>
            <li>Very natural, light flush of color and would work beautifully on pale skin.</li>
            <li>it smells good and the color is subtle and lasts long.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering the whole colour range next week!!</li>
            <li>My skin is acne prone and sensitive</li>
            <li>Even if you put on some lip balm to smooth your chappy lips, it will not work, still showing that dried chappy lips of yours.</li>
            <li>Sweet little container.</li>
            <li>It is about the size of a small tin of lipgloss and also has the smooth, sheer consistency of a lip balm unlike the creamy promo picture.</li>
            <li>so I expected this to be a very pigmented as well.</li>
            <li>In the case of the peach shade I think it might not even be visible on people who have warmer complexions because it is sheer and so natural looking.</li>
            <li>This is a small little tin but to be honest the amount inside of it will last me a while!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It also smells faintly of sweet, sweet peaches -- which I adore since it isn&#x27;t an artificial scent at all.</li>
            <li>The color is not too much or too little.</li>
            <li>This shade is a little lighter than my lips which I was worried about, but is still very wearable.</li>

            <li> The package also came with a free sample of a BB cream, which I absolutely adored and am seriously considering buying the full version of.</li>
            <li> Note: I have sensitive, combination skin and this works very well for me.</li>
            <li> It tends to get stuck in the dry patches and makes it more obvious.</li>
            <li> As an eye shadow it&#x27;s very very sheer, though and only provides a light wash of color.</li>
            <li> The packaging is cute as expected from Korean brands, though it is way smaller than i thought..</li>
            <li> I love these little pots!</li>
            <li> It looks really natural and smells like peach cake!</li>
            <li> Cute but small.</li>
            <li> a little thing; It is worn of easily if you sweat or after 3-4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> It is very pigmented, which makes it a really cool matte lip color, but also reveals every dead skin even smallest ones on your lips.</li>
            <li> On the cheeks they blend out and look very natural but on my lips they look chalky, patchy, and like something you&#x27;d get in one of those cheap makeup kits for little girls.</li>
            <li> Very natural, light flush of color and would work beautifully on pale skin.</li>
            <li> it smells good and the color is subtle and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering the whole colour range next week!!</li>
            <li> My skin is acne prone and sensitive</li>
            <li> Even if you put on some lip balm to smooth your chappy lips, it will not work, still showing that dried chappy lips of yours.</li>
            <li> Sweet little container.</li>
            <li> It is about the size of a small tin of lipgloss and also has the smooth, sheer consistency of a lip balm unlike the creamy promo picture.</li>
            <li> so I expected this to be a very pigmented as well.</li>
            <li> In the case of the peach shade I think it might not even be visible on people who have warmer complexions because it is sheer and so natural looking.</li>
            <li> This is a small little tin but to be honest the amount inside of it will last me a while!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It also smells faintly of sweet, sweet peaches -- which I adore since it isn&#x27;t an artificial scent at all.</li>
            <li> The color is not too much or too little.</li>
            <li> This shade is a little lighter than my lips which I was worried about, but is still very wearable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping time was a bit long but that is always to be expected when buying a product from out of country.</li>
            <li> It definitely needs a primer to hold down creamy eye shadows if you want to use it alone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient to have when you are not high maintenance.</li>
            <li> ( I have a yellowish tan skin due to being mixed) which I was afraid it would be to light and not show up.</li>
            <li> The smell is very sweet and a bit artificial while in the tin, but on the face its smell is not very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the shipping came as expected.</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> As a lip color it was definitely not a pretty color on me.</li>
            <li> Will probably try out the other colors too.</li>
            <li> This product was much smaller than I anticipated, but that is hardly a downfall.</li>
            <li> It even has a little plastic container that looks like it comes from a bakery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can get this as I found out a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Diffidently would order this item again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to over-apply and has this really pretty powdery glow on cheeks.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s slightly drying on the lips, so moisturize!).  </li>
            <li> is flattering for someone pale like me.  </li>
            <li> It washes them out to a very odd colour.</li>
            <li> A little small , anyway , 3 stars for it</li>
            <li> Also, it came with a little gift of a small sample of whiteing cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the size of a small lip balm container, if that helps!</li>
            <li> and I have not experienced any breakouts or irritation in the weeks I&#x27;ve been using these as a blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so silly. ^_^&#x27;</li>
            <li> Sorry Etude house.</li>
            <li> I hate blushes but this is something I feel I could use every day!</li>

            <li> A little small , anyway , 3 stars for it</li>
            <li> This is great! It is kind of dry and powdery on lips but still pretty. As a blush it&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s impossible to over-apply and has this really pretty powdery glow on cheeks. It looks really natural and smells like peach cake! I am an NC20 with light hair but I think this would be almost universally flattering. The packaging is really cute too.</li>
            <li> the shipping came as expected. the item is actually smaller than it looks, almost the size of lipbalm tins. it smells good and the color is subtle and lasts long. the packaging is also really cute, in a pastry-like gift box.</li>
            <li> I thought the packaging was adorable! Its very cute. The overall color is very light. When applied to the cheeks it looks like a very light flush of color. Its really pretty. However on my lips it looks very nudish/pale. I will wear it very often though! Oh and the peach scent is very light and nice. :)</li>
            <li> Ok I love the color, smell, and package but as for the cost ja that is the only down side.&lt;br /&gt;Seeing as yes this is cute but if I were to go to most any drug store in Asian. I can get this as I found out a few days ago. -_-&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Yes very cute package, lasts a long time and u have the container after u use the item up. ^_~&lt;br /&gt;So that is y I only gave it 4 stars b/c I could have gotten 3 or so for what I payed for just 1 lol I&#x27;m so silly. ^_^&#x27;</li>
            <li> I also have the OR201 Orange color, which is very pigmented... so I expected this to be a very pigmented as well. It&#x27;s actually fairly sheer. It&#x27;s buildable though, easy to apply, smells AMAZING, and long lasting. As an eye shadow it&#x27;s very very sheer, though and only provides a light wash of color. Good for &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; makeup. It&#x27;s got a better color payoff on the cheeks and lips (it&#x27;s slightly drying on the lips, so moisturize!).  I would say this may not be very good for darker skin tones as it&#x27;s very sheer and probably won&#x27;t show up unless you put a really thick layer.</li>
            <li> I really love the cute little packaging of this product. It even has a little plastic container that looks like it comes from a bakery.&lt;br /&gt;The tin is really nice, and the raised cupcake-looking top is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;The product smells like peaches and is a pretty color. I didn&#x27;t notice that it showed up well on my skin though. It was alright, but not the easiest to blend.</li>
            <li> smells good (: makes me look peachy</li>
            <li> I am completely in love with this product! Gives just the right amount of color to my lips and cheeks... Natural and beautiful. I will not allow myself to run out of this one for certain! Note: I have sensitive, combination skin and this works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering the whole colour range next week!! I love this product, it&#x27;s the prettiest cream blush I&#x27;ve ever used and when used as a cream eyeshadow at the same time is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Cute but small. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Packaging was tiny, but this product is phenomenal! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more! Sweet smell, beautiful colouring and subtle pigmentation on the skin. Simply flawless!</li>
            <li> Its allright, nothing special. the color doesnt last though. Cute container i suppose. smells lovely. Won&#x27;t repurchase this product. Sorry Etude house.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big Korean beauty fan and etude house is one of my favorite brands! This product is amazing! It gives a beautiful peachy pink flush on the cheeks and I love it! It smells great and I can&#x27;t wait till the summer when I&#x27;m tanner than I am rite now because I think it will love even better!! So if your gonna spend money on any product I highly suggest this one!</li>
            <li> The shipping was faster then what the seller said, it also came with free samples which was a plus. Besides that the product it self was amazing! It was in perfect condition and came in a cute box. The makeup work perfectly with my skin tone( I have a yellowish tan skin due to being mixed) which I was afraid it would be to light and not show up. Not only did it stand out without being over baring but it lasted all day and part of the night with me only having to reply it to my lips after eating.</li>
            <li> It was a lot smaller than I initially thought it was going to be. It&#x27;s about the size of a small lip balm container, if that helps! I use it on my cheeks right now and it gives just the right amount of color (not too dark but easily blended so you can build it up), and I&#x27;ve tried it on my lips as well. But be warned, if you have perpetual chapped lips like me, make sure you exfoliate and moisturize before putting this on! It tends to get stuck in the dry patches and makes it more obvious. But otherwise I&#x27;m in love with this!</li>
            <li> I love these little pots! I have both the Peach and Blueberry versions and use them as blush. The colors work well on my fair, cool-toned skin but they are subtle and may not work on people with darker complexions than mine. In the case of the peach shade I think it might not even be visible on people who have warmer complexions because it is sheer and so natural looking. Wear time on these is surprisingly good; I can go all day without retouching (although Blueberry Cheesecake seems to wear longer than peach). These have a light peach fragrance that isn&#x27;t my favorite but once it is on your face you won&#x27;t be able to smell it anymore. My skin is acne prone and sensitive and I have not experienced any breakouts or irritation in the weeks I&#x27;ve been using these as a blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will note is that while these are marketed as &amp;#34;all over color&amp;#34;, I don&#x27;t think they are suitable on the lips. On the cheeks they blend out and look very natural but on my lips they look chalky, patchy, and like something you&#x27;d get in one of those cheap makeup kits for little girls. They also feel gross when worn as a lip product (kind of powdery and dry).</li>
            <li> This product fades a bit on my cheeks throughout the day unless I top it with a powder blush. Even though it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;All Over Colour&amp;#34; I do not recomment putting this on you lips. It washes them out to a very odd colour. But, as a blush, I love the colour. It&#x27;s a vibrant peach that&#x27;s perfect for the summertime.</li>
            <li> This smells really good and it&#x27;s easy to apply to my cheeks. It doesn&#x27;t feel gross and cakey at all. I don&#x27;t really like it on my eyelids though because it collects at the crease of my eyelids. I&#x27;m a bit tan so this doesn&#x27;t show up too well on my skin but just enough to give me a hint of rosiness.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! The color is excellent!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have the peach sugar cake, and oh my... the colour is so cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a little thing; It is worn of easily if you sweat or after 3-4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, I received it after 1,5 week!</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking the color would have a nice pink/peach color, but because of my olive complexion it comes out more of a nude color. It definitely needs a primer to hold down creamy eye shadows if you want to use it alone. I feel it would be perfect as a base for a nice peachy/nude pressed eye shadow color. The consistency seemed alright for the cheeks as a blush. As a lip color it was definitely not a pretty color on me. It looked nude/beige. Overall it&#x27;s not a bad product or concept. It&#x27;s convenient to have when you are not high maintenance. And if you don&#x27;t like the consistency or color, the container is a nice little decoration you can add to your vanity.</li>
            <li> I love Etude House. Etude house never forever!</li>
            <li> When you touch this it feels like a cream but turns into a powder when you apply. Very nice natural looking color</li>
            <li> The color is very cute for summer season! The packaging is cute as expected from Korean brands, though it is way smaller than i thought..&lt;br /&gt;It is a great blush and very moisturizing as well. I tried to use it as a lip balm and omg you really have to exfoliate your lips really well before putting this on. It is very pigmented, which makes it a really cool matte lip color, but also reveals every dead skin even smallest ones on your lips. Even if you put on some lip balm to smooth your chappy lips, it will not work, still showing that dried chappy lips of yours.</li>
            <li> The tin was significantly smaller than I thought it would be, but the product inside is very nice! It is a bit dry and as such does not look very good on my lips, but it works wonderfully as a cheek tint. Very natural, light flush of color and would work beautifully on pale skin. I hate blushes but this is something I feel I could use every day! The smell is very sweet and a bit artificial while in the tin, but on the face its smell is not very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping time was a bit long but that is always to be expected when buying a product from out of country. The package also came with a free sample of a BB cream, which I absolutely adored and am seriously considering buying the full version of. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Super cute, but not at all practical. Very creamy when applied but disperses well. NEVER as lipstick.</li>
            <li> This is a small little tin but to be honest the amount inside of it will last me a while!&lt;br /&gt;For some reason this doesn&#x27;t really show on my cheeks but it smells so lovely!&lt;br /&gt;I love it regardless. :)</li>
            <li> Gives you a nice flushed/young look. Smell is a light peach scent. It&#x27;s subtle, which is great. Will probably try out the other colors too.</li>
            <li> flushes your cheeks in natural peachy color, and I love it. The color is not too much or too little. Also I decided to use this as a lip tint, and it looked great on my lips</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color and it work the best as blush. I love Etude House product and this one is a great one, it has multiple uses like for lips, eye shadows and blush.</li>
            <li> Love it! It smells like peaches too! It came in such a cute package :D Also, it came with a little gift of a small sample of whiteing cream. Loved that as well! Diffidently would order this item again.</li>
            <li> Love the color, love the smell, love that I can use this for lipstick, blush AND eye shadow.  The color is very warm and pleasant.  I know I will be buying this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Very pretty!! I would definitely buy from this seller again!! (＾ｰ^)ノ</li>
            <li> So pretty, smells so nice, a little glossy/oily, nothin u wouldn&#x27;t expect</li>
            <li> This product was much smaller than I anticipated, but that is hardly a downfall. It is about the size of a small tin of lipgloss and also has the smooth, sheer consistency of a lip balm unlike the creamy promo picture. This shade is great for pale skin and results in a beautiful slightly flushed effect. It also smells faintly of sweet, sweet peaches -- which I adore since it isn&#x27;t an artificial scent at all. I will definitely try to order again before it becomes unavailable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even come on. it&#x27;s too sheer.</li>
            <li> This has a very nice peach smell,cute packaging and shows up on my skin as a very pretty natural pink look.I have pretty fair skin with naturally light pink and golden undertones.Im very happy with this purchase.:)</li>
            <li> Sweet little container. And a nice color too!</li>
            <li> Very nice all over color- a little bit goes a long way.  I like the creamy texture and the color is flattering for someone pale like me.  Helps simplify the morning routine.  I would definitely purchase again.  The vendor sent me some other nice samples too!!</li>
            <li> Love the texture and smell! Easy to blend into my cheeks, and turns out as a wonderful, natural looking peachy-pink. This shade is a little lighter than my lips which I was worried about, but is still very wearable.</li>
