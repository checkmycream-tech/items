            <li> , I went right out and bought their THS Essential Serum from my dermatologist ($250!).</li>
            <li> This product was reccommened to me by my dermatologist, I love it and notice a big difference in the wrinkles being less noticeable and my skin is smoother.</li>
            <li> I am 56 yrs old and I am trying the Brianna Stanko recommendations and so far I think I am seeing a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> product has really made a difference in my skin, as it is plumper and just plain younger looking.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to have used it all.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin texture feel soft, firm, and plump.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to find one that works, and this one is it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year now and can not live without it.  </li>
            <li> It did not contain the one out of the two main ingredients, In the past I purchased this product and it had a moisterizing cream on one side of the pump and the serum on the other side.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it is worth every drop.  </li>
            <li> Using this with the hopes of telling a difference in the next few months.  </li>
            <li> It may not be intended for under eye use, but when I use it in that location, it makes my eye area firmer and less puffy.  </li>
            <li> The prices on Amazon are $100 less then in my doctors office.</li>
            <li> Only the red side dispenses and I think the serum is too expensive to risk a faulty container again.</li>
            <li> It is a dual pump dispenser that delivers a mixture of this product (THS recovery complex) plus APS corrective Complex) in the other chamber, all to rejuvenate the skin.</li>
            <li> I am 40 y.o and beginning to develop small creases on my forehead and some lines at the creases of my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li> Used this product for no more than 45 days when one side quit pumping.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to determine improvement.</li>
            <li> This is a very poorly made product; the container broke after 3 weeks making it impossible to use the contents; inexcusable at a price of over $100!</li>
            <li> Way too expensive!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> My best product , my skin looks younger and less wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it every night following by skinmedica repair cream.</li>
            <li> Great product which I have used before.  I originally purchased this in the dermatologist&#x27;s office and paid much more for the identical product.</li>
            <li> So far I am satisfied.  Hopefully both serums will come out when pumped.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last year and won&#x27;t go without it.  I definitely see a difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li> Not enough product for the cost.  Difficult to determine improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year now and can not live without it.  It does and delivers everything it says.  My skin looks is so visible younger, firmer and radiant. One of my favorite skin products.  I am glad I made the investment and will continue to use the TNS Essential Serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approx. a month and have purchased another bottle already.  It has made my skin texture feel soft, firm, and plump. It may not be intended for under eye use, but when I use it in that location, it makes my eye area firmer and less puffy.  Essentially, I can wake up and look rested.  I am 40 y.o and beginning to develop small creases on my forehead and some lines at the creases of my mouth and eyes. I think it has helped those too. Hefty price tag but it delivers results.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Skinmedica has some of the best facial products I have seen around in many years. Before trying this I swore by Obagi ( which I still think is great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has really made a difference in my skin, as it is plumper and just plain younger looking. I was so impressed, I went right out and bought their THS Essential Serum from my dermatologist ($250!). It is a dual pump dispenser that delivers a mixture of this product (THS recovery complex) plus APS corrective Complex) in the other chamber, all to rejuvenate the skin. I will have to write back to let you know if it works. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, be sure you get a fresh product by checking the expiration dates, and also be careful not to buy a a knock off. The prices on Amazon are $100 less then in my doctors office. Just buy smart.</li>
            <li> love it!!!!!! Dr. Delilah charges $270.00 and amazon $170.00 Same product! great results</li>
            <li> this is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> The product was defective.  It did not contain the one out of the two main ingredients, In the past I purchased this product and it had a moisterizing cream on one side of the pump and the serum on the other side.  The bottle I received had no cream at all.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has EVER worked to truly reduce appearance/actuality of aging.  It&#x27;s expensive, but it is worth every drop.  If I stop using it, my face begins to sag in 3-4 days.  I have wasted SO MUCH MONEY on so many products.  Took a long time to find one that works, and this one is it.</li>
            <li> Use as part of my Skin care regiment.</li>
            <li> This product was reccommened to me by my dermatologist, I love it and notice a big difference in the wrinkles being less noticeable and my skin is smoother. I never am without this product.</li>
            <li> Great to help with overall glow</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my dentist&#x27;s wife &amp; a dermatologist.  I was hesitant as it is very costly. But vanity won out &amp; so gald it did. It works.  My skin looks smoother. You only use a wee bit. It contains powerful ingrediants . Especially good for us women of a certain age.  think I am hooked. Written up as a a good skin care product for women over 60 in Harper&#x27;s Bazaar!</li>
            <li> This is the best skin care product on the market, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> awesome product, good price, thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Thank you</li>
            <li> this is worh buying......excellent would purches this product againim 59 and sun lover as a teen .have had great results</li>
            <li> Skinmedica Tns Essential Serum is the best product for anti aging I would recommend it to my friends and family it really does the job.</li>
            <li> Great product and half the price I have been paying at dermatologist office.</li>
            <li> Love this product! This is one serum that definitely improves the look and feel of your skin. Your skin will be more supple and have a more youthful appearance after one month and even better after two months.</li>
            <li> This came on time and was sealed, very happy with my purchase and will order again. Everything I thought it would be!</li>
            <li> I like the actual product but only one side of the pump is working.  I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to have used it all. Only the red side dispenses and I think the serum is too expensive to risk a faulty container again. Bummer!</li>
            <li> Shipped from China .  Made me wonder if it was the same product. Concerned</li>
            <li> Using this with the hopes of telling a difference in the next few months.  I am 56 yrs old and I am trying the Brianna Stanko recommendations and so far I think I am seeing a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> Used this product for no more than 45 days when one side quit pumping.  Only the white liquid comes out.  Figured out the price for 45 days was over $3 per day.  Way too expensive!!  It may be great but not affordable.</li>
            <li> This is a very poorly made product; the container broke after 3 weeks making it impossible to use the contents; inexcusable at a price of over $100! Would not recommend this cream to anyone.</li>
