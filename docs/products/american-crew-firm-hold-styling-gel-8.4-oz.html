            <li>The best hair styling gel I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he said it is the best hairgel he has used.  </li>
            <li>This is the best gel that I have found or used.</li>
            <li>This gel doesn&#x27;t flake which is great!</li>
            <li>I also LOVE the smell of this gel!!!!</li>
            <li>Best gel I ever used.</li>
            <li>Best gel...</li>
            <li>Great product, very satisfied!!</li>
            <li>my hair looked great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Has a great scent and holds hair just how I want it.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly!</li>
            <li>Holds somewhat strong (not the best at strength).</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Before, my hair would look good</li>
            <li>Just use pomade if you are seeking good hold.</li>
            <li>Very good smell, strong hold,</li>
            <li>Glad I found it here and at a great price.</li>
            <li>I found this product to be superior than most of the products I use, except for Redken.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold as good as the Redken, but definitely better than L&#x27;Oreal or LA Looks.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and that this makes as an awesome alternative to Redken.</li>
            <li>My favorite gel; no residue when it dries and amazon price was amazing</li>
            <li>so, I decided to switch to it after using Ampro&#x27;s Clear Ice Protein Gel product - http://www.amazon.com/Ampro-Clear-Ice-Protein-Styling/dp/B003Y5VU2A for some time which by the way is a great product!</li>
            <li>I used the cheap AXE hair gels and my hair started falling out!</li>
            <li>Smells ok too.</li>
            <li>My favorite gel; no sticky residue, or flakes in my hair.</li>
            <li>This product has always thickened my thinning pate and manages to keep my hair looking halfway healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I found this gel to be best if you have very short to medium length hair.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair gel.</li>
            <li>Percentage-wise, I use this one more often, or sometimes I mix the 2.</li>
            <li>Overall, very good shampoo!</li>
            <li>love the gel, best around, this was a decent price, worth the purchase, i would def buy again when i need more</li>
            <li>Very nice smell to it and holds up the the whole day.</li>
            <li>completely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this produce because of its good hold, amazing smell, and no flakes.</li>
            <li>Good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but when a strong gust of wind blew it looked like wildman hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Liked this gel at Sports Clips and got it quickly and well packaged through Amazon from Super Wholesale.</li>
            <li>I try this product and it does exactly what it said &amp;#34;light hold.&amp;#34;  The fragrance is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, so a good hold is crucial to give it some body.</li>
            <li>Regular Crew product users because of good quality and pkeasant-not overwhelming-scents.</li>
            <li>If you buy the largest bottle you get the best price (at least on Amazon).</li>
            <li>The only plus to this product is that it smells good.</li>
            <li>If you want more of a natural look you can run your hands through your hair after the gel dries.</li>
            <li>smoth and fresh looks,</li>
            <li>Does not clump up is not too stiff, It&#x27;s a great Men&#x27;s hair product.</li>
            <li>just about right.</li>
            <li>There is a scent, but it is pleasant, not strong, and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>, I thought it would have a much better hold, but it actually doesn&#x27;t, so if you want something with a little more hold, i recommend american  crew fiber, its great</li>
            <li>First time buying in this container, worked just like the others.</li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t even that expensive and it works great!</li>
            <li>But when I opened up the 33 oz bottle I was pleasantly surprised because the bottle was filled up</li>
            <li>feels clean, not messy; holds well; lasts all day</li>
            <li>and I rarely use them, however, this firm hold gel by American Crew is just great.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair gel.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight drys fast too.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get much gel for your money though.</li>
            <li>I can apply on damp/kinda wet hair, but more gel than Redken.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this hair gel 4 times (I usually purchase it from target) and love it the most out of the 4-5 different mens hairgels ive</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the type to normally use a lot of hair styling products</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it super firm but its just the right amount of hold for my longish hair.</li>
            <li>I like the new non-clog tube.</li>
            <li>it barely blows around and when it does I can just pull it back up and it goes back into the place it was originally styled at the night before.</li>
            <li>: If you touch your hair too hard it gets messed up, at first the gel doesn&#x27;t stick, you have to wait till it dries for the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched over to &#x27;Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel&#x27; after using American Crew three times and can say it works much</li>
            <li>As much as I like this gel, I stopped using it recently (Jan 2015) because I discovered that the company is NOT CRUELTY-FREE</li>
            <li>I know that American Crew is a very well established brand</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male with thick coarse hair that without a good product will look like a ball of steel wool.</li>
            <li>It is expensive but the benefits are too good to ignore unless you don&#x27;t care about what you put on your hair</li>
            <li>Once your hair starts getting too long, that is when the gel will feel heavy, greasy, etc… just because you have to use more.</li>
            <li>you have short coarse thick hair, use &#x27;Sexy Hair</li>
            <li>However, the American Crew does not leave my hair as crunchy as the other; Crew a little more flexible.</li>
            <li>At first I tried applying this product to slightly wet hair and comb my hair back, as I have medium/long hair that I wear kinda pulled back but with my bangs still over my forehead.</li>
            <li>it if you can take a little flakiness and are willing to be patient till it dries.</li>
            <li>So at first I thought I had wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strong hold, but without the shiny, hard look you find with other hair gels.</li>
            <li>I only like to use a pea-sized amount in my hair and it works just fine, leaving the hair in place all day and not feeling sticky or greasy or anything, although the hair does become a little bit stiff just because it is a gel…</li>

            <li> The Ice is a lot calmer and left my hair soft yet firm as a gel is expected to do.</li>
            <li> It holds my very thin and smooth hair all day long.</li>
            <li> The hold on this gel is decent not amazing</li>
            <li> Wears well throughout the day and when my hair is in need of a cut it calms it down (neatens it enough) to extend my time between cuts.  </li>
            <li> I will keep buying American Crew down the road.</li>
            <li> You only need a very little amount of this gel, which goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I applied some of this gel on my wet hair</li>
            <li> Someone had stole it out of the package or shipped an empty package.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately this gel doesn&#x27;t spike my short coarse thick hair as well as other gels.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t feel heavy like other gel.</li>
            <li> Dollars less on Amazon than in the hair salon.</li>
            <li> less flaky(but</li>
            <li> Previous to ordering the 33 oz bottle, I ordered the smallest bottle which wasn&#x27;t completely filled up, that disappointed me (sort of a rip off).</li>
            <li> still a little flaky)&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Already recommended to a few friends.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores sometimes.  </li>
            <li> but, my hair become hard like wires when applying this.</li>
            <li> My hairline is a little thin in the corners but thick elsewhere, so this gave it some texture and thickness along there and allowed my hair to look suave throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I am actually pretty disappointed in this product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s look before just going in blind in the morning, but when it dried</li>
            <li> Hard to find in my geography, so Amazon it is !</li>
            <li> Hard Up Gel&#x27;!</li>
            <li> Till then it&#x27;s unfortunate and I&#x27;ve got to toss this 8.4oz tube in the bin before my wife starts complaining about the wires on my head ;(</li>
            <li> it cause I hate the feeling of glue in my hair.</li>
            <li> Worst gel ever, it&#x27;s basically water a tube</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First time buying in this container, worked just like the others. Regular Crew product users because of good quality and pkeasant-not overwhelming-scents.</li>
            <li> I used the cheap AXE hair gels and my hair started falling out! This stuff isn&#x27;t even that expensive and it works great!</li>
            <li> I really like this hair gel.  Tried lots of them and this one is the winner by a mile.  Wears well throughout the day and when my hair is in need of a cut it calms it down (neatens it enough) to extend my time between cuts.  Smells ok too.</li>
            <li> My hair is out of control. i didnt have time to cut it so I applied some of this gel on my wet hair and well it looked as if i did cut my hair. It lasted from 9 am til almost midnight. Course it was 24 degrees here.</li>
            <li> Holds somewhat strong (not the best at strength). But it does get the job done and doesn&#x27;t flake.&lt;br /&gt;Note: Will not hold  well if you are using this while working out or playing a sport.</li>
            <li> Liked this gel at Sports Clips and got it quickly and well packaged through Amazon from Super Wholesale. Would order again when we run out.</li>
            <li> My favorite gel; no sticky residue, or flakes in my hair. Strong hold, but without the shiny, hard look you find with other hair gels.</li>
            <li> The best hair styling gel I have ever used. It holds my very thin and smooth hair all day long. And I don&#x27;t feel heavy like other gel. You don&#x27;t even notice that you are wearing hair gel.</li>
            <li> If you need a gel or something that you want to hold well, don&#x27;t get this, I thought it would have a much better hold, but it actually doesn&#x27;t, so if you want something with a little more hold, i recommend american  crew fiber, its great</li>
            <li> I like the new non-clog tube. Dollars less on Amazon than in the hair salon. This product has always thickened my thinning pate and manages to keep my hair looking halfway healthy and shiny. Solid performance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the type to normally use a lot of hair styling products and I rarely use them, however, this firm hold gel by American Crew is just great. You only need a very little amount of this gel, which goes a long way. I found this gel to be best if you have very short to medium length hair. Once your hair starts getting too long, that is when the gel will feel heavy, greasy, etc… just because you have to use more. I only like to use a pea-sized amount in my hair and it works just fine, leaving the hair in place all day and not feeling sticky or greasy or anything, although the hair does become a little bit stiff just because it is a gel…</li>
            <li> feels clean, not messy; holds well; lasts all day</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband and he loves the stuff.</li>
            <li> Does what is supposed to do with no flakes.</li>
            <li> Arrive on time. Good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he said it is the best hairgel he has used.  Doesn&#x27;t flake and holds well!</li>
            <li> At first I tried applying this product to slightly wet hair and comb my hair back, as I have medium/long hair that I wear kinda pulled back but with my bangs still over my forehead. Well I combed it in and I looked like a straight up mobster, complete with the v hairline slicked back and greasy, thick hair. So at first I thought I had wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was at night as I wanted to test out it&#x27;s look before just going in blind in the morning, but when it dried and I woke up the next morning my hair looked great. My hairline is a little thin in the corners but thick elsewhere, so this gave it some texture and thickness along there and allowed my hair to look suave throughout the day. Before, my hair would look good but when a strong gust of wind blew it looked like wildman hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it barely blows around and when it does I can just pull it back up and it goes back into the place it was originally styled at the night before. I wouldn&#x27;t call it super firm but its just the right amount of hold for my longish hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best gel that I have found or used. If you want a spiked up look just apply the gel and style. If you want more of a natural look you can run your hands through your hair after the gel dries. This gel doesn&#x27;t flake which is great! I also LOVE the smell of this gel!!!! If you buy the largest bottle you get the best price (at least on Amazon). The hold on this gel is decent not amazing but it works. Previous to ordering the 33 oz bottle, I ordered the smallest bottle which wasn&#x27;t completely filled up, that disappointed me (sort of a rip off). But when I opened up the 33 oz bottle I was pleasantly surprised because the bottle was filled up completely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this produce because of its good hold, amazing smell, and no flakes.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair gel.</li>
            <li> I like this hair gel because it does not flake and my hair stays put all day.  I&#x27;m a male with thick coarse hair that without a good product will look like a ball of steel wool.</li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I like this gel. There is a scent, but it is pleasant, not strong, and dissipates quickly. I have another gel I also use because I like the way it shines, which this one does not. However, the American Crew does not leave my hair as crunchy as the other; Crew a little more flexible. Percentage-wise, I use this one more often, or sometimes I mix the 2. My hair is fine, so a good hold is crucial to give it some body. This does the trick. This is my 3rd bottle.   UPDATE: As much as I like this gel, I stopped using it recently (Jan 2015) because I discovered that the company is NOT CRUELTY-FREE</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Does not clump up is not too stiff, It&#x27;s a great Men&#x27;s hair product. Hard to find in my geography, so Amazon it is !</li>
            <li> Worst gel ever, it&#x27;s basically water a tube it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair at all even if I put a lot on. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Best gel I ever used. Lightweight drys fast too. Very nice smell to it and holds up the the whole day.</li>
            <li> This product has never dissapointed me. I&#x27;ve purchased this hair gel 4 times (I usually purchase it from target) and love it the most out of the 4-5 different mens hairgels ive tried.&lt;br /&gt;The hold, the shine, and the smell are all on point!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff.  Helps control my curly hair now that I have cut it shorter.</li>
            <li> My favorite gel; no residue when it dries and amazon price was amazing</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years.  Hard to find in the stores sometimes.  Glad I found it here and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great product, very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> I try this product and it does exactly what it said &amp;#34;light hold.&amp;#34;  The fragrance is pretty good.  I can run my fingers through it without pulling my hair.  I like it cause I hate the feeling of glue in my hair.</li>
            <li> Someone had stole it out of the package or shipped an empty package.  I just get an envelope with nothing in it.  But they shipped it USPS so what do you expect.  Never bothered to call and complain about it since I figured it was the post offices fault.  But I went ahead and found it at Fred Meijer and the product is alright.</li>
            <li> Best gel... It is expensive but the benefits are too good to ignore unless you don&#x27;t care about what you put on your hair</li>
            <li> love the gel, best around, this was a decent price, worth the purchase, i would def buy again when i need more</li>
            <li> smoth and fresh looks, just about right.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Pros: Very good smell, strong hold, less flaky(but still a little flaky)&lt;br /&gt;Cons: If you touch your hair too hard it gets messed up, at first the gel doesn&#x27;t stick, you have to wait till it dries for the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it if you can take a little flakiness and are willing to be patient till it dries. Overall, very good shampoo!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly! Already recommended to a few friends. Has a great scent and holds hair just how I want it. You don&#x27;t get much gel for your money though. I can literally see it running out as I use it.</li>
            <li> This gel smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this gel doesn&#x27;t spike my short coarse thick hair as well as other gels. I&#x27;ve switched over to &#x27;Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel&#x27; after using American Crew three times and can say it works much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have short coarse thick hair, use &#x27;Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel&#x27;!</li>
            <li> I found this product to be superior than most of the products I use, except for Redken. Doesn&#x27;t hold as good as the Redken, but definitely better than L&#x27;Oreal or LA Looks. I really like this product and that this makes as an awesome alternative to Redken. I have short hair and I like to spike it up a bit. I can apply on damp/kinda wet hair, but more gel than Redken. I will keep buying American Crew down the road.</li>
            <li> I am actually pretty disappointed in this product! I know that American Crew is a very well established brand so, I decided to switch to it after using Ampro&#x27;s Clear Ice Protein Gel product - http://www.amazon.com/Ampro-Clear-Ice-Protein-Styling/dp/B003Y5VU2A for some time which by the way is a great product! I figured I give the Crew a try but, my hair become hard like wires when applying this. The Ice is a lot calmer and left my hair soft yet firm as a gel is expected to do. If the Crew came out with something similar; I might use it! Till then it&#x27;s unfortunate and I&#x27;ve got to toss this 8.4oz tube in the bin before my wife starts complaining about the wires on my head ;(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. It goes in like water, and also holds like water. Doesn&#x27;t have nearly enough hold for curly hair. Just use pomade if you are seeking good hold. The only plus to this product is that it smells good.</li>
