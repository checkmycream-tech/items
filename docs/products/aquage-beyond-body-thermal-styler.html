            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Product came in good working order and we were pleased with the timeliness of the shipment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that they sell this on Amazon.</li>

            <li>I do not like to use products of this type without some kind of safety seal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thankfully, when I needed more (two years later...you don&#x27;t need much to get a job done, so it lasts FOREVER), Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Additional body is what I need with fine hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a strong odor.</li>
            <li>and this helps smooth everything out and keep away the poofy look!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>Amazon provided me a better price on a product I love.  </li>
            <li>Love this brand of hair products.</li>

            <li>Great product, really changed my life when I found this one.</li>

            <li>and I live in Houston where it is warm and humid</li>
            <li>I have used this product previously and have always been impressed with how it makes my hair seem so straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>I know this shouldn&#x27;t be true</li>
            <li>I first tried this product when I got it free from my hair salon</li>
            <li>A good basic thermal spray that has a smaller amount of dimethicone than most, which this will build up on the hair and make it lifeless eventually.</li>
            <li>Great product to smooth and protect hair with daily use of flat iron.</li>
            <li>Make sure to spray it lightly throughout your hair and immediately blow dry.</li>
            <li>You have to load on your hairspray to keep a tightness to the hot fresh curl.</li>
            <li>I have always been happy with Amazon shipments, however this product arrived in a box and it had no top on the container of spray.</li>
            <li>This thermal spray holds curls or keeps my hair straight no matter how humid it gets!  </li>
            <li>This gives me exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t hold at all regular hair spray works better.</li>
            <li>, this product used with hot rollers keeps my hair curly all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other brands over the years and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I dont know that it costs a little more, it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Also can control it by how much you spray.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a product to use when curling my straight hair to help when styling.</li>
            <li>Great for my thin hair.</li>
            <li>On the first day...it sometimes makes it a tad bit to soft when you go to tease out the curl.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i have thin fine hair and need a light weight but string styling product.</li>
            <li>I use this spray daily because it makes my hair look so much thicker than it really is.</li>
            <li>It smells too much like a standard hair spray.</li>

            <li>I have looked high and low for it at my local salons</li>
            <li>am considering sending the bottle directly to Aquage Distribution with the seller information to find out why it&#x27;s different.  </li>
            <li>but then I had to buy it as just a few sprits seemed to protect my hair from the hot iron.</li>
            <li>It really wasn&#x27;t any less expensive, just more convenient .</li>
            <li>I live in Georgia where it is extremely humid and this product is what I use to keep the frizziness from getting unbearable.&lt;br</li>

            <li> And it does have a strong chemical smell that is hard to get over!!</li>
            <li> I use it with the flat iron on shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I prefer \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; because it leaves my hair silky and soft and not so stiff.</li>
            <li> I blow dry and straighten my hair almost every single day</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it on wet or damp hair.</li>
            <li> thankful for hats and cold weather right now!</li>
            <li> I was going to get their other product...</li>
            <li> Now I wish I  tried the other product Workig Spray.</li>
            <li> I have blonde, long, thin hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and coarse as well</li>
            <li> doesn&#x60;t keep it down 100%</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and provides lightweight holding.  </li>
            <li> working firm spray...</li>
            <li> and this product made my hair feel like it was stiff and glued after I used it.</li>
            <li> Beyond Body provides control and volume--not stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li> I have long, frizzy, thin hair</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m looking for other reasons to blame the poor product on.</li>
            <li> (feels dirty to the touch after you use product) and look even more disgusting.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> Beware that this is advertised falsely!</li>
            <li> and I am desperate for body.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This product is great for thermal spray and also as a finishing spray.  I have very happy and always get my products on delivery time.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that will actually hold a curl for hours!  You simply spray it on the strand of hair before curling it...and it locks in the curl!</li>
            <li> I found this product a couple of years ago in a salon, and it was perfect!  It was the first (and so far only) product line that would work on dry hair that I was trying to flat-iron.  And it doesnt&#x27; make your hair greasy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, when I needed more (two years later...you don&#x27;t need much to get a job done, so it lasts FOREVER), Amazon had the best price.</li>

            <li> I read a lot of reviews about this product.. I have blonde and wavy hair. It&#x27;s thick and coarse as well and this product made my hair feel like it was stiff and glued after I used it. I know this shouldn&#x27;t be true so I&#x27;m looking for other reasons to blame the poor product on. The bottle was sticky when I received it. I prefer \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; because it leaves my hair silky and soft and not so stiff.</li>
            <li> Product came in good working order and we were pleased with the timeliness of the shipment. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have blonde, long, thin hair and I am desperate for body. I use this spray daily because it makes my hair look so much thicker than it really is. I have looked high and low for it at my local salons and I have no idea why they don&#x27;t carry it. I&#x27;m thrilled that they sell this on Amazon. Make sure to spray it lightly throughout your hair and immediately blow dry. Don&#x27;t use it on wet or damp hair. Body lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I live in Georgia where it is extremely humid and this product is what I use to keep the frizziness from getting unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x60;t keep it down 100% but without it I would have a brillo pad on my head. I use this all the time. Can&#x60;t do without it !</li>
            <li> If you want hair to stay. This is it</li>
            <li> Great product to smooth and protect hair with daily use of flat iron. It makes my hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my curly hair when I diffuse with the hair dryer and it provides hold and body.  It smells too much like a standard hair spray.</li>
            <li> A good basic thermal spray that has a smaller amount of dimethicone than most, which this will build up on the hair and make it lifeless eventually.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! I blow dry and straighten my hair almost every single day and this is the only protective spray ive ever found that does it&#x27;s job and isn&#x27;t greasy!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it is not so &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;.  Also can control it by how much you spray.  Also not so sticky.  Works nicely as a setting lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it&#x27;s too bad you can&#x27;t go into a store and purchase it, so I purchase it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this product, so I figured it must be good quality. It is a heat protectant, but gives some body to it as well. I use it with the flat iron on shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> i have thin fine hair and need a light weight but string styling product. This gives me exactly what I need. I have been using it for years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very good product, helps hold hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I have used this product previously and have always been impressed with how it makes my hair seem so straight and smooth. It gets rid of all the fly aways and frizzies that I get at the ends of my hair. I dont know that it costs a little more, it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling like hay. May be \\&quot;protecting\\&quot; it from the heat, but in the process, it&#x27;s making it feel gross (feels dirty to the touch after you use product) and look even more disgusting. Just fries your hair and makes it look like hay.  I&#x27;ve used it for a week trying to get it \\&quot;right\\&quot;...thankful for hats and cold weather right now!</li>
            <li> This product is listed as a &amp;#34;thermal styler&amp;#34;; however, what I received is a &amp;#34;sealing spray&amp;#34;.  Beware that this is advertised falsely!</li>
            <li> I have purchased Beyond Body Thermal Spray at my professional salon.  Amazon provided me a better price on a product I love.  Beyond Body provides control and volume--not stiff or sticky.  Additional body is what I need with fine hair!</li>
            <li> Love this brand of hair products.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to use when curling my straight hair to help when styling. I was going to get their other product...working firm spray...but I thought this Thermal would help more to protect more with the thermal protection.I use a curling iron daily even on a second day of sprayed hair. I have to say that is when it helps best.....on a day 2 of a redo. It helps take a curl faster and helps protect on drying out my hair. On the first day...it sometimes makes it a tad bit to soft when you go to tease out the curl. You have to load on your hairspray to keep a tightness to the hot fresh curl. And it does have a strong chemical smell that is hard to get over!! I hope no one will smell it. It&#x27;s kind of a strong odor. Not too sure of my love of this product. Now I wish I  tried the other product Workig Spray.</li>
            <li> I love this product, which is not available at beauty supply stores, only in salons.  So I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon.  I have always been happy with Amazon shipments, however this product arrived in a box and it had no top on the container of spray. The cap had not come off in the box; there simply was no cap at all....not that I could find. I do not like to use products of this type without some kind of safety seal.  I did, this time, but will buy in my salon in the future.  It really wasn&#x27;t any less expensive, just more convenient .</li>
            <li> I first tried this product when I got it free from my hair salon but then I had to buy it as just a few sprits seemed to protect my hair from the hot iron. Great for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this it doesn&#x27;t hold at all regular hair spray works better.</li>
            <li> this is the best thermal spray on the market and I have tried a lot of them. You can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> The product is NOT the same as you can purchase in a salon.  I had a teaspoon of this bottle tested with one ordered from a Salon and they were both different in color and did not work like the one from the salon.  Additionally the &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t work properly.&lt;br /&gt;I am considering sending the bottle directly to Aquage Distribution with the seller information to find out why it&#x27;s different.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hairstylist.  It is awesome.  Your service was excellent.</li>
            <li> This thermal spray keeps the curl and doesn&#x27;t cause burning of the hair.  Works especially well when you have not body to your hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best heat protectant I&#x27;ve ever bought! It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and provides lightweight holding.  It also protects my color-treated hair!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  I use this product with a curling iron to add shape and body.  It holds the shape without adding weight and brushes out leaving no build up</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair and I live in Houston where it is warm and humid, this product used with hot rollers keeps my hair curly all day. Great product, really changed my life when I found this one.</li>
