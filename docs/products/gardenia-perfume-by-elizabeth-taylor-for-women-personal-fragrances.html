            <li>I had used up my gardenia cologne and couldn&#x27;t find any more, but it turns out that Liz had it!</li>
            <li>and I both love this perfume!</li>
            <li>This perfume is a beautiful, fresh scent that makes you feel surrounded by a flower garden in bloom!</li>
            <li>I used to pluck a flower or 2 to scent the house indoors, it was amazing.</li>
            <li>I chose 5 stars for this perfume because it is gentle and delicious....</li>
            <li>It does not take much to smell great all day!</li>
            <li>I own like a zillion perfumes but</li>
            <li>the nozzle on the spray head clogged up after a couple of months...other than that the price is good for this fragrance...not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Nice but doesn&#x27;t smell like gardenia.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>and I think it has a nice floral scent.</li>
            <li>A nice fragrance to wear during the summer.  </li>
            <li>the item was sealed in box and was so nice....</li>
            <li>I honestly like animalic scents.</li>
            <li>I have worn this fragrance for years and am pleased to find it at a fair price.</li>
            <li>Some of my friends liked the scent on me</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Nice scent but</li>
            <li>nice bottle.</li>
            <li>Got a nice perfume for my gf.</li>
            <li>Nice, inexpensive perfume.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, this particular shopping experience was marvelous.</li>
            <li>was for my mom she really liked it, was super happy about the price tag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great price for a good-smelling perfume that is not cloying and does not smell cheap :-)</li>
            <li>We were happy with the price, how quickly it came, and the condition of the product.    </li>
            <li>Great price arrived quickly...</li>
            <li>This perfume is very strong and pungent if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.  </li>
            <li>Amazon also has the best price on this perfume by far!</li>
            <li>It smell great when you first spray some on, and then it is gone, gone, gone!</li>
            <li>It also comes in a uniquely shaped bottle which is visually pleasant.</li>
            <li>Its exactly how you think it smells, its just a beautiful aroma I would buy this again and form this seller.</li>
            <li>It is very light and not too over powering.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light.</li>
            <li>This Gardenia perfume does not smell very genuine.</li>
            <li>Very light</li>
            <li>/&gt;However this one does have a nice, warm and sweet kind of floral scent which is not too strong and won&#x27;t give you a headache.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this perfume.</li>
            <li>but, they cost a lot more so</li>

            <li>I love the scent of gardenias; no fragrance is more intoxicating and sensuous than that of gardenia.</li>
            <li>I love florals and Elizabeth Taylor.</li>
            <li>Has a lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite by Elizabeth Taylor</li>
            <li>This is a lovely perfume.  </li>
            <li>I get as many compliments wearing this as when I wear Jessica McClintock, and the price difference is not insubstantial.</li>
            <li>Perfume I wore many years ago.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY LOVE THE SCENT</li>
            <li>absolutely love this scent.  </li>
            <li>Gardenia is one of my favorite flowers.  </li>
            <li>so ..... now it&#x27;s my closet spray, pretty nice!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>Wish it were more long-lasting.</li>
            <li>my husbands favorite flower is the gardenia</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance because it&#x27;s not over powering and others asks what I am wearing.</li>
            <li>Love the this perfume.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this sent OMG</li>
            <li>THANKS!!!!</li>
            <li>While this does not smell exactly like gardenias, it comes darned close and is a great light summer scent.</li>
            <li>Good things first you will love this.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume as it is a very clean smell and doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies.  </li>
            <li>very girly very flowery love love love it !!!</li>
            <li>It lasts long and smells wonderful</li>
            <li>It sure is strong....</li>
            <li>Perfume form kind of gives me a mild headache but scented body powder doesn&#x27;t, takes the edge off I guess.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing too, and it smells exactly like Gardenia!</li>
            <li>I did not get to smell it myself, but my sister reports that it smells very true to scent and that my mother loves it.</li>
            <li>I have a huge Gardenia plant and love the flowers</li>
            <li>It is not expensive and very satisfying.</li>
            <li>It provides a lovely, light fragrance and smells just like a freshly-picked gardenia from a garden.</li>
            <li>I have never tried this product before, but as a first time customer, I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>My mother has passed away not too long ago but this wonderfully blended scent takes me back to a beautiful time with her in my life.</li>
            <li>AND HOW MUCH SHE LOVED IT.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful, not too overpowering, but enough to smell like a mild gardenia garden.</li>
            <li>keep carrying this  sweet  cologne .!</li>
            <li>so light and fresh!!</li>
            <li>It will last a while, and it is most definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li>Daughter found it too strong, but I like it.  </li>
            <li>If you like a strong perfume, you will like this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d describe this fragrance as evocative of Fracas with a strong hint of Jungle Gardenia.  </li>
            <li>It is not too sweet as many perfumes can be.  </li>
            <li>Now this new version is an excellent substitution for the old one.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; perfume with higher notes of gardenia, but this is a very strong perfume.  </li>
            <li>Timeless, classic and well worth trying to all my scent loving girlfriends out there!</li>
            <li>It says Free Shipping</li>
            <li>it should not have said free shipping.</li>
            <li>It was a gift for a friend, and when it was sprayed, the fragrance filled the room.</li>
            <li>however fragrance net are great and i will continue to buy from them</li>
            <li>It is light and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>nice smell but goes away fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>It is a light scent and evreytime</li>
            <li>I did a search and told her it is available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d enjoy this.</li>
            <li>Nice, but not the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>so if that&#x27;s what you are looking for this should fit the bill.</li>
            <li>A nice, light fragrance; not overpowering unless you put on too much.  </li>
            <li>The bottle and cap is beautiful in its own right, simple and pretty.  </li>
            <li>Very fresh.</li>
            <li>This is a very fresh and all ages parfum</li>
            <li>I enjoy the france and get many compliments in morning or when I first walk out the door for weekend outings.</li>
            <li>Purchased this product with no prior experience, but now am pleasantly surprised by the great scent and nice comments from family and friends.  </li>
            <li>I found the fragrance to be a bit metallic at first, then the fragrance became softer and more mellow.  </li>
            <li>Nothing Liz&#x27;s other beautiful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>when he comments one I know it must be truly special.</li>
            <li>Fast and accurate delivery!</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, it is close to the real essence of gardenias...</li>
            <li>It is light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>This only smells good for about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>As a young child I always liked the fragrance of Gardenia.  </li>
            <li>but overall its good for wearing around the house to give a shot of fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Not too &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; but still light and fresh.</li>
            <li>This is the only fragrance I have ever loved 100%</li>
            <li>does not have the true smell of Gardenia</li>
            <li>Bought this for my mom for mothers day last year, and she absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>Nice gardenia scent, but nowhere near Tuvache&#x27;s Jungle Gardenia (sigh).  </li>
            <li>but if you like the scent of gardenia&#x27;s this is the one for you, not too flowery or sweet</li>
            <li>I LOVE gardenia, and this is really the product for me.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife about a year ago at a local store and she really loved it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to apply very much for a strong scent.</li>
            <li>The scent starts just a little strong (not scary strong, no worries that you will blow someone away with your parfum scent, lol)</li>
            <li>It may seem strong when you first spray it on but after a min</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased with this unique scent.</li>
            <li>The light scent and adorable aura created by this perfume bring me good mood everyday!</li>
            <li>other then that i am happy with purchase</li>
            <li>And, it quickly softens so</li>
            <li>I received quickly and as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I received quick delivery service,  also.  </li>
            <li>Note the flower leaves mild but permanent perfume.</li>
            <li>It arrived in good time and was an instant success.</li>
            <li>Elizabeth Taylor has a life-long customer in my mom, thanks to this beautiful perfume at such a reasonable price here on Amazon!</li>
            <li>and I waved it out for a minute on my shirt, and almost immediately, the gardenia overtook the other perfume and kept me smelling amazing all day!</li>
            <li>I am almost in my mid 30&#x27;s, and I love this perfume!  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>Very powerful in that you don&#x27;t have to use much but not overly strong or too much.</li>
            <li>i thought it smelled of a fresh gardenia .</li>
            <li>...I get more compliments from men on this and another jasmine-scented perfume by LUSH than I do any others that I wear.</li>
            <li>#34;what perfume are you using?&amp;#34;  So far it remains as my favorite.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t worth returning it.</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful scent and even the last lingering notes are very pretty.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume, get more compliments then any other I have ever used, so I stick with this one.</li>
            <li>If you are buying it because you love the gardenia smell, there are other perfumes resemble gardenia more than this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was not worried about it as Amazon would make it right.</li>
            <li>the price was right</li>
            <li>This seems to be the right bottle and box</li>
            <li>Such a lovely shade of green that will look amazing on your dresser top or wherever you store your parfums.</li>
            <li>This product not only smells nice, like actual gardenias, but for those that have an issue with fragrances that last, this is a great solution.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really believe this is the true product.  </li>
            <li>I loved this perfume, just a simple gardenia smell, doesn&#x27;t have some of the undertones of musk or other scents that most perfumes do.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice fragrance, but it doesn&#x27;t last much.</li>
            <li>It does smell very much like gardenia</li>
            <li>Thanks much!!</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like it very much, maybe it just wasn&#x27;t mixing with my chemistry that day...</li>
            <li>No other scent to me is more sensuous and heady than the scent of real gardenias and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty heavy and very sweet smell, and I was wanting something lighter and more airy...</li>
            <li>More than 25 years ago I had gardenias growing outside our bedroom window in east Texas.</li>
            <li>You will likely Love as much as I do!</li>
            <li>so pretty  on my counter .  </li>
            <li>Additionally the bottle is a simple, elegant addition to your vanity.</li>
            <li>She is also a fan of Elizabeth Taylor and told me several times the bottle is just beatiful and has a lovely flower on the lid.</li>
            <li>Well the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li>Smells so pretty and feminine... and sexy at the same time!</li>
            <li>Thanks, Miss Taylor!</li>
            <li>Gardenia bouquet its what this fragrance smells like, the first notes does remind one of bug spray, but I gues after it misses with your body chemistry it adjust.</li>
            <li>Great for late spring &amp; summer.</li>
            <li>the flower lid is so pretty.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this without smelling it first, but I bought this for my mom, who LOVES anything gardenia, and she wears this perfume every day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth to note that this perfume does not smell too much like gardenia.</li>
            <li>first time i tried this perfume.</li>
            <li>Pretty bottle-</li>
            <li>Not overpowering, smells like the flower, and the bottle is so pretty.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this perfume.</li>
            <li>This is my first time for trying this fragrance</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying, Elizabeth Taylor&#x60;s, Gardenia.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I first purchased Gardenia several years ago, and it is one of my favorite fragrances.  </li>
            <li>If it does not smell exactly like gardenias, it comes closer than any other I&#x27;ve tried, and is fresh and light making it a fabulous summer scent.</li>
            <li>but I actually like it better since perfume that lasts a whole day</li>
            <li>Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s version is a worthy addition to the limited choices available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very classic, old-fashioned scent (almost like something my grandmother would wear), which works for me, because I don&#x27;t want to smell like a &amp;#34;baby prostitute&amp;#34; or Britney Spears.</li>
            <li>Colognes with a light scent, especially those made with white flowers are easy to wear and always bring compliments.  </li>
            <li>Always have loved this scent and it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sweet and isn&#x27;t exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>Thanks to you all at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>The transaction was very smoothe.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This gift made her very</li>
            <li>I like it but not as much as Jungle Gardenia.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t take much and you can smell it for hours</li>
            <li>This fragrance is all I expected and more.  </li>
            <li>oh so much fresher</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>but I really do like it and would recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li>The description was detailed enough that I took a chance.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>Looks like shipper tightened the cork way too much before shipping the product.</li>
            <li>and I had thought I&#x27;d put too much on, but after a minute</li>
            <li>Frankly - is does smell like as if you are in middle of a flower garden , its strong &amp; not subtle</li>
            <li>(LUSH gets it right, though with their Lust scent!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is another one of those long-time favorite scents of mine, although I do prefer floral scents over other types.</li>
            <li>While this is not exact to my favorite JG, it is closer than anything I have found.</li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t seem to be other top note with this perfume).  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, which is great.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this scent to anyone who loves gardenia as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume so much that I have nearly a dozen bottles (8 are empty).  </li>
            <li>When I want to turn up the volume, I spray it over some gardenia oil I bought at the Rennaissance Festival (formerly Planetary Perfumes but can&#x27;t remember the current name of company - out of Ohio) and men seem to love it.</li>
            <li>A classic</li>
            <li>The very pretty flower cap was stuck and I couldn&#x27;t open the bottle.</li>
            <li>It can be strong when first applied, but it decreases its potency over a few minutes</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as long-lasting as some high end perfumes.</li>
            <li>that doesn&#x27;t last-&lt;br /&gt;Had high hopes, but wouldn&#x27;t purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding it in any store, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It smells fresh, but at the same time it has somewhat of a seductive scent to it as well.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, and its the one my fiance prefers it out of the few I do wear.</li>
            <li>always like to explore new fragrances.</li>
            <li>Appears new.  </li>
            <li>This perfume is nothing like the real Gardenias by Liz Taylor; the only thing that resembles the real perfume is the bottle and the package.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves the soft scent of gardenia.</li>
            <li>The smell remains very much the same from the time you spray it on and after 45 minutes or whatever</li>
            <li>I bought two bottles of this lovely fragrance recently, one for me, the other for my Mom.</li>
            <li>exactly what I want but the perfume bottle cork broke when trying to open it.</li>
            <li>tooo strong even with just a little spray.</li>
            <li>This cologne, while not totally gardenia-like, is a lovely, light floral scent, not at all heavy as I expected from an Elizabeth Taylor scent.  </li>
            <li>but I have worn it multiple times since and as we go into spring here in the south I&#x27;ve noticed that it has turned into a pure gardenia smell on my skin</li>
            <li>It seems to last a long time, and the price is right, too!</li>
            <li>It does not have a clear gardenia fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I can remember opening the window and the soft fragrant scent blowing in with the breeze.</li>
            <li>Smells heavenly, similar to real gardenias.</li>
            <li>Guess I would give them another chance at least one more time.  </li>
            <li>Lovely, delicate yet provocative.</li>
            <li>I had it mailed directly to her</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>the bottle has a classy cultivated look.</li>
            <li>only alcohol  with about a drop of gardenia sent per the whole bottle .What</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh and it does not make me smell like a grandma.</li>
            <li>It has a natural, floral scent ... like a meadow of wildflowers.</li>
            <li>you are left smelling just like the simplistic beautiful white flowers themselves.</li>
            <li>A subtle and lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is fresh, but it does not last long.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this seller and I will repurchase in the future.</li>
            <li>A few pumps will last a whole day and stay fresh as well.</li>
            <li>Gardenia is sometimes too sweet, but the green notes in ET&#x27;s Gardenia keep it from being cloying.</li>
            <li>A little bit heavy on the Lily of the Valley for a perfume named what this one is but a nice Summer scent for Home, Fridays &amp; weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i carefully considered this purchase as i can only wear certain  cologne  on my skin  and am very sensitive to odors .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent enough for spraying in the powder room but nothing I personally want to wear.</li>
            <li>i like the gardenia scent in general.</li>
            <li>Fixed for long.</li>
            <li>I have worn this when a vase of real Gardenia flowers are nearby, &amp; it is only slightly close.</li>

            <li> I had used up my gardenia cologne and couldn&#x27;t find any more, but it turns out that Liz had it!</li>
            <li> and I both love this perfume!</li>
            <li> This perfume is a beautiful, fresh scent that makes you feel surrounded by a flower garden in bloom!</li>
            <li> I used to pluck a flower or 2 to scent the house indoors, it was amazing.</li>
            <li> I chose 5 stars for this perfume because it is gentle and delicious....</li>
            <li> It does not take much to smell great all day!</li>
            <li> I own like a zillion perfumes but</li>
            <li> the nozzle on the spray head clogged up after a couple of months...other than that the price is good for this fragrance...not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Nice but doesn&#x27;t smell like gardenia.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> and I think it has a nice floral scent.</li>
            <li> A nice fragrance to wear during the summer.  </li>
            <li> the item was sealed in box and was so nice....</li>
            <li> I honestly like animalic scents.</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for years and am pleased to find it at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Some of my friends liked the scent on me</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> Nice scent but</li>
            <li> nice bottle.</li>
            <li> Got a nice perfume for my gf.</li>
            <li> Nice, inexpensive perfume.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, this particular shopping experience was marvelous.</li>
            <li> was for my mom she really liked it, was super happy about the price tag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great price for a good-smelling perfume that is not cloying and does not smell cheap :-)</li>
            <li> We were happy with the price, how quickly it came, and the condition of the product.    </li>
            <li> Great price arrived quickly...</li>
            <li> This perfume is very strong and pungent if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> Amazon also has the best price on this perfume by far!</li>
            <li> It smell great when you first spray some on, and then it is gone, gone, gone!</li>
            <li> It also comes in a uniquely shaped bottle which is visually pleasant.</li>
            <li> Its exactly how you think it smells, its just a beautiful aroma I would buy this again and form this seller.</li>
            <li> It is very light and not too over powering.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light.</li>
            <li> This Gardenia perfume does not smell very genuine.</li>
            <li> Very light</li>
            <li> /&gt;However this one does have a nice, warm and sweet kind of floral scent which is not too strong and won&#x27;t give you a headache.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this perfume.</li>
            <li> but, they cost a lot more so</li>
            <li> i loove the smell and get many compliments .</li>
            <li> It is my aunt&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li> More like bug spray</li>
            <li> This is the only Liz Taylor scent I LOVE!!!!</li>

            <li> Hope this helps! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Many perfumes make me sneeze when I apply them but not this one.  </li>
            <li> I love the bottle it comes in also.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m okay with the scent</li>
            <li> Most fragrances that say they smell like gardenias, do not.  </li>

            <li> The bottle came today and I love the color and shape of it and</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t my favorite perfume</li>

            <li> I used to buy this perfume in department store for much more.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent of gardenias; no fragrance is more intoxicating and sensuous than that of gardenia.</li>
            <li> I love florals and Elizabeth Taylor.</li>
            <li> Has a lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite by Elizabeth Taylor</li>
            <li> This is a lovely perfume.  </li>
            <li> I get as many compliments wearing this as when I wear Jessica McClintock, and the price difference is not insubstantial.</li>
            <li> Perfume I wore many years ago.  </li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE THE SCENT</li>
            <li> absolutely love this scent.  </li>
            <li> Gardenia is one of my favorite flowers.  </li>
            <li> so ..... now it&#x27;s my closet spray, pretty nice!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Wish it were more long-lasting.</li>
            <li> my husbands favorite flower is the gardenia</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance because it&#x27;s not over powering and others asks what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> Love the this perfume.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this sent OMG</li>
            <li> THANKS!!!!</li>
            <li> While this does not smell exactly like gardenias, it comes darned close and is a great light summer scent.</li>
            <li> Good things first you will love this.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume as it is a very clean smell and doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies.  </li>
            <li> very girly very flowery love love love it !!!</li>
            <li> It lasts long and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> It sure is strong....</li>
            <li> Perfume form kind of gives me a mild headache but scented body powder doesn&#x27;t, takes the edge off I guess.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing too, and it smells exactly like Gardenia!</li>
            <li> I did not get to smell it myself, but my sister reports that it smells very true to scent and that my mother loves it.</li>
            <li> I have a huge Gardenia plant and love the flowers</li>
            <li> It is not expensive and very satisfying.</li>
            <li> It provides a lovely, light fragrance and smells just like a freshly-picked gardenia from a garden.</li>
            <li> I have never tried this product before, but as a first time customer, I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> My mother has passed away not too long ago but this wonderfully blended scent takes me back to a beautiful time with her in my life.</li>
            <li> AND HOW MUCH SHE LOVED IT.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, not too overpowering, but enough to smell like a mild gardenia garden.</li>
            <li> keep carrying this  sweet  cologne .!</li>
            <li> so light and fresh!!</li>
            <li> It will last a while, and it is most definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> Daughter found it too strong, but I like it.  </li>
            <li> If you like a strong perfume, you will like this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d describe this fragrance as evocative of Fracas with a strong hint of Jungle Gardenia.  </li>
            <li> It is not too sweet as many perfumes can be.  </li>
            <li> Now this new version is an excellent substitution for the old one.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; perfume with higher notes of gardenia, but this is a very strong perfume.  </li>
            <li> Timeless, classic and well worth trying to all my scent loving girlfriends out there!</li>
            <li> It says Free Shipping</li>
            <li> it should not have said free shipping.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for a friend, and when it was sprayed, the fragrance filled the room.</li>
            <li> however fragrance net are great and i will continue to buy from them</li>
            <li> It is light and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> nice smell but goes away fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> It is a light scent and evreytime</li>
            <li> I did a search and told her it is available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d enjoy this.</li>
            <li> Nice, but not the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> so if that&#x27;s what you are looking for this should fit the bill.</li>
            <li> A nice, light fragrance; not overpowering unless you put on too much.  </li>
            <li> The bottle and cap is beautiful in its own right, simple and pretty.  </li>
            <li> Very fresh.</li>
            <li> This is a very fresh and all ages parfum</li>
            <li> I enjoy the france and get many compliments in morning or when I first walk out the door for weekend outings.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product with no prior experience, but now am pleasantly surprised by the great scent and nice comments from family and friends.  </li>
            <li> I found the fragrance to be a bit metallic at first, then the fragrance became softer and more mellow.  </li>
            <li> Nothing Liz&#x27;s other beautiful fragrance.  </li>
            <li> when he comments one I know it must be truly special.</li>
            <li> Fast and accurate delivery!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, it is close to the real essence of gardenias...</li>
            <li> It is light and fresh.  </li>
            <li> This only smells good for about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> As a young child I always liked the fragrance of Gardenia.  </li>
            <li> but overall its good for wearing around the house to give a shot of fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Not too &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; but still light and fresh.</li>
            <li> This is the only fragrance I have ever loved 100%</li>
            <li> does not have the true smell of Gardenia</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom for mothers day last year, and she absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> Nice gardenia scent, but nowhere near Tuvache&#x27;s Jungle Gardenia (sigh).  </li>
            <li> but if you like the scent of gardenia&#x27;s this is the one for you, not too flowery or sweet</li>
            <li> I LOVE gardenia, and this is really the product for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife about a year ago at a local store and she really loved it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to apply very much for a strong scent.</li>
            <li> The scent starts just a little strong (not scary strong, no worries that you will blow someone away with your parfum scent, lol)</li>
            <li> It may seem strong when you first spray it on but after a min</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased with this unique scent.</li>
            <li> The light scent and adorable aura created by this perfume bring me good mood everyday!</li>
            <li> other then that i am happy with purchase</li>
            <li> And, it quickly softens so</li>
            <li> I received quickly and as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I received quick delivery service,  also.  </li>
            <li> Note the flower leaves mild but permanent perfume.</li>
            <li> It arrived in good time and was an instant success.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Taylor has a life-long customer in my mom, thanks to this beautiful perfume at such a reasonable price here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> and I waved it out for a minute on my shirt, and almost immediately, the gardenia overtook the other perfume and kept me smelling amazing all day!</li>
            <li> I am almost in my mid 30&#x27;s, and I love this perfume!  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Very powerful in that you don&#x27;t have to use much but not overly strong or too much.</li>
            <li> i thought it smelled of a fresh gardenia .</li>
            <li> ...I get more compliments from men on this and another jasmine-scented perfume by LUSH than I do any others that I wear.</li>
            <li> #34;what perfume are you using?&amp;#34;  So far it remains as my favorite.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t worth returning it.</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful scent and even the last lingering notes are very pretty.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, get more compliments then any other I have ever used, so I stick with this one.</li>
            <li> If you are buying it because you love the gardenia smell, there are other perfumes resemble gardenia more than this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was not worried about it as Amazon would make it right.</li>
            <li> the price was right</li>
            <li> This seems to be the right bottle and box</li>
            <li> Such a lovely shade of green that will look amazing on your dresser top or wherever you store your parfums.</li>
            <li> This product not only smells nice, like actual gardenias, but for those that have an issue with fragrances that last, this is a great solution.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really believe this is the true product.  </li>
            <li> I loved this perfume, just a simple gardenia smell, doesn&#x27;t have some of the undertones of musk or other scents that most perfumes do.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice fragrance, but it doesn&#x27;t last much.</li>
            <li> It does smell very much like gardenia</li>
            <li> Thanks much!!</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like it very much, maybe it just wasn&#x27;t mixing with my chemistry that day...</li>
            <li> No other scent to me is more sensuous and heady than the scent of real gardenias and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty heavy and very sweet smell, and I was wanting something lighter and more airy...</li>
            <li> More than 25 years ago I had gardenias growing outside our bedroom window in east Texas.</li>
            <li> You will likely Love as much as I do!</li>
            <li> so pretty  on my counter .  </li>
            <li> Additionally the bottle is a simple, elegant addition to your vanity.</li>
            <li> She is also a fan of Elizabeth Taylor and told me several times the bottle is just beatiful and has a lovely flower on the lid.</li>
            <li> Well the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li> Smells so pretty and feminine... and sexy at the same time!</li>
            <li> Thanks, Miss Taylor!</li>
            <li> Gardenia bouquet its what this fragrance smells like, the first notes does remind one of bug spray, but I gues after it misses with your body chemistry it adjust.</li>
            <li> Great for late spring &amp; summer.</li>
            <li> the flower lid is so pretty.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this without smelling it first, but I bought this for my mom, who LOVES anything gardenia, and she wears this perfume every day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth to note that this perfume does not smell too much like gardenia.</li>
            <li> first time i tried this perfume.</li>
            <li> Pretty bottle-</li>
            <li> Not overpowering, smells like the flower, and the bottle is so pretty.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this perfume.</li>
            <li> This is my first time for trying this fragrance</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying, Elizabeth Taylor&#x60;s, Gardenia.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I first purchased Gardenia several years ago, and it is one of my favorite fragrances.  </li>
            <li> If it does not smell exactly like gardenias, it comes closer than any other I&#x27;ve tried, and is fresh and light making it a fabulous summer scent.</li>
            <li> but I actually like it better since perfume that lasts a whole day</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s version is a worthy addition to the limited choices available.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very classic, old-fashioned scent (almost like something my grandmother would wear), which works for me, because I don&#x27;t want to smell like a &amp;#34;baby prostitute&amp;#34; or Britney Spears.</li>
            <li> Colognes with a light scent, especially those made with white flowers are easy to wear and always bring compliments.  </li>
            <li> Always have loved this scent and it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sweet and isn&#x27;t exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Thanks to you all at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> The transaction was very smoothe.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This gift made her very</li>
            <li> I like it but not as much as Jungle Gardenia.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t take much and you can smell it for hours</li>
            <li> This fragrance is all I expected and more.  </li>
            <li> oh so much fresher</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> but I really do like it and would recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li> The description was detailed enough that I took a chance.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Looks like shipper tightened the cork way too much before shipping the product.</li>
            <li> and I had thought I&#x27;d put too much on, but after a minute</li>
            <li> Frankly - is does smell like as if you are in middle of a flower garden , its strong &amp; not subtle</li>
            <li> (LUSH gets it right, though with their Lust scent!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is another one of those long-time favorite scents of mine, although I do prefer floral scents over other types.</li>
            <li> While this is not exact to my favorite JG, it is closer than anything I have found.</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t seem to be other top note with this perfume).  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, which is great.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this scent to anyone who loves gardenia as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much that I have nearly a dozen bottles (8 are empty).  </li>
            <li> When I want to turn up the volume, I spray it over some gardenia oil I bought at the Rennaissance Festival (formerly Planetary Perfumes but can&#x27;t remember the current name of company - out of Ohio) and men seem to love it.</li>
            <li> A classic</li>
            <li> The very pretty flower cap was stuck and I couldn&#x27;t open the bottle.</li>
            <li> It can be strong when first applied, but it decreases its potency over a few minutes</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as long-lasting as some high end perfumes.</li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t last-&lt;br /&gt;Had high hopes, but wouldn&#x27;t purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding it in any store, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It smells fresh, but at the same time it has somewhat of a seductive scent to it as well.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, and its the one my fiance prefers it out of the few I do wear.</li>
            <li> always like to explore new fragrances.</li>
            <li> Appears new.  </li>
            <li> This perfume is nothing like the real Gardenias by Liz Taylor; the only thing that resembles the real perfume is the bottle and the package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves the soft scent of gardenia.</li>
            <li> The smell remains very much the same from the time you spray it on and after 45 minutes or whatever</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles of this lovely fragrance recently, one for me, the other for my Mom.</li>
            <li> exactly what I want but the perfume bottle cork broke when trying to open it.</li>
            <li> tooo strong even with just a little spray.</li>
            <li> This cologne, while not totally gardenia-like, is a lovely, light floral scent, not at all heavy as I expected from an Elizabeth Taylor scent.  </li>
            <li> but I have worn it multiple times since and as we go into spring here in the south I&#x27;ve noticed that it has turned into a pure gardenia smell on my skin</li>
            <li> It seems to last a long time, and the price is right, too!</li>
            <li> It does not have a clear gardenia fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I can remember opening the window and the soft fragrant scent blowing in with the breeze.</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly, similar to real gardenias.</li>
            <li> Guess I would give them another chance at least one more time.  </li>
            <li> Lovely, delicate yet provocative.</li>
            <li> I had it mailed directly to her</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> the bottle has a classy cultivated look.</li>
            <li> only alcohol  with about a drop of gardenia sent per the whole bottle .What</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh and it does not make me smell like a grandma.</li>
            <li> It has a natural, floral scent ... like a meadow of wildflowers.</li>
            <li> you are left smelling just like the simplistic beautiful white flowers themselves.</li>
            <li> A subtle and lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance is fresh, but it does not last long.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this seller and I will repurchase in the future.</li>
            <li> A few pumps will last a whole day and stay fresh as well.</li>
            <li> Gardenia is sometimes too sweet, but the green notes in ET&#x27;s Gardenia keep it from being cloying.</li>
            <li> A little bit heavy on the Lily of the Valley for a perfume named what this one is but a nice Summer scent for Home, Fridays &amp; weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i carefully considered this purchase as i can only wear certain  cologne  on my skin  and am very sensitive to odors .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent enough for spraying in the powder room but nothing I personally want to wear.</li>
            <li> i like the gardenia scent in general.</li>
            <li> Fixed for long.</li>
            <li> I have worn this when a vase of real Gardenia flowers are nearby, &amp; it is only slightly close.</li>
            <li> Its a really pretty bottle, but smells a little like I remember an older lady smelling when I was small.  </li>
            <li> This works extremely well on my wife compared to some far more expensive perfumes she had tried.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting</li>
            <li> THAT THE SCENT DOESNT LAST ON YOU LONG.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long, which is disappointing, but I do love to spray it in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and have never been unhappy.  </li>
            <li> Scent lasts a long time, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> scent doesnt stay on your body long than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> It also took to long to get to my home.</li>
            <li> Well, there is nothing fresh about the perfume it is heavy and you smell old and outdated..</li>
            <li> There is definitely another note and it is not pretty.  </li>
            <li> I have looked in multiple stores for this perfume and had no success.  </li>
            <li> The oppression of extreme heat in our southern summers is mitigated by the heady aroma of this hardy little white</li>
            <li> Scent is mild to faint.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my Mom for Mothers Day, it arrived a few days later, but did not matter, she LOVES it.</li>
            <li> Nothing was broken, the bottle came in a package inside the box, and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It does not last even a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s my mistake, certainly not any shortcoming of the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> but it is a bit expensive for me right now</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t buy it in stores, but at least it is through these guys, which is a major plus.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I emailed to get a replacement nozzle but got absolutely NO response!</li>
            <li> first I was skeptical about ordering perfume online</li>
            <li> you gotta be very careful with the portion.</li>
            <li> Indeed, jasmine and gardenia are in the same flower family and jasmine is another that is hard to duplicate in a bottle.</li>
            <li> This perfume is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I want to try Black Pearls</li>
            <li> I saw it on Amazon and we got a bottle twice the size as we purchased before for half the price.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the scent does not last long on my skin so I must keep spraying it throughout the day, though I have found that if I spray it into my clothing it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> At beginning, it smells a little like Jasmie</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dreamy, I even spray a little on a bedtime.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Tabu and Obsession girl for years but wanted something a little lighter, this did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I use this as my go to fragrance for everyday.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the smell of animalic gardenia or heavy creamy florals, this perfume isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> I look forward to wearing it everyday.  </li>
            <li> but this IS NOT TRUE!</li>
            <li> You can hardly smell it after less than an hour.</li>
            <li> When I walked past one of the ladies, she told me it made her remember her Grandmother.  </li>
            <li> I should have known when the bottle is almost the size a small soda can.</li>
            <li> but I do not love it</li>
            <li> I also have a small vial of gardenia perfume oil, purchased at a Rennaissance Faire, which I use to enhance the staying power of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It actually makes me sort of ill.  </li>
            <li> The gardenia scent is dead on!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy for me with spraying 2 times.  </li>
            <li> When I spray this behind my ears I get a slight headache till it settled a bit.  </li>
            <li> Hard to beat an oldie but goodie.   </li>
            <li> A friend told me about this fragrance and how hard it has been for her to find.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for at least 5 years that I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I have complex feeling with this one.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the scent, it doesn&#x27;t really smell like gardenia, Bottle doesn&#x27;t  have any label at all, just a plain green bottle it looks fake.</li>
            <li> very disappointed scent doesn&amp;#34;t last long wish i could get a refund  </li>
            <li> We had a very hard time finding this product.  </li>
            <li> body lotion is too thin or watery---bath lotion does not lather well</li>
            <li> Longevity is medium to poor, sillage medium.</li>
            <li> The worse part is that you can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s flammable.</li>
            <li> Now I am using it by spraying behind my knees only.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am very sorry I wasted the money on the liquid inside.  </li>
            <li> Just be warned; it&#x27;s rather expensive shipping charges.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong Liz Taylor Perfume.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is extremely difficult to capture that scent in a bottle, but Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s perfume has done an admirable job of it.</li>
            <li> I DONT THINK ILL BE ORDERING THIS AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Some people find this disappointing</li>
            <li> Now for bad part I did not think I would ever get it.  </li>
            <li> Quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful about ordering parfum  on line, as I couldn&#x27;t test it.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This is the worst smell Gardenia perfurme that I have ever smelt.</li>
            <li> After that, my friend sprayed her terrible smelling perfume on me</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> body lotion is too thin or watery---bath lotion does not lather well but the eau de parfum is wonderful I was happy to find it---I can not find it in stores</li>
            <li> I chose 5 stars for this perfume because it is gentle and delicious....Highly recommend this product. It is not expensive and very satisfying.</li>
            <li> It says Free Shipping but this IS NOT TRUE! When I contracted AAA Perfume, they said it was Amazon&#x27;s fault and it should not have said free shipping. I canceled my order, but it arrived anyway. I sent it back, and was told I wouldn&#x27;t be charged. We&#x27;ll see when my statement comes.     Just be warned; it&#x27;s rather expensive shipping charges.</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;ve ordered this item. Wife just has to have it.</li>
            <li> This perfume is not worth the money.  It does NOT last at all.  What a joke! You are warned.</li>
            <li> More than 25 years ago I had gardenias growing outside our bedroom window in east Texas. In the spring, when our windows were open, they smelled heavenly! So this cologne seemed to be what I needed to recall those memories. It&#x27;s great. Scent lasts a long time, but not overpowering. Evokes the romance in one&#x27;s life. I will probablly reorder a second bottle. Also would make great gift for Mother&#x27;s Day or anniversaries.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product with no prior experience, but now am pleasantly surprised by the great scent and nice comments from family and friends.  A few pumps will last a whole day and stay fresh as well.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this perfume. It was a gift for a friend, and when it was sprayed, the fragrance filled the room. It does not take much to smell great all day! It will last a while, and it is most definitely a great buy. It smells fresh, but at the same time it has somewhat of a seductive scent to it as well. If you&#x27;re looking for a great, long-lasting perfume, Gardenia by Elizabeth Taylor is for you! ! !</li>
            <li> This is a good buy there are others out there if you search but, they cost a lot more so be happy and buy one if you like gardenia the smell lasts.</li>
            <li> I have looked in multiple stores for this perfume and had no success.  My daughter suggested Amazon.com.  I responded, \\&quot;they sell perfume?\\&quot;.  When I searched I found it!  I love this fragrance, it is close to the real essence of gardenias...I realize finding a fragrance is personal to each one of us and this perfume is just perfect for me.  Thanks to you all at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> When I was growing up my mother had a gardenia bush growing just below my bedroom window. I can remember opening the window and the soft fragrant scent blowing in with the breeze. I used to pluck a flower or 2 to scent the house indoors, it was amazing. My mother has passed away not too long ago but this wonderfully blended scent takes me back to a beautiful time with her in my life. I would highly recommend this scent to anyone who loves gardenia as much as I do. The scent starts just a little strong (not scary strong, no worries that you will blow someone away with your parfum scent, lol) And, it quickly softens so you are left smelling just like the simplistic beautiful white flowers themselves. The bottle is beyond gorgeous! Such a lovely shade of green that will look amazing on your dresser top or wherever you store your parfums. Not mention, my hubby LOVES this! I own like a zillion perfumes but when he comments one I know it must be truly special. Timeless, classic and well worth trying to all my scent loving girlfriends out there! You will likely Love as much as I do!</li>
            <li> A nice, light fragrance; not overpowering unless you put on too much.  This is another one of those long-time favorite scents of mine, although I do prefer floral scents over other types.</li>
            <li> This perfume is a beautiful, fresh scent that makes you feel surrounded by a flower garden in bloom! The transaction was very smoothe.</li>
            <li> didnt smell as good as in person</li>
            <li> i carefully considered this purchase as i can only wear certain  cologne  on my skin  and am very sensitive to odors . i loove the smell and get many compliments . the bottle is beautiful too --looks so pretty  on my counter .  keep carrying this  sweet  cologne .! price is great too.</li>
            <li> Exquisite I like it. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, get more compliments then any other I have ever used, so I stick with this one.</li>
            <li> Like another review, product smells like bug spray.  Quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume.  It is light and fresh.  I love it!  I received it very quickly and am delighted!</li>
            <li> Just what I expet. And shipped on time</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles of this lovely fragrance recently, one for me, the other for my Mom. We both love it! Additionally the bottle is a simple, elegant addition to your vanity. I do experience the essence of the tropical flower when using this and will be buying it and again again!</li>
            <li> my sister loved the fragrance</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly, similar to real gardenias. Very fresh. Great Spring perfume.</li>
            <li> We had a very hard time finding this product.  It is my aunt&#x27;s favorite.  We were happy with the price, how quickly it came, and the condition of the product.    THANKS!!!!</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell . I have this scent , my friend loves it so she&#x27;s getting a bottle for Christmas. Excellent buy.</li>
            <li> the nozzle on the spray head clogged up after a couple of months...other than that the price is good for this fragrance...not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Nice but doesn&#x27;t smell like gardenia.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!!!!  Nothing Liz&#x27;s other beautiful fragrance.  More like bug spray</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s a very classic, old-fashioned scent (almost like something my grandmother would wear), which works for me, because I don&#x27;t want to smell like a &amp;#34;baby prostitute&amp;#34; or Britney Spears.</li>
            <li> Happy to find it, I am used to using this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my Mom for Mothers Day, it arrived a few days later, but did not matter, she LOVES it. She is also a fan of Elizabeth Taylor and told me several times the bottle is just beatiful and has a lovely flower on the lid. This gift made her very happy.[[ASIN:B000P22UEM Gardenia Elizabeth Taylor By Elizabeth Taylor For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 oz]]</li>
            <li> Great price arrived quickly...Gardenia Elizabeth Taylor By Elizabeth Taylor For Women, Eau De Parfum Spray, 3.4-Ounce...I bought three....I have always LOVED Gardenia cologne....This is an oldie but goodie!</li>
            <li> I have had 2 friends tell me they &amp;#34;can&#x27;t stand &amp;#34; the way this perfume smells.  This is one of those scents that smells one way in the bottle and another on the skin .  It does not have a clear gardenia fragrance.  There is definitely another note and it is not pretty.  It might be a fixative they are using.  Well the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li> This is the only Liz Taylor scent I LOVE!!!! It&#x27;s a shame you can&#x27;t buy it in stores, but at least it is through these guys, which is a major plus. I love this scent, and its the one my fiance prefers it out of the few I do wear. Thanks much!!</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful smelling perfume in the world!  When I use it, I can hear steel drum music and the waves breaking on the sand.</li>
            <li> for the price, this is one of the best scents of gardenia you can buy.  I&#x27;ve tried several others,  and for quantity and scent this is my favorite. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves the soft scent of gardenia.</li>
            <li> Good things first you will love this. Bottle is so pretty,looks great sitting on  my cabinet.Bigger than I thought I was getting,great buy for  the money.  Scent is mild to faint.Hard to beat an oldie but goodie.   Now for bad part I did not think I would ever get it.  After I made contact with company I got an e-mail that they  had a problem with shipper on there end. Well thank&#x27;s for letting me know at last.  Was not worried about it as Amazon would make it right.But durn it I wanted the product.So I gave them a week befor I would cancell and yippie I got it.  Guess I would give them another chance at least one more time.  I want to try Black Pearls so we will see.</li>
            <li> I received quickly and as advertised.  Quality as stated and well wrapped.  Excellent service. Would use again. Daughter found it too strong, but I like it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Lovely, delicate yet provocative. Smells so pretty and feminine... and sexy at the same time! If you like the scent if gardenias, this is the best!!!</li>
            <li> While this does not smell exactly like gardenias, it comes darned close and is a great light summer scent. When I want to turn up the volume, I spray it over some gardenia oil I bought at the Rennaissance Festival (formerly Planetary Perfumes but can&#x27;t remember the current name of company - out of Ohio) and men seem to love it. And I love it. No other scent to me is more sensuous and heady than the scent of real gardenias and Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s version is a worthy addition to the limited choices available.</li>
            <li> I love Jungle Gardenia but it is a bit expensive for me right now so I got this instead. I like it but not as much as Jungle Gardenia. It does smell good though. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. I used Gardenia for many years.Now this new version is an excellent substitution for the old one.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much that I have nearly a dozen bottles (8 are empty).  I use this as my go to fragrance for everyday.  It is very light and not too over powering. I have received many compliments on the fragrance from men and women.  Often, I have forgotten I even have this fragrance on at the end of the day and I still get compliments.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I used Tuvache Jungle Gardenia for MANY years. When it no longer became unobtainable, I searched everywhere trying to find something comparable. While this is not exact to my favorite JG, it is closer than anything I have found. I have now worn this for several years (on about the fifth bottle).</li>
            <li> Long lasting and I love the compliments.</li>
            <li> I sent this to my sister in Henderson, Nevada and amazing to both of us, it was delivered the very&lt;br /&gt;NEXT DAY! I was thrilled. I LOVE AMAZON!</li>
            <li> This was the best price on the internet for this product. Others were 3 times or more for this. Great fragrance, used for many years. I buy it for friends all the time, and they love it. Thanks, Miss Taylor!</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  I also bought the body lotion &amp; shower gel.  I layer it on &amp; it smells good all day!</li>
            <li> Great product , price and delivery I will keep on buying it I recommend it. tks</li>
            <li> It did fill all my expectations. Love that perfume.</li>
            <li> Very nice sent. It may seem strong when you first spray it on but after a min it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li> Gardenia bouquet its what this fragrance smells like, the first notes does remind one of bug spray, but I gues after it misses with your body chemistry it adjust.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes.  I have been using this perfume for at least 5 years that I can remember.  One day I was wearing it and I happened to be at a doctor appointment.  When I walked past one of the ladies, she told me it made her remember her Grandmother.  I took that as a compliment.</li>
            <li> This does not smell good.  I should have known when the bottle is almost the size a small soda can.</li>
            <li> The item came in perfect condition and with a nice giveaway(mirror and comb) however, i didnt smell the perfume before and i purchased it coz i thought it smelled of a fresh gardenia . Well, there is nothing fresh about the perfume it is heavy and you smell old and outdated.. I didnt like it at all .. however fragrance net are great and i will continue to buy from them</li>
            <li> This only smells good for about 3 minutes.  It smell great when you first spray some on, and then it is gone, gone, gone!</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to put up with that snooty cashier at the Belk cosmetics counter. Elizabeth would be proud.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister. She loves it and I think it has a nice floral scent. Can&#x27;t go wrong Liz Taylor Perfume.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel comfortable! The light scent and adorable aura created by this perfume bring me good mood everyday!</li>
            <li> very disappointed scent doesn&amp;#34;t last long wish i could get a refund  it a knock off. scent doesnt stay on your body long than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I like this perfume. It can be strong when first applied, but it decreases its potency over a few minutes&lt;br /&gt; Nonetheless, the smell lasts for an hour or so.</li>
            <li> As a young child I always liked the fragrance of Gardenia.  It is light and lasts all day.  A nice fragrance to wear during the summer.  I shower with Garden Bath Gel and use the Gardenia Cologne. I love Billie Holiday - she wore a Gardenia in her hair.</li>
            <li> nice smell but goes away fast</li>
            <li> Its a really pretty bottle, but smells a little like I remember an older lady smelling when I was small.  It&#x27;s a pretty heavy and very sweet smell, and I was wanting something lighter and more airy...but overall its good for wearing around the house to give a shot of fragrance.  It sure is strong....doesn&#x27;t take much and you can smell it for hours</li>
            <li> the item was sealed in box and was so nice....I buy smaller for her but couldn&#x27;t pass up on this...great smell and very happy with the delivery and item...thank you</li>
            <li> It is okay….not as pungent as I thought.</li>
            <li> Frankly - is does smell like as if you are in middle of a flower garden , its strong &amp; not subtle</li>
            <li> This is a very fresh and all ages parfum so my mom and I love it</li>
            <li> The fragrance is  absolutely beautiful and it lasts all day. It smells so romatic and will put him in the mood.  I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Longevity is medium to poor, sillage medium. If you don&#x27;t like the smell of animalic gardenia or heavy creamy florals, this perfume isn&#x27;t for you. I honestly like animalic scents. Bought it to use for making scented body powder. Perfume form kind of gives me a mild headache but scented body powder doesn&#x27;t, takes the edge off I guess. Arrived on time, packaged well. Overall very pleased with this unique scent. Hope this helps! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I read somewhere saying that Liz Taylor used Jungle Gardenia by Tuvache so this perfume is the closest scent you can find when the Jungle Gardenia is no longer around.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is all I expected and more.  Many perfumes make me sneeze when I apply them but not this one.  It lasts all day.  I love the bottle it comes in also.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, not too overpowering, but enough to smell like a mild gardenia garden. I will order this again!</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom for mothers day and she LOVED it. She likes floral scents. I had it mailed directly to her and she was very happy. Got there on time too!</li>
            <li> I actually meant to give it 5 stars.  I have worn this fragrance for years and am pleased to find it at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Some of my friends liked the scent on me but I&#x27;ve smelled Gardenia flowers that are oh so much fresher and I&#x27;m okay with the scent but I do not love it</li>
            <li> Colognes with a light scent, especially those made with white flowers are easy to wear and always bring compliments.  I have found this one to be quite delightful and good for day and evening wear.</li>
            <li> I ordered this scent unsniffed and took a chance. It&#x27;s decent enough for spraying in the powder room but nothing I personally want to wear.</li>
            <li> Most fragrances that say they smell like gardenias, do not.  This cologne does.  It&#x27;s a nice product at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> My favorite online purchase for cologne. Not too &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; but still light and fresh. Would buy this again. Great for late spring &amp; summer.</li>
            <li> A little bit heavy on the Lily of the Valley for a perfume named what this one is but a nice Summer scent for Home, Fridays &amp; weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore the bottle as well.</li>
            <li> Great and good parfum</li>
            <li> Smells great and it&#x27;s a great price!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; perfume with higher notes of gardenia, but this is a very strong perfume.  If you like a strong perfume, you will like this.  You don&#x27;t have to apply very much for a strong scent.</li>
            <li> Smell awesome last all day</li>
            <li> It was just ok smell Lil gardenia but more on the unreal side  Dont expect real gardenia popping in smell otherwise for price its great but not eli arden product</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this I want to go to Hawaii.  It is a light scent and evreytime I wear it I get many compliments.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this fragrance and how hard it has been for her to find. I did a search and told her it is available on Amazon. Meanwhile I bought a bottle of it for myself. I have a huge Gardenia plant and love the flowers so I thought I&#x27;d enjoy this. The bottle came today and I love the color and shape of it and the flower lid is so pretty.  The scent is very light. It is NOT over powering at all. I do like it. It isn&#x27;t my favorite perfume but it is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Nice. Doesn&#x27;t smell a lot like gardenias.</li>
            <li> My wife enjoyed this perfume.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this without smelling it first, but I bought this for my mom, who LOVES anything gardenia, and she wears this perfume every day. It provides a lovely, light fragrance and smells just like a freshly-picked gardenia from a garden. Amazon also has the best price on this perfume by far! Elizabeth Taylor has a life-long customer in my mom, thanks to this beautiful perfume at such a reasonable price here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Toooooo strong!!  Nice scent but tooo strong even with just a little spray.</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful scent and even the last lingering notes are very pretty. This is the only fragrance I have ever loved 100% and I&#x27;m so happy I can find it easily on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this purchase.  Didn&#x27;t care for the scent at all.</li>
            <li> does not have the true smell of Gardenia</li>
            <li> Very Satisfied with product, delivery, and seller!  I would highly recommend this seller and I will repurchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Fast and accurate delivery! However, when I tried to contact Fragrance Express via email, I got NO response. The very pretty flower cap was stuck and I couldn&#x27;t open the bottle. After a struggle, I finally got it off only to discover that in the process, the spray nozzle got damaged. I emailed to get a replacement nozzle but got absolutely NO response!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this perfume in department store for much more. Am glad to find it on Amazon for a great price. It&#x27;s worth to note that this perfume does not smell too much like gardenia. If you are buying it because you love the gardenia smell, there are other perfumes resemble gardenia more than this one.&lt;br /&gt;However this one does have a nice, warm and sweet kind of floral scent which is not too strong and won&#x27;t give you a headache. It also comes in a uniquely shaped bottle which is visually pleasant. It&#x27;s not as long-lasting as some high end perfumes. Some people find this disappointing but I actually like it better since perfume that lasts a whole day tends to give me mind headaches.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I have a hard time finding it in any store, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  The price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have never tried this product before, but as a first time customer, I was very pleased.  I love the smell!!  I look forward to wearing it everyday.  The price was an excellent value-- I saw it elsewhere for double the price.  I received quick delivery service,  also.  Therefore, this particular shopping experience was marvelous.</li>
            <li> first time i tried this perfume. the price was right so i decided to give it a try. i like the gardenia scent in general. nice bottle. top doesnt stay on great. other then that i am happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I love the scent of gardenias; no fragrance is more intoxicating and sensuous than that of gardenia. The oppression of extreme heat in our southern summers is mitigated by the heady aroma of this hardy little white flower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is extremely difficult to capture that scent in a bottle, but Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s perfume has done an admirable job of it. If it does not smell exactly like gardenias, it comes closer than any other I&#x27;ve tried, and is fresh and light making it a fabulous summer scent. Unfortunately the scent does not last long on my skin so I must keep spraying it throughout the day, though I have found that if I spray it into my clothing it lasts longer. I also have a small vial of gardenia perfume oil, purchased at a Rennaissance Faire, which I use to enhance the staying power of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And...I get more compliments from men on this and another jasmine-scented perfume by LUSH than I do any others that I wear. Indeed, jasmine and gardenia are in the same flower family and jasmine is another that is hard to duplicate in a bottle. (LUSH gets it right, though with their Lust scent!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great price for a good-smelling perfume that is not cloying and does not smell cheap :-)</li>
            <li> Pretty bottle- Great smell that doesn&#x27;t last-&lt;br /&gt;Had high hopes, but wouldn&#x27;t purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;Use as air freshner at this point.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bc I love florals and Elizabeth Taylor. At first I didn&#x27;t like it very much, maybe it just wasn&#x27;t mixing with my chemistry that day...but I have worn it multiple times since and as we go into spring here in the south I&#x27;ve noticed that it has turned into a pure gardenia smell on my skin</li>
            <li> i have begun to cheat on my signature fragrance (perry ellis 360) for this!  i just hope i can wear this beautiful scent in the summer!</li>
            <li> Recieved this as a gift. Has a lovely fragrance. Not overpowering, smells like the flower, and the bottle is so pretty.</li>
            <li> I sent this as a gift for my mother who loves the smell of Gardenia.  I did not get to smell it myself, but my sister reports that it smells very true to scent and that my mother loves it.</li>
            <li> Got a nice perfume for my gf.</li>
            <li> This Gardenia perfume does not smell very genuine. The worse part is that you can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s flammable.</li>
            <li> smooth product in perfect condition</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance.  It is not too sweet as many perfumes can be.  It lasts long and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> Not my favorite by Elizabeth Taylor but I&#x27;ll use periodically.  Had never tried this one...always like to explore new fragrances.</li>
            <li> Nice, inexpensive perfume.  Great spring, summery scent.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom for mothers day last year, and she absolutely loved it. The scent is amazing too, and it smells exactly like Gardenia!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely perfume.  It reminds me of the gardenia that grows in Maui.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this perfume. It has a feminine smell so you will know the moment you spray it. So far I like it. If I run out I will be buying it again.😊</li>
            <li> Smell so good. At beginning, it smells a little like Jasmie but then it turns to Gardania. Five stars.</li>
            <li> This is my first time for trying this fragrance but I really do like it and would recommend it to others.  The price is also very good.</li>
            <li> I like perfumes. Liz Taylor&#x27;s fragrance that is wonderful. Fixed for long. Note the flower leaves mild but permanent perfume.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this stuff for the money. The same perfume will have a different scent on each person.  This works extremely well on my wife compared to some far more expensive perfumes she had tried.  Give it a shot.  It might work for you and as a bonus the bottle has a classy cultivated look.</li>
            <li> I get as many compliments wearing this as when I wear Jessica McClintock, and the price difference is not insubstantial.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful about ordering parfum  on line, as I couldn&#x27;t test it.  The description was detailed enough that I took a chance. I like it! Thanks again.</li>
            <li> This perfume is very strong and pungent if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.  The smell remains very much the same from the time you spray it on and after 45 minutes or whatever (it doesn&#x27;t seem to be other top note with this perfume).  When I spray this behind my ears I get a slight headache till it settled a bit.  Now I am using it by spraying behind my knees only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Gardenia &amp; Tuberose from Estee Lauder private collection for some years and I constantly been asked &amp;#34;what perfume are you using?&amp;#34;  So far it remains as my favorite.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase! This perfume is nothing like the real Gardenias by Liz Taylor; the only thing that resembles the real perfume is the bottle and the package. There is not sent at all! only alcohol  with about a drop of gardenia sent per the whole bottle .What a rip off.&lt;br /&gt;I will never purchase from this seller again and you shouldn&#x27;t either</li>
            <li> Like the smell...exactly what I want but the perfume bottle cork broke when trying to open it. Looks like shipper tightened the cork way too much before shipping the product. The perfume is now sort of unusable.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for Jungle Gardenia from years ago. Nice, but not the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;Use it on sheets! Then order Jungle Gardenia!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product recently. got it yesterday. I am very disappointed with the scent, it doesn&#x27;t really smell like gardenia, Bottle doesn&#x27;t  have any label at all, just a plain green bottle it looks fake.</li>
            <li> My mom is a fan of Elizabeth Taylor perfumes so I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try without sampling it. It arrived in good time and was an instant success. Mom loved it and it smells just like a gardenia. Great product and excellent size bottle for the price! Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying, Elizabeth Taylor&#x60;s, Gardenia. Very nice and not over-powering. I recommend it to anyone who likes the delicate-side of Gardenia. Well packed and I recommend this seller!</li>
            <li> Perfume I wore many years ago.  Still smells great.  Appears new.  Got it today.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> MY STEP MOTHER HAD TOLD ME ABOUT THIS PERFUME AND SAID SHE USED TO WEAR IT ALL THE TIME AND HOW MUCH SHE LOVED IT. SO I ORDERED HER ONE AND MYSELF ONE. I REALLY LOVE THE SCENT BUT AM DISSAPOINTED THAT THE SCENT DOESNT LAST ON YOU LONG. IT SEEMS LIKE AFTER FIVE OR SO MINUTES ITS TOTALLY GONE. I DONT THINK ILL BE ORDERING THIS AGAIN.</li>
            <li> A subtle and lovely fragrance.  Not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is the worst smell Gardenia perfurme that I have ever smelt. It does not even smell like Gardenias. So I poured it out instead of returning it, becauae it wasn&#x27;t worth returning it.</li>
            <li> I found the fragrance to be a bit metallic at first, then the fragrance became softer and more mellow.  Nice gardenia scent, but nowhere near Tuvache&#x27;s Jungle Gardenia (sigh).  The spray head was defective--only tiny drops that spray out about 2 inches--no mist, ever.  I&#x27;m trying to find a sprayhead to replace it with.  Nice bottle, but quite a disappointment overall. I happen to find all the Elizabeth Taylor fragrances metallic.  I wonder what that ingredient is, and why it is used.  If I wanted to smell like a floral robot...I&#x27;d move to Stepford.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume as it is a very clean smell and doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Its exactly how you think it smells, its just a beautiful aroma I would buy this again and form this seller.</li>
            <li> THIS FRAGRANCE IS AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was skeptical about ordering perfume online (I had never smelled it before), but all of my concerns vanished when it arrived. Nothing was broken, the bottle came in a package inside the box, and shipping was fast. Plus, it smells good! I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is great. Very powerful in that you don&#x27;t have to use much but not overly strong or too much. Get lots of compliments when I wear this.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this scent.  It&#x27;s dreamy, I even spray a little on a bedtime.  A little goes a long way but if you like the scent of gardenia&#x27;s this is the one for you, not too flowery or sweet, it just perfect.  I&#x27;ve been a Tabu and Obsession girl for years but wanted something a little lighter, this did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the quality of this product. It also took to long to get to my home.</li>
            <li> Gardenia is one of my favorite flowers.  This cologne, while not totally gardenia-like, is a lovely, light floral scent, not at all heavy as I expected from an Elizabeth Taylor scent.  The bottle is beautiful too.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice gardenia scent.  It&#x27;s very sweet and isn&#x27;t exactly what I expected but that&#x27;s my mistake, certainly not any shortcoming of the fragrance.  It does smell very much like gardenia so if that&#x27;s what you are looking for this should fit the bill.</li>
            <li> was for my mom she really liked it, was super happy about the price tag.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and have never been unhappy.  The scent is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I put this on this morning and I had thought I&#x27;d put too much on, but after a minute or so it evened out. After that, my friend sprayed her terrible smelling perfume on me and I waved it out for a minute on my shirt, and almost immediately, the gardenia overtook the other perfume and kept me smelling amazing all day! I LOVE gardenia, and this is really the product for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really believe this is the true product.  It does not last even a few minutes.  A tester spritz at the mall will last for hours.  This seems to be the right bottle and box but I am very sorry I wasted the money on the liquid inside.  It actually makes me sort of ill.  Never again!  You have been warned.</li>
            <li> I have complex feeling with this one. My husband likes it on me. but I don&#x27;t feel the same way. you gotta be very careful with the portion. It&#x27;s very heavy for me with spraying 2 times.  after several minutes I feel like dizzy  so ..... now it&#x27;s my closet spray, pretty nice!</li>
            <li> I had used up my gardenia cologne and couldn&#x27;t find any more, but it turns out that Liz had it! I love this stuff and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is fresh, but it does not last long. It&#x27;s not harsh and it does not make me smell like a grandma. I enjoy the france and get many compliments in morning or when I first walk out the door for weekend outings.</li>
            <li> It is a nice fragrance, but it doesn&#x27;t last much. You can hardly smell it after less than an hour.</li>
            <li> This product not only smells nice, like actual gardenias, but for those that have an issue with fragrances that last, this is a great solution.  It stays all day, even when I don&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> Smells beautiful! Doesn&#x27;t last very long, which is disappointing, but I do love to spray it in the morning. Wish it were more long-lasting.</li>
            <li> really good smell, my mom loves it for xmas</li>
            <li> I presented it as a gift.  She has not stopped wearing it.</li>
            <li> this bottle is so pretty!!and the scent is great!! so light and fresh!! smells just like  a gardenia  in bloom!! ilove this scent!! MY FAVORITE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am almost in my mid 30&#x27;s, and I love this perfume!  The gardenia scent is dead on!  A little goes a long way, which is great.  The bottle and cap is beautiful in its own right, simple and pretty.  My hunt for the perfect gardenia perfume is over, I am sticking with this one for life.  :)</li>
            <li> I have worn this when a vase of real Gardenia flowers are nearby, &amp; it is only slightly close. This parfum smells mostly like alcohol sadly.</li>
            <li> Always have loved this scent and it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife about a year ago at a local store and she really loved it. I saw it on Amazon and we got a bottle twice the size as we purchased before for half the price. This stuff smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d describe this fragrance as evocative of Fracas with a strong hint of Jungle Gardenia.  Gardenia is sometimes too sweet, but the green notes in ET&#x27;s Gardenia keep it from being cloying. This is a great every day perfume, perfect for summer.  It seems to last a long time, and the price is right, too!</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly!  A classic I hope stays around forever.</li>
            <li> I loved this perfume, just a simple gardenia smell, doesn&#x27;t have some of the undertones of musk or other scents that most perfumes do.  i get tons of compliments whenever i wear this.</li>
            <li> my husbands favorite flower is the gardenia and i am always looking for a perfume that comes close he and I both love this perfume!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance because it&#x27;s not over powering and others asks what I am wearing. I have been told everyone knows when I entered the building.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Love the this perfume. So happy I found here again. Perfect A++++++ seller. Will continue to do business with again. Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this sent OMG I will be buying again its like spring time on my neck very girly very flowery love love love it !!!</li>
            <li> I first purchased Gardenia several years ago, and it is one of my favorite fragrances.  It has a natural, floral scent ... like a meadow of wildflowers.</li>
            <li> I always buy this because it is my very favorite and I cannot find it in the stores.  Very light</li>
