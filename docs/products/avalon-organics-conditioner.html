            <li>I really liked it, so I looked up the shampoo, and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It honestly seemed it was damaging my hair more than strengthening it.</li>
            <li>Smells great and very invigorating in the shower!</li>
            <li>I love Avalon organics.</li>
            <li>My wife and I love this.  </li>
            <li>I DO love the smell, and the sensation of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I used to love this conditioner, but it has been reformulated.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Avalon peppermint has become my favorite shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>However if I were located where I could not get it easily, I would order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>If the formula copyright on your bottle of beloved peppermint conditioner is 2009, you have been using the older formulation and purchasing</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think they did a good job of testing the new formula before they put it on the market.</li>
            <li>My fine hair needs something like this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>free the likeable mint on my scalp.</li>
            <li>It smells awesome but was not effective as a conditioner.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product is the smell.  </li>
            <li>There is a sticker on the bottle that says \\&quot;New More</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that it does not have sulfates or parabens, not sure if the strengthening aspect it touts is true, but leaves my hair pretty wiry . . .</li>
            <li>More Essential Oils\\&quot; one, NOT the \\&quot;New More Sustainable\\&quot; one.</li>
            <li>They changed the formula, and though I&#x27;m all about more sustainable, it&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
            <li>I ignored earlier reviews of this product because I had a bottle of it in my shower, it was a favorite of mine, and it was about to run out.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is not too heavy but does a good job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My hair is very long, very straight and very fine.  </li>
            <li>Really makes hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It dries out my hair rather than conditioning it, it leaves my curly and unruly hair more tangled than before I used it, and overall it just doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to the older formula.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It did not seem to moisturize my hair or make it easy to comb through when it was wet.</li>
            <li>The peppermint scent is a little strong as first, but then gets milder.</li>
            <li>: My review is for the \\&quot;New</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change in my hair, good or bad.</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair, so some people may not have the same issues with it,</li>
            <li>For the first time I&#x27;m able to have the natural waves in my hair becuse its no longer weighed down with other product.</li>
            <li>Very thick conditioner, works great and helped, along with the Avalon Organics Peppermint Shampoo, clear up my husbands dry scalp.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of peppermint and it is a scent that is hard to find in shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not super excited about the peppermint smell OR the tingling, but my hair is SO soft and silky when I use this, people can&#x27;t help but compliment, and touch it.</li>
            <li>My hair is almost as soft, but the conditioner is not as silky.</li>
            <li>I got it at the all natural store here in town.</li>
            <li>When I got it all three bottles said it&#x27;s only 70% natural.</li>

            <li> I love Avalon organics. My hair is the lightest its ever been. You don&#x27;t realize how much &#x27;regular&#x27; shampoo or conditioner weighs your hair down until you use something that doesn&#x27;t. I have very long hair, down to my bottom; and even though I dont use any hairspray, gel etc. its still very heavy. For the first time I&#x27;m able to have the natural waves in my hair becuse its no longer weighed down with other product.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this.  The only other soap I&#x27;ll by is Dr. Bronners.</li>
            <li> Used this for about a month now. I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change in my hair, good or bad. I DO love the smell, and the sensation of the conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me, but it is a nice splurge.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does not work for me. My hair is greasier and heavier after using this product. It was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Very thick conditioner, works great and helped, along with the Avalon Organics Peppermint Shampoo, clear up my husbands dry scalp. Smells great and very invigorating in the shower!</li>
            <li> I have 4c hair. Once this product is gone i will.not repurchase becaue it does nothing for my hair but tingles free the likeable mint on my scalp. After my hair is drying, i have to rescupitate my strands to regain moisture...this product was 12...and the company should pay me for trying their hyped up lie.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to condition well.  It&#x27;s great that it does not have sulfates or parabens, not sure if the strengthening aspect it touts is true, but leaves my hair pretty wiry . . . not much of a difference from a &#x27;no-conditioner&#x27; day!</li>
            <li> I used to love this conditioner, but it has been reformulated. It doesn&#x27;t detangle and it leaves my hair dull and sticky. There is a sticker on the bottle that says \\&quot;New More Sustainable\\&quot;. I appreciate their efforts for sustainability, but if it doesn&#x27;t work, no one will buy it. I have long fine hair, so some people may not have the same issues with it, but I don&#x27;t think they did a good job of testing the new formula before they put it on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo as well as the rosemary scent for volume. Both work well. The peppermint scent is a little strong as first, but then gets milder. I love it. I alternate between the two. My fine hair needs something like this.&lt;br /&gt;I buy locally and save the shipping. However if I were located where I could not get it easily, I would order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome but was not effective as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> It in conjunction with the shampoo leave my hair flat and lifeless.</li>
            <li> great smell. but not very conditioning.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The smell is fantastic!  Gives you an invigorating feeling as well as leaves your hair feeling great!</li>
            <li> my hair felt dry and was knotted- had to use leave-in conditioner to comb through it. I can&#x27;t use it in the winter but like it in summer.</li>
            <li> I am wary of some ingredients, but I cannot argue with the results.  My hair is very long, very straight and very fine.  No hair product I have EVER used in my LIFE did what it says it would do, except for this one.  I&#x27;m not super excited about the peppermint smell OR the tingling, but my hair is SO soft and silky when I use this, people can&#x27;t help but compliment, and touch it. You may have to fight them off with sticks, and invest in pepper spray.  After trying dozens of conditioning products over the years, that disappoint and let you down, this is one quiet little gem I hope is around as long as I have hair.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE : My review is for the \\&quot;New More Essential Oils\\&quot; one, NOT the \\&quot;New More Sustainable\\&quot; one. They changed the formula, and though I&#x27;m all about more sustainable, it&#x27;s just not the same. My hair is almost as soft, but the conditioner is not as silky.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this conditioner.  I love the smell of peppermint and it is a scent that is hard to find in shampoo and conditioner. It is also organic. After using half the bottle I gave up on this product. It did not seem to moisturize my hair or make it easy to comb through when it was wet. It honestly seemed it was damaging my hair more than strengthening it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;ve used the Body wash before. I got it at the all natural store here in town. I really liked it, so I looked up the shampoo, and conditioner. When I got it all three bottles said it&#x27;s only 70% natural. I like this product but I&#x27;m probably not going to be using it again. When the items arrived all three of them were in a bag and leaking. I still have quite a bit left, though, so I wasn&#x27;t to concerned.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. Came well wrapped and with great packaging.</li>
            <li> Avalon peppermint has become my favorite shampoo/conditioner. I have waist length, slightly oily hair and use this product daily. The conditioner is not too heavy but does a good job of moisturizing. I would recommend this item to friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing reviews saying it left people&#x27;s hair dry and wiry... I don&#x27;t know about that, but it left my hair UNBELIEVABLY greasy. Even after my next shower with no conditioner... Still just about as greasy. It seriously looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in months. It was way too expensive to begin with, and ended up being the worst conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look great and my scalp tingle.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start by disclosing that I have long, dark, thick curly hair. My hair sits just above my tailbone. This bottle lasted all of a week. I loved the smell...but my hair felt like straw after it dried. I was a straw haired woman. It seems to be a great product... But not for me.</li>
            <li> I ignored earlier reviews of this product because I had a bottle of it in my shower, it was a favorite of mine, and it was about to run out. Lo and behold the bottle I received in the mail was, in fact, a new formulation that is absolutely terrible. It dries out my hair rather than conditioning it, it leaves my curly and unruly hair more tangled than before I used it, and overall it just doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to the older formula. If the formula copyright on your bottle of beloved peppermint conditioner is 2009, you have been using the older formulation and purchasing this product will leave you sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product is the smell.  It does not moisturize at all; my hair felt knotted.  I conditioned twice with it and then had to use one of my regular conditioners after.</li>
            <li> Really makes hair smooth and soft.</li>
