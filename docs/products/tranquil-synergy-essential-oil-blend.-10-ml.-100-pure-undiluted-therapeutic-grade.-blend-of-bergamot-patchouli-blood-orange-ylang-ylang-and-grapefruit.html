            <li>It&#x27;s a nice oil, but I found the smell a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li>After using the Plant Therapy Essential Oils now for about six months I can say I am very pleased with every one of them that I&#x27;ve tried and feel that they are of excellent quality.</li>

            <li>Thank you, Plant Therapy, your oils are really lovely.</li>
            <li>I love the oil scents to include the Tranquil Synergy Essentil Oil Blend.</li>
            <li>Most of my oils are Plant Therapy now.  </li>
            <li>But for diffusing and diluted for topical use, it&#x27;s a great oil!  </li>
            <li>I also love using it in my aroma pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>she says it&#x27;s become her favorite synergy to use in her diffuser.</li>
            <li>Love to even just smell from the bottle.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell of it and will be ordering more of it from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li>I love putting the oil into my humidifier and having it fill the house.</li>

            <li>They LOVE the smell.</li>

            <li>Wonderful mix and smells terrific.</li>
            <li>Love this oil.  </li>
            <li>I put it in the diffuser, absolutely love the citrus and spice profile.</li>
            <li>Combined with Nature&#x27;s Gate Pomegranate Sunflower lotion on the rest of me,  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve heard the comment,  \\&quot;You</li>
            <li>Patchouli is one of my favorite scents, and I like this blend.</li>
            <li>Love them both</li>
            <li>I now use sensual as my perfume and my husband Loves it! :)</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li>This brand is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I love their prices too.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more of this oil.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell also</li>
            <li>I also like the plug on the top, as it assists in being able to add the desired amount of drops.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>me want to hug them more.</li>
            <li>I love your products, and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li>I do not know for sure yet</li>
            <li>how this effects me, as I have so many issues.</li>
            <li>Order was received in a timely fashion and I think this is&lt;br /&gt;a reputable company.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, but this is very very watery.</li>
            <li>high quality and smells great.</li>
            <li>I find this blend to be a perfect aroma to help me unwind from a long day at work.  </li>
            <li>It is very calming and pleasant.</li>
            <li>then you&#x27;re probably not going to like it because of how strong it is but trust me, put it in something too diluted and you will love it.</li>
            <li>It so strong and overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping good price.</li>
            <li>Gives off a nice pleasant odor, wish it would last longer though.</li>
            <li>My kids ask for the Relax oil every night before bed, they are sleeping much better and fall asleep more quickly.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, this is great!</li>
            <li>I have tried other oils, and this is the best I have</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad (not at all!), but it does have a bit of a head shop type smell to it.</li>
            <li>The package arrived very quickly and the item was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>Some of the combo oils are strong but this one I use on pillows to help drift into a relaxing sleep</li>
            <li>Strong patchouli smell</li>
            <li>It would be a bit too strong to wear on</li>
            <li>The patchouli notes are a bit strong, and can overwhelm the lavender, a scent I prefer.</li>
            <li>Very potent and pure.</li>
            <li>Many time I will use it while taking a bath right before bedtime!</li>
            <li>I drab a drop or two on my linens, and sometimes on my wrists; it&#x27;s such a beautiful scent to go to sleep by.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the many excellent reviews of Plant Therapy Essential Oils on this page that helped me in choosing them.  </li>
            <li>This blend is wonderful and I use it on myself as well as the grandbaby when it is time to settle down for the night.  </li>
            <li>The scent was so soft and very pleasant, and I did feel very relaxed/tranquil.  </li>
            <li>Thus is my favorite oil so far,  the packaging was good, it came quickly</li>
            <li>This smells wonderful...not too strong and very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Helps to keep him calm and sleep better at night.</li>
            <li>I cannot prove it, but I feel much better and calm with this blend.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to receive the Tranquil Synergy Essential Oil Blend and even happier</li>
            <li>Make ur room , find the best thoughrs in ur mind, put a few drops of oil and invite the person</li>
            <li>The scent is light, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>, This is a good buy to relax naturally .</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>Just received my second order of many more to come!  </li>
            <li>I am pleased so far, and will see after using for a month or more.</li>
            <li>Recommend to anyone who is searching for a pleasant scented essential oil.</li>
            <li>Arrived sooner than I expected, great customer service.</li>
            <li>Fair left muck in my machine</li>
            <li>This Tranquil blend is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>The oil has a very earthy smell to it, to some people it may be an overwhelming earthy smell</li>
            <li>Not only do I smell good</li>
            <li>The scent is go gentle, I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the patchouli, lavendar/ sandalwood smell, it is really heavenly.</li>
            <li>but I really can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li>I mix a few drops of this wonderful smelling oil to a carrier oil (either pure argan or sweet apricot) and rub it on my hands and neck just before going to bed.</li>
            <li>it sure beats spending a fortune on perfume,  and it is such a mild clean scent that does not overpower like many perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I have used almost everything to try and help me sleep, and this oil is a great alternative to other sleep aids.</li>
            <li>Like many older people, I sometimes experience days of insomnia.  </li>
            <li>This particular one seems to be a favorite of my clients (and my self).  </li>
            <li>so I have ordered and received several essential oils that I can blend with Lavender so that I can attempt to get a handle on my nerves and this is one product that is an excellent addition to my blends.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy ur life ;)</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the essential oil blend, Tranquil.  </li>
            <li>Seems like every time I try one its my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really had time to try this essential oil out yet, but it smells really nice!</li>
            <li>I really like that it&#x27;s strong but not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>this is my favorite by far!  </li>
            <li>Helps calm me before bed to promote sleep.</li>
            <li>I can say that it works to help calm the nervous system.  </li>
            <li>I use this one along with calm the child oil.</li>
            <li>They really do calm you and put you to sleep.</li>
            <li>However in case you bought it and don&#x27;t like it either, with some drops of rose essential oil</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the aroma</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>Both of these also were delivered quicker than expected and in good shape.</li>
            <li>Contrary to what another reviewer said, you DO have to pay more for a really good long lasting oil, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be overwhelming because when I sniffed it gently from the container straight, it was pretty powerful.</li>
            <li>I order several different variations of this line with great results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super floral or fruity, it&#x27;s almost an herbal musky smell, but very &amp;#34;clean.&amp;#34; It makes my bedroom and bathroom smell amazing when I use it in the shower!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very unusual odor.  </li>
            <li>Very, very soothing.</li>
            <li>Product exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>This is the first oil I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I love this essential oil.</li>
            <li>I joined numerous Facebook groups and read blog after blog to find a company that is reputable and affordable.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I really love Plant Therapy&#x27;s Tranquil Synergy Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>I use this oil with my diffuser on a regular basis and love it.</li>
            <li>Not offensive, but not perhaps a first choice for a room fragrance.</li>
            <li>I fought to keep my eyes open :)&lt;</li>
            <li>found.(I also love how low their prices are).</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s a bit of a bite to the scent that is off-putting when I first use it.  </li>
            <li>She needs to relax, but she definitely doesn&#x27;t need to be any more drowsy.  </li>
            <li>I love this combination of essential oils.  </li>
            <li>on my second bottle and have a third one on the way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it to when making lotion bars and everyone who uses it starts yawning and looks incredibly relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing oil blend &amp; I find the scent to be long lasting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping the other two&lt;br /&gt;oils - Germ-Fighter and Immune-Aid - will be as effective.  </li>
            <li>Really nice oil, I add it to my cream and wear it during the day and put it directly on my skin at night, it definitely has an earthy but calming smell to it.  </li>
            <li>but I simply cannot afford them any more - these seem to&lt;br /&gt;be the same high quality but more affordable.....</li>
            <li>Not sure it helped as much as I had hoped, but it did provide a pleasant fragrance that was not perfumey, and cancelled out that undefined sickness and antiseptic smell.</li>
            <li>Recently I became more interested in researching and using high quality therapeutic grade oils, like YL.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend any PT essential oils, but this is one of my top favorites.</li>
            <li>Just a few drops to my diffuser and my whole first floor smells lovely!</li>
            <li>For kids, I&#x27;d only add one drop as the scent is a bit strong.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;100% pure, undiluted, and therapeutic\\&quot;, in my estimation.</li>
            <li>100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, but for anyone like me new to purchasing blends for use in diffusers because mainstream scented products are bothersome to allergies - one or more ingredients in the blends may trigger an allergic reaction, as these are from actual plants, etc.  </li>
            <li>They are a very high quality, and I will buy from them again.</li>
            <li>i put on diffuser at night with a little lavender oil added and its amazing.</li>
            <li>After a hard day at work it works good with my spa mist.will purchase this product again .</li>
            <li>The Bergamot really comes through.  </li>
            <li>A very relaxing scent for the oil burner.&lt;br /&gt;Adding</li>
            <li>Product was delivered fast and packed well.  </li>
            <li>Fell asleep fast and slept well.  </li>
            <li>Very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I find it very helpful at night, used in my diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Very calming.</li>
            <li>When diffused it really does create a &amp;#34;tranquil&amp;#34; atmosphere.</li>
            <li>my husband was fast asleep.</li>
            <li>I just feel as though the scent fades too fast.  </li>
            <li>Every time I use it, I sleep really well.</li>
            <li>I like the aroma of this product and find it has a very calming and soothing affect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I find it very relaxing.</li>
            <li>Also haven&#x27;t had much luck using this to help me fall asleep</li>
            <li>Very relaxing scent.  </li>
            <li>But this EO really grew on me.  </li>
            <li>The patchouli is the scent that lingers, and was never one of my favorites, but it really works well in this.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped my sleep problems - getting to sleep and staying asleep.  </li>
            <li>their other blend that is similar to &amp;#34;thieves&amp;#34; is a good one though..</li>
            <li>I love that I&#x27;m paying for the product alone, as compared to other brands that have inflated prices because they are MLM products.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it works, and other times it&#x27;s just overwhelmingly offending to the nasal passages.  </li>
            <li>other oils I have paid more to get.</li>
            <li>Probably won&#x27;t repurchase but will try other blends from the line because they are reasonably priced and seem good quality (I am new to essential oils).</li>
            <li>People respond to scents in a highly individualized way, so reviews of oil scents may not be of much use to you.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t have a hand in making this particular oil, but he did help with the KidSafe oils and serves as a consultant for Plant Therapy.  </li>
            <li>That shows that this company is striving to do right by their customers by learning as much they can about essential oils and providing quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Someone on a Facebook group highly recommended Tranquil, so</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other brands of essential oils and this one seems to definitely own up to being,</li>
            <li>I also received a very similar oil in the same grab bag and wasn&#x27;t sure which one I wanted to open use right away.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting without overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Even my boys ask to put  a few drops on their pillow at night to sleep better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I put it on my dogs collars, natural flea and tick repellent, smells fantastic and nice</li>
            <li>You do not need much because it is what it says, undiluted so if you use too much of it it is going knock you down with its powerful scent.</li>
            <li>Subtle but nice.</li>
            <li>The problem is that when you are most stressed, you usually don&#x27;t remember to use it.  </li>
            <li>Several weeks ago, I used this blend to make my first batch of CP soap.</li>
            <li>I have used many different brands of essential oils over the last 12 years in my massage therapy and yoga practice.  </li>
            <li>Careful pouring, drops come out quickly.</li>
            <li>Not a bad scent, just not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I find that it helps me to unwind and decompress after a busy day.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, despite being listed second on the ingredients list, it does not overpower the Synergy.  </li>
            <li>It smells like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>The Patchouli does remain after time, but is soft.</li>
            <li>Reasonable is the key word</li>
            <li>&quot; so far.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately this was not as good as the Young Living Oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be able to go through an entire 30ml bottle by myself</li>
            <li>This oil has a strange scent to it - I really can&#x27;t describe it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and calming, but when you take a sniff, there just seems to be something missing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s an economical solution for those who are high stress and have a hard time falling asleep.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like spending the money, but using this has caused me to decide to only buy Young Living.</li>
            <li>far this is the only Synergy that I have purchased from Plant Therapy</li>
            <li>It smells nearly identical and seems to have all the same healing &amp; theraputic qualities.  </li>
            <li>I have used Young Living essential oils</li>
            <li>I really like it and use it frequently, but something is missing.  </li>
            <li>A little of this goes a long way, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so pungent and smells so fresh.  </li>
            <li>I take a lot of daily naps due to current chemo treatment and this really helps.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something a little softer but I still like for certain days.</li>

            <li> love this company and products, very affordable and prompt free shipping cannot beat it!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice oil, but I found the smell a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li> After using the Plant Therapy Essential Oils now for about six months I can say I am very pleased with every one of them that I&#x27;ve tried and feel that they are of excellent quality.</li>

            <li> Thank you, Plant Therapy, your oils are really lovely.</li>
            <li> I love the oil scents to include the Tranquil Synergy Essentil Oil Blend.</li>
            <li> Most of my oils are Plant Therapy now.  </li>
            <li> But for diffusing and diluted for topical use, it&#x27;s a great oil!  </li>
            <li> I also love using it in my aroma pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> she says it&#x27;s become her favorite synergy to use in her diffuser.</li>
            <li> Love to even just smell from the bottle.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of it and will be ordering more of it from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> I love putting the oil into my humidifier and having it fill the house.</li>

            <li> They LOVE the smell.</li>

            <li> Love this oil.  </li>
            <li> I put it in the diffuser, absolutely love the citrus and spice profile.</li>
            <li> Combined with Nature&#x27;s Gate Pomegranate Sunflower lotion on the rest of me,  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve heard the comment,  \\&quot;You</li>
            <li> Patchouli is one of my favorite scents, and I like this blend.</li>
            <li> Love them both</li>
            <li> I now use sensual as my perfume and my husband Loves it! :)</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> This brand is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I love their prices too.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more of this oil.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell also</li>
            <li> I also like the plug on the top, as it assists in being able to add the desired amount of drops.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> me want to hug them more.</li>
            <li> I love your products, and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I do not know for sure yet</li>
            <li> how this effects me, as I have so many issues.</li>
            <li> Order was received in a timely fashion and I think this is&lt;br /&gt;a reputable company.  </li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, but this is very very watery.</li>
            <li> high quality and smells great.</li>
            <li> I find this blend to be a perfect aroma to help me unwind from a long day at work.  </li>
            <li> It is very calming and pleasant.</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;re probably not going to like it because of how strong it is but trust me, put it in something too diluted and you will love it.</li>
            <li> It so strong and overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping good price.</li>
            <li> Gives off a nice pleasant odor, wish it would last longer though.</li>
            <li> My kids ask for the Relax oil every night before bed, they are sleeping much better and fall asleep more quickly.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, this is great!</li>
            <li> I have tried other oils, and this is the best I have</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad (not at all!), but it does have a bit of a head shop type smell to it.</li>
            <li> The package arrived very quickly and the item was well packaged.  </li>
            <li> Some of the combo oils are strong but this one I use on pillows to help drift into a relaxing sleep</li>
            <li> Strong patchouli smell</li>
            <li> It would be a bit too strong to wear on</li>
            <li> The patchouli notes are a bit strong, and can overwhelm the lavender, a scent I prefer.</li>
            <li> Very potent and pure.</li>
            <li> Many time I will use it while taking a bath right before bedtime!</li>
            <li> I drab a drop or two on my linens, and sometimes on my wrists; it&#x27;s such a beautiful scent to go to sleep by.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the many excellent reviews of Plant Therapy Essential Oils on this page that helped me in choosing them.  </li>
            <li> This blend is wonderful and I use it on myself as well as the grandbaby when it is time to settle down for the night.  </li>
            <li> The scent was so soft and very pleasant, and I did feel very relaxed/tranquil.  </li>
            <li> Thus is my favorite oil so far,  the packaging was good, it came quickly</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful...not too strong and very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep him calm and sleep better at night.</li>
            <li> I cannot prove it, but I feel much better and calm with this blend.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive the Tranquil Synergy Essential Oil Blend and even happier</li>
            <li> Make ur room , find the best thoughrs in ur mind, put a few drops of oil and invite the person</li>
            <li> The scent is light, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> , This is a good buy to relax naturally .</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Just received my second order of many more to come!  </li>
            <li> I am pleased so far, and will see after using for a month or more.</li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone who is searching for a pleasant scented essential oil.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than I expected, great customer service.</li>
            <li> Fair left muck in my machine</li>
            <li> This Tranquil blend is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> The oil has a very earthy smell to it, to some people it may be an overwhelming earthy smell</li>
            <li> Not only do I smell good</li>
            <li> The scent is go gentle, I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the patchouli, lavendar/ sandalwood smell, it is really heavenly.</li>
            <li> but I really can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops of this wonderful smelling oil to a carrier oil (either pure argan or sweet apricot) and rub it on my hands and neck just before going to bed.</li>
            <li> it sure beats spending a fortune on perfume,  and it is such a mild clean scent that does not overpower like many perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I have used almost everything to try and help me sleep, and this oil is a great alternative to other sleep aids.</li>
            <li> Like many older people, I sometimes experience days of insomnia.  </li>
            <li> This particular one seems to be a favorite of my clients (and my self).  </li>
            <li> so I have ordered and received several essential oils that I can blend with Lavender so that I can attempt to get a handle on my nerves and this is one product that is an excellent addition to my blends.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy ur life ;)</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the essential oil blend, Tranquil.  </li>
            <li> Seems like every time I try one its my new favorite.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really had time to try this essential oil out yet, but it smells really nice!</li>
            <li> I really like that it&#x27;s strong but not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li> this is my favorite by far!  </li>
            <li> Helps calm me before bed to promote sleep.</li>
            <li> I can say that it works to help calm the nervous system.  </li>
            <li> I use this one along with calm the child oil.</li>
            <li> They really do calm you and put you to sleep.</li>
            <li> However in case you bought it and don&#x27;t like it either, with some drops of rose essential oil</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the aroma</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Both of these also were delivered quicker than expected and in good shape.</li>
            <li> Contrary to what another reviewer said, you DO have to pay more for a really good long lasting oil, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be overwhelming because when I sniffed it gently from the container straight, it was pretty powerful.</li>
            <li> I order several different variations of this line with great results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super floral or fruity, it&#x27;s almost an herbal musky smell, but very &amp;#34;clean.&amp;#34; It makes my bedroom and bathroom smell amazing when I use it in the shower!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very unusual odor.  </li>
            <li> Very, very soothing.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> This is the first oil I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I love this essential oil.</li>
            <li> I joined numerous Facebook groups and read blog after blog to find a company that is reputable and affordable.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really love Plant Therapy&#x27;s Tranquil Synergy Essential Oil.</li>
            <li> I use this oil with my diffuser on a regular basis and love it.</li>
            <li> Not offensive, but not perhaps a first choice for a room fragrance.</li>
            <li> I fought to keep my eyes open :)&lt;</li>
            <li> found.(I also love how low their prices are).</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s a bit of a bite to the scent that is off-putting when I first use it.  </li>
            <li> She needs to relax, but she definitely doesn&#x27;t need to be any more drowsy.  </li>
            <li> I love this combination of essential oils.  </li>
            <li> on my second bottle and have a third one on the way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it to when making lotion bars and everyone who uses it starts yawning and looks incredibly relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing oil blend &amp; I find the scent to be long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the other two&lt;br /&gt;oils - Germ-Fighter and Immune-Aid - will be as effective.  </li>
            <li> Really nice oil, I add it to my cream and wear it during the day and put it directly on my skin at night, it definitely has an earthy but calming smell to it.  </li>
            <li> but I simply cannot afford them any more - these seem to&lt;br /&gt;be the same high quality but more affordable.....</li>
            <li> Not sure it helped as much as I had hoped, but it did provide a pleasant fragrance that was not perfumey, and cancelled out that undefined sickness and antiseptic smell.</li>
            <li> Recently I became more interested in researching and using high quality therapeutic grade oils, like YL.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend any PT essential oils, but this is one of my top favorites.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops to my diffuser and my whole first floor smells lovely!</li>
            <li> For kids, I&#x27;d only add one drop as the scent is a bit strong.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;100% pure, undiluted, and therapeutic\\&quot;, in my estimation.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but for anyone like me new to purchasing blends for use in diffusers because mainstream scented products are bothersome to allergies - one or more ingredients in the blends may trigger an allergic reaction, as these are from actual plants, etc.  </li>
            <li> They are a very high quality, and I will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> i put on diffuser at night with a little lavender oil added and its amazing.</li>
            <li> After a hard day at work it works good with my spa mist.will purchase this product again .</li>
            <li> The Bergamot really comes through.  </li>
            <li> A very relaxing scent for the oil burner.&lt;br /&gt;Adding</li>
            <li> Product was delivered fast and packed well.  </li>
            <li> Fell asleep fast and slept well.  </li>
            <li> Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I find it very helpful at night, used in my diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Very calming.</li>
            <li> When diffused it really does create a &amp;#34;tranquil&amp;#34; atmosphere.</li>
            <li> my husband was fast asleep.</li>
            <li> I just feel as though the scent fades too fast.  </li>
            <li> Every time I use it, I sleep really well.</li>
            <li> I like the aroma of this product and find it has a very calming and soothing affect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I find it very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Also haven&#x27;t had much luck using this to help me fall asleep</li>
            <li> Very relaxing scent.  </li>
            <li> But this EO really grew on me.  </li>
            <li> The patchouli is the scent that lingers, and was never one of my favorites, but it really works well in this.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped my sleep problems - getting to sleep and staying asleep.  </li>
            <li> their other blend that is similar to &amp;#34;thieves&amp;#34; is a good one though..</li>
            <li> I love that I&#x27;m paying for the product alone, as compared to other brands that have inflated prices because they are MLM products.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it works, and other times it&#x27;s just overwhelmingly offending to the nasal passages.  </li>
            <li> other oils I have paid more to get.</li>
            <li> Probably won&#x27;t repurchase but will try other blends from the line because they are reasonably priced and seem good quality (I am new to essential oils).</li>
            <li> People respond to scents in a highly individualized way, so reviews of oil scents may not be of much use to you.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t have a hand in making this particular oil, but he did help with the KidSafe oils and serves as a consultant for Plant Therapy.  </li>
            <li> That shows that this company is striving to do right by their customers by learning as much they can about essential oils and providing quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Someone on a Facebook group highly recommended Tranquil, so</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other brands of essential oils and this one seems to definitely own up to being,</li>
            <li> I also received a very similar oil in the same grab bag and wasn&#x27;t sure which one I wanted to open use right away.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting without overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Even my boys ask to put  a few drops on their pillow at night to sleep better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I put it on my dogs collars, natural flea and tick repellent, smells fantastic and nice</li>
            <li> You do not need much because it is what it says, undiluted so if you use too much of it it is going knock you down with its powerful scent.</li>
            <li> Subtle but nice.</li>
            <li> The problem is that when you are most stressed, you usually don&#x27;t remember to use it.  </li>
            <li> Several weeks ago, I used this blend to make my first batch of CP soap.</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of essential oils over the last 12 years in my massage therapy and yoga practice.  </li>
            <li> Careful pouring, drops come out quickly.</li>
            <li> Not a bad scent, just not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I find that it helps me to unwind and decompress after a busy day.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, despite being listed second on the ingredients list, it does not overpower the Synergy.  </li>
            <li> It smells like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> The Patchouli does remain after time, but is soft.</li>
            <li> Reasonable is the key word</li>
            <li> &quot; so far.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was not as good as the Young Living Oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be able to go through an entire 30ml bottle by myself</li>
            <li> This oil has a strange scent to it - I really can&#x27;t describe it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet and calming, but when you take a sniff, there just seems to be something missing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s an economical solution for those who are high stress and have a hard time falling asleep.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like spending the money, but using this has caused me to decide to only buy Young Living.</li>
            <li> far this is the only Synergy that I have purchased from Plant Therapy</li>
            <li> It smells nearly identical and seems to have all the same healing &amp; theraputic qualities.  </li>
            <li> I have used Young Living essential oils</li>
            <li> I really like it and use it frequently, but something is missing.  </li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so pungent and smells so fresh.  </li>
            <li> I take a lot of daily naps due to current chemo treatment and this really helps.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something a little softer but I still like for certain days.</li>
            <li> A few drops in the tub is exactly what is needed after a long day (stressful or not).</li>
            <li> I have used other oils from this company and love them, but this one is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Sprinkled a few drops on my pillow, added a few drops to room diffuser and applied a drop behind my ears with good results.</li>
            <li> A true relaxing scent to use after a tired day.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Earl Grey tea.  </li>
            <li> smell, lasts a long time, and also has a calming effect on this</li>
            <li> This works well in helping you relax after a long day.  </li>
            <li> She sent an extra by mistake and told me to give the other as a gift.  </li>
            <li> i have been working with essential oils for a long time and have purchased both the most and least expensive ones...  </li>
            <li> That might be because the cap was loose in the package and the oil leaked</li>
            <li> really does seem to have at least a slight calming effect on me.</li>
            <li> I especially like the little instruction sheet that comes with and has suggestions for how to use the oils.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not really helpful with relaxation.</li>
            <li> I ordered Tranquil to replace my nearly empty bottle of YL Peace &amp; Calming.  </li>
            <li> I had expected Lavender</li>
            <li> /&gt;(However, arrived exactly as expected).</li>
            <li> I have mixed a few drops in with coconut oil and use that on my arms and hands in the evening.  </li>
            <li> This brand is not pure.</li>
            <li> I usually get nervous with blends since I am not the one making it to my personal preferences.  </li>
            <li> I like this brand and will buy other scents.</li>
            <li> I was worried the Patchouli would overpower the other scents</li>
            <li> : Because of the combination of oils in this synergy I don&#x27;t think I will use it for making home made lotions and other products.  </li>
            <li> if you  have any other relaxing blends on sale,please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Some of my other favs are germ fighter and pain aid.</li>
            <li> Getting calmed down without pills and other drugs</li>
            <li> Since EOs can go bad after a while I try not to open them until I&#x27;m ready to use them.  </li>
            <li> The mixture puts me to sleep in less than 15 mins.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I put just a little on my pillow to help caress me to sleep at night.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops work</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week before bed.</li>
            <li> Something is missing from this scent...</li>
            <li> But...there&#x27;s just something missing...</li>
            <li> It helps when I diffuse it, and I put a few drops on my pillow with two of lavender.</li>
            <li> (I dab a few drops on my skin and on my pillowcase).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using just a few drops will work for a room.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not really a huge fan of Patchouli.  </li>
            <li> Even the combination essiential oils are not watered down and therefore a small amount can be added to lotions, carrier oils room diffusers etc.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about the Patchouli, since that can be a very heavy fragrence, but it is not overwhelming at all.  </li>
            <li> I like to rub a small drop under my nose it helps gives a boost to your day or evening to tranquil sleep.</li>
            <li> I usually mix with some lotion.</li>
            <li> I rub a small drop of study buddy on my desk lamp bulb.  </li>
            <li> What a relaxer, I diffuse it AND put it on my hubby&#x27;s food at night to help him relax after a hard day at work.</li>
            <li> Not a good buy.</li>
            <li> This smell is almost hypmatyzing (sp sorry)!  </li>
            <li> i think the ratio is off and makes this blend almost unpleasant..  </li>
            <li> It was not relaxing and smelled bad.</li>
            <li> lotion that I could put on before bed or to help me when I&#x27;m having a bad migraine.</li>
            <li> Still bad.</li>
            <li> These gave me a terrible headache!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great aroma. Tranquil is a great name for this product. Calms and relaxes me.</li>
            <li> Fair left muck in my machine</li>
            <li> I did not like the scent of this oil blend. It was not relaxing and smelled bad. I preferred lavender for a relaxing oil.</li>
            <li> Great scent!  Product exactly as described.  Will purchase again.  Recommend to anyone who is searching for a pleasant scented essential oil.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use a combination of the oils every night.</li>
            <li> This is the first oil I have ever tried.  I put 5 drops in my diffuser and I cannot stand the smell.  I gave the oil to a friend of mine that is into oils to see if she liked it.</li>
            <li> Love this brand. The price is great. This Tranquil blend is my absolute favorite. I love the citrus properties.</li>
            <li> The Bergamot really comes through.  Reminds me of Earl Grey tea.  A very relaxing scent for the oil burner.&lt;br /&gt;Adding extra words to appease Amazon!</li>
            <li> I use it mostly in my dorm room and vehicles that I drive. Gives off a nice pleasant odor, wish it would last longer though.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really had time to try this essential oil out yet, but it smells really nice!</li>
            <li> Really nice scent to this blend.  I use it in my diffuser every night.  It is very calming and pleasant.</li>
            <li> This blend of essential oils is wonderful to use after a stressful day at work. I find that it helps me to unwind and decompress after a busy day. The quality is excellent and the price I paid makes this an excellent value. I love that I&#x27;m paying for the product alone, as compared to other brands that have inflated prices because they are MLM products.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Pleasant,calm and relaxing scent-smells great! After a hard day at work it works good with my spa mist.will purchase this product again .</li>
            <li> I thought aromatherapy was poppycock until I had an injury. Now I know it works but not all oils are created equal. However this brand is a essential oil carrier. Even the combination essiential oils are not watered down and therefore a small amount can be added to lotions, carrier oils room diffusers etc. Some of the combo oils are strong but this one I use on pillows to help drift into a relaxing sleep</li>
            <li> I usually get nervous with blends since I am not the one making it to my personal preferences.  Plant Therapy did a wonderful job with this blend.  I have zero complaints with the aroma.  I find this blend to be a perfect aroma to help me unwind from a long day at work.  It helps soothe me enough so I can fall asleep and not have my mind dwelling on the day.</li>
            <li> I have several Plant Therapy essential oils.  Seems like every time I try one its my new favorite.  This one is no exception.  I diffused it at bedtime last night.  The scent was so soft and very pleasant, and I did feel very relaxed/tranquil.  I highly recommend any PT essential oils, but this is one of my top favorites.</li>
            <li> Strong patchouli smell, kids won&#x27;t like it, mine didn&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t know if it work cuz I don&#x27;t use it enough because of the kids.</li>
            <li> These oils are great and I have been very pleased with the customer service. When I had an oil I did not like the smell of they immediately provided me with a refund and had me pass the oil on the a friend who did like the smell.</li>
            <li> I need about 4-5 drops to soak a diffuser pad and the smell does permeate  a 1200 Sq-foot area nicely (using  [[ASIN:B001891JA2 B001891JA2]]  plug-in diffuser).  I like the smell, but for anyone like me new to purchasing blends for use in diffusers because mainstream scented products are bothersome to allergies - one or more ingredients in the blends may trigger an allergic reaction, as these are from actual plants, etc.  I happen to have found out I am allergic to eucalyptus, for example. I like this brand and will buy other scents.</li>
            <li> Really nice oil, I add it to my cream and wear it during the day and put it directly on my skin at night, it definitely has an earthy but calming smell to it.  Well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this blend! I blend it with lavender and cedarwood for a great calming blend. I have a son with autism and I make a rollarball diluted with fractionated coconut oil and use this on the back of his neck twice a day. Helps to keep him calm and sleep better at night.</li>
            <li> Like many older people, I sometimes experience days of insomnia.  I admit to ordering this with some skepticism.  The scent is lovely.  A light spray on the pillow, lights out and close eyes to pleasantly drift into restful sleep.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle - a must have for home and travel~</li>
            <li> ehhhhhhh.  I don&#x27;t like spending the money, but using this has caused me to decide to only buy Young Living.</li>
            <li> I use Plant Therapy Tranquil Synergy Oil at bedtime on the bottom of my feet and on my wrists. I&#x27;ll also often put some on a cotton ball and place it in my pillow case. It does help me relax and sleep better. Great stuff!! And Plant Therapy is an awesome company with super oils!!!</li>
            <li> This product has a earthy smell. You do not need much because it is what it says, undiluted so if you use too much of it it is going knock you down with its powerful scent. I mixed mine in almond oil and added 3 drops to that,placed it on my salt crystal lamp. However if you are not used to essential oil then you&#x27;re probably not going to like it because of how strong it is but trust me, put it in something too diluted and you will love it.</li>
            <li> A few drops in the tub is exactly what is needed after a long day (stressful or not). For kids, I&#x27;d only add one drop as the scent is a bit strong.</li>
            <li> use as aroma therapy on use on my skin once and it discolored me it eventually wore off. I must admit it does not say you can use topically so that was y fault.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered fast and packed well.  And the smell of this blend is wonderful.  I put drops on my pillow every night and it relaxes mind and body - I sleep like a baby.  I&#x27;ve also used it to combat anxiety attacks - works like a charm.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Depending on what you want to use this for, you may or may not like it.  I use it for relaxation at night/bedtime.  Unfortunately this was not as good as the Young Living Oil i have always bought.  While the scent is pleasing, it is thinner and does not last - I will go back to YL after this is gone.  Contrary to what another reviewer said, you DO have to pay more for a really good long lasting oil, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Smells like cough syrup... And it&#x27;s not really helpful with relaxation. However in case you bought it and don&#x27;t like it either, with some drops of rose essential oil the smell can be a lot BETTER.</li>
            <li> Upon purchasing this I had never used or bought any essential oils before. I was wanting something to add to my lotions to make a &amp;#34;soothing, calming&amp;#34; lotion that I could put on before bed or to help me when I&#x27;m having a bad migraine. I love this essential oil. It&#x27;s perfect for what I wanted it for. I would definitely recommend &amp; purchase again.</li>
            <li> I just started trying out essential oils....this is my favorite by far!  I just ordered the 30 ml size to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> It would be a bit too strong to wear on it&#x27;s own, I mixed 3 drops with a 1/4 cup of coconut oil and use it as lotion. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Relaxing. Subtle but nice.</li>
            <li> This smell is almost hypmatyzing (sp sorry)!  Long lasting without overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Helps calm me before bed to promote sleep. I&#x27;m on my second bottle. I would try it if you have insomnia.</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with this oil. Just a few drops to my diffuser and my whole first floor smells lovely! Great product and great price!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I put it in my diffuser and run it during the evening. I have a diffuser for me car also and use it in there. I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> I have someone using this for anxiety attacks, and hope for great results. Thank you, Plant Therapy, your oils are really lovely.</li>
            <li> I love the oil scents to include the Tranquil Synergy Essentil Oil Blend. It really does improve your moods and great to add to a warm bath water for this fall and winter season. I like to rub a small drop under my nose it helps gives a boost to your day or evening to tranquil sleep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice oil, but I found the smell a bit overwhelming. That might be because the cap was loose in the package and the oil leaked so I got a good dose of it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell at all. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but this would not make me feel tranquil.</li>
            <li> love this company and products, very affordable and prompt free shipping cannot beat it!!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something a little softer but I still like for certain days. I usually mix with some lotion. I prefer lavender so I will not be purchasing this scent again.</li>
            <li> What a great blend.  Diffused this and also mixed with coconut oil and applied to my feet.  Fell asleep fast and slept well.  Just as I hoped.  Arrived sooner than I expected, great customer service.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and I think it works. I cannot prove it, but I feel much better and calm with this blend.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so pungent and smells so fresh.  I use this to make bath salts as well as a soothing spray for my bed linens.  Just a few drops work, so I feel this is a good value.  The package arrived very quickly and the item was well packaged.  Definitely on my reorder list!</li>
            <li> This brand is not pure. These gave me a terrible headache!</li>
            <li> Very effective.  Sprinkled a few drops on my pillow, added a few drops to room diffuser and applied a drop behind my ears with good results.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent. I use it in an oil burner and the house smells like a Spa. Very relaxing. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product, very good quality of oils.  Most of my oils are Plant Therapy now.  The prices are great and the quality of the oils are very good.  My kids ask for the Relax oil every night before bed, they are sleeping much better and fall asleep more quickly.  I prefer the scent of this oil, it calms and relaxes me.  I use it a few times a week before bed.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a room diffuser.  I thought this was going to be overwhelming because when I sniffed it gently from the container straight, it was pretty powerful. But in the diffuser, it is a nice scent. The patchouli notes are a bit strong, and can overwhelm the lavender, a scent I prefer. Probably won&#x27;t repurchase but will try other blends from the line because they are reasonably priced and seem good quality (I am new to essential oils).</li>
            <li> My order of two ( tranquil and meditation) arrived in time for me for use while my mother was in hospice. Not sure it helped as much as I had hoped, but it did provide a pleasant fragrance that was not perfumey, and cancelled out that undefined sickness and antiseptic smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using Essential Oils for cleaners and soap making for years, but only recently got into the therapeutic benefits of essential oils. I joined numerous Facebook groups and read blog after blog to find a company that is reputable and affordable.  My search brought me to Plant Therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, their relationship with Robert Tisserand is one I greatly respect and was the #1 reason I chose this company to purchase oils from.  He didn&#x27;t have a hand in making this particular oil, but he did help with the KidSafe oils and serves as a consultant for Plant Therapy.  That shows that this company is striving to do right by their customers by learning as much they can about essential oils and providing quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto the Tranquil Synergy review!  I received a 30 ml bottle of Tranquil in a &amp;#34;Grab Bag&amp;#34; purchase I made last month.  I also received a very similar oil in the same grab bag and wasn&#x27;t sure which one I wanted to open use right away.  Since EOs can go bad after a while I try not to open them until I&#x27;m ready to use them.  Someone on a Facebook group highly recommended Tranquil, so I decided to try this out first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: I am very impressed.  It has a very pleasant, mellow smell.  I was worried the Patchouli would overpower the other scents and I&#x27;m not really a huge fan of Patchouli.  Much to my surprise, despite being listed second on the ingredients list, it does not overpower the Synergy.  I diffused this for about 20 minutes and found the Bergamot and Blood Orange to have the dominant smell after the diffuser was turned off.  I really like that it&#x27;s strong but not too overpowering.  Five drops in my diffuser was all I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses: Because of the combination of oils in this synergy I don&#x27;t think I will use it for making home made lotions and other products.  I like to keep those simple and only use two or three oils.  But for diffusing and diluted for topical use, it&#x27;s a great oil!  I also love using it in my aroma pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this is the only Synergy that I have purchased from Plant Therapy and I am very pleased.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be able to go through an entire 30ml bottle by myself so I have shared some with my mom and she says it&#x27;s become her favorite synergy to use in her diffuser.</li>
            <li> Yes it was great to use with my diffuser for therapy and relaxation.&lt;br /&gt; if you  have any other relaxing blends on sale,please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I find it very helpful at night, used in my diffuser.  Love to even just smell from the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the best there is in my opinion. I take a lot of daily naps due to current chemo treatment and this really helps. I absolutely love the smell of it and will be ordering more of it from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> I am conflicted about this oil blend.  Sometimes it works, and other times it&#x27;s just overwhelmingly offending to the nasal passages.  It does help a lot in promoting relaxation and tranquility. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love putting the oil into my humidifier and having it fill the house. The oil has a very earthy smell to it, to some people it may be an overwhelming earthy smell however I personally love the scent. I do find the oil to be calming and I like to use it at night when I sleep.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the aroma</li>
            <li> I really love Plant Therapy&#x27;s Tranquil Synergy Essential Oil. Sometimes I put just a little on my pillow to help caress me to sleep at night. It is also great for the bath. One drop on the pillow--two or three in the bath--that&#x27;s all it takes. I also have a wood burning stove, so at times, when nobody is home, I&#x27;ll put a couple of drops in our cast iron vaporizer to subtlety scent the room.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very unusual odor.  I can say that it works to help calm the nervous system.  The problem is that when you are most stressed, you usually don&#x27;t remember to use it.  Doh!  Yes, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, but this is very very watery. It pours out of the bottle instead of dropping. I wish I could choose over. Not a good buy. The same thing happened with the patchouli that I purchased from the same brand. Dont buy this brand.  ***UPDATE***  Turns out that the stopper is different than what I am used to. It is not the quality of the oil, but the different stopper. Other than that, this is great! Smells great, great price, great sellers.</li>
            <li> Several weeks ago, I used this blend to make my first batch of CP soap. Today I brought some samples in to work to see what people think. They LOVE the smell. Even the men! It&#x27;s not super floral or fruity, it&#x27;s almost an herbal musky smell, but very &amp;#34;clean.&amp;#34; It makes my bedroom and bathroom smell amazing when I use it in the shower!</li>
            <li> Awesome synergy blend from Plant Therapy!!!  Smells just like described!</li>
            <li> Thus is my favorite oil so far,  the packaging was good, it came quickly and I like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this blend! I like to make a misting spray with it and spray my room and pillows before bed.</li>
            <li> I love this. Wonderful mix and smells terrific. Very calming.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  I put a dab on my pillow and it definitely is relaxing to the senses and puts me to sleep.  I&#x27;ve purchased other brands of essential oils and this one seems to definitely own up to being, \\&quot;100% pure, undiluted, and therapeutic\\&quot;, in my estimation.</li>
            <li> Something is missing from this scent...I really like it and use it frequently, but something is missing.  It&#x27;s sweet and calming, but when you take a sniff, there just seems to be something missing.  Can&#x27;t pinpoint it.  It&#x27;s not enough to make me stop using it.  But...there&#x27;s just something missing...</li>
            <li> This blend is wonderful.  I put it in the diffuser, absolutely love the citrus and spice profile.</li>
            <li> I combine Tranquil Synergy with Relax Synergy by putting about 4 or so drops of each in the palm of my hand and then applying it over my face, neck, and wrists to get it off of my palm.  Combined with Nature&#x27;s Gate Pomegranate Sunflower lotion on the rest of me,  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve heard the comment,  \\&quot;You smell awesome!  What are you wearing?\\&quot; from family members and strangers alike.  Not only do I smell good but I do believe it has a calming effect on me,  and it sure beats spending a fortune on perfume,  and it is such a mild clean scent that does not overpower like many perfumes.  My husband who has a sensitive nose and is not much of a perfume guy loves it.</li>
            <li> It smells like old lady perfume. It so strong and overwhelming. I have used other oils from this company and love them, but this one is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> This blend is wonderful and I use it on myself as well as the grandbaby when it is time to settle down for the night.  Love this blend, great scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is go gentle, I love it. I drab a drop or two on my linens, and sometimes on my wrists; it&#x27;s such a beautiful scent to go to sleep by. Patchouli is one of my favorite scents, and I like this blend.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I am pleased with this product over all. When diffused it really does create a &amp;#34;tranquil&amp;#34; atmosphere. The scent is pleasant, not too strong.</li>
            <li> I use this oil with my diffuser on a regular basis and love it. The smell is wonderful without being over powering. I use it for me as well as the kids. Many time I will use it while taking a bath right before bedtime! Will order more once I am out! I use this one along with calm the child oil. Love them both and they mox well!</li>
            <li> This oil has a strange scent to it - I really can&#x27;t describe it. It&#x27;s not bad (not at all!), but it does have a bit of a head shop type smell to it. Not offensive, but not perhaps a first choice for a room fragrance. BUT, amazingly enough adding this oil to a diffuser creates an almost instant relaxation / sleepiness! It&#x27;s in our bedroom, and within an hour my husband was fast asleep. I fought to keep my eyes open :)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an economical solution for those who are high stress and have a hard time falling asleep. I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second bottle and have a third one on the way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it to when making lotion bars and everyone who uses it starts yawning and looks incredibly relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing oil blend &amp; I find the scent to be long lasting.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, smelling this from time to time really does seem to have at least a slight calming effect on me.</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of essential oils over the last 12 years in my massage therapy and yoga practice.  Recently I became more interested in researching and using high quality therapeutic grade oils, like YL.  After using the Plant Therapy Essential Oils now for about six months I can say I am very pleased with every one of them that I&#x27;ve tried and feel that they are of excellent quality. This particular one seems to be a favorite of my clients (and my self).  Just received my second order of many more to come!  Thanks to the many excellent reviews of Plant Therapy Essential Oils on this page that helped me in choosing them.  I and my clients are so happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;Ps. Some of my other favs are germ fighter and pain aid. I now use sensual as my perfume and my husband Loves it! :)</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, I use this in my laundry and our clothes always smell fresh, clean and &#x27;herby&#x27; Love it.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive the Tranquil Synergy Essential Oil Blend and even happier once I ran it in my diffuser!  The scent was not overpowering or stringent in any way.  Perfect scent to fill my workspace while I worked on an art project. Thank yoU!!!</li>
            <li> What a relaxer, I diffuse it AND put it on my hubby&#x27;s food at night to help him relax after a hard day at work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several of these oils, wish the scent would last longer - but I love this scent the best of all I&#x27;ve tried.  I add drops to my regular body lotion after a shower &amp; it feels/ smells great.  I just feel as though the scent fades too fast.  Love the patchouli, lavendar/ sandalwood smell, it is really heavenly.</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops of this wonderful smelling oil to a carrier oil (either pure argan or sweet apricot) and rub it on my hands and neck just before going to bed. Every time I use it, I sleep really well.</li>
            <li> I have used almost everything to try and help me sleep, and this oil is a great alternative to other sleep aids. I have tried other oils, and this is the best I have found.(I also love how low their prices are). They are a very high quality, and I will buy from them again. Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> Nice oil, but there&#x27;s a bit of a bite to the scent that is off-putting when I first use it.  Probably that bite leads to the tranquility.  Who knows.  I like it.  Nice transaction with the shipper.  She sent an extra by mistake and told me to give the other as a gift.  Her gift to me.</li>
            <li> I find this combination very pleasant. It is definitely comforting to have on the body or in the air. The Ylang Ylang is present but not obnoxious. The Patchouli does remain after time, but is soft. I massaged my dad&#x27;s feet with this, then put his socks back on. The smell was in the socks but oh so nice. I got two bottles and would give as a gift.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with the quality of this oil. It helps when I diffuse it, and I put a few drops on my pillow with two of lavender. Very, very soothing.</li>
            <li> I ordered Tranquil to replace my nearly empty bottle of YL Peace &amp; Calming.  It smells nearly identical and seems to have all the same healing &amp; theraputic qualities.  Easy on the budget too!  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I like the aroma of this product and find it has a very calming and soothing affect.&lt;br /&gt;I would definately purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product! Smells great.. I had expected Lavender but it&#x27;s not in there. Easy to use...nice to smell!!</li>
            <li> high quality and smells great. Cant beat the price and they are great to work with. definately buy this product.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice blend.  I was a little concerned about the Patchouli, since that can be a very heavy fragrence, but it is not overwhelming at all.  I keep it on my desk and and take a whiff from the bottle when my day starts getting to me.  I find it very relaxing.</li>
            <li> This brand is phenomenal. Very potent and pure. I order several different variations of this line with great results. I use it on myself and my dogs</li>
            <li> I have a problems with my nerves.  Getting calmed down without pills and other drugs so I have ordered and received several essential oils that I can blend with Lavender so that I can attempt to get a handle on my nerves and this is one product that is an excellent addition to my blends.  I love their prices too.  Reasonable is the key word and I cannot tell the difference in this and other oils I have paid more to get.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful...not too strong and very clean and fresh. It is a good value for the price...you only need a drop or two. I will buy more of this oil.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Even my boys ask to put  a few drops on their pillow at night to sleep better. Works great to relieve tension at work, home, school. I love the smell also, This is a good buy to relax naturally .</li>
            <li> This blend smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Will order again. Fast shipping good price.</li>
            <li> I gave this product as a gift for a friend who is experiencing some medical problems.  She needs to relax, but she definitely doesn&#x27;t need to be any more drowsy.  She loves patchouli, and I thought, with the combo of citrus, it would relax and perk her up some.  She loved it!  I also purchased study buddy for myself, and it helps me to not be sleepy when I read (I attend U of Iowa online.)It&#x27;s a great alternative to caffeine or energy drinks.  I especially like the little instruction sheet that comes with and has suggestions for how to use the oils.  I rub a small drop of study buddy on my desk lamp bulb.  Both of these also were delivered quicker than expected and in good shape. I definitely recommend this seller.  This was an Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> This oil smells wonderful! I also like the plug on the top, as it assists in being able to add the desired amount of drops.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t sleep without this one and the relax scent! They really do calm you and put you to sleep. Love it</li>
            <li> i have been working with essential oils for a long time and have purchased both the most and least expensive ones...  this blend was not pleasing to my nose at all..  i think the ratio is off and makes this blend almost unpleasant..  their other blend that is similar to &amp;#34;thieves&amp;#34; is a good one though..</li>
            <li> speedy shipping, great product, smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product and it smells good. Make ur room , find the best thoughrs in ur mind, put a few drops of oil and invite the person u like. Enjoy ur life ;)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I put it on my dogs collars, natural flea and tick repellent, smells fantastic and nice&lt;br /&gt;woodsy smell, lasts a long time, and also has a calming effect on this, it&#x27;s a win win for me and the dogs.&lt;br /&gt;makes me want to hug them more.</li>
            <li> No cons. This scent is great!  A true relaxing scent to use after a tired day. I do mix this with Relax synergy essential oil blend at bedtime. All I say is, &amp;#34;good rest&amp;#34;. The mixture puts me to sleep in less than 15 mins. Hope they have the big bottles of both kinds when I reorder.</li>
            <li> Scent seems heavier on the patchouli/ylang ylang front versus citrusy notes. Not a bad scent, just not exactly what I was looking for. Also haven&#x27;t had much luck using this to help me fall asleep (I dab a few drops on my skin and on my pillowcase).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(However, arrived exactly as expected).</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the essential oil blend, Tranquil.  It smells wonderful and lives up&lt;br /&gt;to its name.  Very relaxing scent.  I will order it again.[[ASIN:B005VSXU30 Tranquil Synergy Essential Oil Blend. 10 ml. 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade. (Blend of: Bergamot, Patchouli, Blood Orange, Ylang Ylang and Grapefruit)]]</li>
            <li> this is awesome. i put on diffuser at night with a little lavender oil added and its amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this combination of essential oils.  It has a tranquil affect.  The scent is light, not overpowering. Careful pouring, drops come out quickly.</li>
            <li> But this EO really grew on me.  The patchouli is the scent that lingers, and was never one of my favorites, but it really works well in this.  I have used in in body butter and it is AMAZING!  I do think it has helped my sleep as well but I really can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li> I love your products, and will continue to use them. I do not know for sure yet how this effects me, as I have so many issues. I am pleased so far, and will see after using for a month or more. Thanks you for your caring and great business efforts!</li>
            <li> I purchased three Synergy Oils but have only used \\&quot;Tranquil\\&quot; so far.  I use it at night - rub it on my feet and temples - plus inhale.  It has really helped my sleep problems - getting to sleep and staying asleep.  I&#x27;m hoping the other two&lt;br /&gt;oils - Germ-Fighter and Immune-Aid - will be as effective.  Order was received in a timely fashion and I think this is&lt;br /&gt;a reputable company.  I have used Young Living essential oils but I simply cannot afford them any more - these seem to&lt;br /&gt;be the same high quality but more affordable.....hence 5 STARS!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great item, great price.  This works well in helping you relax after a long day.  Using just a few drops will work for a room.</li>
            <li> This is a soothing, pleasant synergy which I like. I have mixed a few drops in with coconut oil and use that on my arms and hands in the evening.  People respond to scents in a highly individualized way, so reviews of oil scents may not be of much use to you.</li>
            <li> When I read the description of oil scents that were used it sounded very nice. When I received the oils in the mail and opened them (I bought three different ones) I found all of them offensive. I tried putting a drop on a paper and letting it sit, thinking it just needed to air. Still bad. So, I diluted each one, which helped, but I was imagining scents of different things that I would never want to smell on purpose. Maybe it&#x27;s my nose and someone else might think they&#x27;re wonderful, but I won&#x27;t be using them.</li>
