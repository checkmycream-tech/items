            <li>I love these for my purse and for traveling.</li>
            <li>I would buy many, so would many people I talk to.</li>
            <li>I love Estee Lauder products...</li>
            <li>These were all great samples and my wife really like them.  </li>
            <li>Love them all.</li>
            <li>the packaging is lovely and the scents are divine.</li>
            <li>I love this collectipn of Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li>The sizes are great to carry in purse not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I did because I do dislike one of the fragrances --- puts me in mind of my old Granny...</li>
            <li>Practical and easy to carry on...LOVE IT....</li>
            <li>I also liked the pure whtie linen one too</li>
            <li>it was a floral fragrance but not annoying at all, it smells like fresh flower bouquet.  </li>
            <li>These do not smell to me like the real scents, which I have purchased many times.</li>
            <li>I usually buy these travel sets in the duty free or on airplanes and they have always been great.</li>
            <li>Just right for travel.</li>
            <li>Especially if each one is your favorite..</li>
            <li>I had only unused Beuteful love them all</li>
            <li>I would return it, but foolishly I threw away the packaging when I put the bottles (which look authentic enough) in my medicine cabinet, so</li>
            <li>-thanks!</li>
            <li>It smells so pretty.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find this one on Amazon, but my advice is do not waste your money here.</li>
            <li>I just wished Estee Lauder would sell a Minature Collection with Spellbound, Cinnabar, Youth Due, White Linen, Private Collection Amber, this would be AWESOME.</li>
            <li>Of course, Amazon makes delivery to out-of-state friends so much easier.</li>
            <li>Really like this as a gift.</li>
            <li>I gave this as a gift and the person seemed to enjoy the different fragrances.</li>
            <li>My mother in law loves perfume, and with this she got 5 new ones!</li>
            <li>Much better than one big bottle of the same cologne.</li>
            <li>Cute little boxed set of EL fragrances.  </li>
            <li>It is a very complete set of perfumes...</li>
            <li>Your indeed worth every single spray</li>
            <li>this way, for the same amount of money as one large bottle, my friends have an option of scents to spritz on themselves.</li>
            <li>I really like every one of the fragrances, especially the Pure White Linen.</li>
            <li>Classy mixture of perfume  scents.</li>
            <li>I do not know whether they are not the real thing, or maybe old and just smell differently now, but either way they are a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li>She was so excited to get them that she immediately opened the bag up and tried a few (one on one wrist, another on the other, etc.)</li>

            <li> I liked the pleasures bloom it does smell like Miracle by lanccome.  I also liked the pure whtie linen one too it was a floral fragrance but not annoying at all, it smells like fresh flower bouquet.  My least favorite was the Pleasures it is too floral and green for me so I gave it to my sister and she likes that perfume.  The sizes are great to carry in purse not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Mom loved these travel sized fragrances!  Great gift to allow someone to find the specific scent they love the best!</li>

Also, I like that each bottle only has a little perfume, as I find so much gets wasted in the bigger bottles. this way, for the same amount of money as one large bottle, my friends have an option of scents to spritz on themselves.

            <li> I love these for my purse and for traveling. I don&#x27;t have to take my big bottles from my home. I can use these travel purse sprays. I just wished Estee Lauder would sell a Minature Collection with Spellbound, Cinnabar, Youth Due, White Linen, Private Collection Amber, this would be AWESOME.
