            <li>Nice staff.</li>
            <li>I loved them when I saw them, but when I used them some of them faded the color so you can not notice then on the nail, I tried again and the way to try to keep the color is just to place a drop of top coat ever it</li>
            <li>are so nice</li>
            <li>For what she tells me it is a really nice addition to her nail decoration</li>

            <li>The quality is so nice for the price.</li>
            <li>The spinning wheel provides a nice storage.</li>
            <li>I can not wait to see the amazing nail art that my daughter and I can create using all this fun nail stuff!!!</li>
            <li>Beautiful, organized, and exactly what I wanted!</li>

            <li>but the pearls are good :) :)</li>
            <li>The wheel it comes in is good and is easy to access pearls.</li>
            <li>but they came in good condition and were a perfect white color</li>
            <li>the pearls got here quickly and look great.</li>
            <li>Really do love! :)</li>
            <li>These are very pretty and a great addition to my Nail Art decorations.  </li>

            <li>I love them, very stylish &amp; cute.</li>
            <li>But they were happy to make it right.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll snag or come off easily!</li>
            <li>These are nice, I probably wouldn&#x27;t order them again mostly based on they lose shiny luster if you use a top coat.</li>
            <li>I am starting my own business and these were great!</li>
            <li>These are super cute and im sure will look great on a mani.</li>
            <li>this is the first purchase I have not been happy with.</li>
            <li>Besides that incident, everything is fine!</li>

            <li>and they are so cute</li>
            <li>Although I am very happy with the product I thought the wheel would be a lot bigger than what it is.</li>

            <li>I love the variety of sizes.  </li>
            <li>I have used these to create elegant designs.  </li>

            <li>so I guess I will repurchase to get more.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li>They kept sticking to top of wheel</li>
            <li>but I already love them.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I love pearls.</li>
            <li>Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
            <li>However I can still use them and I do recommend them if you&#x27;re ok with not having so many...</li>

            <li>but they are cute...</li>
            <li>i love them on my nailt and my phone cases</li>
            <li>I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have tweezers to pick the gems up.</li>
            <li>But I guess that&#x27;s ok because I think they shipped from Hong Kong</li>
            <li>I use this product the most but dislike that they are like all unorganized</li>
            <li>I need more.</li>
            <li>love them</li>
            <li>Such a great deal for the money!</li>
            <li>I love then</li>
            <li>love them love the wheels there in</li>
            <li>it was a great deal and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>i really love it ..</li>
            <li>I put them on when I do my gel manicures and love the look.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re smaller than the picture, but I think they&#x27;re perfect</li>
            <li>It was cute but it was ok</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s okay since I paid like 20 something cents for these plus shipping they equaled about a dollar.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re still cute, and I can still use it to decorate.</li>
            <li>I love how they look on my nails.</li>
            <li>I will probably order more soon.</li>
            <li>Pleased.</li>
            <li>They are so cute and sophisticated looking.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I love these pearls, they come in a variety of sizes.  </li>
            <li>However, I had hoped to use them for more of a craft supply, in card making.</li>
            <li>I love these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>im satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>the pic makes it look like there is alot more than there is, but it might just be because they were kinda piled up on eachother</li>
            <li>Sizes aren&#x27;t that variant, but I like them :)</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>One side of the beads is flat so it rests perfectly on your nail.  </li>
            <li>The backs are flat and they will be perfect for wedding nails.</li>
            <li>The items are very good in the variety of sizes but the pearl paint comes off rather easy even if putting a protective clear coat on top.</li>
            <li>These pearls are beautiful and and a touch of elegance when you want something more classy.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be larger, however they are very cute and work great.  </li>
            <li>Super cute!</li>
            <li>I would recommend these for weddings or prom super cute and the price cant be beat!</li>
            <li>The pearls are easy to put on using either nail glue or setting into the nail polish and you can choose what size is the most appropriate for whatever occasion you need</li>
            <li>I like the assortment of sizes, they&#x27;re pretty good if you&#x27;re a beginner nail artist</li>
            <li>Excited to get playing around!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be there on time that&#x27;s a good thing I will buy more thanks bye</li>
            <li>These pearls are awesome because of the flat back, its very easy to use while placing on anyones nails.&lt;br /&gt;Def a most buy!!</li>
            <li>They are pretty good for the price, but the color quickly comes off and they get damaged very easily.</li>
            <li>I decorated my iPod case with some of these, Among other things, they looked nice, Love how they look, the size is good, and there is so many!</li>
            <li>but I am fine with that considering the price :)</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, they are perfect for my crafts, especially card-making so I will still be able to use them.  </li>
            <li>these flat- back pearls are beautiful, very dainty design.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, and there is so many sizes and such.</li>
            <li>BUT they were pretty cheap and they had a good variety of sizes</li>
            <li>pshh better give me something free or something.</li>
            <li>Arrive early, same that I buy, good price, good quality, good package.</li>
            <li>Excellent, it came earlier than expected and it looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>exactly as described thought there would be more but its okay because it was cheaoer then most</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to glue them on nails.</li>
            <li>I would definetely get this again when I don&#x27;t have any more left lol</li>
            <li>and they fall off easily but</li>
            <li>I like that there are many different sizes - Great for people with all lengths of nails.</li>
            <li>They arrived before schedule and in a spinning wheel for easy storage,i always like that.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li>I received my product very quickly.</li>
            <li>3) they stick to your hands.... veryyy easy.</li>
            <li>The product gets here very quickly and everything is just as they say/describe.</li>
            <li>Although they took a while to arrive from Asia (I believe they came from Hong Kong), the product is as described and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I received them VERY quickly (the estimated arrival was Feb 13 to Feb 21</li>
            <li>The pencil makes bead/pearl placement so easy.</li>
            <li>It also came very quickly.</li>
            <li>The size is nice but the color is just too yellowish and the packaging was not the good some of my pearls were outside their container</li>
            <li>I love that there are different sizes of pearls and look very nice on the nails to get a 3d effect .</li>
            <li>i was expecting more than what came .Other than that they were cool on my finger nails.</li>
            <li>I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
            <li>They are super easy to use and to apply them i always put on top coat</li>
            <li>but I think they&#x27;ll turn out fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my order :)</li>
            <li>I love my pearls and they&#x27;re at such an amazing price!</li>
            <li>Besides that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>These are fine for the purpose they were made for, I guess.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re cute and super chic.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!  </li>
            <li>yeah is super cute</li>
            <li>cute but need to apply with super glue or nail glue</li>
            <li>I recommend applying them with gel super glue to your gel nail polish BEFORE curing then applying the top coat for added strength.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and stylish.</li>
            <li>They came so much sooner than the estimated date, I love when that happens!</li>
            <li>the assortment is fine, and the product doesnt look cheap, cant wait to use them</li>
            <li>A nice addition to my large manicure product collection.</li>

            <li>you should really get it !!:)</li>
            <li>there are an assortment of sizes to create different looks and they all look very cute!</li>
            <li>If you are expecting a huge container, you are mistaken.</li>
            <li>more bright white like the name says.</li>
            <li>Cheap, pearl coated plastic,  not at all shiney</li>
            <li>just because I did 4 fingers and filled them all the way up or what</li>
            <li>They are a bit cheap looking but</li>
            <li>the price was cheap and that&#x27;s what this is, CHEAP.</li>
            <li>They are really cheap plastic</li>

            <li>They were so cheaply made.</li>
            <li>All at a CHEAP price.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>While I do not know how many are in this wheel, for the price, it is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy nail art and bought these beads on a whim.</li>
            <li>but what  ever they were cheap.  </li>
            <li>Overall happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>cheap quality.</li>
            <li>Other that, they are very pretty and excellent deal for the price.</li>
            <li>But these are nice, and the flat back is perfect for nail art.</li>
            <li>The price is right , will be ordering more .</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t need them right away, because they took a while to arrive.  </li>
            <li>No odd shapes, all good rounds, and flatbacked for nail application.</li>
            <li>The case is very useful.</li>
            <li>there pretty but not at all happy with how many where in the pack definitely not what it says or shows !</li>
            <li>I got the item on the expected date and the item is in a good confition just like how it look in the image!</li>

            <li>I like the pearls and tht sizes just really wish there were more of them and</li>
            <li>so they dont need a big container and its a good deal.</li>
            <li>It was good but the wheel is smaller.</li>
            <li>If not they need to change the picture that they have displayed and put up the true picture of what is being sent out.</li>
            <li>But they look cool</li>
            <li>I think that if you have a purpose in mind, then you should buy them because they are good quality for a very low price.</li>

            <li>I love the different sizes available and the spinner is a lot easier to spin than most</li>

            <li>They&#x27;re a good size, but they are all the same size.</li>
            <li>Received wheel that was not as full as the photos dispect.</li>
            <li>ordering didn&#x27;t really kno what to expect, but I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>but I thought it would be full</li>
            <li>The picture make it look like its full</li>
            <li>and there is a good amount in each of them, especially since there is 3 sizes</li>
            <li>Over all, not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>pretty, fairly easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Pretty easy to get to stay on.</li>
            <li>I love love love these so much that I&#x27;m actually considering using pearls from now on instead of stones.</li>
            <li>It certainly didnt have as many as showed but for the price it is worth it.</li>
            <li>The other rows will probably work great for nails which is the reason I purchased them.</li>
            <li>I loved that their flat bottoms..</li>
            <li>The pearls themselves are great, easy to apply (you can even just use a top coat) and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Got the pearls not as many as the picture showed but a decent amount  </li>
            <li>SUPER PRETY</li>
            <li>There is only a tiny amount of them but what do you expect with the great price?!!!</li>
            <li>I love the different sizes which gives me more chances to change up my creaativity.</li>
            <li>sure I will be ordering more, from this company sometime in the future.</li>
            <li>Amazed at their beauty, the quality and super fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>they come off easily, but they&#x27;re worth the price if your looking for something to easily make your nails a little more glam!</li>
            <li>and I guess its a pretty good deal especially for the price</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!  </li>
            <li>There is foam pieces in each compartment so it makes it appear fuller than it really is!!</li>
            <li>Soo pretty!</li>
            <li>They are so pretty!</li>
            <li>These pearls are fun to work with, easy to install, and cute to look at with different colors on nails.</li>
            <li>Although the wheel could have been bigger and had more pearls in it, it was still an amazing deal and it came VERY early.</li>
            <li>I think these little pearls are a GREAT touch to my nails.</li>
            <li>The whole container can fit in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li>These were extremely cheap (inexpensive) but quite high quality!</li>
            <li>Took couple weeks to get but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>It may take a couple of weeks to get to you, but it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li>So worth the money</li>
            <li>And they were kind  mixed up when i opened them.</li>
            <li>These are worth every penny you spend</li>
            <li>but well worth the time.</li>
            <li>I added these to some assorted craft fun like phone cases, costumes and rings.</li>
            <li>and so far it cute when I try it on my daughter nail</li>
            <li>a lot smaller than i expected but still very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Durable and cute for the price, I love all of the different sizes, and i love that even though they were in a wheel they were not all mixed up.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait if you have time.  </li>
            <li>I am having fun with these cuties.  </li>
            <li>Comes in different sizes and they are surprisingly cheap &amp; elegant.</li>
            <li>The beads came way before the expected date and in good condition.</li>
            <li>So fun to use and nails</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to those who like to have fun with their nails.</li>
            <li>I use these for fun accents to my makeup.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are a lot of fun to play with.  </li>
            <li>but I guess it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>Good thing was that I got it before the expected date.</li>
            <li>Nice nail art with various rhinestones.</li>
            <li>so far, i have done many designs for spring and winter.</li>
            <li>its from out of the country, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I even could count how many tiny cheap pearls they got me.</li>
            <li>I guess they were worth it</li>
            <li>Although well worth it for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>so worth the cost, &amp; the wait,</li>
            <li>Def worth the money.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the buy.</li>
            <li>These are so fun for using on my nails</li>
            <li>and after is dry apply the real top coat to the whole nail.</li>
            <li>They are nice, you don&#x27;t get too many of the bigger, more usable sizes, the little tiny ones are microscopic (which could be good for very intricate nail art)</li>
            <li>Other than that there good.</li>
            <li>i got its on the right estimated date</li>
            <li>the price was right too.</li>
            <li>They come in a variety of sizes and can be used for practically anything and everything with the right glue.</li>
            <li>it came right on time.</li>
            <li>Love them and was super surprised at the fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>very easy to use, add beauty to regular nails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s due to static or something like that</li>
            <li>The quality of pearls are as expected for the price, on the third day the top iridescent layer came out on most pearls even though I covered them with CND brisa lite top coat.</li>
            <li>But next time I think I&#x27;ll just order the large size pearls, as I use these for embellishments on everything BUT nails :) the small ones would be perfect for nails tho, add dimension and texture that&#x27;s not so large</li>
            <li>this are so small they will look great on the nails.</li>
            <li>package is small but makes it great for storage.</li>
            <li>Pearls arrived earlier than expected, almost 2 weeks before and since it was free shipping, it was a great deal for the price.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take too long to arrive and the pearls look nice.</li>
            <li>I love these, they make for cute little designs on my nails.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I expected, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Came super fast.</li>
            <li>Lucky they did not cost much at all.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet, I KNOW they will work great because I bought a similar product that works just the same.</li>
            <li>most are chipped, the plastic container turns and you open one section at a time, unfortunately the plastic rubbing on the plastic creates static and since the pieces themselves are a light plastic, it is ridiculously easy to lose many at a time.</li>
            <li>It also shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>the different shapes makes it much more fun to do junk nails (which is street way of saying decorative or fancy nails with jems and other cute things)!</li>
            <li>But i don&#x27;t like it very much on my finger nails, because after working on  the job or around the house they fall off.</li>
            <li>Also very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love the different sized pearls &amp; the flat side makes it very easy to put on your nails.</li>
            <li>but they were good for a little girl&#x27;s nail set</li>
            <li>Loved the wheel of little pearls.  </li>
            <li>It is also SUPER easy to open unlike cheeky!</li>
            <li>Not very many in each side but for the price, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Got it very fast wish the wheel was bigger and had more pearls</li>
            <li>Also pretty</li>
            <li>the color was exactly what they say it is ...</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I received exactly what picture showed.</li>
            <li>I love how they have different sizes.</li>
            <li>These are adorable, but I thought they would be slightly bigger in size.  </li>
            <li>but it probably will cost more to send it back then to keep it.  </li>
            <li>It you can pick them up and get them on your nails they are pretty.</li>
            <li>And they look so pretty in the container</li>
            <li>They are cute, and there are different sizes.</li>
            <li>You can not use them more than once they are for one time use only.</li>
            <li>They worked on my nails really well!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more later on when I need more..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok I would buy again only reason I give four stars</li>
            <li>better to go to a nail store and actually see in person what you are getting.</li>
            <li>they are perfect for nails or glueing on random things.  </li>
            <li>Love that I have a variety of sizes and they&#x27;re so pretty and simple.</li>
            <li>Love the different sizes and the ease of applying to my nails.  </li>
            <li>Love the different sizes of pearls.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really satisfied with my purchase since the pearls aren&#x27;t as big as they look in the picture</li>
            <li>Love them just thought it would be bigger</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally got them!</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I will say there aren&#x27;t exactly a many pearls in the actual case, but it&#x27;s quite a lot.</li>
            <li>but they are different sizes and there are many in the wheel.</li>
            <li>Still cute though, I&#x27;ve used them several times.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, tons of beads!  </li>
            <li>they are so tiny I love them.  </li>
            <li>They are not separated exactly.</li>
            <li>She enjoyed adding them to her nail art to add a personal style and touch!</li>
            <li>Love the various sizes.</li>
            <li>but I love how they look and all the different sizes they come in.</li>
            <li>and I wish there were more of the larger sized ones</li>
            <li>Pretty detailing for nails art</li>
            <li>Came with two different sizes, wished it had more variety on size.</li>
            <li>This was my first time</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t count to see how many were actually in here</li>
            <li>The big ones are ok. , but they are plastic and not pearls at all and</li>
            <li>These are so pretty.</li>
            <li>then I thought, but overall all I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>Love the different sizes.</li>
            <li>Some of the smaller sizes didnt seem to have as many though.</li>
            <li>theyre exactly what is shown in the pic.</li>
            <li>now I was sure at first they look very big</li>
            <li>that it has all the different sizes because it helps add more dynamics to the design.</li>
            <li>and you get exactly what&#x27;s shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>These are exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>The pearls are adorable and come in various sizes.  </li>
            <li>Love the multiple colors.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that there are three different sizes of these pearls.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>love that these pearls came in different sizes.</li>
            <li>Just wished it was more pearls, cuz you can never get enough of pearls.</li>
            <li>I only wish that there were more of them.</li>
            <li>many different sizes and shapes&lt;br /&gt;-Helpful dispenser</li>
            <li>They are so cute and come with such variety.</li>
            <li>Other than that they&#x27;re fine the different sizes, and  quality are good.  </li>
            <li>The pearls are flat backed, which makes them super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>then I expected but they are still super cute.</li>
            <li>these little pearls really look beautiful when you add them and cover with a clear cover.</li>
            <li>These are much smaller than pictured and there are fewer in the container than what&#x27;s pictured they are good for nail art on short nails..</li>
            <li>Im really like the product, and the options to make my nails pretty.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s small but still really good</li>
            <li>own tons of gems/pearls/nail caviar/fimo canes &amp; will continue to buy more&lt;br /&gt;Recomended for your average nail guru ♥♥</li>
            <li>far from full, has about maybe 15 of each size.</li>
            <li>are a good size, but very few.</li>
            <li>so my nails are super classy XD</li>
            <li>Easy to apply although the smallest ones are too tiny.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy enough to pick out the ones you want.</li>
            <li>very cute to add fashion to your nails, they come in different sizes to make different designs.</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li>They fall off really easily if you try to use nail glue or just regular nail polish to keep them on however if you have someone use acrylic/shellac it would work.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m certain there isn&#x27;t 1200!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I would certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li>Mini and large..</li>
            <li>These came not just in the round shape in varying sizes, but also in heart shape in varying sizes, which I LOVE!</li>
            <li>Everything is great except that the actual product has way less of pearls than the image shows.</li>
            <li>This is my second time ordering from the same provider and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>The backs are flat for easy application.  </li>
            <li>The backs are flat and easy to design with them.  </li>
            <li>my disappointment, none of the pieces were big enough so that if I just put one or two pieces on my nail, it would take the majority of the space.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the product is great in its quality and the amount that they give is plenty!&lt;br /&gt;I used top coat to stick these pearls on my nails and use top coat again to coat</li>
            <li>I suppose that for the price you really can&#x27;t complain too much, but the picture is a bit misleading</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s very close up to the product).</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>They are very staticky</li>
            <li>That makes it much easier to apply to nails or cellphone cases if  you want...</li>
            <li>doesnt sparkle that much.</li>
            <li>and they really go on the nails</li>
            <li>The pearls stayed on until I was ready to take them off.</li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>once on the nail they really make the designs pop.</li>
            <li>I received my product really fast to my surprise.</li>
            <li>Really like how they look they make nails look much nicer.</li>
            <li>for under a dollar I was expecting that it wouldn&#x27;t be as much as the picture.</li>
            <li>Tons of variety of sizes and shipped really fast..</li>
            <li>but once on you cant really tell.</li>
            <li>I really like them, haven&#x27;t used them yet</li>
            <li>But this for my wife and she really like it</li>
            <li>4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t have as much beads as it appears in the picture</li>
            <li>work very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,  received them 10days before estimated delivery.  </li>
            <li>warning if you put too much on one nail they look like boils or warts...</li>
            <li>but i m learning it so fast</li>
            <li>FAST TOO.</li>
            <li>The pearls are very glossy.  </li>
            <li>Either way I am VERY unsatisfied and DO NOT recommend..</li>
            <li>It really add class to the nail art.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good  for its price , I expected them a bit bigger</li>
            <li>is ok is not much of it but is worth the money u pay for this thanks for sending it early then the date u say.</li>
            <li>But the one I received not only came in 10 days early, it looks like it has more than the picture.</li>
            <li>i liked them but the only thing I thought they were bigger</li>
            <li>I mean for the price, it is a good product</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love these and can&#x27;t wait to decorate nails with them.</li>
            <li>The small one is perfect to make a little dotted line.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love them.</li>
            <li>I use them often for Chanel inspired nails and for many other designs.</li>
            <li>Be very careful when painting over top of the jewel so that the pearl essence does not brush off.</li>
            <li>They are a little small, but when on the nails they look beautiful, and they also come in many different sizes</li>
            <li>The very little pearls i did get look nice</li>
            <li>Less pearls than I expected but great price</li>
            <li>this is a good buy, different size half pearls ,would recommend and qwould buy again when needed.</li>
            <li>Some people complained that there weren&#x27;t very many</li>
            <li>this is my second purchase because it doesnt come full like the pic</li>
            <li>The wheel definitely wasn&#x27;t as full as pictured.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I thought it would be and isnt even nearly as full as the picture.</li>
            <li>Pearls are super small and not really what I was annitcipating, but it&#x27;s fine will do fine for only $1.08 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>The flat back and different sizes make them very easy and fun to work with.</li>
            <li>They came in a few different sizes and there were a fair amount of each.</li>
            <li>,Decent size ..</li>
            <li>Came in the mail quickly and worked well for my purposes (theatrical makeup).</li>
            <li>Most likely I will not be coming back if they cant give me what I paid for.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery overall but useable.</li>
            <li>Love these pearls the only thing there are only two sizes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a lot more white than the last one i got.</li>
            <li>A decent buy for the price.</li>
            <li>Her pearls were a shiny super white color.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>The pearls have a flat back to them which made it easier for me to stick them onto my phone case :)</li>
            <li>With a little practice, you&#x27;ll have cute little pearls part of your nail art without accidentally losing all your pearls :)</li>
            <li>and they arrived on time in a cute little organized container.</li>
            <li>The sizes from small to large are cute and not showy in any way.</li>
            <li>These look very nice in the picture, but when i actually used it for my nails, the white pearl faded away in less than a week.</li>
            <li>The product is not near as full as the picture shown.</li>
            <li>There were a few things I did not like: 1) not as many pearls as in picture</li>
            <li>they are not a bright white pearl, more on the creamy yellowish pearl side other than that I&#x27;m super pleased with shipping,  packaging and the product itself</li>
            <li>Havent had a chance to try since I have short nails right now, waiting for them to grow</li>
            <li>The pearls are nice though I thought they may be a little shinier and the wheel would be bigger!!</li>
            <li>They both have the same issue of containing a lot of static, which causes the pearls to go flying out of the container when you turn it and is a bit harder to work with.</li>
            <li>The product was smaller than I expected and didn&#x27;t have as many pearls as pictured.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these little pearls!</li>
            <li>This is great to add a little something to your plain nailpolish</li>
            <li>Serious static cling with the pearls but looks gorgeous after you apply it especially pairing up next to a color tip like glittery pink.</li>
            <li>I use the small ones to make bows, hearts, flowers, they are cute.</li>
            <li>Product came within the time it was supposed to, a bit early even!</li>
            <li>They are cute, I&#x27;d use tweezers to place them because they are so small.</li>
            <li>and it comes in many different sizes from very tiny to fairly big.</li>
            <li>I am not sure most of them could even be used on nails.</li>
            <li>The pearls come in three different sizes (small, med, large) and can be used either seperately or together to create interesting looks.  </li>
            <li>but the beads are pretty, but its so empty the little beads float to the top.  </li>
            <li>The sizes are pretty much all the same there are no really big ones.</li>
            <li>all size are mixed up, but stil they are soooo amazing and totally enough (half) perls .</li>
            <li>These plastic pearls have mostly all lost their luster, so they just look like little white plastic decals.</li>
            <li>so they end up looking more like little balls on your nails rather than actual pearls.</li>
            <li>Maybe make wheel a little larger but love them, will buy again.</li>
            <li>but they have so much static between them and the plastic container they come in, it was hard to grab &amp; use them even with tweezers.</li>
            <li>There are not very many pearls and they seem so cheap.</li>
            <li>Pearls came a little different then shown in the picture and clearly there are not as many pearls as there are in the picture but for the price</li>
            <li>The pearls also tend to lose their color a bit when you put clear coat over them.</li>
            <li>It clearly labels the sizes of the pearls in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really thats the actual size of it literally</li>
            <li>So far no complaints.</li>
            <li>a wild for me to get them</li>
            <li>I bought these to use as arts&#x27;n crafts purposes for my young kids.</li>
            <li>I really wish they came in a larger quantity.</li>
            <li>They arrived early.</li>
            <li>You could nearly pick them up.</li>
            <li>I like to use a couple different sizes on each nail, which looks really neat.</li>
            <li>I really like the different size of pearls and the nail art stone wheel</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>--it only occured with the very smallest of the pearls though.</li>
            <li>About a week early.</li>
            <li>Would have given 4 stars but the fact that they go into different slots, I really didnt like that.</li>
            <li>All in all, I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This makes is much easier than using glue or regular polish.</li>
            <li>The wheel pictured made it look a lot bigger than it really is.</li>
            <li>but so far I like them.</li>
            <li>Came early and just like the picture.</li>
            <li>Very pretty pearls with flat backs and different sizes.</li>
            <li>This is a 5 star item, a must have for the collection, they are adorable, there are a few different sizes.  </li>
            <li>They were sticking to the top of the case and whatnot, and when I opened the slot, they literally, I mean literally flew out and some stuck in bunches.</li>
            <li>Product was possibly half full.</li>
            <li>They have several different sizes, from tiny ones to fairly good small size.</li>
            <li>There are four &#x27;sections&#x27; for each size and there really aren&#x27;t very many pearls, which is a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li>Came earlier then expected and it was full</li>
            <li>but they are very small other wise</li>
            <li>but item was just as described, and all little sections of the try look full.  </li>
            <li>Cheap pearls came in a very little amount.</li>
            <li>These are tiny and unfortunately it took for FOREVER to get to me, but they did get here and will be great NEXT time we do this solar system project!</li>
            <li>Product arrived earlier than expected, but container was crushed and many of the pearl had fallen out.</li>
            <li>The pearls come in many different sizes, which I thought was hard to tell in the picture.</li>
            <li>Love the different sizes and the bottom is dull so glue can adhere well to the nail.</li>
            <li>and I will repurchase pearls as soon as I am done with these one, and it seems that they will be gone very fast for the wheel contains less product then pictured, and the wheel is very small, but again for the price, it is ok...</li>
            <li>They got here a week earlier than expected, which is always good, but there are less than I expected.</li>
            <li>There were barely any beads in it!</li>
            <li>I apply three, small, medium, large with eyelash glue, in order next to my right eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when you receive it its only about half full.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is, sometimes it looks like the plastic wasnt completely cut around, but</li>
            <li>exactly as expected, thanks</li>
            <li>First of all I had expected the wheel to be a larger size.</li>
            <li>Eventhough they came in a small nail art wheel, it was full of pearls in all sizes..</li>
            <li>The quality is poor, and the picture made it seem like there were more.</li>
            <li>Easily affixed upon a thin layer or clear polish.  </li>
            <li>there are literally only 37 pearls in it, only 3 different sizes, well really I should say two because I only have 3 of the smallest size.</li>
            <li>They also tend to go everywhere if you are not very careful.</li>
            <li>The wheel container is very sturdy and the pearls do not mix with each other.</li>
            <li>I actually got pearls, which I didn&#x27;t need, at least it was cheap.</li>
            <li>I have ordered several things from different sellers in far away places for nail art......</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only on a few and definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>They do stick to the top of the container and the container is really small but other than that i like them!</li>
            <li>These came a little later than expected, but the product was so fantastic.</li>
            <li>Super duper small, tiny beads.</li>
            <li>but then I finally get it, and the package was open (not the yellow envelope from the PO but the clear package that the wheel is actually in)</li>
            <li>The seller contacted  me and offered to refund half the cost (even though it doesn&#x27;t cost as much its the thought that counts).</li>
            <li>only complaint is that it wasn&#x27;t as full as it is shown in the photo</li>
            <li>They are such pretty little pearl like gems in different sizes.</li>
            <li>.I just got these in the mail today and they were packaged very well and tight.</li>
            <li>Super cute, I was a little afraid it would be too big for my nails</li>
            <li>These pearls are super small, at least the first four rows are.</li>
            <li>They have static to them which makes them a little hard to grab</li>

            <li> Nice staff.</li>
            <li> I loved them when I saw them, but when I used them some of them faded the color so you can not notice then on the nail, I tried again and the way to try to keep the color is just to place a drop of top coat ever it</li>
            <li> are so nice</li>
            <li> For what she tells me it is a really nice addition to her nail decoration</li>
            <li> love the pearly sheen they have and the fact that the sizes are in a good variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The quality is so nice for the price.</li>
            <li> The spinning wheel provides a nice storage.</li>
            <li> I can not wait to see the amazing nail art that my daughter and I can create using all this fun nail stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, organized, and exactly what I wanted!</li>

            <li> but the pearls are good :) :)</li>
            <li> The wheel it comes in is good and is easy to access pearls.</li>
            <li> but they came in good condition and were a perfect white color</li>
            <li> the pearls got here quickly and look great.</li>
            <li> Really do love! :)</li>
            <li> These are very pretty and a great addition to my Nail Art decorations.  </li>

            <li> I love them, very stylish &amp; cute.</li>
            <li> But they were happy to make it right.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll snag or come off easily!</li>
            <li> These are nice, I probably wouldn&#x27;t order them again mostly based on they lose shiny luster if you use a top coat.</li>
            <li> I am starting my own business and these were great!</li>
            <li> These are super cute and im sure will look great on a mani.</li>
            <li> this is the first purchase I have not been happy with.</li>
            <li> Besides that incident, everything is fine!</li>

            <li> I love the variety of sizes.  </li>
            <li> I have used these to create elegant designs.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> so I guess I will repurchase to get more.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li> They kept sticking to top of wheel</li>
            <li> but I already love them.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I love pearls.</li>
            <li> Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
            <li> However I can still use them and I do recommend them if you&#x27;re ok with not having so many...</li>
            <li> I love the variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> still cute</li>
            <li> but they are cute...</li>
            <li> i love them on my nailt and my phone cases</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have tweezers to pick the gems up.</li>
            <li> But I guess that&#x27;s ok because I think they shipped from Hong Kong</li>
            <li> I use this product the most but dislike that they are like all unorganized</li>
            <li> I need more.</li>
            <li> love them</li>
            <li> Such a great deal for the money!</li>
            <li> I love then</li>
            <li> love them love the wheels there in</li>
            <li> it was a great deal and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> i really love it ..</li>
            <li> I put them on when I do my gel manicures and love the look.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re smaller than the picture, but I think they&#x27;re perfect</li>
            <li> It was cute but it was ok</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s okay since I paid like 20 something cents for these plus shipping they equaled about a dollar.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re still cute, and I can still use it to decorate.</li>
            <li> I love how they look on my nails.</li>
            <li> I will probably order more soon.</li>
            <li> Pleased.</li>
            <li> They are so cute and sophisticated looking.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I love these pearls, they come in a variety of sizes.  </li>
            <li> However, I had hoped to use them for more of a craft supply, in card making.</li>
            <li> I love these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> im satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> the pic makes it look like there is alot more than there is, but it might just be because they were kinda piled up on eachother</li>
            <li> Sizes aren&#x27;t that variant, but I like them :)</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> One side of the beads is flat so it rests perfectly on your nail.  </li>
            <li> The backs are flat and they will be perfect for wedding nails.</li>
            <li> The items are very good in the variety of sizes but the pearl paint comes off rather easy even if putting a protective clear coat on top.</li>
            <li> These pearls are beautiful and and a touch of elegance when you want something more classy.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be larger, however they are very cute and work great.  </li>
            <li> Super cute!</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for weddings or prom super cute and the price cant be beat!</li>
            <li> The pearls are easy to put on using either nail glue or setting into the nail polish and you can choose what size is the most appropriate for whatever occasion you need</li>
            <li> I like the assortment of sizes, they&#x27;re pretty good if you&#x27;re a beginner nail artist</li>
            <li> Excited to get playing around!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be there on time that&#x27;s a good thing I will buy more thanks bye</li>
            <li> These pearls are awesome because of the flat back, its very easy to use while placing on anyones nails.&lt;br /&gt;Def a most buy!!</li>
            <li> They are pretty good for the price, but the color quickly comes off and they get damaged very easily.</li>
            <li> I decorated my iPod case with some of these, Among other things, they looked nice, Love how they look, the size is good, and there is so many!</li>
            <li> but I am fine with that considering the price :)</li>
            <li> Lucky for me, they are perfect for my crafts, especially card-making so I will still be able to use them.  </li>
            <li> these flat- back pearls are beautiful, very dainty design.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, and there is so many sizes and such.</li>
            <li> BUT they were pretty cheap and they had a good variety of sizes</li>
            <li> pshh better give me something free or something.</li>
            <li> Arrive early, same that I buy, good price, good quality, good package.</li>
            <li> Excellent, it came earlier than expected and it looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> exactly as described thought there would be more but its okay because it was cheaoer then most</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to glue them on nails.</li>
            <li> I would definetely get this again when I don&#x27;t have any more left lol</li>
            <li> and they fall off easily but</li>
            <li> I like that there are many different sizes - Great for people with all lengths of nails.</li>
            <li> They arrived before schedule and in a spinning wheel for easy storage,i always like that.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li> I received my product very quickly.</li>
            <li> 3) they stick to your hands.... veryyy easy.</li>
            <li> The product gets here very quickly and everything is just as they say/describe.</li>
            <li> Although they took a while to arrive from Asia (I believe they came from Hong Kong), the product is as described and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I received them VERY quickly (the estimated arrival was Feb 13 to Feb 21</li>
            <li> The pencil makes bead/pearl placement so easy.</li>
            <li> It also came very quickly.</li>
            <li> The size is nice but the color is just too yellowish and the packaging was not the good some of my pearls were outside their container</li>
            <li> I love that there are different sizes of pearls and look very nice on the nails to get a 3d effect .</li>
            <li> i was expecting more than what came .Other than that they were cool on my finger nails.</li>
            <li> I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
            <li> They are super easy to use and to apply them i always put on top coat</li>
            <li> but I think they&#x27;ll turn out fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my order :)</li>
            <li> I love my pearls and they&#x27;re at such an amazing price!</li>
            <li> Besides that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> These are fine for the purpose they were made for, I guess.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re cute and super chic.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!  </li>
            <li> yeah is super cute</li>
            <li> cute but need to apply with super glue or nail glue</li>
            <li> I recommend applying them with gel super glue to your gel nail polish BEFORE curing then applying the top coat for added strength.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and stylish.</li>
            <li> They came so much sooner than the estimated date, I love when that happens!</li>
            <li> the assortment is fine, and the product doesnt look cheap, cant wait to use them</li>
            <li> A nice addition to my large manicure product collection.</li>
            <li> I use them all the time in my nail art and they are all very pretty!</li>

            <li> you should really get it !!:)</li>
            <li> there are an assortment of sizes to create different looks and they all look very cute!</li>
            <li> If you are expecting a huge container, you are mistaken.</li>
            <li> more bright white like the name says.</li>
            <li> Cheap, pearl coated plastic,  not at all shiney</li>
            <li> just because I did 4 fingers and filled them all the way up or what</li>
            <li> They are a bit cheap looking but</li>
            <li> the price was cheap and that&#x27;s what this is, CHEAP.</li>
            <li> They are really cheap plastic</li>

            <li> They were so cheaply made.</li>
            <li> All at a CHEAP price.</li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> While I do not know how many are in this wheel, for the price, it is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy nail art and bought these beads on a whim.</li>
            <li> but what  ever they were cheap.  </li>
            <li> Overall happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> cheap quality.</li>
            <li> Other that, they are very pretty and excellent deal for the price.</li>
            <li> But these are nice, and the flat back is perfect for nail art.</li>
            <li> The price is right , will be ordering more .</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t need them right away, because they took a while to arrive.  </li>
            <li> No odd shapes, all good rounds, and flatbacked for nail application.</li>
            <li> The case is very useful.</li>
            <li> there pretty but not at all happy with how many where in the pack definitely not what it says or shows !</li>

            <li> I like the pearls and tht sizes just really wish there were more of them and</li>
            <li> so they dont need a big container and its a good deal.</li>
            <li> It was good but the wheel is smaller.</li>
            <li> If not they need to change the picture that they have displayed and put up the true picture of what is being sent out.</li>
            <li> But they look cool</li>
            <li> I think that if you have a purpose in mind, then you should buy them because they are good quality for a very low price.</li>

            <li> I love the different sizes available and the spinner is a lot easier to spin than most</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re a good size, but they are all the same size.</li>
            <li> Received wheel that was not as full as the photos dispect.</li>
            <li> ordering didn&#x27;t really kno what to expect, but I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> but I thought it would be full</li>
            <li> The picture make it look like its full</li>
            <li> and there is a good amount in each of them, especially since there is 3 sizes</li>
            <li> Over all, not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> pretty, fairly easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Pretty easy to get to stay on.</li>
            <li> I love love love these so much that I&#x27;m actually considering using pearls from now on instead of stones.</li>
            <li> It certainly didnt have as many as showed but for the price it is worth it.</li>
            <li> The other rows will probably work great for nails which is the reason I purchased them.</li>
            <li> I loved that their flat bottoms..</li>
            <li> The pearls themselves are great, easy to apply (you can even just use a top coat) and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Got the pearls not as many as the picture showed but a decent amount  </li>
            <li> SUPER PRETY</li>
            <li> There is only a tiny amount of them but what do you expect with the great price?!!!</li>
            <li> I love the different sizes which gives me more chances to change up my creaativity.</li>
            <li> sure I will be ordering more, from this company sometime in the future.</li>
            <li> Amazed at their beauty, the quality and super fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> they come off easily, but they&#x27;re worth the price if your looking for something to easily make your nails a little more glam!</li>
            <li> and I guess its a pretty good deal especially for the price</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!  </li>
            <li> There is foam pieces in each compartment so it makes it appear fuller than it really is!!</li>
            <li> Soo pretty!</li>
            <li> They are so pretty!</li>
            <li> These pearls are fun to work with, easy to install, and cute to look at with different colors on nails.</li>
            <li> Although the wheel could have been bigger and had more pearls in it, it was still an amazing deal and it came VERY early.</li>
            <li> I think these little pearls are a GREAT touch to my nails.</li>
            <li> The whole container can fit in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> These were extremely cheap (inexpensive) but quite high quality!</li>
            <li> Took couple weeks to get but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> It may take a couple of weeks to get to you, but it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li> So worth the money</li>
            <li> And they were kind  mixed up when i opened them.</li>
            <li> These are worth every penny you spend</li>
            <li> but well worth the time.</li>
            <li> I added these to some assorted craft fun like phone cases, costumes and rings.</li>
            <li> and so far it cute when I try it on my daughter nail</li>
            <li> a lot smaller than i expected but still very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Durable and cute for the price, I love all of the different sizes, and i love that even though they were in a wheel they were not all mixed up.</li>
            <li> Worth the wait if you have time.  </li>
            <li> I am having fun with these cuties.  </li>
            <li> Comes in different sizes and they are surprisingly cheap &amp; elegant.</li>
            <li> The beads came way before the expected date and in good condition.</li>
            <li> So fun to use and nails</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to those who like to have fun with their nails.</li>
            <li> I use these for fun accents to my makeup.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are a lot of fun to play with.  </li>
            <li> but I guess it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> Good thing was that I got it before the expected date.</li>
            <li> Nice nail art with various rhinestones.</li>
            <li> so far, i have done many designs for spring and winter.</li>
            <li> its from out of the country, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I even could count how many tiny cheap pearls they got me.</li>
            <li> I guess they were worth it</li>
            <li> Although well worth it for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> so worth the cost, &amp; the wait,</li>
            <li> Def worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> These are so fun for using on my nails</li>
            <li> and after is dry apply the real top coat to the whole nail.</li>
            <li> They are nice, you don&#x27;t get too many of the bigger, more usable sizes, the little tiny ones are microscopic (which could be good for very intricate nail art)</li>
            <li> Other than that there good.</li>
            <li> i got its on the right estimated date</li>
            <li> the price was right too.</li>
            <li> They come in a variety of sizes and can be used for practically anything and everything with the right glue.</li>
            <li> it came right on time.</li>
            <li> Love them and was super surprised at the fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> very easy to use, add beauty to regular nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s due to static or something like that</li>
            <li> The quality of pearls are as expected for the price, on the third day the top iridescent layer came out on most pearls even though I covered them with CND brisa lite top coat.</li>
            <li> But next time I think I&#x27;ll just order the large size pearls, as I use these for embellishments on everything BUT nails :) the small ones would be perfect for nails tho, add dimension and texture that&#x27;s not so large</li>
            <li> this are so small they will look great on the nails.</li>
            <li> package is small but makes it great for storage.</li>
            <li> Pearls arrived earlier than expected, almost 2 weeks before and since it was free shipping, it was a great deal for the price.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take too long to arrive and the pearls look nice.</li>
            <li> I love these, they make for cute little designs on my nails.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I expected, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Came super fast.</li>
            <li> Lucky they did not cost much at all.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet, I KNOW they will work great because I bought a similar product that works just the same.</li>
            <li> most are chipped, the plastic container turns and you open one section at a time, unfortunately the plastic rubbing on the plastic creates static and since the pieces themselves are a light plastic, it is ridiculously easy to lose many at a time.</li>
            <li> It also shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> the different shapes makes it much more fun to do junk nails (which is street way of saying decorative or fancy nails with jems and other cute things)!</li>
            <li> But i don&#x27;t like it very much on my finger nails, because after working on  the job or around the house they fall off.</li>
            <li> Also very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love the different sized pearls &amp; the flat side makes it very easy to put on your nails.</li>
            <li> but they were good for a little girl&#x27;s nail set</li>
            <li> Loved the wheel of little pearls.  </li>
            <li> It is also SUPER easy to open unlike cheeky!</li>
            <li> Not very many in each side but for the price, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Got it very fast wish the wheel was bigger and had more pearls</li>
            <li> Also pretty</li>
            <li> the color was exactly what they say it is ...</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what picture showed.</li>
            <li> I love how they have different sizes.</li>
            <li> These are adorable, but I thought they would be slightly bigger in size.  </li>
            <li> but it probably will cost more to send it back then to keep it.  </li>
            <li> It you can pick them up and get them on your nails they are pretty.</li>
            <li> And they look so pretty in the container</li>
            <li> They are cute, and there are different sizes.</li>
            <li> You can not use them more than once they are for one time use only.</li>
            <li> They worked on my nails really well!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more later on when I need more..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I would buy again only reason I give four stars</li>
            <li> better to go to a nail store and actually see in person what you are getting.</li>
            <li> they are perfect for nails or glueing on random things.  </li>
            <li> Love that I have a variety of sizes and they&#x27;re so pretty and simple.</li>
            <li> Love the different sizes and the ease of applying to my nails.  </li>
            <li> Love the different sizes of pearls.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really satisfied with my purchase since the pearls aren&#x27;t as big as they look in the picture</li>
            <li> Love them just thought it would be bigger</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally got them!</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I will say there aren&#x27;t exactly a many pearls in the actual case, but it&#x27;s quite a lot.</li>
            <li> but they are different sizes and there are many in the wheel.</li>
            <li> Still cute though, I&#x27;ve used them several times.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, tons of beads!  </li>
            <li> they are so tiny I love them.  </li>
            <li> They are not separated exactly.</li>
            <li> She enjoyed adding them to her nail art to add a personal style and touch!</li>
            <li> Love the various sizes.</li>
            <li> but I love how they look and all the different sizes they come in.</li>
            <li> and I wish there were more of the larger sized ones</li>
            <li> Pretty detailing for nails art</li>
            <li> Came with two different sizes, wished it had more variety on size.</li>
            <li> This was my first time</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t count to see how many were actually in here</li>
            <li> The big ones are ok. , but they are plastic and not pearls at all and</li>
            <li> These are so pretty.</li>
            <li> then I thought, but overall all I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> Love the different sizes.</li>
            <li> Some of the smaller sizes didnt seem to have as many though.</li>
            <li> theyre exactly what is shown in the pic.</li>
            <li> now I was sure at first they look very big</li>
            <li> that it has all the different sizes because it helps add more dynamics to the design.</li>
            <li> and you get exactly what&#x27;s shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> These are exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> The pearls are adorable and come in various sizes.  </li>
            <li> Love the multiple colors.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that there are three different sizes of these pearls.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> love that these pearls came in different sizes.</li>
            <li> Just wished it was more pearls, cuz you can never get enough of pearls.</li>
            <li> I only wish that there were more of them.</li>
            <li> many different sizes and shapes&lt;br /&gt;-Helpful dispenser</li>
            <li> They are so cute and come with such variety.</li>
            <li> Other than that they&#x27;re fine the different sizes, and  quality are good.  </li>
            <li> The pearls are flat backed, which makes them super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> then I expected but they are still super cute.</li>
            <li> these little pearls really look beautiful when you add them and cover with a clear cover.</li>
            <li> These are much smaller than pictured and there are fewer in the container than what&#x27;s pictured they are good for nail art on short nails..</li>
            <li> Im really like the product, and the options to make my nails pretty.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small but still really good</li>
            <li> own tons of gems/pearls/nail caviar/fimo canes &amp; will continue to buy more&lt;br /&gt;Recomended for your average nail guru ♥♥</li>
            <li> far from full, has about maybe 15 of each size.</li>
            <li> are a good size, but very few.</li>
            <li> so my nails are super classy XD</li>
            <li> Easy to apply although the smallest ones are too tiny.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s easy enough to pick out the ones you want.</li>
            <li> very cute to add fashion to your nails, they come in different sizes to make different designs.</li>
            <li> exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li> They fall off really easily if you try to use nail glue or just regular nail polish to keep them on however if you have someone use acrylic/shellac it would work.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m certain there isn&#x27;t 1200!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I would certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> Mini and large..</li>
            <li> These came not just in the round shape in varying sizes, but also in heart shape in varying sizes, which I LOVE!</li>
            <li> Everything is great except that the actual product has way less of pearls than the image shows.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering from the same provider and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> The backs are flat for easy application.  </li>
            <li> The backs are flat and easy to design with them.  </li>
            <li> my disappointment, none of the pieces were big enough so that if I just put one or two pieces on my nail, it would take the majority of the space.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the product is great in its quality and the amount that they give is plenty!&lt;br /&gt;I used top coat to stick these pearls on my nails and use top coat again to coat</li>
            <li> I suppose that for the price you really can&#x27;t complain too much, but the picture is a bit misleading</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s very close up to the product).</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> They are very staticky</li>
            <li> That makes it much easier to apply to nails or cellphone cases if  you want...</li>
            <li> doesnt sparkle that much.</li>
            <li> and they really go on the nails</li>
            <li> The pearls stayed on until I was ready to take them off.</li>
            <li> I really like them.</li>
            <li> once on the nail they really make the designs pop.</li>
            <li> I received my product really fast to my surprise.</li>
            <li> Really like how they look they make nails look much nicer.</li>
            <li> for under a dollar I was expecting that it wouldn&#x27;t be as much as the picture.</li>
            <li> Tons of variety of sizes and shipped really fast..</li>
            <li> but once on you cant really tell.</li>
            <li> I really like them, haven&#x27;t used them yet</li>
            <li> But this for my wife and she really like it</li>
            <li> 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t have as much beads as it appears in the picture</li>
            <li> work very well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  received them 10days before estimated delivery.  </li>
            <li> warning if you put too much on one nail they look like boils or warts...</li>
            <li> but i m learning it so fast</li>
            <li> FAST TOO.</li>
            <li> The pearls are very glossy.  </li>
            <li> Either way I am VERY unsatisfied and DO NOT recommend..</li>
            <li> It really add class to the nail art.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good  for its price , I expected them a bit bigger</li>
            <li> is ok is not much of it but is worth the money u pay for this thanks for sending it early then the date u say.</li>
            <li> But the one I received not only came in 10 days early, it looks like it has more than the picture.</li>
            <li> i liked them but the only thing I thought they were bigger</li>
            <li> I mean for the price, it is a good product</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love these and can&#x27;t wait to decorate nails with them.</li>
            <li> The small one is perfect to make a little dotted line.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love them.</li>
            <li> I use them often for Chanel inspired nails and for many other designs.</li>
            <li> Be very careful when painting over top of the jewel so that the pearl essence does not brush off.</li>
            <li> They are a little small, but when on the nails they look beautiful, and they also come in many different sizes</li>
            <li> The very little pearls i did get look nice</li>
            <li> Less pearls than I expected but great price</li>
            <li> this is a good buy, different size half pearls ,would recommend and qwould buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> Some people complained that there weren&#x27;t very many</li>
            <li> this is my second purchase because it doesnt come full like the pic</li>
            <li> The wheel definitely wasn&#x27;t as full as pictured.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought it would be and isnt even nearly as full as the picture.</li>
            <li> Pearls are super small and not really what I was annitcipating, but it&#x27;s fine will do fine for only $1.08 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> The flat back and different sizes make them very easy and fun to work with.</li>
            <li> They came in a few different sizes and there were a fair amount of each.</li>
            <li> ,Decent size ..</li>
            <li> Came in the mail quickly and worked well for my purposes (theatrical makeup).</li>
            <li> Most likely I will not be coming back if they cant give me what I paid for.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery overall but useable.</li>
            <li> Love these pearls the only thing there are only two sizes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a lot more white than the last one i got.</li>
            <li> A decent buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Her pearls were a shiny super white color.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> The pearls have a flat back to them which made it easier for me to stick them onto my phone case :)</li>
            <li> With a little practice, you&#x27;ll have cute little pearls part of your nail art without accidentally losing all your pearls :)</li>
            <li> and they arrived on time in a cute little organized container.</li>
            <li> The sizes from small to large are cute and not showy in any way.</li>
            <li> These look very nice in the picture, but when i actually used it for my nails, the white pearl faded away in less than a week.</li>
            <li> The product is not near as full as the picture shown.</li>
            <li> There were a few things I did not like: 1) not as many pearls as in picture</li>
            <li> they are not a bright white pearl, more on the creamy yellowish pearl side other than that I&#x27;m super pleased with shipping,  packaging and the product itself</li>
            <li> Havent had a chance to try since I have short nails right now, waiting for them to grow</li>
            <li> The pearls are nice though I thought they may be a little shinier and the wheel would be bigger!!</li>
            <li> They both have the same issue of containing a lot of static, which causes the pearls to go flying out of the container when you turn it and is a bit harder to work with.</li>
            <li> The product was smaller than I expected and didn&#x27;t have as many pearls as pictured.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these little pearls!</li>
            <li> This is great to add a little something to your plain nailpolish</li>
            <li> Serious static cling with the pearls but looks gorgeous after you apply it especially pairing up next to a color tip like glittery pink.</li>
            <li> I use the small ones to make bows, hearts, flowers, they are cute.</li>
            <li> Product came within the time it was supposed to, a bit early even!</li>
            <li> They are cute, I&#x27;d use tweezers to place them because they are so small.</li>
            <li> and it comes in many different sizes from very tiny to fairly big.</li>
            <li> I am not sure most of them could even be used on nails.</li>
            <li> The pearls come in three different sizes (small, med, large) and can be used either seperately or together to create interesting looks.  </li>
            <li> but the beads are pretty, but its so empty the little beads float to the top.  </li>
            <li> The sizes are pretty much all the same there are no really big ones.</li>
            <li> all size are mixed up, but stil they are soooo amazing and totally enough (half) perls .</li>
            <li> These plastic pearls have mostly all lost their luster, so they just look like little white plastic decals.</li>
            <li> so they end up looking more like little balls on your nails rather than actual pearls.</li>
            <li> Maybe make wheel a little larger but love them, will buy again.</li>
            <li> but they have so much static between them and the plastic container they come in, it was hard to grab &amp; use them even with tweezers.</li>
            <li> There are not very many pearls and they seem so cheap.</li>
            <li> Pearls came a little different then shown in the picture and clearly there are not as many pearls as there are in the picture but for the price</li>
            <li> The pearls also tend to lose their color a bit when you put clear coat over them.</li>
            <li> It clearly labels the sizes of the pearls in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really thats the actual size of it literally</li>
            <li> So far no complaints.</li>
            <li> a wild for me to get them</li>
            <li> I bought these to use as arts&#x27;n crafts purposes for my young kids.</li>
            <li> I really wish they came in a larger quantity.</li>
            <li> They arrived early.</li>
            <li> You could nearly pick them up.</li>
            <li> I like to use a couple different sizes on each nail, which looks really neat.</li>
            <li> I really like the different size of pearls and the nail art stone wheel</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> --it only occured with the very smallest of the pearls though.</li>
            <li> About a week early.</li>
            <li> Would have given 4 stars but the fact that they go into different slots, I really didnt like that.</li>
            <li> All in all, I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This makes is much easier than using glue or regular polish.</li>
            <li> The wheel pictured made it look a lot bigger than it really is.</li>
            <li> but so far I like them.</li>
            <li> Came early and just like the picture.</li>
            <li> Very pretty pearls with flat backs and different sizes.</li>
            <li> This is a 5 star item, a must have for the collection, they are adorable, there are a few different sizes.  </li>
            <li> They were sticking to the top of the case and whatnot, and when I opened the slot, they literally, I mean literally flew out and some stuck in bunches.</li>
            <li> Product was possibly half full.</li>
            <li> They have several different sizes, from tiny ones to fairly good small size.</li>
            <li> There are four &#x27;sections&#x27; for each size and there really aren&#x27;t very many pearls, which is a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> Came earlier then expected and it was full</li>
            <li> but they are very small other wise</li>
            <li> but item was just as described, and all little sections of the try look full.  </li>
            <li> Cheap pearls came in a very little amount.</li>
            <li> These are tiny and unfortunately it took for FOREVER to get to me, but they did get here and will be great NEXT time we do this solar system project!</li>
            <li> Product arrived earlier than expected, but container was crushed and many of the pearl had fallen out.</li>
            <li> The pearls come in many different sizes, which I thought was hard to tell in the picture.</li>
            <li> Love the different sizes and the bottom is dull so glue can adhere well to the nail.</li>
            <li> and I will repurchase pearls as soon as I am done with these one, and it seems that they will be gone very fast for the wheel contains less product then pictured, and the wheel is very small, but again for the price, it is ok...</li>
            <li> They got here a week earlier than expected, which is always good, but there are less than I expected.</li>
            <li> There were barely any beads in it!</li>
            <li> I apply three, small, medium, large with eyelash glue, in order next to my right eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when you receive it its only about half full.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is, sometimes it looks like the plastic wasnt completely cut around, but</li>
            <li> exactly as expected, thanks</li>
            <li> First of all I had expected the wheel to be a larger size.</li>
            <li> Eventhough they came in a small nail art wheel, it was full of pearls in all sizes..</li>
            <li> The quality is poor, and the picture made it seem like there were more.</li>
            <li> Easily affixed upon a thin layer or clear polish.  </li>
            <li> there are literally only 37 pearls in it, only 3 different sizes, well really I should say two because I only have 3 of the smallest size.</li>
            <li> They also tend to go everywhere if you are not very careful.</li>
            <li> The wheel container is very sturdy and the pearls do not mix with each other.</li>
            <li> I actually got pearls, which I didn&#x27;t need, at least it was cheap.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several things from different sellers in far away places for nail art......</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only on a few and definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> They do stick to the top of the container and the container is really small but other than that i like them!</li>
            <li> These came a little later than expected, but the product was so fantastic.</li>
            <li> Super duper small, tiny beads.</li>
            <li> but then I finally get it, and the package was open (not the yellow envelope from the PO but the clear package that the wheel is actually in)</li>
            <li> The seller contacted  me and offered to refund half the cost (even though it doesn&#x27;t cost as much its the thought that counts).</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it wasn&#x27;t as full as it is shown in the photo</li>
            <li> They are such pretty little pearl like gems in different sizes.</li>
            <li> .I just got these in the mail today and they were packaged very well and tight.</li>
            <li> Super cute, I was a little afraid it would be too big for my nails</li>
            <li> These pearls are super small, at least the first four rows are.</li>
            <li> They have static to them which makes them a little hard to grab</li>
            <li> this only comes with large and small</li>
            <li> there are different sizes and are flat on one side.</li>
            <li> but there is decent amount for a few uses on your nail art 2)</li>
            <li> and I thought I was gonna have small med and large</li>
            <li> Tiny little pearls, very classy looking.  </li>
            <li> The wheel is really small &amp; not as much pearls as the picture.</li>
            <li> the small one are like dust they are stones, real joke</li>
            <li> didnt really last as long.</li>
            <li> When I finally got it it was in shipping for long time so it has to settle but has been a week and is still jumping at me when try to take one</li>
            <li> I like how one end is flat so that it sticks.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, multiple use</li>
            <li> They do however, have flat backs!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Definitely a lot smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> The smallest ones are really tiny and just smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> The wheel was much smaller than I expected and when you open it the pearls just pop everywhere.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The big ones can be used for different purpose other than nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> is the wheel is pretty small but other than that</li>
            <li> They are what I expected, plastic pearl looking gems with a flat back.</li>
            <li> I usually use these to make my images that i have stamped draw attention to a particular spot.</li>
            <li> They did take a little long to get here, but look how far its coming from.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> not worth it, not enough in it and way too tiny</li>
            <li> they were much smaller than what i expected.</li>
            <li> In the pictures looks like multiple sizes, not what u expected at all</li>
            <li> I paid for it long time ago</li>
            <li> This wheel is much smaller than I had expected but there are still plenty of pearls in each compartment.  </li>
            <li> Not NEARLY what you see in the pictures.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t take long to receive it.</li>
            <li> But once they are on they stay on for a long time</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why these would be taking that long</li>
            <li> but it was smaller than expected maybe measuring 3 inches in diameter</li>
            <li> which I didn&#x27;t like I expected them to be white.</li>
            <li> I had also expected the pearls inside of it to to be a bit larger too.</li>
            <li> What I expected, seems to have same amount as picture.</li>
            <li> Not very pleased...picture misleading because the beads are tiny.</li>
            <li> Was smaller then expected, but I was hoping it would turn out that way.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> over a week earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to come.</li>
            <li> It does take a long time to ship</li>
            <li> You do have to wait a long time for delivery</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;d say is was worth it, just a bit of false advertisement.</li>
            <li> I did one finger on each hand with different size pearls and it lasted a very long time!!</li>
            <li> This came in a week and it was exactly as described (they got a little mixed up in shipping from all the jiggling around but its very little and not very problematic).</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure but somewhere in china, and I live in the United States.</li>
            <li> the wheel is very small and most of the beads are missing its half empty</li>
            <li> I ordered other stuff the same day as these</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my nails and it arrived a week after I ordered it way way before due, the pearls come in a variety of sizes as pictured definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> When you turn yge holder to go to different sections, the stones would slide into other compartments.</li>
            <li> some got mixed up in the other slots but thats no ones fault.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 because one of the paks had plenty while the other pak only had like 8 in each section.</li>
            <li> shipping is long, so don&#x27;t expect them in under 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take very long at all for it to come to California.</li>
            <li> and before that is dry, I just stick them on.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a bigger container, but there seems to be enough pearls in there for a few uses.</li>
            <li> Not worth it and will be getting my money back.</li>
            <li> A little hard to use this item for nail art since it does not always stick on the first time.</li>
            <li> these are half pearls of various shapes.</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased color rhime stone wheels, and were way bigger than this one.</li>
            <li> the pearls were smaller than in the picture and the sections were not full.</li>
            <li> There is A LOT of these little pearls, and when I opened the package some had came out of the wheel into the envelope thing, which wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> and they are mixed up a little, but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little bigger though because I ordered these to put on some phone cases</li>
            <li> suggest getting the little wax-tip pencil made for picking up tiny things like this.</li>
            <li> It only has a little</li>
            <li> the money spent.</li>
            <li> They are what I expected.</li>
            <li> It Arrived sooner the expected.</li>
            <li> The wheel itself stays closed, no spilled pearls everywhere.</li>
            <li> and is not much as pic.  </li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> They pearls were not what i expected.</li>
            <li> I have a few different plans for this item.</li>
            <li> Did come in on time, but product just not what was expected.</li>
            <li> Really, it&#x27;s only a few inches in diameter.</li>
            <li> and two areas were empty.</li>
            <li> there are a few mixed in that</li>
            <li> arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li> I took two stars off because I expected them to be cream like the picture</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> what I expected them to be, but they do the job well.</li>
            <li> it was seriously this lil tiny disc just as big as the pic</li>
            <li> I just poured them out into a different small container.</li>
            <li> and you can also use them to decorate other things like a jewelry box or whatever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;shipping was faster then expected!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product on Amazon with other nail products, it didn&#x27;t arrive.</li>
            <li> AND ON OTHER ITEMS TO GIVE THEM FLAIR</li>
            <li> They are either way too small or way too big.</li>
            <li> the container is so small though seriously, barely bigger than a quarter</li>
            <li> i didnt think that they were that small and not enough to do multiples phones.</li>
            <li> She got them way before the expected delivery date also!</li>
            <li> &amp; it took a few weeks to come but not as long as the estimate delivery date said ..</li>
            <li> They look very similar to the picture, seeing as how they are for nails, they are small.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the product came in the bead sizes as advertised.</li>
            <li> but when I got it, it was so small and only about 20 pearls in it.</li>
            <li> and I was disappointed to see it wasn&#x27;t as many as the picture showed</li>
            <li> Kinda mad because I was excited to get these.</li>
            <li> The design ideas that I could use the pearls for are endless but I probably won&#x27;t bother because I won&#x27;t want to deal with the aggravation.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was expecting something different but these are almost to small to even use I cant get a grip on them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the other comments</li>
            <li> but I have also decorated a bunch of other things with them.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how the pearls are halves so I can make them work on my nails although some are small really small</li>
            <li> You get much much much less product then you see in the picture, each compartment is almost empty.</li>
            <li> Definitely not as many little pearls as pictured above!!!</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s hard to open.</li>
            <li> When it arrived all of the little pearls were spread everywhere, including even outside small wheel and some even falling out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am constantly decorating and painting my nails, but have had trouble inthe past with keeping my nail decor on, this is not an issue with this product.</li>
            <li> Not fun picking them up.</li>
            <li> not worth it</li>
            <li> I got the other products and this item was missing.</li>
            <li> It only came with one size and it was very small</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the little pearls can slide out of their compartments and they are all jumbled up now.</li>
            <li> There are always reviews complaining about how it took longer than estimated to arrive and how there are a lot less stones than pictured.</li>
            <li> extra small and small ( not like in the picture)</li>
            <li> I received it very quickly but I was very disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come with different sizes.</li>
            <li> I bought these for the little buttons</li>
            <li> When I got them they came in a little package.</li>
            <li> These are the cutest little pearl beads, it comes in a variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> But I got them for other things, like small crafts.</li>
            <li> Lots of little pearls in each section, there are about 3 sizes though...</li>
            <li> It did take a little while to come in</li>
            <li> Except that it took a little longer to come in the mail,</li>
            <li> a little longer arrived.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these little beauties YET</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re are this little bitty pearls that you can&#x27;t even see on a phone case.</li>
            <li> Well-priced, but not very many are in each container.</li>
            <li> so it was just a little bit messy.</li>
            <li> but if your too rough the pearl coating comes off and it becomes dull.</li>
            <li> The pearls are much smaller than they appear and come in three sizes (approximately): 3mm, 1mm, 1/2 mm.</li>
            <li> I should have read the review before buying them would have save me a few weeks of waiting.  </li>
            <li> I asked for them to send out another one that isn&#x27;t missing majority of the product</li>
            <li> So I discovered after trying these out a few times, that I don&#x27;t like pearls on my nail art.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;d have to use quite a few of them for longer nails.</li>
            <li> They came round no heart shaped ones as mentioned in another review.</li>
            <li> I used it for everything it makes me want to do my nails everyday.</li>
            <li> It took them about a month to get to me and when I opened them there were quite a few spilled in the bag.</li>
            <li> they are messy.</li>
            <li> you get quite a few of each.</li>
            <li> Only one small negative, maybe it was my fault for not reading the description, but the wheel is on the small side.</li>
            <li> The photo does not accurately depict the amount of pearls you receive in the wheel.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but there are a lot less pearls than what is pictured.</li>
            <li> and it also came with very little pearls but</li>
            <li> they are small</li>
            <li> The container is small and plastic so handle with care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small.</li>
            <li> I guess but not completely satisfied</li>
            <li> The wheel fits in the palm of your hand, it&#x27;s really small.</li>
            <li> Pearls are too small to work with.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too small</li>
            <li> &amp; im not sure when I will I bought them cause</li>
            <li> I was expecting them to be smaller, but these were a bit difficult to handle because of their size.</li>
            <li> I waited for over a month to get this in (which I usually don&#x27;t mind)</li>
            <li> Its kinda small.</li>
            <li> waaaaayyyy too small  </li>
            <li> The pearls in the package are extremely small.</li>
            <li> The container itself is as small as my palm &amp; very few pearls are in the container</li>
            <li> The item was too small we expected it to be a little bigger, my daughter was a lil disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> There were very few pearls in each.</li>
            <li> But they are hard to apply if you are using the small ones.</li>
            <li> Mind you, it is a small package because they are VERY small.</li>
            <li> so it is hard to grab them.</li>
            <li> Also I have had a hard time finding pearls because I like to view things in person.</li>
            <li> Go slow in turning otherwise you may have pearls everywhere.</li>
            <li> too thick and bulky.</li>
            <li> Very very small wheel kinda hard to put on</li>
            <li> Not worth the wasted money or disappointment</li>
            <li> I do my hair a lot, so I&#x27;d be shocked if they stay on as long as my toes do with the heavy use of my hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small</li>
            <li> Very Small.</li>
            <li> They are very small and they will not stick to rhinestone pencils.</li>
            <li> It the very small ones</li>
            <li> The shipping took about a week, which was lot faster than what Amazon told me the delivery date would be.&lt;br /&gt;The pieces range from very small to medium</li>
            <li> , The pearl rhinestones are so tiny...very very small.</li>
            <li> They are so tiny they would be very difficult to pick up to use.</li>
            <li> Not a good case at all.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in that big time.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a tad bit bigger:(</li>
            <li> but it was very hard to tell the difference between the size.</li>
            <li> These pearls like to cling to the sides of the case and are very difficult to manage so be careful!</li>
            <li> its over $1 for this crap and its smaller the than the palm of my hand</li>
            <li> After applying a thin coat, the stones can be moved around until it&#x27;s cured.</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISE</li>
            <li> I am very mad and want my money back!</li>
            <li> Not a good buy for me sorry.</li>
            <li> i just hate that they dont stay shine long!</li>
            <li> so I can get down &amp; dirty!</li>
            <li> Not very pleased but not too disappointed either</li>
            <li> , it should cost no more than 5 cents or something..and the people even gave me a refund just to delete my bad feedback on this product..</li>
            <li> The smallest ones seem rather impractical in the sense that they would be difficult to apply one by one.</li>
            <li> The wheel is difficult to turn and will find yourself with pearls all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I must have read the sizing wrong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m always a bit afraid to order items like these from China.</li>
            <li> This item is a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> sad I wanted to use this before my trip!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when purchasing these because I wanted to get a quality item.</li>
            <li> Just bad plastic.</li>
            <li> But not that bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s October 16th... :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love these! Perfect for my clients that are looking for stunning yet low key nails. Definitely not what&#x27;s in the picture. these are half pearls of various shapes.</li>
            <li> I love these, they make for cute little designs on my nails.</li>
            <li> Good variety of colored stones, all of mine were in the correct spot, which is a good thing bc I&#x27;ve bought some before that were all mixed &amp; you don&#x27;t want to deal with the sorting of hundreds of these tiny stones...</li>
            <li> Perfect for myh crafting projects just what i needed.</li>
            <li> These are nice, I probably wouldn&#x27;t order them again mostly based on they lose shiny luster if you use a top coat. They are nice, you don&#x27;t get too many of the bigger, more usable sizes, the little tiny ones are microscopic (which could be good for very intricate nail art) but they have so much static between them and the plastic container they come in, it was hard to grab &amp; use them even with tweezers.</li>
            <li> i love this . i got its on the right estimated date and well packaged.they are all different shapes and they are so cute</li>
            <li> Although I am very happy with the product I thought the wheel would be a lot bigger than what it is. The pearls are good quality and a good size for nail art</li>
            <li> I like the pearls and tht sizes just really wish there were more of them and tht they came in a bigger bundle. But all in all it&#x27;s really nice product and will be by them again</li>
            <li> good product. need more!</li>
            <li> I will not order again</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t trust the picture of this product! The pearls are much smaller than they appear and come in three sizes (approximately): 3mm, 1mm, 1/2 mm. There are four &#x27;sections&#x27; for each size and there really aren&#x27;t very many pearls, which is a bit disappointing. The smallest ones seem rather impractical in the sense that they would be difficult to apply one by one. I suppose that for the price you really can&#x27;t complain too much, but the picture is a bit misleading (it&#x27;s very close up to the product).</li>
            <li> I got exactly what was described, and am happy with these! But next time I think I&#x27;ll just order the large size pearls, as I use these for embellishments on everything BUT nails :) the small ones would be perfect for nails tho, add dimension and texture that&#x27;s not so large it&#x27;ll snag or come off easily!</li>
            <li> They do stick to the top of the container and the container is really small but other than that i like them! they are small so they dont need a big container and its a good deal.</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast. It&#x27;s easy to glue them on nails. I use the small ones to make bows, hearts, flowers, they are cute. they look awesome. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more of these when I run out! They come in all different sizes. Really do love! :)</li>
            <li> These plastic pearls have mostly all lost their luster, so they just look like little white plastic decals. Just okay.</li>
            <li> I got this one and a colored pearls version. They both have the same issue of containing a lot of static, which causes the pearls to go flying out of the container when you turn it and is a bit harder to work with. However, that&#x27;s unavoidable when you have plastic rubbing against plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a good buy for the economy of scale. With a little practice, you&#x27;ll have cute little pearls part of your nail art without accidentally losing all your pearls :)</li>
            <li> Very nice. Great size. Took couple weeks to get but worth the wait. Will buy again,  also ordered the colored ones. Also pretty</li>
            <li> loved them, just what I wanted! I am starting my own business and these were great! the price was right too. i will buy from amazon anytime with results like these.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  A great price that you have to be very pleased with. Worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of sizes.  I have used these to create elegant designs.  Easily affixed upon a thin layer or clear polish.  The size variety would also make for a great &#x27;junk&#x27; nail!!</li>
            <li> Got the pearls not as many as the picture showed but a decent amount  just I don&#x27;t like that they stick to the lid</li>
            <li> They are what I expected. They are very staticky so it is hard to grab them. I like them a lot though</li>
            <li> Love these! They came in a few different sizes and there were a fair amount of each. I would buy again after running out.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get these today. They came almost 10 days before the earliest estimated delivery date ( they are shipped from Singapore so it takes a while to get to the US). They were well packaged, only 1 of the tiniest pearls managed to escape the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it wasn&#x27;t as full as it is shown in the photo but I do feel like I got a lot for the price.</li>
            <li> BLING FOR YOUR NAILS.</li>
            <li> they were much smaller than what i expected. they are still useable, i think.. we shall see when i get to use them.</li>
            <li> I recieved this today, and have a total of 23 pearls in the container. Not 23 in each slot, 23 of the tiny ones.. TOTAL. Not worth it and will be getting my money back.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like you didn&#x27;t put anything in the case! How can I say more about it! I feel really sad!!!!</li>
            <li> It was delivered days before the estimated delivery date which is a great thing, packaging was okay. There is A LOT of these little pearls, and when I opened the package some had came out of the wheel into the envelope thing, which wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me. I just poured them out into a different small container. Other than that, I love these and can&#x27;t wait to decorate nails with them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good  for its price , I expected them a bit bigger but they&#x27;re okay ,Decent size ..&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to people</li>
            <li> I loved this item ... It&#x27;s good sizes for nail art the color was exactly what they say it is ... I will be repurchasing this item ....</li>
            <li> i bought this thinking it was way bigger than it was. it was seriously this lil tiny disc just as big as the pic really thats the actual size of it literally</li>
            <li> Not a good case at all. Looks and fits great but within days I noticed fractures and I never dropped my phone once. Just bad plastic.</li>
            <li> Quantity is not as described. Quality is so so, the shape is not as neat</li>
            <li> It was good but the wheel is smaller. didnt really last as long. but the pearls are good :) :)</li>
            <li> Product came within the time it was supposed to, a bit early even! It was exactly as described. Mind you, it is a small package because they are VERY small. But they work great! A nice addition to my large manicure product collection.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what picture showed. I loved that their flat bottoms.. That makes it much easier to apply to nails or cellphone cases if  you want... Eventhough they came in a small nail art wheel, it was full of pearls in all sizes..</li>
            <li> these perals are the cutetst i absolutley love them. there perfect for wedding nails. i just love all the shapes and sizes</li>
            <li> I accidentally bought this thinking this was rhinestones because of the picture listed. I actually got pearls, which I didn&#x27;t need, at least it was cheap.</li>
            <li> They all one size!! In the pictures looks like multiple sizes, not what u expected at all but It&#x27;ll do</li>
            <li> Received them in i think 2 weeks love them perfect for my phone cases and nail designs.Great assortment. kinda got jipped on a few pearl sections but dont really care for that price I&#x27;ll Just order 2 more.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten the product ! I paid for it long time ago still after a month have not gotten it I had clients waiting on these and never came! I ordered other stuff the same day as these and I got that stuff 3 weeks ago but these havent showed up I am very mad and want my money back!</li>
            <li> Beautiful pearls. Come in two sizes. The backs are flat for easy application.  If you are expecting a huge container, you are mistaken. The whole container can fit in the palm of my hand. The container is small and plastic so handle with care. Go slow in turning otherwise you may have pearls everywhere. It may take a couple of weeks to get to you, but it is worth the wait. Order in advance so you may have them for your nails will needed. If you are applying these on your nails they are perfect.  The small one is perfect to make a little dotted line. I love mine.  So far no complaints. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This wheel is much smaller than I had expected but there are still plenty of pearls in each compartment.  Came in the mail quickly and worked well for my purposes (theatrical makeup).</li>
            <li> It Arrived sooner the expected. The case is very useful. Im Loving the sizes. No complains. I will be buying some more. What a deal</li>
            <li> Think more like 10 of each size pearls. Not NEARLY what you see in the pictures. The pictures show a lot more than I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the pearls are functional. No odd shapes, all good rounds, and flatbacked for nail application. The wheel itself stays closed, no spilled pearls everywhere. Lots of compliments on the appearance (used for accent nail).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it is a lot smaller than it appears.</li>
            <li> I Give it 4 stars cos It&#x27;s very small I  was expecting it to be much bigger . Other than that there good.</li>
            <li> Ordered on September 5th and still have not recived item... It&#x27;s October 16th... :( sad I wanted to use this before my trip!</li>
            <li> I received it after almost 40 days after I purchased it. and is not much as pic.  terrible.  i would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Took about 1month to get. Pearls are super small and not really what I was annitcipating, but it&#x27;s fine will do fine for only $1.08 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> This came in a week and it was exactly as described (they got a little mixed up in shipping from all the jiggling around but its very little and not very problematic). I use them all the time in my nail art and they are all very pretty! So worth the money and my friends are always impressed.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful.  The pearls come in three different sizes (small, med, large) and can be used either seperately or together to create interesting looks.  The pearls are easy to put on using either nail glue or setting into the nail polish and you can choose what size is the most appropriate for whatever occasion you need</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long. The color fades and looks like white buttons. You get what you pay for. Not a good buy for me sorry.</li>
            <li> i thought these were awesome my nails have never looking so cute. and you can also use them to decorate other things like a jewelry box or whatever.</li>
            <li> I saw Zooey deschanel nails with her awesome tux so I was thinking how to make them pop even more!&lt;br /&gt;So I bought these for the little buttons&lt;br /&gt;DANG they look great they work perfect and everyone loves my nails!&lt;br /&gt;They look like pearl buttons so my nails are super classy XD</li>
            <li> Very cute and versatile, can&#x27;t wait to use them. didn&#x27;t take long to receive it. Not the most stunning but I think they&#x27;ll turn out fine</li>
            <li> The photo does not accurately depict the amount of pearls you receive in the wheel. I was sorely disappointed. You get about 1/4 of the amount shown in the photo. Boo.</li>
            <li> I love having so many options because it comes in so many . I am so happy to have bought it</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product! They are exactly what I expected, I am very pleased. I cannot wait to use them for wedding nail designs.</li>
            <li> SUPER PRETY I LOVE THIS LOOK ON MY NAILS WITH SOME LACEY DESIGN IT IS AWSOME AND MY KIDS LOVE IT TO</li>
            <li> These are so cute!!! I love how they have different sizes. I put mine on with clear nail polish and they stayed on great! I got a lot of compliments on them.</li>
            <li> These are adorable, but I thought they would be slightly bigger in size.  One is teeny tiny, then a speck bigger and the biggest is the size of a rhinestone.  But they will work to help achieve some cute 3D nail designs.</li>
            <li> I should have read the review before buying them would have save me a few weeks of waiting.  The picture is misleading when you receive it the wheel is very small and most of the beads are missing its half empty but the beads are pretty, but its so empty the little beads float to the top.  Contacted the company and they wanted me to send a pic of it knowing they know what product they are sending out.  I asked for them to send out another one that isn&#x27;t missing majority of the product but it probably will cost more to send it back then to keep it.  Most likely I will not be coming back if they cant give me what I paid for.  If not they need to change the picture that they have displayed and put up the true picture of what is being sent out.</li>
            <li> i use this to decorate my phone, nails and crafts. great price. ive use all of them. loved it, really great !!</li>
            <li> So I discovered after trying these out a few times, that I don&#x27;t like pearls on my nail art.  They just look funky.  Lucky for me, they are perfect for my crafts, especially card-making so I will still be able to use them.  I like that there are different sizes, and there are LOTS of them.  So if you enjoy pearls on your nails, these are great.  And if you use pearls for crafts, they are perfect.</li>
            <li> is ok is not much of it but is worth the money u pay for this thanks for sending it early then the date u say.</li>
            <li> Good. Nice. Okay. Alright. As expected. In one piece. Nifty. Shiny. A-ok. Acceptable. Satisfactory. Valuable. Favorable. Neat. Pleasant. Agreeable. Commendable.</li>
            <li> They pearls were not what i expected. They are smaller than what I thought. Very Small. And they were kind  mixed up when i opened them. I would not buy them again. but it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> good case, not alot of pearls though . Thought there would be more, but for the price I cant complain!&lt;br /&gt;shipping was faster then expected!</li>
            <li> pretty, fairly easy to apply.  Serious static cling with the pearls but looks gorgeous after you apply it especially pairing up next to a color tip like glittery pink.</li>
            <li> Cheap, pearl coated plastic,  not at all shiney</li>
            <li> Definitely a lot smaller than I expected but they were cute. Would recommend these to a friend.</li>
            <li> too thick and bulky. doesnt sparkle that much.</li>
            <li> But they are hard to apply if you are using the small ones. They are very small and they will not stick to rhinestone pencils. They also tend to go everywhere if you are not very careful. Other than that I love them.</li>
            <li> It took 2 hours for me to do my nails! I don&#x27;t know if thats just because I did 4 fingers and filled them all the way up or what but they kept flipping over! But once they are on they stay on for a long time mine stayed on for a week and I am constantly picking at my nails!</li>
            <li> These are worth every penny you spend you have so many sizes to choose from and you can work with them!</li>
            <li> I like the deferent sizes of the pearls, they look nice and elegant. the only thing i didn&#x27;t like was the shipping it tok a wild for me to get them but well worth the time.</li>
            <li> Very tiny. It you can pick them up and get them on your nails they are pretty.</li>
            <li> i just got them and they look nice there just okay&lt;br /&gt; they look better on the picture but there still cute</li>
            <li> Very cheap price , good product, fast service,Love the different sizes.You can be so creative with these.Would recommend this product for professionals and non professionals</li>
            <li> When I finally got it it was in shipping for long time so it has to settle but has been a week and is still jumping at me when try to take one</li>
            <li> Very pretty and stylish. I am a nail tech and my clients just fell in love with this product. Will be ordering more for sure.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll I was just waitin and waitin and waitin on these pearls so I did get them and used them the same day for breast cancer month</li>
            <li> The size is nice but the color is just too yellowish and the packaging was not the good some of my pearls were outside their container so it was just a little bit messy.</li>
            <li> Because the pearls have really amazing quality and they really go on the nails well both acrylic and regular they are amazing!!!</li>
            <li> product came as described. A++ not as sparkly as I would have liked, but they were good for a little girl&#x27;s nail set</li>
            <li> And they look so pretty in the container, I can&#x27;t wait to use them. I was expecting a bigger container, but there seems to be enough pearls in there for a few uses.</li>
            <li> The pearls come in all different sizes which, is what I wanted. The wheel it comes in is good and is easy to access pearls. The pearls stayed on until I was ready to take them off. I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter and she is using them.. she loves them</li>
            <li> These are so cute, and work perfectly. Great buy, and I had no issues receiving it. These are my favorite out of all the ones I bought. They are so fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product. When I received them the sizes were all mixed together. There was so much static that when I went to turn the wheel they would stick on my hand and/or fly out of the wheel. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> this are so small they will look great on the nails. will buy more for sure love this too cute.</li>
            <li> They got here a week earlier than expected, which is always good, but there are less than I expected. The quality is poor, and the picture made it seem like there were more. They are cute, and there are different sizes. For the price, I&#x27;d say is was worth it, just a bit of false advertisement.</li>
            <li> The wheel is really small &amp; not as much pearls as the picture. But not that bad. Its actually really cute :)</li>
            <li> I love this purchase! Pearls are so elegant! and they arrived on time in a cute little organized container. I cannot wait to use them on my nails.</li>
            <li> I am constantly decorating and painting my nails, but have had trouble inthe past with keeping my nail decor on, this is not an issue with this product. yuo will get a lot of use out of it an dit looks beautiful</li>
            <li> I love it this is my second purchase because it doesnt come full like the pic but u cant beat the price dont want to run out of them look gorgeous</li>
            <li> I would never order again I thought it would be like the ones at the nail salon and they feel nothing like it very cheap and it looks horrible I rather pay the extra cash and get it done at the salon</li>
            <li> I added these to some assorted craft fun like phone cases, costumes and rings. I have also used them for makeup for photo shoots. They work like a charm and are very beautiful and light wight.</li>
            <li> all size are mixed up, but stil they are soooo amazing and totally enough (half) perls . Thanjs for the good deal either</li>
            <li> Although it took a while to come its a great product and really food material it&#x27;s small but still really good</li>
            <li> They are pretty good for the price, but the color quickly comes off and they get damaged very easily. You can not use them more than once they are for one time use only.</li>
            <li> I hope your business goes well. Very much proud of what you do. Keep it going I am very proud!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product on Amazon with other nail products, it didn&#x27;t arrive. I got the other products and this item was missing. Highly disappointed. Will definitely not be ordering this product, or from this seller again.</li>
            <li> These are much smaller than pictured and there are fewer in the container than what&#x27;s pictured they are good for nail art on short nails.. you&#x27;d have to use quite a few of them for longer nails. They are cute, I&#x27;d use tweezers to place them because they are so small.</li>
            <li> The item was too small we expected it to be a little bigger, my daughter was a lil disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> I like it and they were prettier in person than on the site. I have a few different plans for this item.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use as arts&#x27;n crafts purposes for my young kids. There is only a tiny amount of them but what do you expect with the great price?!!!</li>
            <li> I find these pearls to be perfect for my nails. They are low price but descent quality. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> So I finally got them and yup got all the pearls like it appears in the picture and it was super easy to apply to my nails</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these pearls, they come in all sizes so you can find the perfect one for the nail art you are doing.</li>
            <li> They worked on my nails really well! If I had the money I would buy Them again.I really like them.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but there are a lot less pearls than what is pictured. But they are cute.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these little pearls! They vary in size which is great and makes them easy to use for any design. They came round no heart shaped ones as mentioned in another review. They do however, have flat backs! Super cute! I will definitely order again when I run out!</li>
            <li> Super cute, I was a little afraid it would be too big for my nails but they&#x27;re cute and super chic.</li>
            <li> Very pretty pearls with flat backs and different sizes. They have static to them which makes them a little hard to grab but it&#x27;s okay :) I love how feminine these look. They make beautiful designs. The price is wonderful, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love them, great price and free shipping!!!  I tried them the as soon I retrieve them frin the mail and they were a perfect addition to my nails.</li>
            <li> most are chipped, the plastic container turns and you open one section at a time, unfortunately the plastic rubbing on the plastic creates static and since the pieces themselves are a light plastic, it is ridiculously easy to lose many at a time. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. They do not come with a nail adhesive, either, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting one.</li>
            <li> I really like these for something that will last a few days. They are a bit cheap looking but once on the nail they really make the designs pop. I would recommend these for weddings or prom super cute and the price cant be beat!</li>
            <li> package is small but makes it great for storage. there&#x27;s plenty of beads to choose from and all different sizes. awesome for nail designs! makes everything more elegant :)</li>
            <li> The container itself is as small as my palm &amp; very few pearls are in the container i&#x27;m certain there isn&#x27;t 1200!&lt;br /&gt;This picture doesn&#x27;t look like the product i recived</li>
            <li> Very cute and girly. Gives your nail art a nice touch. I received my product really fast to my surprise. I really wish they came in a larger quantity.I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> These pearls like to cling to the sides of the case and are very difficult to manage so be careful! use these as an accent in your nail art. I usually use these to make my images that i have stamped draw attention to a particular spot.</li>
            <li> I like the assortment of sizes, they&#x27;re pretty good if you&#x27;re a beginner nail artist or you just want some bling to your nails without the salon price. I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my order :)</li>
            <li> Pretty&lt;br /&gt;Half pearls&lt;br /&gt;As pictured&lt;br /&gt;Great price&lt;br /&gt;I own tons of gems/pearls/nail caviar/fimo canes &amp; will continue to buy more&lt;br /&gt;Recomended for your average nail guru ♥♥</li>
            <li> I USE THESE ITEMS FOR ALL SORTS OF PROJECTS  ON CLOTHES  NAILS AND ON OTHER ITEMS TO GIVE THEM FLAIR</li>
            <li> The product is not near as full as the picture shown. Did come in on time, but product just not what was expected.</li>
            <li> the pearls were smaller than in the picture and the sections were not full. There were very few pearls in each. I was disappointed, because I waited weeks for these.</li>
            <li> Loved the wheel of little pearls.  Easy to apply although the smallest ones are too tiny.  Really like how they look they make nails look much nicer.</li>
            <li> I received it very quickly but I was very disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come with different sizes. It only came with one size and it was very small and it also came with very little pearls but for under a dollar I was expecting that it wouldn&#x27;t be as much as the picture.</li>
            <li> It was great to gets it , it mailed fast to my house and I can use to polish nails with thoses on it :)</li>
            <li> But they look cool so I try it and so far it cute when I try it on my daughter nail .. She like it too</li>
            <li> I like it.&lt;br /&gt;The big ones can be used for different purpose other than nails.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to anyone who does nails.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to all ladies out there that like to grab attention on your hands I like them and I wish they sold packs with more amount of pearls.... I will definitely buy more later on when I need more..</li>
            <li> a lot smaller than i expected but still very happy with the product. Didn&#x27;t take very long at all for it to come to California.</li>
            <li> the wheel looks much bigger in the picture. Really, it&#x27;s only a few inches in diameter. However the beads inside are very nice and so cute c: I recommend these a lot~!</li>
            <li> They are bigger than I was hoping for and looks as though they have been bouncing around in the container for some time. Most of the shiny pearl coating has rubbed off them.</li>
            <li> Love the jewels they will be one of my favorites to use on my nails. They are so glamorous when done with the white jewels.</li>
            <li> Very cute in clusters on nails. My only complaint is that the little pearls can slide out of their compartments and they are all jumbled up now. But it&#x27;s easy enough to pick out the ones you want.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I would buy again only reason I give four stars is the wheel is pretty small but other than that seems ok</li>
            <li> Got it today and all the pieces were the same size, not like the picture and description says. Disappointed in that big time. and two areas were empty. and the rest had from 2 to 10 pieces. very disappointed in that. the price was cheap and that&#x27;s what this is, CHEAP. Don&#x27;t bother buying it. better to go to a nail store and actually see in person what you are getting. Will never buy nail items online again.</li>
            <li> The pearls come in many different sizes, which I thought was hard to tell in the picture. They&#x27;re look so cute on nails. The only downside is, sometimes it looks like the plastic wasnt completely cut around, but it&#x27;s only on a few and definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It did take a month to get to me but are the perfect sizes. I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product perfect sizes plus they are very easy to stick to the nail plus they resemble a pearl very good</li>
            <li> These came in on time, but they were not what I was hoping for. They are either way too small or way too big. It the very small ones there are a few mixed in that are a good size, but very few. The pearls also tend to lose their color a bit when you put clear coat over them. Over all, not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> there are different sizes and are flat on one side. they are perfect for nails or glueing on random things.  the container is so small though seriously, barely bigger than a quarter but u do get 3 different sizes of pearls.</li>
            <li> Not as it looks..i was expecting more than what came .Other than that they were cool on my finger nails.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t even got them yet. It&#x27;s taken almost two months... I don&#x27;t know why these would be taking that long</li>
            <li> Love this product. Durable and cute for the price, I love all of the different sizes, and i love that even though they were in a wheel they were not all mixed up. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love that I have a variety of sizes and they&#x27;re so pretty and simple. Can&#x27;t wait to use these when doing 3D nails!!!! I would certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> These are nice quality although I haven&#x27;t found a use for them yet. I think that if you have a purpose in mind, then you should buy them because they are good quality for a very low price.</li>
            <li> Arrive early, same that I buy, good price, good quality, good package. Im really like the product, and the options to make my nails pretty.</li>
            <li> These are very pretty and a great addition to my Nail Art decorations.  I was disappointed they too over 4 weeks to get here and there is no way of knowing when you are purchasing something from Hong Kong until after you make the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great value for the amount of pearls you get in the wheel. This will be perfect for wedding nails! Will re-order</li>
            <li> this is a good buy, different size half pearls ,would recommend and qwould buy again when needed. good for price</li>
            <li> i didnt think that they were that small and not enough to do multiples phones. i will not buy these again.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!  Love the different sizes and the ease of applying to my nails.  Will be buying another set soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small. I thought it was going to be way bigger.  The picture is to big. When I got them they came in a little package.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my wife who does her own nails and she loves them! She got TWO packs of varying sizes. Great price, great product, and great value! She got them way before the expected delivery date also! Tha&#x27;ts always a plus!</li>
            <li> Good product, great price and nice service</li>
            <li> I was worried when i bought these thinking they may be too big but it was smaller than expected maybe measuring 3 inches in diameter</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the different sizes of pearls. So excited to use them when they came in the mail. Got lots of compliments</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how the pearls are halves so I can make them work on my nails although some are small really small I still love th price I paid making santa hat nail tips and need the pearls cant wait to put them on</li>
            <li> Perfect size &amp; cute for nails I love it &amp;#60;3 I would definetely get this again when I don&#x27;t have any more left lol</li>
            <li> These are the cutest little pearl beads, it comes in a variety of sizes. I would definitely recommend them and will be  buying them again.</li>
            <li> top notch quality&lt;br /&gt;nail tech daughter loves them.&lt;br /&gt;small and perfect&lt;br /&gt;these are not inferior.&lt;br /&gt;great value, will order again.</li>
            <li> exactly as expected, thanks</li>
            <li> The wheel definitely wasn&#x27;t as full as pictured. The reason it still got 4 stars is because I absolutely love the product otherwise! Tons of variety of sizes and shipped really fast.. Look great and I guess its a pretty good deal especially for the price</li>
            <li> The pearls are beautiful and exactly as described. I am so happy. I received them well before expected which I was pleasantly surprised about.</li>
            <li> my clients love these embellishments this product came ion great condition and I am very happy with the product I got</li>
            <li> They are really cheap plastic but once on you cant really tell. The sizes are pretty much all the same there are no really big ones.</li>
            <li> Pearls arrived earlier than expected, almost 2 weeks before and since it was free shipping, it was a great deal for the price.  The pearls are beautiful, with a beautiful luster. They have several different sizes, from tiny ones to fairly good small size. The wheel container is very sturdy and the pearls do not mix with each other. I recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> These came a little later than expected, but the product was so fantastic. They are a little small, but when on the nails they look beautiful, and they also come in many different sizes so I was very pleased!</li>
            <li> Purchased these a year ago... still have never recived them. I paid for these and I have not recived them.</li>
            <li> I put them on my nails and my friends too . The price is right , will be ordering more .</li>
            <li> Love the different sized pearls &amp; the flat side makes it very easy to put on your nails. Great for simple manicures. &amp; it took a few weeks to come but not as long as the estimate delivery date said .. About a month before it.</li>
            <li> They came so much sooner than the estimated date, I love when that happens! The packaging was soooo cute! It was in a vintage looking envelope. They look very similar to the picture, seeing as how they are for nails, they are small. But I got them for other things, like small crafts. I decorated my iPod case with some of these, Among other things, they looked nice, Love how they look, the size is good, and there is so many! Totally recommended! Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this. I used it for everything it makes me want to do my nails everyday. It doesnt change color but if your too rough the pearl coating comes off and it becomes dull.</li>
            <li> Very very small wheel kinda hard to put on and they fall off easily but cheap price don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase anymore cute I guess but not completely satisfied</li>
            <li> I love that there are different sizes of pearls and look very nice on the nails to get a 3d effect . The price was great also.</li>
            <li> Pearls, Pearls, Pearls..... Nothing like having pearls on your finger nails and diamonds on your fingers, or silver or gold. Looks sweet.</li>
            <li> Less pearls than I expected but great price</li>
            <li> Shipping was very quick and customer service was very good. I wasn&#x27;t really satisfied with my purchase since the pearls aren&#x27;t as big as they look in the picture and I didn&#x27;t get as many was shown. The seller contacted  me and offered to refund half the cost (even though it doesn&#x27;t cost as much its the thought that counts).</li>
            <li> Love them just thought it would be bigger lol I but they r so dam pretty love the color. XD</li>
            <li> Great for nail art! I love the different sizes available and the spinner is a lot easier to spin than most</li>
            <li> Good quality and many sizes to use.  Just make sure you don&#x27;t need them right away, because they took a while to arrive.  Worth the wait if you have time.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> These pearls are beautiful and and a touch of elegance when you want something more classy. They are great! They arrived early. i really love them Thanks</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ALL PEOPLE THAT ARE IN NEED OF IT!!! ITS THE BEST QUALITY IVE EVER SEEN ONLINE ... I WILL BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN IN THE FUTURE..</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!  Product as described.  They are so cute, I have been wanting to get these pearls for awhile now.  I&#x27;m glad I finally got them!</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves this product it is a great value and she and her friends can spend lots of time designing the perfect nail! It also shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> Cant take my eyes off them!! Love them and was super surprised at the fast delivery.  Product just as described and looks way better in person.  One side of the beads is flat so it rests perfectly on your nail.  Amazed at their beauty, the quality and super fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> I received these early and they are perfect for nail art. The backs are flat and they will be perfect for wedding nails. Very happy. Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> item as described. looks like amount in container is what is shown in the picture. arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li> The wheel fits in the palm of your hand, it&#x27;s really small. The pearls are flat backed, which makes them super easy to apply. They are suppose to come in various sizes, but they don&#x27;t. They&#x27;re a good size, but they are all the same size. They came in two shapes, circles &amp; hearts. There aren&#x27;t that many, but they work well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They took about three weeks to arrive. But they came in tact &amp; the wheel works. I would recommend if you don&#x27;t mind having pearls of all one size.</li>
            <li> Havent had a chance to try since I have short nails right now, waiting for them to grow so I can get down &amp; dirty!</li>
            <li> very cute pearls. I absolutely love these. I purchased these for my nail art designs and already received so many compliments!</li>
            <li> Came earlier then expected and it was full but the pearls have a beige/ yellowish tone to them which I didn&#x27;t like I expected them to be white. And they don&#x27;t look pearly white on the nails. Very disappointed won&#x27;t but it again</li>
            <li> Just received the product very happy with it. Arrived in perfect condition.  Cant wait to use them!!</li>
            <li> Good product will be using them continuously.</li>
            <li> I got these a while back and forgot to post my review, but they came in about 2 &amp; 1/2 to 3 weeks and they&#x27;re actually the same size as in the picture, but the picture is enlarged so it looks bigger. I will say there aren&#x27;t exactly a many pearls in the actual case, but it&#x27;s quite a lot. I really like them, haven&#x27;t used them yet but they are the perfect size for your nails. I love them, very stylish &amp; cute.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my nails and it arrived a week after I ordered it way way before due, the pearls come in a variety of sizes as pictured definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This pearls were terrible. They were so cheaply made. The stones were all static-like, sticking together. You could nearly pick them up. When you turn yge holder to go to different sections, the stones would slide into other compartments.</li>
            <li> She loves all the nail items and has has a blast with the nail items. So she can do many designs now</li>
            <li> This is a 5 star item, a must have for the collection, they are adorable, there are a few different sizes.  The backs are flat and easy to design with them.  Tiny little pearls, very classy looking.  I am having fun with these cuties.  I would highly recommend this product.  Really cute.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t pearl like cream like in the picture there more bright white like the name says. Other than that they&#x27;re fine the different sizes, and  quality are good.  I took two stars off because I expected them to be cream like the picture and they&#x27;re not they are white as snow.  But for under $3 what was I expecting</li>
            <li> It took them about a month to get to me and when I opened them there were quite a few spilled in the bag. but they are different sizes and there are many in the wheel.</li>
            <li> These pearls are super small, at least the first four rows are. The other rows will probably work great for nails which is the reason I purchased them.</li>
            <li> These pearls are fun to work with, easy to install, and cute to look at with different colors on nails.</li>
            <li> The shipping took about a week, which was lot faster than what Amazon told me the delivery date would be.&lt;br /&gt;The pieces range from very small to medium size.&lt;br /&gt;To my disappointment, none of the pieces were big enough so that if I just put one or two pieces on my nail, it would take the majority of the space.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the product is great in its quality and the amount that they give is plenty!&lt;br /&gt;I used top coat to stick these pearls on my nails and use top coat again to coat it.&lt;br /&gt;But as it is for any 3D nail art pieces, they do fall off from your nails if you accidentally bump into something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good investment and you get a lot for how cheap this product is!</li>
            <li> First of all I had expected the wheel to be a larger size. I had also expected the pearls inside of it to to be a bit larger too. Al of which is my fault though, because I was ignorant. It clearly labels the sizes of the pearls in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product. It didn&#x27;t take too long to arrive and the pearls look nice.</li>
            <li> These little pearls look awesome on my nails. I like to use a couple different sizes on each nail, which looks really neat. I definitely recommend them to any expert or novice nail artist!</li>
            <li> THIS IS SO MISLEADING, MY GRANDDAUGHTER IS SO DISAPPOINTED, SHE ALREADY TO DO HER DECORATE AND SHE CAN NOT USE THEM. FALSE ADVERTISE</li>
            <li> Pearls are too small to work with.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought it would be and isnt even nearly as full as the picture. Not very pleased but not too disappointed either, You get what you pay for. The very little pearls i did get look nice though</li>
            <li> Received wheel that was not as full as the photos dispect. Product was possibly half full. Other than that, the product came in the bead sizes as advertised.</li>
            <li> These are tiny and unfortunately it took for FOREVER to get to me, but they did get here and will be great NEXT time we do this solar system project!</li>
            <li> These are great just like the picture.  But Ebay has them cheeper for a lot more pieces. Will purchase from Ebay in the future</li>
            <li> What I expected, seems to have same amount as picture. And I think good price for amount.  I like that it came in the container shown. Also I have had a hard time finding pearls because I like to view things in person. But these are nice, and the flat back is perfect for nail art. Comes with varying sizes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on these! They are super easy to use and to apply them i always put on top coat and before that is dry, I just stick them on. Comes in different sizes and they are surprisingly cheap &amp; elegant.</li>
            <li> But this for my wife and she really like it</li>
            <li> The beads came way before the expected date and in good condition. 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t have as much beads as it appears in the picture</li>
            <li> I like these. The only issue I have is that they do not look enough like actual pearls. They don&#x27;t have enough shine and tone so they end up looking more like little balls on your nails rather than actual pearls. Still cute though, I&#x27;ve used them several times.</li>
            <li> excellent!  Fast shipping, tons of beads!  Just as pictured.  Many sizes to select from in wheel.  All at a CHEAP price.</li>
            <li> Not very pleased...picture misleading because the beads are tiny. I can use them but it&#x27;s not what I expected. There is foam pieces in each compartment so it makes it appear fuller than it really is!! Quick delivery overall but useable. Would not order again.</li>
            <li> they are so tiny I love them.  There are different sizes and the wheel is tiny...its so cute. Love it</li>
            <li> Great product for nail decorating. So fun to use and nails look beautiful! I recommend this product to those who like to have fun with their nails.</li>
            <li> I use these for fun accents to my makeup.  I apply three, small, medium, large with eyelash glue, in order next to my right eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the wheel is the size of my palm.  It does have some static with the beads and they are mixed up a little, but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a lot of fun to play with.  You can use them so many ways; nails, makeup, and accent on clothes to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use Elmer&#x27;s school glue or eyelash glue if you don&#x27;t want permanent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to know how you use these playful beads.</li>
            <li> Lovely! Multiple sizes, too!!</li>
            <li> Nice im thinking what creation i can make lol great price and evrythin i recomend it i dont give i 5 star bcuz its cute but not over the top na yeah is super cute u can put it in your phone nail s evrywhere</li>
            <li> I ordered these during the holiday so it got lost in the mail. It came from china so i guess it added to the delay. But they were happy to make it right. Other that, they are very pretty and excellent deal for the price. I&#x27;ll order again from this seller :)</li>
            <li> I like the product and I&#x27;ll be there on time that&#x27;s a good thing I will buy more thanks bye</li>
            <li> very cute to add fashion to your nails, they come in different sizes to make different designs. good deal for the money</li>
            <li> the different shapes makes it much more fun to do junk nails (which is street way of saying decorative or fancy nails with jems and other cute things)! but simple patterns are posible with the different sizing too :D&lt;br /&gt;diffently order again from them~ and would buy this product again ^^&lt;br /&gt;Super happy about this purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like the different size of pearls and the nail art stone wheel was a great wheel and easy to use</li>
            <li> but it was very hard to tell the difference between the size. The biggest one and smallest Icould not the medium and the others. They are not separated exactly. I like to use them.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these! She enjoyed adding them to her nail art to add a personal style and touch! wow</li>
            <li> Came super fast. These were extremely cheap (inexpensive) but quite high quality! Beautiful, and there is so many sizes and such. Love love love</li>
            <li> I like that there are many different sizes - Great for people with all lengths of nails. I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
            <li> cute but need to apply with super glue or nail glue</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to bring this to my nail tech and have some beautiful designs on my nails. Happy with my purchase. I thought they would be a bit bigger but it&#x27;s ok, still beautiful and does the job :)</li>
            <li> Love the various sizes. Great product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I love how they look and all the different sizes they come in. I like them.</li>
            <li> Soo pretty! They arrived before schedule and in a spinning wheel for easy storage,i always like that. I totally recommend this seller &amp;this product,thankyou!</li>
            <li> I did one finger on each hand with different size pearls and it lasted a very long time!! Can;t wait to experiment some more with these!!</li>
            <li> There are not very many pearls and they seem so cheap. Lucky they did not cost much at all. I would not recommend ordering.</li>
            <li> The took a bit to get here, but once they did, I was in heaven. They are so pretty!</li>
            <li> Love these pearls the only thing there are only two sizes and I thought I was gonna have small med and large this only comes with large and small</li>
            <li> I was super excited to recieve my package but when I got it, it was so small and only about 20 pearls in it.</li>
            <li> i was very pleased with my purchase. The pearls have a flat back to them which made it easier for me to stick them onto my phone case :)</li>
            <li> I think these little pearls are a GREAT touch to my nails. That come in different sizes. I think the pearl look on nails are beautiful.</li>
            <li> You get much much much less product then you see in the picture, each compartment is almost empty. Nice looking product.</li>
            <li> These pearls look great on my nails! There&#x27;s about three different sizes in the wheel. The smallest ones are really tiny and just smaller than I expected and I wish there were more of the larger sized ones but I still like them.</li>
            <li> Super duper small, tiny beads.</li>
            <li> these little pearls really look beautiful when you add them and cover with a clear cover.</li>
            <li> Pretty detailing for nails art</li>
            <li> price was great as well as the speedy delivery thank you</li>
            <li> Came with two different sizes, wished it had more variety on size. It&#x27;s also a lot more white than the last one i got.</li>
            <li> if you love bling on your nails these are a must great deal very pleased</li>
            <li> Nice staff. I love it.</li>
            <li> love it! exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li> All sizes. .. very cute.</li>
            <li> These are super cute and im sure will look great on a mani. I havent tried them yet but they look really cute there are diff sizes as shown and are just what i was expecting</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I like the product but on the pictures it shows that it has a lot of product but it&#x27;s too small and like it&#x27;s only comes like 7 of each color but I guess it&#x27;s worth it so I guess I will repurchase to get more.</li>
            <li> Love them just wish the quantity was higher. This was my first time ordering didn&#x27;t really kno what to expect, but I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Lots of little pearls in each section, there are about 3 sizes though...maybe 1 size filling up 3 of the slots per size? But that&#x27;s okay, the pearls are wonderful and I love wearing them/decorating my nails with them.&lt;br /&gt;Only small problem i had is that when i first got it, somehow the pearls were static-y? They were sticking to the top of the case and whatnot, and when I opened the slot, they literally, I mean literally flew out and some stuck in bunches. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s due to static or something like that --it only occured with the very smallest of the pearls though. Besides that incident, everything is fine!</li>
            <li> there pretty but not at all happy with how many where in the pack definitely not what it says or shows ! wouldn&#x27;t not buy again</li>
            <li> Shipment came quicker than projected, package was sealed so no chance of lost pearls.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect varying sizes to make any manicure stand out.  Now that I have them in hand, I just wish that I would have bought a couple... THEY ARE PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for</li>
            <li> Definitely not as many little pearls as pictured above!!! It did take a little while to come in and I was disappointed to see it wasn&#x27;t as many as the picture showed BUT they were pretty cheap and they had a good variety of sizes ..I guess I can order again.. Unless someone else can tell me where I can find a vendor that will actually send what they put in the picture!</li>
            <li> I got the item on the expected date and the item is in a good confition just like how it look in the image!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very cute! I haven&#x27;t used them yet &amp; im not sure when I will I bought them cause I had an idea for them I just can&#x27;t remember ! Oh well I&#x27;ll figure something out (:</li>
            <li> A little hard to use this item for nail art since it does not always stick on the first time.</li>
            <li> The pearls aren&#x27;t quite as lustrous as the photo but overall I&#x27;m happy. Sized I got were just under 2mm, 3mm, and 5mm.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t count to see how many were actually in here but their is a lot! I like how one end is flat so that it sticks. Great buy!</li>
            <li> these pearls are awesome for nail decorating and small crafts. i have found many come joined together and is a pain to break apart, but not these ones!</li>
            <li> I like these pearls. They&#x27;re all different sizes. They don&#x27;t break easily. I wish they were a little bigger though because I ordered these to put on some phone cases</li>
            <li> I can not wait to see the amazing nail art that my daughter and I can create using all this fun nail stuff!!!</li>
            <li> These are nice quality, very pretty and a great price. They did take a little long to get here, but look how far its coming from.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest getting the little wax-tip pencil made for picking up tiny things like this. It works great and leaves no residue or sticky spots on the teeny stars and stuff.</li>
            <li> The container is much smaller than it looks</li>
            <li> They come in a variety of sizes and can be used for practically anything and everything with the right glue.</li>
            <li> I received my product very quickly. I wish the wheel was bigger. They have a variety of sizes. I used the pearlos to create a bow on my accent nails. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments. I would definately buy again from this seller</li>
            <li> The big ones are ok. , but they are plastic and not pearls at all and the small one are like dust they are stones, real joke</li>
            <li> Diamonds are diamonds I guess</li>
            <li> Good thing was that I got it before the expected date. About a week early. It came in its little bag and the wheel was in perfect shape. There were a few things I did not like: 1) not as many pearls as in picture but there is decent amount for a few uses on your nail art 2) they are messy. They kept sticking to top of wheel so when I turn it, pearls go into different slots with different sizes. 3) they stick to your hands.... veryyy easy. Becareful and not to spill them. A decent buy for the price. Although, I will think a lot in buying them again. Would have given 4 stars but the fact that they go into different slots, I really didnt like that.</li>
            <li> great! I would recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> These are so pretty. I have not opened them yet but I already love them.</li>
            <li> Great value and variety</li>
            <li> These were much smaller then I thought, but overall all I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> Product arrived earlier than expected, but container was crushed and many of the pearl had fallen out. The pearls themselves are great, easy to apply (you can even just use a top coat) and last a long time. Well-priced, but not very many are in each container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m always a bit afraid to order items like these from China. There are always reviews complaining about how it took longer than estimated to arrive and how there are a lot less stones than pictured. But the one I received not only came in 10 days early, it looks like it has more than the picture. All in all, I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s okay I guess. Not a bunch of different sizes. There are 2 sizes. Mini and large.. That&#x27;s it. Plus it&#x27;s hard to open.</li>
            <li> I love pearls. These pearls are awesome because of the flat back, its very easy to use while placing on anyones nails.&lt;br /&gt;Def a most buy!!</li>
            <li> Excellent, it came earlier than expected and it looks beautiful. The wheel comes with a variety of different sizes.</li>
            <li> Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
            <li> Cannot express how low quality and tacky these look. Horrible appearance and looks horrific on your nails. Not worth the wasted money or disappointment</li>
            <li> Beautiful, organized, and exactly what I wanted! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> The product was smaller than I expected and didn&#x27;t have as many pearls as pictured. However I can still use them and I do recommend them if you&#x27;re ok with not having so many...</li>
            <li> work very well. But i don&#x27;t like it very much on my finger nails, because after working on  the job or around the house they fall off.</li>
            <li> They were a bit smaller then I expected but they are still super cute. The flat back and different sizes make them very easy and fun to work with.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of sizes. I use them often for Chanel inspired nails and for many other designs. Thank you. I love them</li>
            <li> I loved them when I saw them, but when I used them some of them faded the color so you can not notice then on the nail, I tried again and the way to try to keep the color is just to place a drop of top coat ever it and after is dry apply the real top coat to the whole nail.</li>
            <li> Nice nail art with various rhinestones.</li>
            <li> Very cute. Love the different sizes. The quality and the quantity were great. Some of the smaller sizes didnt seem to have as many though.</li>
            <li> It comes with 3 sizes, and sticks well on your nail.  Lots of patterns can be achieved with the different sizes.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the pearl colouring coming off.</li>
            <li> Was smaller then expected, but I was hoping it would turn out that way.&lt;br /&gt;Came over a week earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering from the same provider and I LOVE it! The product gets here very quickly and everything is just as they say/describe. I love my pearls and they&#x27;re at such an amazing price!</li>
            <li> They fall off really easily if you try to use nail glue or just regular nail polish to keep them on however if you have someone use acrylic/shellac it would work.</li>
            <li> far from full, has about maybe 15 of each size. still cute but I thought it would be full</li>
            <li> This item is a bit disappointing., The pearl rhinestones are so tiny...very very small. but they are cute...I just wished they were a tad bit bigger...</li>
            <li> i love them on my nailt and my phone cases great complements on both i will be ordering again soon</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
            <li> I like the variety of pearl sizes however it is a struggle to turn the wheel. Besides that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> My best friend and i order these together. Her pearls were a shiny super white color. But when I got mine. They were a yellow funky color. I haven&#x27;t used them yet. Kinda mad because I was excited to get these.</li>
            <li> These look very nice in the picture, but when i actually used it for my nails, the white pearl faded away in less than a week. I wish the pearl would stay pearly white instead of fading as the days go by. This product is definitely what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet but item was just as described, and all little sections of the try look full.  Awesome-can&#x27;t wait to try!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  received them 10days before estimated delivery.  A bit disappointed with the variety of sizes,  theres just two, extra small and small ( not like in the picture) they are not a bright white pearl, more on the creamy yellowish pearl side other than that I&#x27;m super pleased with shipping,  packaging and the product itself</li>
            <li> I love the pearls!!!!! I just got them in the mail yesterday, and I used them today and they work great. Just make sure you have tweezers to pick the gems up. Everything was great Except that it took a little longer to come in the mail, But I guess that&#x27;s ok because I think they shipped from Hong Kong, I&#x27;m not sure but somewhere in china, and I live in the United States. So I get why it would take a little longer arrived. LOVE THEM!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are so fun to play with! I really love them! Thank you for the great customer service and everything that you do!!!!</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size for my nail art.  Maybe make wheel a little larger but love them, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this product the most but dislike that they are like all unorganized but i still love it using it!</li>
            <li> got the to do nails and they work great...lots of sizes...they make any mani pop...warning if you put too much on one nail they look like boils or warts...i got a couple of comments...lol</li>
            <li> Love these! Perfect variety of sizes for beginners.  There&#x27;s not as many as the picture shows, but still a GREAT price. I need more. I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be larger, however they are very cute and work great.  I wish the would put sizes in the description.</li>
            <li> These came not just in the round shape in varying sizes, but also in heart shape in varying sizes, which I LOVE! They&#x27;re adorable!</li>
            <li> i cant tell u how happy i am with this purchase. i m beginner when it comes nail designs but i m learning it so fast and it became passion with time.these pearls are so nice and it comes in many different sizes from very tiny to fairly big. very good quality and u will love doing designs with them. love them</li>
            <li> The pictures are deceiving.  The picture make it look like its full but when you receive it its only about half full.  Have not heard from the seller.</li>
            <li> Yes I love them and they come in all sizes so you can fill in the lil spaces!! Awesome deal</li>
            <li> theyre exactly what is shown in the pic. some got mixed up in the other slots but thats no ones fault. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> The wheel was much smaller than I expected and when you open it the pearls just pop everywhere. The design ideas that I could use the pearls for are endless but I probably won&#x27;t bother because I won&#x27;t want to deal with the aggravation.</li>
            <li> I use these for my craft projects.  Range in size from 2mm to 3mm.  The wheel is difficult to turn and will find yourself with pearls all over the place.  Not fun picking them up.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. For what she tells me it is a really nice addition to her nail decoration</li>
            <li> Love these they came very quickly about 7 days! They have many sizes and are exactly what I was hoping for! Such a great deal for the money!</li>
            <li> these flat- back pearls are beautiful, very dainty design. so far, i have done many designs for spring and winter. very easy to use, add beauty to regular nails</li>
            <li> beautiful pearls as described</li>
            <li> I think these will do very nicely for my nail art. The sizes from small to large are cute and not showy in any way. I would repurchase these.</li>
            <li> Caution: This product does not arrive as shown on the picture. When it arrived all of the little pearls were spread everywhere, including even outside small wheel and some even falling out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> its over $1 for this crap and its smaller the than the palm of my hand, it should cost no more than 5 cents or something..and the people even gave me a refund just to delete my bad feedback on this product..pshh better give me something free or something. not worth it, not enough in it and way too tiny</li>
            <li> While I do not know how many are in this wheel, for the price, it is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the pearly sheen they have and the fact that the sizes are in a good variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought angled tweezers to apply these with. Also, I use gel polish to put these on with. A gel coat will not solidify unless cured under a UV lamp. After applying a thin coat, the stones can be moved around until it&#x27;s cured. This makes is much easier than using glue or regular polish.</li>
            <li> I LOVED THESE MULTI SIZED PEARLS.  I USED THEM FAST TOO. I WOULD BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Showed up early and the colors are brilliant!</li>
            <li> I love then now I was sure at first they look very big but I tried there tiny and just as promised. love them love the wheels there in</li>
            <li> but they are very small other wise it was a great deal and fast shipping. Havent tried them yet.  Look forward to doing my nail art</li>
            <li> Good product. Especially for the price. Use them for mail art. Just wish the purchase could have came sooner. It took a long time to come.</li>
            <li> this item was just as described i like that it has all the different sizes because it helps add more dynamics to the design.</li>
            <li> Different sized pearls in a wheel carry case.  It&#x27;s a good deal and you get exactly what&#x27;s shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> i really love it .. it came right on time. an they all are different size.if  you 3D stuff you should really get it !!:)</li>
            <li> assorted pearls for nail decorating , let your inmagination go and you can do ...whatever lol. yes I would recomend this.</li>
            <li> These are exactly as shown. The pearls are adorable and come in various sizes.  I put them on when I do my gel manicures and love the look.</li>
            <li> I love these for my nails!!! They&#x27;re smaller than the picture, but I think they&#x27;re perfect so I ordered two more!!</li>
            <li> The pearls are nice though I thought they may be a little shinier and the wheel would be bigger!! but I&#x27;m okay with how they are!! , great size for any type nail!! You could use it for the phone to! Might need to order two for the phone!!! Think that&#x27;s what immas do!!!</li>
            <li> I enjoy nail art and bought these beads on a whim. Although they took a while to arrive from Asia (I believe they came from Hong Kong), the product is as described and easy to use. I recommend applying them with gel super glue to your gel nail polish BEFORE curing then applying the top coat for added strength.</li>
            <li> I purchased these with the skulls and the colored pearls and I love them all!  The white pearls are an added extra for doing french or floral designs.</li>
            <li> i liked them but the only thing I thought they were bigger but they came in good condition and were a perfect white color</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail. It does take a long time to ship and I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s because its from out of the country, but worth the wait. I love the different sizes which gives me more chances to change up my creaativity.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these little beauties YET but they are lovely and look like pearls! I am planning on using them for makeup looks, art projects and nails! Excited to get playing around!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these because i knew i was going to run out. I gave it a 3 because one of the paks had plenty while the other pak only had like 8 in each section. It only has a little</li>
            <li> The item came almost 1 month later. Couldnt believe at what I got ! Cheap pearls came in a very little amount. I even could count how many tiny cheap pearls they got me. Totally not like what they showed in their picture. I wish I could rate 0 star. Someone tell me how to post a picture here, I ll show you.</li>
            <li> The items are very good in the variety of sizes but the pearl paint comes off rather easy even if putting a protective clear coat on top. Be very careful when painting over top of the jewel so that the pearl essence does not brush off.</li>
            <li> It was cute but it was ok I wasn&#x27;t about the color. but what  ever they were cheap.  I guess they were worth it</li>
            <li> I love these so much! The quality is so nice for the price. They will look so cute on my nails, can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using these, they turned out marvelously :) The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the pearly paint chips off after a while but I am fine with that considering the price :)</li>
            <li> Nice pearl effect on them, perfect flat backs, and a wide assortment of sizes to choose from. Perfect for a beginner and professional nail tech or at home nail stylist!!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when purchasing these because I wanted to get a quality item. I received them VERY quickly (the estimated arrival was Feb 13 to Feb 21 and I received them January 30). They are what I expected, plastic pearl looking gems with a flat back. There is only three sizes but I am okay with that! The only thing is that they are soooo static-y in their package that when you open it they sometimes jump out! But it&#x27;s okay since I paid like 20 something cents for these plus shipping they equaled about a dollar. I am satisfied for paying pocket change! Some people complained that there weren&#x27;t very many but I ordered 2 of these and there is a good amount in each of them, especially since there is 3 sizes you get quite a few of each.</li>
            <li> The wheel pictured made it look a lot bigger than it really is. It is smaller than the palm of my hand and I only received about 300 pearls. I was expecting them to be smaller, but these were a bit difficult to handle because of their size. They&#x27;re still cute, and I can still use it to decorate.</li>
            <li> Love the multiple colors. Goes well with nail dssign, especially with the colored pearls. Lasts a long time, multiple use</li>
            <li> Terrific, just as advertised</li>
            <li> There is a good variety of sizes.  The container is made well to keep the sizes segregated.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to actually use then yet but so far I like them.</li>
            <li> The quality of pearls are as expected for the price, on the third day the top iridescent layer came out on most pearls even though I covered them with CND brisa lite top coat. I mean for the price, it is a good product and I will repurchase pearls as soon as I am done with these one, and it seems that they will be gone very fast for the wheel contains less product then pictured, and the wheel is very small, but again for the price, it is ok...I like the affect pearls create on the nails, especially when combined with rhinestones, JEWEL MANIA!</li>
            <li> Pearls came a little different then shown in the picture and clearly there are not as many pearls as there are in the picture but for the price it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. Came packaged in a wheel so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time on a recent manicure that I created and it turn out great &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use these! They are such pretty little pearl like gems in different sizes. Not very many in each side but for the price, it&#x27;s good. You do have to wait a long time for delivery but they still came before last day promised.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re are this little bitty pearls that you can&#x27;t even see on a phone case. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again ever</li>
            <li> the pearls got here quickly and look great. Pretty easy to get to stay on. Everyone will be jealous of your nails!</li>
            <li> These are very cute on the nails. The pearls are very glossy.  Also very fast shipping. Only one small negative, maybe it was my fault for not reading the description, but the wheel is on the small side. I have previously purchased color rhime stone wheels, and were way bigger than this one. Although well worth it for the price I paid. Overall happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time. I love how they look on my nails. Especially the smaller ones. If you are buying these I would recommend getting the pencil to pick them up with. The pencil makes bead/pearl placement so easy. It picks them up and holds the bead for you to get them in place where you want them.</li>
            <li> I waited for over a month to get this in (which I usually don&#x27;t mind) but then I finally get it, and the package was open (not the yellow envelope from the PO but the clear package that the wheel is actually in) there are literally only 37 pearls in it, only 3 different sizes, well really I should say two because I only have 3 of the smallest size. There was a piece of grass or something in the wheel.. making me think maybe it was dropped and someone just picked up what pearls they could?? Either way I am VERY unsatisfied and DO NOT recommend..</li>
            <li> the peaces were all mixed up in the wheel</li>
            <li> I must have read the sizing wrong I thought it would be a tad bit bigger:(</li>
            <li> Love the different sizes and the bottom is dull so glue can adhere well to the nail. I will probably order more soon.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet, I KNOW they will work great because I bought a similar product that works just the same. I love the fact that there are three different sizes of these pearls. The quantity is great for the price I paid. I can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. Pleased.</li>
            <li> this nail wheel comes packed with pearls! there are an assortment of sizes to create different looks and they all look very cute!</li>
            <li> I love love love these so much that I&#x27;m actually considering using pearls from now on instead of stones. They are so cute and sophisticated looking. I tried them on my toes, and not one has fallen off since I did them two weeks ago. I haven&#x27;t tried them on my fingers, but I will update this review once I do. I do my hair a lot, so I&#x27;d be shocked if they stay on as long as my toes do with the heavy use of my hands.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my purchase! These pearls are adorable, and I can&#x27;t wait to see what cute designs I can create now that I have these!</li>
            <li> The picture shows different sizes but I only received one size in each slot. It certainly didnt have as many as showed but for the price it is worth it. It also came very quickly.</li>
            <li> Got it very fast wish the wheel was bigger and had more pearls then I got but still very nice selection of sizes going to use soon!!</li>
            <li> I wanted all circled pearls which is What they show You in the picture. But it was not . It h HDTV as all types of shapes that I could use</li>
            <li> I love it i just hate that they dont stay shine long!</li>
            <li> Everything is great except that the actual product has way less of pearls than the image shows. You know, you cant see the bottom of each section on the wheel in the image but you definitely can in the actual product. I can count the number of pearls in my wheel.</li>
            <li> Came early and just like the picture. I like them. (:</li>
            <li> Just what i was hoping they would be. Nice!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I guess just not something I would buy again.</li>
            <li> love that these pearls came in different sizes. good quality for a great price!</li>
            <li> Heads up, they&#x27;re not just for nails. I decorated a shirt I made and also my cell phone cover.</li>
            <li> Its kinda small. its about a thumbs length across, but it works! Im a nail artist by night, and I ordered these to try out at a sleepover party. I suggest applying with tweezers, and finishing with a topcoat. they come off easily, but they&#x27;re worth the price if your looking for something to easily make your nails a little more glam!</li>
            <li> waaaaayyyy too small  not worth it i have no idea what i am going to use them for.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was expecting something different but these are almost to small to even use I cant get a grip on them.</li>
            <li> I love it! I cant wait to use them! so worth the cost, &amp; the wait, trust me!&lt;br /&gt;Im sure I will be ordering more, from this company sometime in the future. Thank u!</li>
            <li> .I just got these in the mail today and they were packaged very well and tight. Although the wheel could have been bigger and had more pearls in it, it was still an amazing deal and it came VERY early.It is also SUPER easy to open unlike cheeky! I will buy from this seller again and I think I might buy the actual item again. Don&#x27;t listen to the other comments these are awesome and adorable.</li>
            <li> I love this assortment of pearls! The spinning wheel provides a nice storage. Just wished it was more pearls, cuz you can never get enough of pearls.</li>
            <li> cheap quality. You get what you pay.</li>
            <li> I love these pearls, they come in a variety of sizes.  They are perfect! I only wish that there were more of them.</li>
            <li> These are fine for the purpose they were made for, I guess. However, I had hoped to use them for more of a craft supply, in card making. These are TINY. I am not sure most of them could even be used on nails. They are so tiny they would be very difficult to pick up to use.</li>
            <li> I love these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-So many different sizes and shapes&lt;br /&gt;-Helpful dispenser&lt;br /&gt;-Hold well on the nail&lt;br /&gt;-Look great!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to get a hold of</li>
            <li> The pearls in the package are extremely small. I feel as though the picture is misleading. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Beautiful pearls. I luv the teeny ones..Theyre 2mm. My package came with 3 sizes and I got a total of 253. 178 of the 2mm, 50 of 3mm and 25 of 4mm size. Def worth the money.</li>
            <li> exactly as described thought there would be more but its okay because it was cheaoer then most</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the merchandise I&#x27;ve purchesed</li>
            <li> Very good prices for getting so many(: got these a while ago and still haven&#x27;t ran out</li>
            <li> I love these pearls! I use them on my nails all the time and they stay on perfectly! Love love!!</li>
            <li> im satisfied with this product. the assortment is fine, and the product doesnt look cheap, cant wait to use them</li>
            <li> came like shown, shipping took forever.. i almost forgot about the item</li>
            <li> I have ordered several things from different sellers in far away places for nail art......this is the first purchase I have not been happy with. There were barely any beads in it!</li>
            <li> This product is worth the buy. It really add class to the nail art. And the varity is so convent.</li>
            <li> the pic makes it look like there is alot more than there is, but it might just be because they were kinda piled up on eachother</li>
            <li> When I opened the package I was disappointed by the size of pearls. I also question the amount of pearls to be what they claim is in there. I still used them on my nails tho. I will not reorder.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price and fast shipping!!!!</li>
            <li> Sizes aren&#x27;t that variant, but I like them :) shipping is long, so don&#x27;t expect them in under 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Arrived before time and beautiful!</li>
            <li> These are great for nails.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good. Not 100% what I expected them to be, but they do the job well.</li>
            <li> These are so fun for using on my nails but I have also decorated a bunch of other things with them. They are so cute and come with such variety. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Love them. Adds color to nails.</li>
            <li> This is great to add a little something to your plain nailpolish</li>
