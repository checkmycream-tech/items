            <li> kinda wide the white tip goes all the way down to my nail bed because of the shape because my nails are smaller</li>
            <li> These did, but I also ordered d the 500 duck feet shaped nails and received the wrong nails not happy because those were the ones I was really excited about and got the wrong thing and didnt send them back because to big of a hassle</li>
            <li> We like because the tip is thin that why we need</li>
