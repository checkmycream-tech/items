    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The Fonz has nothing on me now that I have these excellent combs on me!</li>
            <li>And the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; seemed to be fused together, so weren&#x27;t the best for their intended use.&lt;br /&gt;Splurge, and buy descent combs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If these combs were on a baseball team they would be the best utility players you&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>These however are perfect</li>
            <li>Ive been telling myself for years that my hair looks best when i walk out of the Barbers</li>
            <li>But for what they are they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li>I go, and these were perfect!</li>
            <li>Probably the best quality to price ratio of any comb I&#x27;ve come accross.</li>
            <li>Great add on to get Prime shipping with and you need some!</li>
            <li>His is also in perfect tact.</li>

            <li>They&#x27;re a great buy when they&#x27;re on sale.</li>
            <li>Very handy and fits in pant pockets.</li>
            <li>so it works out very nicely.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t look good, they don&#x27;t look good.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They do their job for a good price.</li>
            <li>Also the price seemed to be a good one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact design sets for ease of use, and travel capabilities, without taking away from its superior qualities in terms of hair styling.</li>
            <li>Good combs my husband loves his.</li>
            <li>So, I thought these would be of good quality.  </li>
            <li>and they seem fairly durable.</li>
            <li>Nice price, two great combs</li>
            <li>For the price that you pay for it, and knowing that these are combs, these are good for the price.</li>
            <li>Good set of combs.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>The two Vidal Sassoon combs I purchased through Amazon are good quality products.</li>
            <li>They go through my hair without pulling it out by the roots and leave it in good shape</li>
            <li>They seem to stand up to a fair amount of abuse.</li>
            <li>but it is good for what it does.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good spare combs to take around with you.</li>
            <li>Good to order a bunch for when you lose your combs.</li>
            <li>Good plastic-y pocket comb.</li>
            <li>Excellent comb really made my hair look great.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described and received in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>lovely combs!</li>
            <li>Good size,  very cheap and have held up nicely for me.</li>
            <li>Oh, and they&#x27;re cheap, LOL</li>
            <li>I will be recommending this amazing product to all of my close friends and family.</li>
            <li>These are nice combs,</li>
            <li>You better off with a good ole GOODY comb you can get about anywhere.</li>
            <li>an effective, inexpensive comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild hair is no match, when the plastic teeth are on attack.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good combs, perfect for travelling, and also good for a daily use.</li>
            <li>He likes the comb and feels it slides through his hair without catching.  </li>
            <li>All of my reviews are written by me, and are my own opinions.</li>
            <li>It just sits there when you could have used that money towards that nice knife set you</li>
            <li>These combs are nothing special, but for the price they are great.</li>
            <li>a good pocket comb like this should have more bristles to accommodate more hair.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to operate, and do not require instructions.</li>
            <li>I am sure over time it will be ok!</li>
            <li>Keep em clean and they&#x27;ll keep you looking good.</li>
            <li>I was able to very easily bend the combs and the teeth to the point where I felt like they would probably break.  </li>
            <li>These will get the job done, but are made of very cheap feeling plastic -- If I had to do it over again, I&#x27;d just buy combs from the store, I would have been more satisfied.</li>
            <li>I use it to comb my hair, the hair that&#x27;s on top of my head.</li>
            <li>Love these combs.</li>
            <li>Nothing more to be said.</li>
            <li>Cheap but nice combs.</li>
            <li>so your hair comes in more separated strands.  </li>
            <li>You ever think about how many words there are that end with &amp;#34;omb&amp;#34; that don&#x27;t rhyme?</li>
            <li>Just like the free ones from school picture day!</li>
            <li>The hair shaping capability of this product is outstanding.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend finds it sexy.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re combs, what more is there to be written...</li>
            <li>these combs are in fact OK.</li>
            <li>still okay</li>
            <li>quality pocket comb from a reputable source.</li>
            <li>What more is there to expect from a comb?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend, it&#x27;s a tad better than the cheapies at Walmart/Target.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>If I wouldn&#x27;t have shaved my head about 2 months after buying these, I would have probably bought 2 more orders, because I literally leave them everywhere, on the bathroom sink, on my desk, by my bed, in my pocket (goes through the laundry), and in my car.</li>
            <li>As Gertrude said: \\&quot;A comb is a comb is a comb,\\&quot; what more could I add.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll have to do till I buy a better one.</li>
            <li>If anyone has any questions for me feel free to ask!</li>
            <li>What more of a review do you want?  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s my ticket to a more adventurous life in retirement.  </li>
            <li>Wish the plastic were more rounded at the tips</li>
            <li>Good use out of these, still using the first one.</li>
            <li>They all have beautiful hair, but it still needs to be combed from time to time to keep that wild side in check.  </li>
            <li>Great cheap comb, can&#x27;t really beat the price</li>
            <li>I bought these as an add on and have been happy with them so far.</li>
            <li>I would have given it a lower rating, except that it is an add-on item and cheap, and are better than using your fingers to comb your hair.</li>
            <li>Nothing to get excited about, just glad I still need one at 76.</li>
            <li>easily lost tho.</li>
            <li>Easily.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for combs that won&#x27;t break easily, these are not the ones for you.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to work with this shipper.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t break easily either-</li>
            <li>They are strong, as I flexed them and they did not break.</li>
            <li>These are great and look nice, but the teeth break off a little more easily than I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>Real cheap, exactly what you would expect and would be looking for.</li>
            <li>but my daughter with fine hair looks a lot prettier when I use these</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for cheap combs that you can easily replace, these are the ones for you, but if you want something that will hold up, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Needed something with relatively fine teeth that I could use with beard trimmers.  </li>
            <li>Thank you to amazon for getting this out to me so quick!</li>
            <li>This is literally the thinnest, narrowest, cheaply made comb I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>If you want to comb your hair on the cheap, these are the way to go.</li>
            <li>I can fit this into my pocket and and take it out whenever my hair gets out of place.</li>
            <li>The size is correct but they are somewhat flexible and made of a cheap material.  </li>
            <li>They comb, but they feel cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dirt cheap</li>
            <li>Combs were cheap in price and quality.</li>
            <li>Cheap price, but</li>
            <li>Flimsy, pointy, cheap.  </li>
            <li>Scratchy and cheap.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s cheap, so</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic pocket comb.</li>
            <li>They felt and look cheap.  </li>
            <li>but they are good quality so far</li>
            <li>Until I shaved my head, these were very useful.</li>
            <li>So these things are very useful for their price, and how convenient it is for them to arrive at your doorstep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, look cheap but was not expecting much about this</li>
            <li>They are professional and always love to help!   </li>
            <li>nice looking comb, they fit well in a back packet or front shirt, well made and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Great price and expected quality.</li>
            <li>These seemed like such a good deal.</li>
            <li>This was a good value for your standard men&#x27;s comb.  </li>
            <li>Loving them so far.</li>
            <li>I left my good comb in a golf card a month or so ago and since then I have bought 5 combs trying to find a satisfactory one to replace the lost on.  </li>
            <li>so it would be more gentle on the head.</li>
            <li>The first comb works fine, sure, it allows you to rearrange the hairs on your head just the way you like, and it certainly works a heck of a lot better than the old piece of cereal box I was using before.  </li>
            <li>These two are almost exactly like the cheap 59 cent comb</li>
            <li>The size is nice and good enough to take with you in a back pocket...</li>
            <li>If only I were more adventurous, more care-free, living my life to the fullest, I would have lost that first comb by now, broken in some wild skirmish, lost on some spontaneous trip to Europe, stolen by some beautiful ex-girlfriend...  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s many closely set teeth work far more effectively than your wide set five pronged hands.</li>
            <li>These comes are very rear to fine at my hometown (leaving overseas)</li>
            <li>These little combs are great.  </li>
            <li>The plastic is very flimsy and cheap.  </li>
            <li>These are useful to keep in car.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed, price is right.</li>
            <li>Well, they were shipped out right away in time for me to put them in all three of my grandsons&#x27; Christmas stockings.  </li>
            <li>Teeth aren&#x27;t too sharp (or blunt) and it works exactly like he wants it too - great comb.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much more to it than that, lol.</li>
            <li>Pocket Combs don&#x27;t get much cheaper, but it&#x27;s that kind of cheapyness that feels like these combs will last longer than me, you know.</li>
            <li>Good, solid (as far as plastic goes) pocket combs.</li>
            <li>These combs are okay but not as good as the old ACE hard rubber combs</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vidal Sassoon, a first name in hair care.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;If</li>
            <li>Exactly the type of comb I want to keep in my front jeans pockets.</li>
            <li>A first class product.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described...can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure he would be honored to use combs such as this.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these just to get to free-shipping level, but, to my surprise, these combs are sturdier, yet more flexible, than your basic, checkout-counter comb!</li>
            <li>Why is the price 3 times higher?</li>
            <li>I found these pretty flmsy.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re similar in quality to Walgreens&#x27; 50 cent combs, perhaps slightly better.</li>
            <li>and now I can easy come my hair and not having to use the brush several times a day.</li>
            <li>These certainly get the job done though.</li>
            <li>What can I say about these nice little pocket combs?  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight and flexible.</li>
            <li>Very serviceable, meets expectations.</li>
            <li>Who wants one comb when they can have two?  </li>
            <li>Expected more from a name brand.</li>
            <li>These combs are so much the bomb that I plan to take them to my tomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not so, these are very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>SO VERY WELL.</li>
            <li>It was not what I expected, I should have read the web site better.</li>
            <li>This makes it so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was fast.</li>
            <li>They show very enlarge pic of this item.</li>
            <li>Did you really NEED two??  </li>
            <li>/&gt;they are not awesome, but they are good and cheap</li>
            <li>He uses a thick pomade and they are still in good shape.</li>
            <li>Small enough to fit into my back-pocket and flexible to fit comfortable.</li>
            <li>But I LOATHE going into stores, and after quickly checking two stores and not finding any, went on Amazon and found them with free Prime shppg in less than a minute.</li>
            <li>My old ones (different brand) would chip a lot and break easily.</li>
            <li>main reason for getting - I am always losing my combs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so he could quit cleaning his older ones.  </li>
            <li>The first time I bought them I was pleased, just as other reviewers were, with a reasonable price for a simple item.  </li>
            <li>May be fine for short hair that barely needs a comb.</li>
            <li>This is a bit rough when combing, I have to smooth it out by polishing on some surface.</li>
            <li>Would probably pay a few more bucks for a sturdier product.</li>
            <li>Good combs for the car or your pocket... not to big or small</li>
            <li>They work fine, and aren&#x27;t too sharp, but I won&#x27;t be buying them again.</li>
            <li>I like that these combs are actually quite flexible (as combs go) such that they don&#x27;t break and I don&#x27;t even notice them in my pocket as they flex easily when I sit.</li>
            <li>And yet I&#x27;m too stubborn to give it to charity; it&#x27;s a perplexity I cannot live without until I solve it.  </li>
            <li>Combs are flimsy and not very well made - they kind of work but not very well.</li>
            <li>These cheap combs actually work better than any of the expensive combs/brushes I have bought.  </li>
            <li>I really just wanted some simple but sturdy combs that I can bring with me everywhere</li>
            <li>Kookie from &#x27;77 Sunset Strip alive today</li>
            <li>If you bend them too far, they will break, imagine that.</li>
            <li>If you do not bend them too far, they do not break, imagine that.</li>
            <li>Made in the millions at some factory in sub-Saharan Africa, or a far flung corner of Asia this one comes with Vidal Sassoon branding.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy plastic, no broken teeth after a month of daily use.</li>
            <li>(we use them for my 3 year old).</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t look like the Wild Man From Borneo.</li>
            <li>There are times I gain some confidence from it, knowing that as long as it still sits there I haven&#x27;t been so reckless as to have lost the first comb.  </li>
            <li>Must be getting old...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough for easy use, but small enough to fit in your pocket.  </li>
            <li>They work great, and ever after being in my pocket with other things for weeks, none of the teeth have broken off.  </li>
            <li>I thought it is decent size if not regular size.</li>
            <li>Decent quality and definitely gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I need new ones is I manage o lose teh old ones.</li>
            <li>Two, small, cheap, plastic combs.</li>
            <li>They are small and cheap</li>
            <li>I expected a little better since the Vidal Sassoon name was attached.</li>
            <li>The opinions expressed here should not be taken as any legal or medical advise these are just my personal experiences/opinions. </li>
            <li>These are exactly what you think they are and work just like every other one like it.</li>
            <li>higher quality, well-finished, stronger) that your average 25 cent comb at the drug store.</li>
            <li>Cheap, expected, but these are really cheap, like very thin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the difference between a good comb and a bad one.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The Fonz has nothing on me now that I have these excellent combs on me!</li>
            <li> And the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; seemed to be fused together, so weren&#x27;t the best for their intended use.&lt;br /&gt;Splurge, and buy descent combs.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I go, and these were perfect!</li>
            <li> Probably the best quality to price ratio of any comb I&#x27;ve come accross.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re a great buy when they&#x27;re on sale.</li>
            <li> Very handy and fits in pant pockets.</li>
            <li> so it works out very nicely.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t look good, they don&#x27;t look good.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They do their job for a good price.</li>
            <li> Also the price seemed to be a good one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact design sets for ease of use, and travel capabilities, without taking away from its superior qualities in terms of hair styling.</li>
            <li> Good combs my husband loves his.</li>
            <li> So, I thought these would be of good quality.  </li>
            <li> and they seem fairly durable.</li>
            <li> Nice price, two great combs</li>
            <li> For the price that you pay for it, and knowing that these are combs, these are good for the price.</li>
            <li> Good set of combs.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> The two Vidal Sassoon combs I purchased through Amazon are good quality products.</li>
            <li> They go through my hair without pulling it out by the roots and leave it in good shape</li>
            <li> They seem to stand up to a fair amount of abuse.</li>
            <li> but it is good for what it does.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good spare combs to take around with you.</li>
            <li> Good to order a bunch for when you lose your combs.</li>
            <li> Good plastic-y pocket comb.</li>
            <li> Excellent comb really made my hair look great.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described and received in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> lovely combs!</li>
            <li> Good size,  very cheap and have held up nicely for me.</li>
            <li> Oh, and they&#x27;re cheap, LOL</li>
            <li> I will be recommending this amazing product to all of my close friends and family.</li>
            <li> These are nice combs,</li>
            <li> You better off with a good ole GOODY comb you can get about anywhere.</li>
            <li> an effective, inexpensive comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild hair is no match, when the plastic teeth are on attack.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good combs, perfect for travelling, and also good for a daily use.</li>
            <li> He likes the comb and feels it slides through his hair without catching.  </li>
            <li> All of my reviews are written by me, and are my own opinions.</li>
            <li> It just sits there when you could have used that money towards that nice knife set you</li>
            <li> These combs are nothing special, but for the price they are great.</li>
            <li> a good pocket comb like this should have more bristles to accommodate more hair.</li>
            <li> They are very easy to operate, and do not require instructions.</li>
            <li> I am sure over time it will be ok!</li>
            <li> Keep em clean and they&#x27;ll keep you looking good.</li>
            <li> I was able to very easily bend the combs and the teeth to the point where I felt like they would probably break.  </li>
            <li> These will get the job done, but are made of very cheap feeling plastic -- If I had to do it over again, I&#x27;d just buy combs from the store, I would have been more satisfied.</li>
            <li> I use it to comb my hair, the hair that&#x27;s on top of my head.</li>
            <li> Love these combs.</li>
            <li> Nothing more to be said.</li>
            <li> Cheap but nice combs.</li>
            <li> so your hair comes in more separated strands.  </li>
            <li> You ever think about how many words there are that end with &amp;#34;omb&amp;#34; that don&#x27;t rhyme?</li>
            <li> Just like the free ones from school picture day!</li>
            <li> The hair shaping capability of this product is outstanding.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend finds it sexy.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re combs, what more is there to be written...</li>
            <li> these combs are in fact OK.</li>
            <li> still okay</li>
            <li> quality pocket comb from a reputable source.</li>
            <li> What more is there to expect from a comb?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend, it&#x27;s a tad better than the cheapies at Walmart/Target.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> If I wouldn&#x27;t have shaved my head about 2 months after buying these, I would have probably bought 2 more orders, because I literally leave them everywhere, on the bathroom sink, on my desk, by my bed, in my pocket (goes through the laundry), and in my car.</li>
            <li> As Gertrude said: \\&quot;A comb is a comb is a comb,\\&quot; what more could I add.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll have to do till I buy a better one.</li>
            <li> If anyone has any questions for me feel free to ask!</li>
            <li> What more of a review do you want?  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s my ticket to a more adventurous life in retirement.  </li>
            <li> Wish the plastic were more rounded at the tips</li>
            <li> Good use out of these, still using the first one.</li>
            <li> They all have beautiful hair, but it still needs to be combed from time to time to keep that wild side in check.  </li>
            <li> Great cheap comb, can&#x27;t really beat the price</li>
            <li> I bought these as an add on and have been happy with them so far.</li>
            <li> I would have given it a lower rating, except that it is an add-on item and cheap, and are better than using your fingers to comb your hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing to get excited about, just glad I still need one at 76.</li>
            <li> easily lost tho.</li>
            <li> Easily.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for combs that won&#x27;t break easily, these are not the ones for you.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to work with this shipper.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t break easily either-</li>
            <li> They are strong, as I flexed them and they did not break.</li>
            <li> These are great and look nice, but the teeth break off a little more easily than I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> Real cheap, exactly what you would expect and would be looking for.</li>
            <li> but my daughter with fine hair looks a lot prettier when I use these</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for cheap combs that you can easily replace, these are the ones for you, but if you want something that will hold up, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Needed something with relatively fine teeth that I could use with beard trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Thank you to amazon for getting this out to me so quick!</li>
            <li> This is literally the thinnest, narrowest, cheaply made comb I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> If you want to comb your hair on the cheap, these are the way to go.</li>
            <li> I can fit this into my pocket and and take it out whenever my hair gets out of place.</li>
            <li> The size is correct but they are somewhat flexible and made of a cheap material.  </li>
            <li> They comb, but they feel cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dirt cheap</li>
            <li> Combs were cheap in price and quality.</li>
            <li> Cheap price, but</li>
            <li> Flimsy, pointy, cheap.  </li>
            <li> Scratchy and cheap.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s cheap, so</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic pocket comb.</li>
            <li> They felt and look cheap.  </li>
            <li> but they are good quality so far</li>
            <li> Until I shaved my head, these were very useful.</li>
            <li> So these things are very useful for their price, and how convenient it is for them to arrive at your doorstep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, look cheap but was not expecting much about this</li>
            <li> They are professional and always love to help!   </li>
            <li> nice looking comb, they fit well in a back packet or front shirt, well made and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great price and expected quality.</li>
            <li> These seemed like such a good deal.</li>
            <li> This was a good value for your standard men&#x27;s comb.  </li>
            <li> Loving them so far.</li>
            <li> I left my good comb in a golf card a month or so ago and since then I have bought 5 combs trying to find a satisfactory one to replace the lost on.  </li>
            <li> so it would be more gentle on the head.</li>
            <li> The first comb works fine, sure, it allows you to rearrange the hairs on your head just the way you like, and it certainly works a heck of a lot better than the old piece of cereal box I was using before.  </li>
            <li> These two are almost exactly like the cheap 59 cent comb</li>
            <li> The size is nice and good enough to take with you in a back pocket...</li>
            <li> If only I were more adventurous, more care-free, living my life to the fullest, I would have lost that first comb by now, broken in some wild skirmish, lost on some spontaneous trip to Europe, stolen by some beautiful ex-girlfriend...  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s many closely set teeth work far more effectively than your wide set five pronged hands.</li>
            <li> These comes are very rear to fine at my hometown (leaving overseas)</li>
            <li> These little combs are great.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is very flimsy and cheap.  </li>
            <li> These are useful to keep in car.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, price is right.</li>
            <li> Well, they were shipped out right away in time for me to put them in all three of my grandsons&#x27; Christmas stockings.  </li>
            <li> Teeth aren&#x27;t too sharp (or blunt) and it works exactly like he wants it too - great comb.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much more to it than that, lol.</li>
            <li> Pocket Combs don&#x27;t get much cheaper, but it&#x27;s that kind of cheapyness that feels like these combs will last longer than me, you know.</li>
            <li> Good, solid (as far as plastic goes) pocket combs.</li>
            <li> These combs are okay but not as good as the old ACE hard rubber combs</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vidal Sassoon, a first name in hair care.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;If</li>
            <li> Exactly the type of comb I want to keep in my front jeans pockets.</li>
            <li> A first class product.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described...can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure he would be honored to use combs such as this.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these just to get to free-shipping level, but, to my surprise, these combs are sturdier, yet more flexible, than your basic, checkout-counter comb!</li>
            <li> Why is the price 3 times higher?</li>
            <li> I found these pretty flmsy.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re similar in quality to Walgreens&#x27; 50 cent combs, perhaps slightly better.</li>
            <li> and now I can easy come my hair and not having to use the brush several times a day.</li>
            <li> These certainly get the job done though.</li>
            <li> What can I say about these nice little pocket combs?  </li>
            <li> Very lightweight and flexible.</li>
            <li> Very serviceable, meets expectations.</li>
            <li> Who wants one comb when they can have two?  </li>
            <li> Expected more from a name brand.</li>
            <li> These combs are so much the bomb that I plan to take them to my tomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not so, these are very flimsy.  </li>
            <li> SO VERY WELL.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected, I should have read the web site better.</li>
            <li> This makes it so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was fast.</li>
            <li> They show very enlarge pic of this item.</li>
            <li> Did you really NEED two??  </li>
            <li> /&gt;they are not awesome, but they are good and cheap</li>
            <li> He uses a thick pomade and they are still in good shape.</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit into my back-pocket and flexible to fit comfortable.</li>
            <li> But I LOATHE going into stores, and after quickly checking two stores and not finding any, went on Amazon and found them with free Prime shppg in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> My old ones (different brand) would chip a lot and break easily.</li>
            <li> main reason for getting - I am always losing my combs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so he could quit cleaning his older ones.  </li>
            <li> The first time I bought them I was pleased, just as other reviewers were, with a reasonable price for a simple item.  </li>
            <li> May be fine for short hair that barely needs a comb.</li>
            <li> This is a bit rough when combing, I have to smooth it out by polishing on some surface.</li>
            <li> Would probably pay a few more bucks for a sturdier product.</li>
            <li> Good combs for the car or your pocket... not to big or small</li>
            <li> They work fine, and aren&#x27;t too sharp, but I won&#x27;t be buying them again.</li>
            <li> I like that these combs are actually quite flexible (as combs go) such that they don&#x27;t break and I don&#x27;t even notice them in my pocket as they flex easily when I sit.</li>
            <li> And yet I&#x27;m too stubborn to give it to charity; it&#x27;s a perplexity I cannot live without until I solve it.  </li>
            <li> Combs are flimsy and not very well made - they kind of work but not very well.</li>
            <li> These cheap combs actually work better than any of the expensive combs/brushes I have bought.  </li>
            <li> I really just wanted some simple but sturdy combs that I can bring with me everywhere</li>
            <li> Kookie from &#x27;77 Sunset Strip alive today</li>
            <li> If you bend them too far, they will break, imagine that.</li>
            <li> If you do not bend them too far, they do not break, imagine that.</li>
            <li> Made in the millions at some factory in sub-Saharan Africa, or a far flung corner of Asia this one comes with Vidal Sassoon branding.  </li>
            <li> Sturdy plastic, no broken teeth after a month of daily use.</li>
            <li> (we use them for my 3 year old).</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t look like the Wild Man From Borneo.</li>
            <li> There are times I gain some confidence from it, knowing that as long as it still sits there I haven&#x27;t been so reckless as to have lost the first comb.  </li>
            <li> Must be getting old...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough for easy use, but small enough to fit in your pocket.  </li>
            <li> They work great, and ever after being in my pocket with other things for weeks, none of the teeth have broken off.  </li>
            <li> I thought it is decent size if not regular size.</li>
            <li> Decent quality and definitely gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I need new ones is I manage o lose teh old ones.</li>
            <li> Two, small, cheap, plastic combs.</li>
            <li> They are small and cheap</li>
            <li> I expected a little better since the Vidal Sassoon name was attached.</li>
            <li> The opinions expressed here should not be taken as any legal or medical advise these are just my personal experiences/opinions. </li>
            <li> These are exactly what you think they are and work just like every other one like it.</li>
            <li> higher quality, well-finished, stronger) that your average 25 cent comb at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Cheap, expected, but these are really cheap, like very thin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the difference between a good comb and a bad one.</li>
            <li> and I have super thick, long hair.  </li>
            <li> The first one was 59 cents at a gas station -- hard plastic - pointed needles that hurt the head.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re kinda flimsy and my hair is pretty thick</li>
            <li> I have bought different ones in the past that are cheap and will hardly comb my toddlers short hair.  </li>
            <li> They are both the same size, something I questioned when the package came (since they weren&#x27;t placed on top of each other it looked kinda weird).</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re gonna pitch for three innings, head to short on a double switch, and then be the fastest center fielder you&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> Im not a professional hair cutter</li>
            <li> but I bought these to comb my long hair cat.  </li>
            <li> and I know that they will hold up a long time.</li>
            <li> so we shop Amazon whenever possible for small items that are becoming increasingly difficult to find at the local drugstore or supermarket.</li>
            <li> I must have gotten a different comb than other people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been carrying one in my back pocket everyday for the past two months and it has not broken.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re stiff enough to get through tangles, yet, flexible enough to be sat upon repeatedly without developing a permanent curve.</li>
            <li> My husband likes the new combs and now he has a spare in case he loses one.</li>
            <li> So you gotta be careful</li>
            <li> The product is just as expected, two combs.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> Two combs as expected.</li>
            <li> Been a problem with harder plastic combs.</li>
            <li> Even the teeth of the comb are not very sturdy compared to other combs I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> toddler uses the other one and we all know how rough toddlers can be.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat sharp edges.</li>
            <li> I think they made the bristles too sharp.  </li>
            <li> Fits in my pocket, and comes in pair so when I couldn&#x27;t find one I just used the other one.</li>
            <li> I bought several of these because I usually like Vidal Sassoon products.  </li>
            <li> but the tines on these are painfully sharp.  </li>
            <li> There must be a thousand uses, and my mind used to be so sharp...</li>
            <li> And other mornings it just reminds me of my wasteful, impulsive spending.  </li>
            <li> And other times it pains my heart to think of all the disadvantaged people of the world who could be using this comb while this greedy bastard sits here with two.  </li>
            <li> then but I usually like it on the long and loose side...</li>
            <li> The second time they were made differently and had an odd taper on the inside of the teeth, with the effect that they grab hair very tightly and just don&#x27;t let go.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re unusable for even a little bit of hair, and I don&#x27;t have any to spare!</li>
            <li> &gt; One thing to note, the teeth are a bit on the sharp side (must be the way the plastic is molded), but quickly dulls down to a soothing point.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about a small black men&#x27;s comb, I guess, but these are definitely nicer (</li>
            <li> end is wide and other is narrow.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that their so flimsy that its hard to comb your hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $.</li>
            <li> Just your typical pocket com&#x27;s for men.</li>
            <li> I agree with the previous reviewer.</li>
            <li> It currently sits on my dresser as a constant reminder every morning of my failed creativity.  </li>
            <li> And they didn&#x27;t mess it up.</li>
            <li> A little pointy with no bend.</li>
            <li> I am neither disappointed nor excited about them.</li>
            <li> They bend a little, they might be a little heavier, but they will do just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery</li>
            <li> I usually keep one in my traveling bag and the other one in my place</li>
            <li> They are really sharp and hurt pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> Thin and likely breakable plastic.  </li>
            <li> I need a firm comb that can plow through tangled hair if needed.</li>
            <li> Received one with the teeth all crooked and side ways not happy about that.</li>
            <li> Alas, my extra comb still sits there without a use, haunting me.  </li>
            <li> I only think they are a little expensive for what they are.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to try hard to mess this up.</li>
            <li> Works, they are small</li>
            <li> Its just too small.</li>
            <li> Not sure what else there is to a comb.</li>
            <li> Price should be around $1.50 and no more.</li>
            <li> Too small and too flimsy.</li>
            <li> These combs are small and feel rather insignificant but get the job done for my purposes.</li>
            <li> I did not realize that this is a small comb, like pocket sized.</li>
            <li> These are just two ordinary combs.</li>
            <li> but when it arrives its too small.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these combs and they are hard for me to find.</li>
            <li> Maybe my scalp will dull them over time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to figure anything out anymore since those combs arrived in the mail.  </li>
            <li> I hate the whole Wal-Mart concept</li>
            <li> A little expensive for just pocket combs, but</li>
            <li> Kinda too expensive considering how small they are and the fact the they&#x27;re made of plastic.</li>
            <li> They do what I need them to do and none of the teeth have broken.</li>
            <li> The comb hasn&#x27;t broken-</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t realize these were pocket combs, so my husband did not like them one bit.  </li>
            <li> I never realized just how expensive combs can be.  </li>
            <li> I know this sounds crazy</li>
            <li> a waste of money, you idiot!  </li>
            <li> Scratches the crap out of my scalp and extremely uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> How can a comb be that bad, you ask?</li>
            <li> can you say bad about this.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The quality of the plastic is very disappointing, this is not a branded item at all.</li>
            <li> dont buy, crap.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The Fonz has nothing on me now that I have these excellent combs on me!</li>
            <li> My husband loves these combs and they are hard for me to find.</li>
            <li> Before this product: http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2014/226/7/7/me_and_my_messy_hair_first_thing_in_the_morning_by_serena1422-d7v4fp0.jpg&lt;br /&gt;After this product: http://www.provillusreviewinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Best-Hair-grwoth-products-for-Women.jpg&lt;br /&gt;The pictures don&#x27;t lie people. This product WORKS.</li>
            <li> I use it to comb my hair, the hair that&#x27;s on top of my head. There&#x27;s not much more to it than that, lol.</li>
            <li> These are nice combs, Im not a professional hair cutter but my daughter with fine hair looks a lot prettier when I use these</li>
            <li> These combs are okay but not as good as the old ACE hard rubber combs I used to buy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t have enough pocket combs.&lt;br /&gt;I bought some from a dollar store. And the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; seemed to be fused together, so weren&#x27;t the best for their intended use.&lt;br /&gt;Splurge, and buy descent combs.&lt;br /&gt;Vidal Sassoon, a first name in hair care.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;If you don&#x27;t look good, they don&#x27;t look good.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Combs are flimsy and not very well made - they kind of work but not very well. Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This is what I was looking for for! These comes are very rear to fine at my hometown (leaving overseas) and now I can easy come my hair and not having to use the brush several times a day.</li>
            <li> Thin and likely breakable plastic.  Somewhat sharp edges.</li>
            <li> Love these combs. Very lightweight and flexible. Durable not to break or lose any teeth after several months with me using them every day. Exactly the type of comb I want to keep in my front jeans pockets.</li>
            <li> Guys, these are combs like you would not believe. They have exceeded my expectations in every way shape AND form. I can comb my hair AND my beard with them. It&#x27;s incredible. If these combs were on a baseball team they would be the best utility players you&#x27;ve ever seen. They&#x27;re gonna pitch for three innings, head to short on a double switch, and then be the fastest center fielder you&#x27;ve ever seen. If they were hockey players they would be Patrice Bergeron and then a clone of Patrice Bergeron. All-stars, is what I&#x27;m trying to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big fan. Big, big fan.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described and received in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> a bit pricey for two combs. but they are good quality so far</li>
            <li> These seemed like such a good deal. A pocket comb you can replace on a regular basis.Only problem is that their so flimsy that its hard to comb your hair.You better off with a good ole GOODY comb you can get about anywhere.</li>
            <li> Works, they are small</li>
            <li> Its just too small. Thinking of returning it but I will give out to someone lolz</li>
            <li> These combs are nothing special, but for the price they are great. I use them for slicking my pomade through my hair and keeping it shaped through the day. They do what I need them to do and none of the teeth have broken. I recommend them for anyone who just needs some cheaper combs around for styling. Nothing more to be said.</li>
            <li> Cheap but nice combs. They do their job for a good price.</li>
            <li> Finally! It took a couple of days to get use to the smaller size but I am hooked now. I am buying them for the rest of the family. A first class product.</li>
            <li> The comb hasn&#x27;t broken- it still has all its bristles. I assume it&#x27;s made of hardened rubber and not plastic...a quality product.</li>
            <li> Very serviceable, meets expectations.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm, is great, seems reliable, and doesn&#x27;t seem flimsy. I would recommend. Not sure what else there is to a comb.</li>
            <li> I know this sounds crazy but I bought these to comb my long hair cat.  These cheap combs actually work better than any of the expensive combs/brushes I have bought.  I have bought different ones in the past that are cheap and will hardly comb my toddlers short hair.  These however are perfect and I know that they will hold up a long time.</li>
            <li> Ive been telling myself for years that my hair looks best when i walk out of the Barbers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So finally I decided to switch from a brush to a comb at home, and got the same ones my barber uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gotta say, I love them!!!</li>
            <li> Kinda too expensive considering how small they are and the fact the they&#x27;re made of plastic. Price should be around $1.50 and no more.</li>
            <li> This is a bit rough when combing, I have to smooth it out by polishing on some surface. Some bristles poke at you. Very handy and fits in pant pockets. I would have wished it is smoother. I am sure over time it will be ok!</li>
            <li> Who wants one comb when they can have two?  They still don&#x27;t make my quiff look like Ryan Reynolds though...</li>
            <li> Cheap, expected, but these are really cheap, like very thin.  Expected more from a name brand.</li>
            <li> Too small and too flimsy. May be fine for short hair that barely needs a comb. I need a firm comb that can plow through tangled hair if needed.</li>
            <li> What can I say.  They are strong, as I flexed them and they did not break. Also the price seemed to be a good one.</li>
            <li> They are really sharp and hurt pretty bad.  Just like the ones you would get on picture day.  Not worth the $.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t realize these were pocket combs, so my husband did not like them one bit.  But for what they are they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li> This was a good value for your standard men&#x27;s comb.  I bought these as an add on and have been happy with them so far.</li>
            <li> I really just wanted some simple but sturdy combs that I can bring with me everywhere I go, and these were perfect! Loving them so far.</li>
            <li> I wish I bought the vidal sassoon longer combs.  These tend to be too short, and they are too needle-y so your hair comes in more separated strands.  I like it when my hair bunches up.  I would recommend going to target and buying the $3 one they have there.  It changes to a wider tooth size depending on the way you hold it.</li>
            <li> This is literally the thinnest, narrowest, cheaply made comb I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I would have given it a lower rating, except that it is an add-on item and cheap, and are better than using your fingers to comb your hair.</li>
            <li> Eh. Cheap. A little pointy with no bend. So you gotta be careful so you don&#x27;t stab/scratch your head.</li>
            <li> Yup, these are combs.  Exactly as described...can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  If you want to comb your hair on the cheap, these are the way to go.</li>
            <li> Great cheap comb, can&#x27;t really beat the price</li>
            <li> These will get the job done, but are made of very cheap feeling plastic -- If I had to do it over again, I&#x27;d just buy combs from the store, I would have been more satisfied.</li>
            <li> Smoothese on the tips should be improved.</li>
            <li> You ever think about how many words there are that end with &amp;#34;omb&amp;#34; that don&#x27;t rhyme? These combs are so much the bomb that I plan to take them to my tomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some day... not for awhile, my children  - so don&#x27;t spend the inheritance yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Were Kookie from &#x27;77 Sunset Strip alive today, I&#x27;m sure he would be honored to use combs such as this.  (Google that, youngsters).</li>
            <li> These combs are small and feel rather insignificant but get the job done for my purposes.</li>
            <li> Just like the free ones from school picture day!</li>
            <li> The hair shaping capability of this product is outstanding. It&#x27;s many closely set teeth work far more effectively than your wide set five pronged hands. It&#x27;s compact design sets for ease of use, and travel capabilities, without taking away from its superior qualities in terms of hair styling.</li>
            <li> Received one with the teeth all crooked and side ways not happy about that. Basic comb what do you expect</li>
            <li> I can fit this into my pocket and and take it out whenever my hair gets out of place. That can happen often, as my hairstyles change now and then but I usually like it on the long and loose side... My girlfriend finds it sexy.</li>
            <li> These are combs. You&#x27;d have to try hard to mess this up. And they didn&#x27;t mess it up. So everyone&#x27;s happy</li>
            <li> Good combs my husband loves his. He uses a thick pomade and they are still in good shape.</li>
            <li> Two, small, cheap, plastic combs. Very standard, just what I was looking for. These are exactly what you think they are and work just like every other one like it.</li>
            <li> Nothing to get excited about, just glad I still need one at 76. The only reason I need new ones is I manage o lose teh old ones.</li>
            <li> I tried to buy a mid-price comb - not the cheapest and not the most expensive.  So, I thought these would be of good quality.  Not so, these are very flimsy.  The size is correct but they are somewhat flexible and made of a cheap material.  i would not buy again!</li>
            <li> Great quality. easily lost tho.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, look cheap but was not expecting much about this</li>
            <li> The product is just as expected, two combs.&lt;br /&gt;No issues with them. They work as expected.&lt;br /&gt;One end is wide and other is narrow.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re combs, what more is there to be written...</li>
            <li> a good pocket comb like this should have more bristles to accommodate more hair. it&#x27;s the difference between a good comb and a bad one.</li>
            <li> three stars means &amp;#34;it&#x27;s ok&amp;#34; according to Amazon. these combs are in fact OK. I am neither disappointed nor excited about them. They comb, but they feel cheap. That&#x27;s what you get for 2 bucks.</li>
            <li> MAN, THESE COMB YOUR HAIR. IF YOU WANT YOUR HAIR COMBED, THESE WILL DO THAT. SO WELL. SO VERY WELL.</li>
            <li> How can a comb be that bad, you ask? Easily. Just design it with sharpened teeth that dig into your scalp, like this one.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy unless you want your head to bleed.</li>
            <li> They are combs, they work, nothing else to say</li>
            <li> A little expensive for just pocket combs, but still okay and they seem fairly durable.</li>
            <li> This was an add-on item.&lt;br /&gt;What can you say bad about this.&lt;br /&gt;My main reason for getting - I am always losing my combs.&lt;br /&gt;I have two now lol</li>
            <li> Just your typical pocket com&#x27;s for men. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I must have gotten a different comb than other people. In fact, the photo does look a bit different than what I received. They were so flimsy that the tines were bent by the 1 piece of wire holding the comb to the paper packaging. I would say that I got what I paid for. Next time I&#x27;ll get an Ace comb that only need to replace when I lose it again.</li>
            <li> My spouse is always losing his combs, so I buy them in bulk. But I LOATHE going into stores, and after quickly checking two stores and not finding any, went on Amazon and found them with free Prime shppg in less than a minute. I hate the whole Wal-Mart concept so we shop Amazon whenever possible for small items that are becoming increasingly difficult to find at the local drugstore or supermarket.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for combs that won&#x27;t break easily, these are not the ones for you.  The plastic is very flimsy and cheap.  Even the teeth of the comb are not very sturdy compared to other combs I&#x27;ve used.  I was able to very easily bend the combs and the teeth to the point where I felt like they would probably break.  If you&#x27;re looking for cheap combs that you can easily replace, these are the ones for you, but if you want something that will hold up, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> These are quality plastic combs. They are very easy to operate, and do not require instructions. If you bend them too far, they will break, imagine that. If you do not bend them too far, they do not break, imagine that.</li>
            <li> I like keeping these combs with me in my back pocket. I like that these combs are actually quite flexible (as combs go) such that they don&#x27;t break and I don&#x27;t even notice them in my pocket as they flex easily when I sit.</li>
            <li> I did not realize that this is a small comb, like pocket sized. It was not what I expected, I should have read the web site better.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about a small black men&#x27;s comb, I guess, but these are definitely nicer (higher quality, well-finished, stronger) that your average 25 cent comb at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Who needs overpriced combs?  Vidal provides an effective, inexpensive comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild hair is no match, when the plastic teeth are on attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One thing to note, the teeth are a bit on the sharp side (must be the way the plastic is molded), but quickly dulls down to a soothing point.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dirt cheap and it works, not to mention you get two, one to keep at home, one to keep in your pocket. In my opinion, that merits 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Nice price, two great combs</li>
            <li> My husband likes the new combs and now he has a spare in case he loses one.</li>
            <li> quality pocket comb from a reputable source. lovely combs!</li>
            <li> Two combs as expected.</li>
            <li> I left my good comb in a golf card a month or so ago and since then I have bought 5 combs trying to find a satisfactory one to replace the lost on.  The first one was 59 cents at a gas station -- hard plastic - pointed needles that hurt the head.  These two are almost exactly like the cheap 59 cent comb and I have thrown them away already.</li>
            <li> A comb.  Made in the millions at some factory in sub-Saharan Africa, or a far flung corner of Asia this one comes with Vidal Sassoon branding.  This makes it so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are a mammal, and still have hair on your crown, this comb will enable you shape it into pleasing shapes.  This may or may not help you in the attraction of future mating partners.</li>
            <li> Yes, unbreakable plastic combs. They bend a little, they might be a little heavier, but they will do just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast. They were cheaper than I could get at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Good use out of these, still using the first one. My old ones (different brand) would chip a lot and break easily.</li>
            <li> These are just two ordinary combs. They&#x27;re great to part my hair with and when they get caught in tangles, they don&#x27;t break unlike some combs I&#x27;ve had before. They are both the same size, something I questioned when the package came (since they weren&#x27;t placed on top of each other it looked kinda weird). What more is there to expect from a comb?</li>
            <li> Combs were cheap in price and quality. I expected a little better since the Vidal Sassoon name was attached. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Great combs. Small enough to fit into my back-pocket and flexible to fit comfortable.</li>
            <li> Good combs, perfect for travelling, and also good for a daily use.</li>
            <li> nice looking comb, they fit well in a back packet or front shirt, well made and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I bought these combs twice.  They tend to disappear around my house.  The first time I bought them I was pleased, just as other reviewers were, with a reasonable price for a simple item.  The second time they were made differently and had an odd taper on the inside of the teeth, with the effect that they grab hair very tightly and just don&#x27;t let go.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re unusable for even a little bit of hair, and I don&#x27;t have any to spare!</li>
            <li> For the price that you pay for it, and knowing that these are combs, these are good for the price. Haven&#x27;t had them break or cause any bleeding or whatnot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend, it&#x27;s a tad better than the cheapies at Walmart/Target.</li>
            <li> I ordered these just to get to free-shipping level, but, to my surprise, these combs are sturdier, yet more flexible, than your basic, checkout-counter comb! Who knew? One in the car, one in your purse--and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> One at the sink, one in the shower. Sturdy plastic, no broken teeth after a month of daily use. Just what I needed, price is right.</li>
            <li> way overpriced for a comb of this quality and size. The quality of the plastic is very disappointing, this is not a branded item at all.</li>
            <li> Pocket Combs don&#x27;t get much cheaper, but it&#x27;s that kind of cheapyness that feels like these combs will last longer than me, you know. I don&#x27;t know why anybody would put their name on these, but they comb my eyebrows and head ok. Oh, and they&#x27;re cheap, LOL</li>
            <li> Until I shaved my head, these were very useful. I misplace combs all the time, so buying these helped. If I wouldn&#x27;t have shaved my head about 2 months after buying these, I would have probably bought 2 more orders, because I literally leave them everywhere, on the bathroom sink, on my desk, by my bed, in my pocket (goes through the laundry), and in my car. So these things are very useful for their price, and how convenient it is for them to arrive at your doorstep.</li>
            <li> These are great and look nice, but the teeth break off a little more easily than I&#x27;d like (we use them for my 3 year old).</li>
            <li> Excellent comb really made my hair look great.</li>
            <li> I bought these as back-up combs because I&#x27;m always losing my combs.  They work great, and ever after being in my pocket with other things for weeks, none of the teeth have broken off.  I would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> I use these to comb my hair</li>
            <li> Keep it in my back pocket.  Flexible enough not to break when you sit.  Been a problem with harder plastic combs.</li>
            <li> Good set of combs. Just what I like. Good price.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but hurts the scalp when combing.  I think they made the bristles too sharp.  I will keep if for travel, not worried about losing these guys.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comb....  It&#x27;s big enough for easy use, but small enough to fit in your pocket.  It works out well for me.</li>
            <li> They show very enlarge pic of this item. I thought it is decent size if not regular size. But it is toy size. Had to return them. Also the quality is flimsy.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t do your windows, wash your car, make your bed, cook dinner, or even watch your house while you&#x27;re away on vacation. However, it does come with an identical twin, sometimes I get them mixed up, but they don&#x27;t seem to mind. I do sometimes have to get on it for just laying around, but it&#x27;s a comb, what do you expect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: It will part your hair, send it in lines in the direction you&#x27;re moving it, and seems like a sturdy piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> Decent quality and definitely gets the job done.  Probably the best quality to price ratio of any comb I&#x27;ve come accross.</li>
            <li> Umm, its works and I see no fault in it. The size is nice and good enough to take with you in a back pocket...</li>
            <li> Fits in my pocket, and comes in pair so when I couldn&#x27;t find one I just used the other one. I usually keep one in my traveling bag and the other one in my place so it works out very nicely.</li>
            <li> These say Vidal sassoon on them. Keep em clean and they&#x27;ll keep you looking good. Cheap price, but so what, if you lose them no big deal.</li>
            <li> It was easy to work with this shipper. I have no complaints about them. Everything was great and without problem.</li>
            <li> The two Vidal Sassoon combs I purchased through Amazon are good quality products. They go through my hair without pulling it out by the roots and leave it in good shape so I don&#x27;t look like the Wild Man From Borneo. I can review a &#x27;disc&#x27;, I can review a &#x27;tome&#x27;, but how on earth do you review a comb? As Gertrude said: \\&quot;A comb is a comb is a comb,\\&quot; what more could I add.</li>
            <li> Flimsy, pointy, cheap.  I threw mine in the trash.</li>
            <li> I agree with the previous reviewer. These are similar to 50 cent drugstore combs. Why is the price 3 times higher? Rip off.</li>
            <li> I found these pretty flmsy. Would probably pay a few more bucks for a sturdier product. These certainly get the job done though.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re kinda flimsy and my hair is pretty thick but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Real cheap, exactly what you would expect and would be looking for. Great add on to get Prime shipping with and you need some!</li>
            <li> Scratches the crap out of my scalp and extremely uncomfortable to use. I definitely do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I misplace my combs all the time. These are useful to keep in car.</li>
            <li> Good, solid (as far as plastic goes) pocket combs. They have both medium- and fine-toothed sections which means they work well for both head and facial hair grooming. They seem to stand up to a fair amount of abuse. I only think they are a little expensive for what they are.</li>
            <li> Hubby likes using combs and keeping one tucked in his wallet&#x27;s fold.  He asked me to find him a bag of combs so he could quit cleaning his older ones.  I bought several of these because I usually like Vidal Sassoon products.  He likes the comb and feels it slides through his hair without catching.  Teeth aren&#x27;t too sharp (or blunt) and it works exactly like he wants it too - great comb.</li>
            <li> Scratchy and cheap. Bendy and crappy. But it&#x27;s cheap, so whatever. It&#x27;ll have to do till I buy a better one.</li>
            <li> These little combs are great.  They seem to be made of great quality.  We&#x27;ve had these for a while now and I have super thick, long hair.  I use this every time I get out of the shower and we still have every tooth on the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My toddler uses the other one and we all know how rough toddlers can be.  His is also in perfect tact.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have thought it&#x27;s possible to screw up a plastic comb... but the tines on these are painfully sharp.  Maybe my scalp will dull them over time.</li>
            <li> The spines are a bit too pointy and scratch my scalp but it is good for what it does.</li>
            <li> Quality Combs, great for the price.  I will be recommending this amazing product to all of my close friends and family. If anyone has any questions for me feel free to ask!

            <li> IT&#x27;S A COMB!  What more of a review do you want?  The only question you need to ask yourself is, \\&quot;What in god&#x27;s name am I supposed to do with the second one?\\&quot;  Well, if you&#x27;re reading these reviews seeking counsel on that topic, seek elsewhere, because I haven&#x27;t figured it out myself.  It&#x27;s hard to figure anything out anymore since those combs arrived in the mail.  The first comb works fine, sure, it allows you to rearrange the hairs on your head just the way you like, and it certainly works a heck of a lot better than the old piece of cereal box I was using before.  But the second comb just sits there...just sits there.  It currently sits on my dresser as a constant reminder every morning of my failed creativity.  \\&quot;Why can&#x27;t I think of any use for this extra comb?  There must be a thousand uses, and my mind used to be so sharp...I must be losing something.\\&quot;  And other mornings it just reminds me of my wasteful, impulsive spending.  \\&quot;What a waste of money, you idiot!  Why did you buy two??  Did you really NEED two??  It just sits there when you could have used that money towards that nice knife set you wanted.\\&quot;  And other times it pains my heart to think of all the disadvantaged people of the world who could be using this comb while this greedy bastard sits here with two.  And yet I&#x27;m too stubborn to give it to charity; it&#x27;s a perplexity I cannot live without until I solve it.  There are times I gain some confidence from it, knowing that as long as it still sits there I haven&#x27;t been so reckless as to have lost the first comb.  But then a pang of regret stabs my heart as I reflect on the drabness of my life.  If only I were more adventurous, more care-free, living my life to the fullest, I would have lost that first comb by now, broken in some wild skirmish, lost on some spontaneous trip to Europe, stolen by some beautiful ex-girlfriend...  Alas, my extra comb still sits there without a use, haunting me.  Some days I pick it up to admire it&#x27;s pristine glory, quietlyhoping that combs go up in value as they age.  This one is still in mint condition, after all.  Perhaps it&#x27;s my ticket to a more adventurous life in retirement.  It&#x27;s a gamble.  It&#x27;s a riddle.  It&#x27;s the bane of my existence.  I urge you only to buy one comb.</li>
            <li> dont buy, crap. bristles are sharpened like a needle and just scrapes your scalp. they need to be duller.</li>
            <li> Great price and expected quality.</li>
            <li> Hurts the head when I comb in. Wish the plastic were more rounded at the tips so it would be more gentle on the head.</li>
            <li> They are small and cheap but I guess that is what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Do people comb baby heads with these? Jeez. The comb hairs snapped after about a month of use, or whenever I wasn&#x27;t paying close attention to how I combed my hair. I found a better alternative by purchasing single-length combs from pharmacies, where returns aren&#x27;t so difficult if the product is plastic and low-quality.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good spare combs to take around with you. Good size,  very cheap and have held up nicely for me. Good to order a bunch for when you lose your combs.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY !!..the size in the pic seems big but when it arrives its too small.</li>
            <li> Must be getting old... I never realized just how expensive combs can be.  After looking at some costing $8, spending $2.50 for two actually seems like quite a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these to keep my occasional beard groomed. Needed something with relatively fine teeth that I could use with beard trimmers.  And they work great for that.  I don&#x27;t carry them in my pocket, so can&#x27;t vouch for durability.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic pocket comb.</li>
            <li> Good plastic-y pocket comb. They&#x27;re similar in quality to Walgreens&#x27; 50 cent combs, perhaps slightly better. I&#x27;ve been carrying one in my back pocket everyday for the past two months and it has not broken. They&#x27;re stiff enough to get through tangles, yet, flexible enough to be sat upon repeatedly without developing a permanent curve. They&#x27;re a great buy when they&#x27;re on sale.</li>
            <li> They felt and look cheap.  They work fine, and aren&#x27;t too sharp, but I won&#x27;t be buying them again.</li>
            <li> What can I say about these nice little pocket combs?  Well, they were shipped out right away in time for me to put them in all three of my grandsons&#x27; Christmas stockings.  They all have beautiful hair, but it still needs to be combed from time to time to keep that wild side in check.  These work!</li>
            <li> Good combs for the car or your pocket... not to big or small they don&#x27;t break easily either-</li>
            <li> they are smaller than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;they are not awesome, but they are good and cheap so it I do not regret buying.</li>
            <li> Combs are combs -- they work, but I can&#x27;t see a need to get verbal about them.</li>
