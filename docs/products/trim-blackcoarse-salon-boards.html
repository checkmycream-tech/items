            <li>It works and the price is great for a package of 48.  </li>
            <li>Awesome price for how many you are getting.</li>
            <li>These emery boards are good quality and a good value.  </li>
            <li>GOOD PRODUCT WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li>They are the really nice sturdy boards that you find at the salon.</li>
            <li>Nice to have them stashed all over the house.</li>
            <li>With any luck these 48 boards will be a lifetime supply, and for now I&#x27;m happy knowing that any time I need a nail file I know right where they are</li>
            <li>Decent quality at very fair price.</li>
            <li>This was perfect, everything wrapped and packaged nicely and came super fast.</li>
            <li>and they are fine and handy.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I would buy again fast shipping just absolutely great A++++ seller</li>
            <li>They are also a great tool for those pups who dislike having nails trimmed, but will sit still while I am gently filing.</li>
            <li>The smooth side is ok</li>
            <li>The boards that they sent me would be fine for someone wanting medium grit.</li>
            <li>but my nails are somewhat fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so coarse this can be use for so many more things.</li>
            <li>Ordered these in coarse finish, seems more like fine.  </li>
            <li>Simply wash with warm soap and water as if you&#x27;re washing your hands.</li>
            <li>Normal emory boards wear out very quickly.</li>
            <li>Looks like it will be better than that, as these seem to last longer than the ones I&#x27;ve been getting.</li>
            <li>I always like getting a product that is exactly what I expect.</li>
            <li>I am only able to get one use out of these.  </li>
            <li>I found exactly what I was looking for on amazon.</li>
            <li>Not coarse, more like an aggressive medium.  </li>
            <li>However these work great for my big toes because the nails there are much harder and a bit thicker than fingernails.</li>
            <li>The coarse file is perfect for quick removal of rough, cut edges and other imperfections.</li>
            <li>WITH THE LARGE SUPPLY PROVIDED</li>
            <li>keep two nail files in every room, this Salon coarse file and the Salon fine file.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>A dog with not much fur/hair between the toes (like my Greyhounds) may be more sensitive to the friction than those with more (like my Irish Setter/Golden mix).</li>
            <li>If I use this on my fingernails it really tears them up and leaves them raggedy</li>
            <li>This is a great product for toenails and especially for individuals with thick toe nails.  </li>
            <li>The coarseness isn&#x27;t really a problem for me but they are much more coarse than I expected.  </li>
            <li>These are the only kind of emory boards that work for me on my man-nails, because I need a nice, rough, tough board to deal with the snags and hangnails that occur from time to time.</li>
            <li>They dry quickly without warping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I finally got smart and bought this pack of emory boards</li>
            <li>The fine file is used after the coarse file, to mellow the rough edge and give a soft satin finish.</li>
            <li>These work great with little pressure and can actually be washed/disinfected a few times before needing replacing.</li>
            <li>They were much cheaper than buying them in packages of 3 in the local stores.  </li>
            <li>As a professional dog groomer and vet tech, I have these files everywhere and keep a supply on hand at all times.</li>
            <li>After clipping nails, I use these to eliminate rough edges and catches, as well as smoothing the freshly cut surface.</li>
            <li>While both dogs require anesthesia every 4-5 months for corn excision (they grow right back within days), I can keep the corns at bay a bit longer by filing the outside &#x27;bump&#x27; off the toe pads to keep them from being &#x27;put under&#x27; too often.</li>
            <li>Most dogs will pull their foot from your hand if it gets hot, but others will tolerate it to the point of causing a hot spot or sore, and then you&#x27;ve just traded one painful issue for another.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t imagine maintaining my nails without both - the coarse one, used alone, leaves your nails feeling slightly rough and scratchy, and the fine one, used alone, just doesn&#x27;t have enough firepower to handle the rough edges I get after a long day of gardening, pet training, and general nail</li>
            <li>I suppose this isn&#x27;t truly an EMERY board but a nail file; anyway, I bought the bin of 48 black (coarse) and the bin of 48 pink (fine) and keep them wherever - car tray, handbag, in front of the tv, in my knitting basket, whatever -</li>
            <li>Weak underlying structure that easily bends and breaks .</li>
            <li>so doing, one must be careful not to make the toe pad too &#x27;hot&#x27; from the friction, so if you&#x27;re going to try this, start slowly and gently and keep feeling the corn/toe pad for heat.</li>

            <li> total crap, amazon sent me medium grit boards.</li>
            <li> Leave them in the kitchen drawers, car, desk, etc and not that expensive that you can hand them out to friends if they break a nail</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The coarse side is not coarse enough. Weak underlying structure that easily bends and breaks . The smooth side is ok</li>
            <li> I was always looking for emory boards and would always find worn out torn emory boards around the house. I finally got smart and bought this pack of emory boards and I am so glad that I did. Now I have enough to last me a long time and I never have to search for them. They are the really nice sturdy boards that you find at the salon. Great buy.</li>
            <li> These emery boards are good quality and a good value.  They were much cheaper than buying them in packages of 3 in the local stores.  I use them to file nails and to file rough edges on feet.  I will purchase them again.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> I suppose this isn&#x27;t truly an EMERY board but a nail file; anyway, I bought the bin of 48 black (coarse) and the bin of 48 pink (fine) and keep them wherever - car tray, handbag, in front of the tv, in my knitting basket, whatever - and they are fine and handy.</li>
            <li> My cat loves playing with these over all his other toys.</li>
            <li> Decent quality at very fair price. Convenient to have a quantity on hand.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be a timesaver as I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep buying another one or two every few weeks. Looks like it will be better than that, as these seem to last longer than the ones I&#x27;ve been getting. Nice to have them stashed all over the house. Fast delivery. Product as desribed.</li>
            <li> Awesome price for how many you are getting. Since i do nails have a pack of 48 is great. I would buy again fast shipping just absolutely great A++++ seller</li>
            <li> I always like getting a product that is exactly what I expect. This was perfect, everything wrapped and packaged nicely and came super fast.</li>
            <li> I use for cleaning up and re-shaping model horses. Also, I use two placed on paper to level a horse&#x27;s feet when models won&#x27; t stand without wobbling. I just rub the bottom of the hoofs until the horse stands well.</li>
            <li> Ordered these in coarse finish, seems more like fine.  I am only able to get one use out of these.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are the only kind of emory boards that work for me on my man-nails, because I need a nice, rough, tough board to deal with the snags and hangnails that occur from time to time. Whenever I needed a file I could never find one, as if we only bought one or two at a time at the pharmacy they would eventual migrate around and/or go missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve solved that problem by purchasing this big tub of boards, which I now keep in my desk. With any luck these 48 boards will be a lifetime supply, and for now I&#x27;m happy knowing that any time I need a nail file I know right where they are and there&#x27;s no chance of running out any time soon.</li>
            <li> I buy these to file my dog&#x27;s nails after dremmeling them and they are perfect.  Now I can use all I need and not pay $4 for only 2.  I have lots and since I have 3 dogs this is an incredible deal.  Two thumbs WAY up!</li>
            <li> As a professional dog groomer and vet tech, I have these files everywhere and keep a supply on hand at all times. After clipping nails, I use these to eliminate rough edges and catches, as well as smoothing the freshly cut surface. They are also a great tool for those pups who dislike having nails trimmed, but will sit still while I am gently filing. These work great with little pressure and can actually be washed/disinfected a few times before needing replacing. Simply wash with warm soap and water as if you&#x27;re washing your hands. They dry quickly without warping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use them on several of my own dogs who have deep, painful corns in their toe pads. While both dogs require anesthesia every 4-5 months for corn excision (they grow right back within days), I can keep the corns at bay a bit longer by filing the outside &#x27;bump&#x27; off the toe pads to keep them from being &#x27;put under&#x27; too often. It doesn&#x27;t help with the painful, pointy core inside the pad, but does allow them to walk a bit more evenly and in balance than if I did not file them down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In so doing, one must be careful not to make the toe pad too &#x27;hot&#x27; from the friction, so if you&#x27;re going to try this, start slowly and gently and keep feeling the corn/toe pad for heat. A dog with not much fur/hair between the toes (like my Greyhounds) may be more sensitive to the friction than those with more (like my Irish Setter/Golden mix). Most dogs will pull their foot from your hand if it gets hot, but others will tolerate it to the point of causing a hot spot or sore, and then you&#x27;ve just traded one painful issue for another.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted and for half the price of what I usually pay (2 boards). I wash my hands constantly as a nurse and truth be told, I need both sides to smooth off the callused skin (terrible). I go through these boards easily, so I finally came to the conclusion that it was cheaper to buy in bulk! I found exactly what I was looking for on amazon. Will never go back to the drug store again.</li>
            <li> Not coarse, more like an aggressive medium.  My wife can use them, but I can not use them as intended.</li>
            <li> Handy to have around for cutting down length or for rough feet.... But these files are VERY coarse.  You&#x27;ll need others for finish work.</li>
            <li> Bought a big amount of these.  Leave them in the kitchen drawers, car, desk, etc and not that expensive that you can hand them out to friends if they break a nail</li>
            <li> Salon Nail File, Coarse / B000ZMCNFI&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep two nail files in every room, this Salon coarse file and the Salon fine file. The coarse file is perfect for quick removal of rough, cut edges and other imperfections. The fine file is used after the coarse file, to mellow the rough edge and give a soft satin finish. I really can&#x27;t imagine maintaining my nails without both - the coarse one, used alone, leaves your nails feeling slightly rough and scratchy, and the fine one, used alone, just doesn&#x27;t have enough firepower to handle the rough edges I get after a long day of gardening, pet training, and general nail abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Ana Mardoll</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT&lt;br /&gt;GOOD BUY PER PIECE&lt;br /&gt;EASY TO STORE&lt;br /&gt;EFFECTIVE ABRASIVE FOR NAILS&lt;br /&gt;WILL LAST FOREVER WITH THE LARGE SUPPLY PROVIDED</li>
            <li> Happy with this product</li>
            <li> The coarseness isn&#x27;t really a problem for me but they are much more coarse than I expected.  The bigger problem is the grit/sand falls off as you use it on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so coarse this can be use for so many more things.</li>
            <li> 5 STARS, 5 STARS, 5 STARS!</li>
            <li> total crap, amazon sent me medium grit boards. Not what was advertised here at all. The boards that they sent me would be fine for someone wanting medium grit. But that&#x27;s not what these say, and that&#x27;s why I ordered them.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for toenails and especially for individuals with thick toe nails.  It is the only nail board that I use on my toes.  It works and the price is great for a package of 48.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> If I use this on my fingernails it really tears them up and leaves them raggedy but my nails are somewhat fine. However these work great for my big toes because the nails there are much harder and a bit thicker than fingernails. The coarse grit files off any imperfections in my big toenails with just a few files and I can keep the sides trimmed so they don&#x27;t grow in. I would definitely buy these again to keep my big toenails from getting painfully ingrown.</li>
            <li> Normal emory boards wear out very quickly. These are stronger, coarser, and last longer. Happy!</li>
            <li> The course is not course and they are so weak that as you file they just bend. A waste of time and money.</li>
