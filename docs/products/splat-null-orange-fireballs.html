            <li>Easy to use, just follow directions provided!</li>
            <li>Love the color very bright and stays vibrant longer then most the semi-permanent dye.</li>
            <li>Hair is a beautiful vibrant orange now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t use peroxide so it is much better for your hair than a box dye.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>(I mix a cup of each together in a measuring cup and just pour it in my hair while i&#x27;m bent over the tub, and put some on my gloved hands to make sure it got on the front of my hair also.</li>
            <li>You can also add more of the bleach to your shampoo</li>
            <li>I was extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>ive tried.im 109 % satisfied</li>
            <li>but from what I could use I enjoyed.</li>
            <li>I love the color, to the fullest.</li>
            <li>But Now I am glad he talked me into it..</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for years now, mostly using Manic Panic, but I couldn&#x27;t get my hands on orange Manic Panic, so I ordered this.</li>
            <li>is a great color, and it lasts... (which is not something I would say of all Splat dyes, but this one really sticks.)</li>
            <li>I wanted in my hair; it was more of a reddish-orange color.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>I love the color orange</li>
            <li>I love these Splat colors.</li>
            <li>Mine was even more orange than the people they show on the box.</li>
            <li>If you love orange you&#x27;ll love Orange Fireballs.</li>
            <li>I love it  </li>
            <li>Love this color</li>
            <li>and I love Splat</li>
            <li>, color always lasts the longest, smells great, and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li>&amp;#60;3 :)</li>
            <li>Actually, my daughter is the VERY happy one.</li>
            <li>I have used the product before so as always I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>i love this</li>
            <li>but i havent had a problem make sure hair dries before dressing</li>
            <li>orange and bright.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who isn&#x27;t able to maintain bright colour isn&#x27;t using the product right.</li>
            <li>sure your hair has the right ph balance (you can by ph balancing shampoo and conditioner if needed) and that you have a good amount of protein and moisturizer in your hair.</li>
            <li>Have lots of clean up supplies handy, use gloves, and do not get on scalp.</li>
            <li>I have washed my hair 2 or 3 times already and its still just as bright as when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed in the slightest!</li>
            <li>I have been dyeing my hair for years with fun colors and this product is by far the best!</li>
            <li>thanks so much for making an awesome product i could use on my teenagers hair!!!</li>
            <li>the gloves pretty much suck, but they are latex free, so that is awesome because i have a latex allergy.</li>
            <li>The color is very vibrant and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>(what&#x27;s more important than the color being</li>
            <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t ship so safe and secure.  </li>
            <li>Bright, vibrant color  looks just like the picture on the packaging.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and comes with a bleaching kit in every box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s vibrant, bright, and lasts longer than you&#x27;d think it would.</li>
            <li>Bleached out easily too.</li>
            <li>It has been two months and the color is still strong.  </li>
            <li>And the &#x27;odor&#x27; of the dye isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li>the orange color is fricking pretty, and super bright.</li>
            <li>Product worked but was watered down and opened..Not very happy.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it was fine.</li>
            <li>The bleach is pretty basic, not the best; but, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I love the color, in fact, the first week when I dyed my hair, I ordered three more boxes of this because I thought it would fade</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair black and orange for Halloween and it was perfect.</li>
            <li>It still worked fine.  </li>
            <li>So if you love bold colors and want to make a statement then get it</li>
            <li>or it will turn out great only to wash out way too soon</li>
            <li>I actually pulled the pieces of hair that I wanted through a hair cap and it worked great.</li>
            <li>I am 62 years old and now have BRIGHT orange streaks in my hair.</li>
            <li>:) I hope it lasts a while and its really affordable better than going to a store to buy it</li>
            <li>Bleach first for better color.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I recieved my package.</li>
            <li>All the colors so far have stayed vibrant and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>This will take the dye right out from your hair!</li>
            <li>To me, the best part about it is the fact that it hardly fades at all.</li>
            <li>hair is bleached white and the orange was bright.  </li>
            <li>I use cool water to wash my hair</li>
            <li>But hey, that&#x27;s better than having to go the whole summer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Splat pink  and purple colors before, and they DO NOT COME OUT easily, which is, for me, a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Great product stays in longer then other products.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t was out quick either.</li>
            <li>This has worked just as well as any of the other colors splat offers (which is wonderfully).</li>
            <li>It lasts very well and is easy to use we will use this brand again.</li>
            <li>The fact that it comes with bleach makes it worth while.</li>
            <li>Fun.  </li>
            <li>It got here faster than expected, and I was more than pleased with the color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of eccentric).</li>
            <li>Always fresh stock.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this product if you want nice color.&lt;br /&gt;Remember that this product does not change your hair color, but only coats your hair.</li>
            <li>those long complaints said I still love this product because the dye is more of a stain and last longer than most demi permanent dyes.</li>
            <li>It is a good product I just recently used the color on my hair  and the color is vibrant and I have compliments on the color.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, VERY bright orange.</li>
            <li>I started to think I was allergic, but that couldn&#x27;t be right, since I&#x27;ve bleached my hair before.</li>
            <li>Ive bought 7 bottles.its the best color yet n not sold in stores.i get smirrering multi colors of orange,its bright n easier to rinse...not a big mess like other colors</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Condition: New&lt;br /&gt;Brand new, ships safely &amp; securely.</li>
            <li>Orange is my favorite color, so when I saw this and read the mostly poor reviews, I decided to bet on the good ones and take a chance in ordering it.</li>
            <li>This (vibrant) color is hot shower friendly.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair many times a year with different colors and combo&#x27;s using Splat hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teen isn&#x27;t pleased.</li>
            <li>This is the first time using this product</li>
            <li>i have used splat hair dye before, this was my first time using this color.</li>
            <li>(also, I&#x27;m the one who uploaded the photo to show you exactly how the color turns out)</li>
            <li>The color is good, but around 1/3 of the dye was wasted inside of the box.</li>
            <li>your hair is damaged too much from bleaching the dye will not stick right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments from total strangers on the bright color of it.</li>
            <li>colors they have are very vibrant and pretty on bleached hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty intense.  </li>
            <li>but if it is too strong it will actually bleach your hair again instead of just lifting some of the hair dye.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too hard to clean off the tub even if you don&#x27;t spray first, but it&#x27;s better to just have it not stick at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t take it out as much as you need it to you can repeat the process.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve played around with more than a few colors in my hair, and this one has definitely become my favorite.</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>their colors come out really well.</li>
            <li>for a splash of orange this does the trick its in for a couple weeks to a month depending on the hair and eventually washes out so for the parents who are like biting your lip like really to your child</li>
            <li>this is  really the stuff to buy</li>
            <li>I was even on TV and the color popped so much on screen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t even get much to work with.</li>
            <li>he is very happy.&lt;br /&gt;his</li>
            <li>The color washed out so fast, unlike the rest of the Splat colors.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d use it again for a single fur project, and will be very pleased once again.</li>
            <li>Awesome vibrant color that shines and becomes a little less vivid over weeks but still has the orange punch that you are looking for.</li>
            <li>It does work, but seems to damage hair more than other bleach.</li>
            <li>can mix some of it in your shampoo and it will stay much longer and keep vibrant</li>
            <li>I love Splat hair dye and have bought this product multiple times and definitely will again!</li>
            <li>fox.the color is vibrant and glows.</li>
            <li>Unless if you leave it on for a very long time then it is lighter blonde but also yourhair is more damaged, and the more damaged your hair is the less the dye will stick to your hair.</li>
            <li>I dyed half my hair orange, half pink, and it came out great!</li>
            <li>(you can put a red or pink on top of it, but not a green)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VIVID orange and doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
            <li>This works really well and can bring it back to vibrant even after it has faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to wear gloves when I put it on as long as I wash my hands in the shower right after I put the shampoo on)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does fade pretty fast so if you&#x27;re looking for a hair color that will only last a week or two, this is for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-You can also mix it in a clear hair glaze.</li>
            <li>Also when I used it (my hair is naturally a medium brown)</li>
            <li>I think you should pick what volume of peroxide is in your developer according to your natural hair color, so this peroxide in a box is not going to work well for everyone&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend leaving conditioner on your hair for 15 or 20 minutes after you bleach it, and if it is not your first time bleaching your hair then i would suggest either doing a moisturizing treatment or leaving the conditioner on your hair all night long.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair 2-3 times a week in old water to help from fading etc.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a direct dye, there is no ammonia or peroxide in the colorant itself.  </li>
            <li>Destroyed my hair completely.</li>
            <li>My Daughter buys Splat all the time locally and it is much thicker.  </li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t bleach the hair prior to using the dye but the color still came out very orange.</li>
            <li>Unnatural colors don&#x27;t stay in quite the way that natural ones do.</li>
            <li>If you bleach your hair, the color is definitely mor vibrant and stays longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It last longer than most hair dyes that don&#x27;t contain peroxide (although I have used products that last a little longer, but not in orange)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shampoo your hair like normal only leave in the shampoo for a couple of minutes before rinsing it out.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that if you do a protein treatment you don&#x27;t over do it to the point where your hair is hard and brittle (been there: only a moisturizing treatment can save you</li>
            <li>they last pretty long too.</li>
            <li>use some whitening toothpaste mixed with a little soap and clean it up immediately.</li>
            <li>The product instructions are clear and simple to follow.</li>
            <li>It has been 2 weeks and my hair has barely faded in the slightest (except the ends, but that&#x27;s to be expected when you bleach your hair as much as I do).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only hair dye she will use, and she says it leaves her hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>i also used leftover hair bleach and an old rag to wipe some orange dye off of my white sink and tub.</li>
            <li>it turned out very yellow and not the normal blonde color I was expecting.</li>
            <li>the color turns out great just for the record and if you keep washing it in cold water, it lasts so long!</li>
            <li>Fades quite quick and received in a used looking condition :/</li>
            <li>Vivid colour that lasts a long time, just like all Splat products!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Not only did this destroy my hair, it actually burnt my scalp, now, I&#x27;m aware bleach can do this if you&#x27;re not careful, but the bleach didn&#x27;t even touch my scalp directly.</li>
            <li>If you have black hair this is not recommended because the bleach will not be strong enough to make your hair blonde, but for medium brown, red, or dark blonde hair this should still lift your hair</li>
            <li>It is less of a problem with this orange color, but with the darker read and blue you really have to watch out.</li>

            <li> I wanted in my hair; it was more of a reddish-orange color.</li>
            <li> I love the color</li>
            <li> I love the color orange</li>
            <li> I love these Splat colors.</li>
            <li> Mine was even more orange than the people they show on the box.</li>
            <li> If you love orange you&#x27;ll love Orange Fireballs.</li>
            <li> I love it  </li>
            <li> Love this color</li>
            <li> and I love Splat</li>
            <li> , color always lasts the longest, smells great, and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 :)</li>
            <li> Actually, my daughter is the VERY happy one.</li>
            <li> I have used the product before so as always I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> i love this</li>
            <li> but i havent had a problem make sure hair dries before dressing</li>
            <li> orange and bright.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who isn&#x27;t able to maintain bright colour isn&#x27;t using the product right.</li>
            <li> sure your hair has the right ph balance (you can by ph balancing shampoo and conditioner if needed) and that you have a good amount of protein and moisturizer in your hair.</li>
            <li> Have lots of clean up supplies handy, use gloves, and do not get on scalp.</li>
            <li> I have washed my hair 2 or 3 times already and its still just as bright as when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed in the slightest!</li>
            <li> I have been dyeing my hair for years with fun colors and this product is by far the best!</li>
            <li> thanks so much for making an awesome product i could use on my teenagers hair!!!</li>
            <li> the gloves pretty much suck, but they are latex free, so that is awesome because i have a latex allergy.</li>
            <li> The color is very vibrant and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> (what&#x27;s more important than the color being</li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t ship so safe and secure.  </li>
            <li> Bright, vibrant color  looks just like the picture on the packaging.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and comes with a bleaching kit in every box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s vibrant, bright, and lasts longer than you&#x27;d think it would.</li>
            <li> Bleached out easily too.</li>
            <li> It has been two months and the color is still strong.  </li>
            <li> And the &#x27;odor&#x27; of the dye isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li> the orange color is fricking pretty, and super bright.</li>
            <li> Product worked but was watered down and opened..Not very happy.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it was fine.</li>
            <li> The bleach is pretty basic, not the best; but, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I love the color, in fact, the first week when I dyed my hair, I ordered three more boxes of this because I thought it would fade</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair black and orange for Halloween and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> It still worked fine.  </li>
            <li> So if you love bold colors and want to make a statement then get it</li>
            <li> or it will turn out great only to wash out way too soon</li>
            <li> I actually pulled the pieces of hair that I wanted through a hair cap and it worked great.</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old and now have BRIGHT orange streaks in my hair.</li>
            <li> :) I hope it lasts a while and its really affordable better than going to a store to buy it</li>
            <li> Bleach first for better color.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I recieved my package.</li>
            <li> All the colors so far have stayed vibrant and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> This will take the dye right out from your hair!</li>
            <li> To me, the best part about it is the fact that it hardly fades at all.</li>
            <li> hair is bleached white and the orange was bright.  </li>
            <li> I use cool water to wash my hair</li>
            <li> But hey, that&#x27;s better than having to go the whole summer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Splat pink  and purple colors before, and they DO NOT COME OUT easily, which is, for me, a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Great product stays in longer then other products.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t was out quick either.</li>
            <li> This has worked just as well as any of the other colors splat offers (which is wonderfully).</li>
            <li> It lasts very well and is easy to use we will use this brand again.</li>
            <li> The fact that it comes with bleach makes it worth while.</li>
            <li> Fun.  </li>
            <li> It got here faster than expected, and I was more than pleased with the color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of eccentric).</li>
            <li> Always fresh stock.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product if you want nice color.&lt;br /&gt;Remember that this product does not change your hair color, but only coats your hair.</li>
            <li> those long complaints said I still love this product because the dye is more of a stain and last longer than most demi permanent dyes.</li>
            <li> It is a good product I just recently used the color on my hair  and the color is vibrant and I have compliments on the color.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, VERY bright orange.</li>
            <li> I started to think I was allergic, but that couldn&#x27;t be right, since I&#x27;ve bleached my hair before.</li>
            <li> Ive bought 7 bottles.its the best color yet n not sold in stores.i get smirrering multi colors of orange,its bright n easier to rinse...not a big mess like other colors</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Condition: New&lt;br /&gt;Brand new, ships safely &amp; securely.</li>
            <li> Orange is my favorite color, so when I saw this and read the mostly poor reviews, I decided to bet on the good ones and take a chance in ordering it.</li>
            <li> This (vibrant) color is hot shower friendly.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair many times a year with different colors and combo&#x27;s using Splat hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teen isn&#x27;t pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the first time using this product</li>
            <li> i have used splat hair dye before, this was my first time using this color.</li>
            <li> (also, I&#x27;m the one who uploaded the photo to show you exactly how the color turns out)</li>
            <li> The color is good, but around 1/3 of the dye was wasted inside of the box.</li>
            <li> your hair is damaged too much from bleaching the dye will not stick right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments from total strangers on the bright color of it.</li>
            <li> colors they have are very vibrant and pretty on bleached hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty intense.  </li>
            <li> but if it is too strong it will actually bleach your hair again instead of just lifting some of the hair dye.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too hard to clean off the tub even if you don&#x27;t spray first, but it&#x27;s better to just have it not stick at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t take it out as much as you need it to you can repeat the process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve played around with more than a few colors in my hair, and this one has definitely become my favorite.</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> their colors come out really well.</li>
            <li> for a splash of orange this does the trick its in for a couple weeks to a month depending on the hair and eventually washes out so for the parents who are like biting your lip like really to your child</li>
            <li> this is  really the stuff to buy</li>
            <li> I was even on TV and the color popped so much on screen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t even get much to work with.</li>
            <li> he is very happy.&lt;br /&gt;his</li>
            <li> The color washed out so fast, unlike the rest of the Splat colors.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d use it again for a single fur project, and will be very pleased once again.</li>
            <li> Awesome vibrant color that shines and becomes a little less vivid over weeks but still has the orange punch that you are looking for.</li>
            <li> It does work, but seems to damage hair more than other bleach.</li>
            <li> can mix some of it in your shampoo and it will stay much longer and keep vibrant</li>
            <li> I love Splat hair dye and have bought this product multiple times and definitely will again!</li>
            <li> fox.the color is vibrant and glows.</li>
            <li> Unless if you leave it on for a very long time then it is lighter blonde but also yourhair is more damaged, and the more damaged your hair is the less the dye will stick to your hair.</li>
            <li> I dyed half my hair orange, half pink, and it came out great!</li>
            <li> (you can put a red or pink on top of it, but not a green)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VIVID orange and doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
            <li> This works really well and can bring it back to vibrant even after it has faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to wear gloves when I put it on as long as I wash my hands in the shower right after I put the shampoo on)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does fade pretty fast so if you&#x27;re looking for a hair color that will only last a week or two, this is for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-You can also mix it in a clear hair glaze.</li>
            <li> Also when I used it (my hair is naturally a medium brown)</li>
            <li> I think you should pick what volume of peroxide is in your developer according to your natural hair color, so this peroxide in a box is not going to work well for everyone&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend leaving conditioner on your hair for 15 or 20 minutes after you bleach it, and if it is not your first time bleaching your hair then i would suggest either doing a moisturizing treatment or leaving the conditioner on your hair all night long.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair 2-3 times a week in old water to help from fading etc.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a direct dye, there is no ammonia or peroxide in the colorant itself.  </li>
            <li> Destroyed my hair completely.</li>
            <li> My Daughter buys Splat all the time locally and it is much thicker.  </li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t bleach the hair prior to using the dye but the color still came out very orange.</li>
            <li> Unnatural colors don&#x27;t stay in quite the way that natural ones do.</li>
            <li> If you bleach your hair, the color is definitely mor vibrant and stays longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It last longer than most hair dyes that don&#x27;t contain peroxide (although I have used products that last a little longer, but not in orange)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shampoo your hair like normal only leave in the shampoo for a couple of minutes before rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that if you do a protein treatment you don&#x27;t over do it to the point where your hair is hard and brittle (been there: only a moisturizing treatment can save you</li>
            <li> they last pretty long too.</li>
            <li> use some whitening toothpaste mixed with a little soap and clean it up immediately.</li>
            <li> The product instructions are clear and simple to follow.</li>
            <li> It has been 2 weeks and my hair has barely faded in the slightest (except the ends, but that&#x27;s to be expected when you bleach your hair as much as I do).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only hair dye she will use, and she says it leaves her hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> i also used leftover hair bleach and an old rag to wipe some orange dye off of my white sink and tub.</li>
            <li> it turned out very yellow and not the normal blonde color I was expecting.</li>
            <li> the color turns out great just for the record and if you keep washing it in cold water, it lasts so long!</li>
            <li> Fades quite quick and received in a used looking condition :/</li>
            <li> Vivid colour that lasts a long time, just like all Splat products!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Not only did this destroy my hair, it actually burnt my scalp, now, I&#x27;m aware bleach can do this if you&#x27;re not careful, but the bleach didn&#x27;t even touch my scalp directly.</li>
            <li> If you have black hair this is not recommended because the bleach will not be strong enough to make your hair blonde, but for medium brown, red, or dark blonde hair this should still lift your hair</li>
            <li> It is less of a problem with this orange color, but with the darker read and blue you really have to watch out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using splat for the last 6 months or so, but only the pink, purple, and blue because these are the only colors that are sold at my local wal-mart.</li>
            <li> I did leave the color in for a full hour and a half (since this is technically \\&quot;semi-permanent\\&quot; hair-dye, I always leave it in for at least double the recommended time so that it will keep for weeks.</li>
            <li> In my ashy/golden blonde hair it lasted a long time even 2 bleachings did not take it out!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product, but I do advise you leave it in for at least an hour if you&#x27;re wanting the color to really stick.</li>
            <li> It will be a problem that it lasts long if you want to change your color to something that clashes it</li>
            <li> it lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t bleed or blend, it recedes from the other color being applied - by the same company.</li>
            <li> but if you think you might not want it for very long then you should just try one of the splat boxes that washes out in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stained my skin pretty  bad, and this isn&#x27;t my first time using splat.</li>
            <li> It takes me at least an hour longer to dye my hair using splat than with normal dyes because I&#x27;m really careful not to come out with a stained head</li>
            <li> a half distilled white vinegar/half water on your hair and leave it on for a minute after the wait time is up</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t skip using the Vaseline around your hair line and neck and still be carefully even if you do.</li>
            <li> actually a little upset that it&#x27;s lasted so long, currently, because I want to dye my hair purple or lime green now, but I don&#x27;t want to bleach hair.</li>
            <li> Longer than any other products.</li>
            <li> re-dying my hair every other week or so.</li>
            <li> Use the bleach (if you have dark, rough hair) for at least 30-50 minutes and leave the colour in for the same.</li>
            <li> The orange color was hard to find only reviews for, so I&#x27;ll leave one here.</li>
            <li> i have washed my hair a few times since dyeing it and the fading is minimal.</li>
            <li> you can add in a clarifying shampoo to tone it down a bit.</li>
            <li> (I use about half shampoo/half dye</li>
            <li> There was a slight problem with shipping</li>
            <li> A little too well.  </li>
            <li> the product is messy, so be fully prepared to have stained clothing and/or skin.</li>
            <li> I used to use manic panic but discovered Splatt a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on for about an hour and get a few months out of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep the color, but I&#x27;m not very enthusiastic about it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this was runny because of the color or if it was because it was shipped to AZ.  </li>
            <li> if you are clumsy like i am, and DO spill it everywhere.</li>
            <li> My Daughter has thick hair that is medium length.  </li>
            <li> you are trying to remove the dye mix a very small amount of bleach together (1/4 a teaspoon of bleach and peroxide) and mix it with a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> When I opened I was sad to see that almost half the bottle of color was spilled out.</li>
            <li> The color stains your skin and clothes really bad, so you will have to take extra steps during coloring, to keep from having to wear the stain off of your skin.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed when after 3 days my hair looked tye-dyed rather then a solid Orange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bleach my hair with other bleaches before, but nothing as bad as this.</li>
            <li> And my hair was soft and glossy but it damaged it horribly.</li>
            <li> The color was all wrong.</li>
            <li> bleach included is very poor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-wash your hair separately from when you take a shower using cold water</li>
            <li> (unless if you don&#x27;t mind taking a cold shower)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so unhappy with what this did to my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest cutting it with conditioner.</li>
            <li> Plus the color is almost impossible to get out without cutting or frying your hair.</li>
            <li> so when I saw that splat had an orange I had to try it regardless of all the bad reviews..</li>
            <li> I cant say anything bad about it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> but it came out horrible .</li>
            <li> It has a terrible smell.</li>
            <li> Terrible hair color, go with pravana and some alternative bleach.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Vivid colour that lasts a long time, just like all Splat products!&lt;br /&gt;Very orange and bright.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who isn&#x27;t able to maintain bright colour isn&#x27;t using the product right. Use the bleach (if you have dark, rough hair) for at least 30-50 minutes and leave the colour in for the same.</li>
            <li> Great product stays in longer then other products. Bleach first for better color. Great, easy to use, nice product thanks</li>
            <li> I have used almost every brand of hair dye out their and splat has several thing about it that I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t use peroxide so it is much better for your hair than a box dye.&lt;br /&gt;-The colors they have are very vibrant and pretty on bleached hair (what&#x27;s more important than the color being pretty?)&lt;br /&gt;-It last longer than most hair dyes that don&#x27;t contain peroxide (although I have used products that last a little longer, but not in orange)&lt;br /&gt;-You can mix some of it in your shampoo and it will stay much longer and keep vibrant (I use about half shampoo/half dye and I don&#x27;t have to wear gloves when I put it on as long as I wash my hands in the shower right after I put the shampoo on)&lt;br /&gt;-You can also mix it in a clear hair glaze. This works really well and can bring it back to vibrant even after it has faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It stains everything! You can&#x27;t get it anywhere on your scalp or skin or your counters. It is less of a problem with this orange color, but with the darker read and blue you really have to watch out. It takes me at least an hour longer to dye my hair using splat than with normal dyes because I&#x27;m really careful not to come out with a stained head (trust me it stands out if you part your hair and their is a big spot of dye there. So don&#x27;t skip using the Vaseline around your hair line and neck and still be carefully even if you do. Also when you wash it out of your hair I would advise spraying a bleach cleaner all in your tub so the dye wont stick it to. It&#x27;s not too hard to clean off the tub even if you don&#x27;t spray first, but it&#x27;s better to just have it not stick at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The bleach included is very poor. It does work, but seems to damage hair more than other bleach. Also when I used it (my hair is naturally a medium brown) it turned out very yellow and not the normal blonde color I was expecting. Unless if you leave it on for a very long time then it is lighter blonde but also yourhair is more damaged, and the more damaged your hair is the less the dye will stick to your hair. I never use the bleach included, I either give it away or throw it out. I think you should pick what volume of peroxide is in your developer according to your natural hair color, so this peroxide in a box is not going to work well for everyone&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With those long complaints said I still love this product because the dye is more of a stain and last longer than most demi permanent dyes. Also I like that you can mix it in your shampoo to keep it looking bright. That doesn&#x27;t work with all dyes (manic panic doesn&#x27;t help at all in your shampoo) and doesn&#x27;t ever work for dyes with peroxide in them. It will be a problem that it lasts long if you want to change your color to something that clashes it (you can put a red or pink on top of it, but not a green) but if you think you might not want it for very long then you should just try one of the splat boxes that washes out in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;little tips:&lt;br /&gt;-If your hair is damaged too much from bleaching the dye will not stick right or it will turn out great only to wash out way too soon (I have been in both situations where it only dyed the area in my hair that was just bleached [my roots] and no where else and when it dyed it all but didn&#x27;t last long)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure your hair has the right ph balance (you can by ph balancing shampoo and conditioner if needed) and that you have a good amount of protein and moisturizer in your hair. I recommend leaving conditioner on your hair for 15 or 20 minutes after you bleach it, and if it is not your first time bleaching your hair then i would suggest either doing a moisturizing treatment or leaving the conditioner on your hair all night long. Just make sure that if you do a protein treatment you don&#x27;t over do it to the point where your hair is hard and brittle (been there: only a moisturizing treatment can save you now)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-if you are worried about howmuch the bleach will damage your hair you can add in a clarifying shampoo to tone it down a bit. If you have black hair this is not recommended because the bleach will not be strong enough to make your hair blonde, but for medium brown, red, or dark blonde hair this should still lift your hair just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-pouring a half distilled white vinegar/half water on your hair and leave it on for a minute after the wait time is up and before you wash out the dye can help the dye last longer (I mix a cup of each together in a measuring cup and just pour it in my hair while i&#x27;m bent over the tub, and put some on my gloved hands to make sure it got on the front of my hair also. They i kinda massage it in for just a minute then start the rinsing with luke warm water but ending with cold)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-wash your hair separately from when you take a shower using cold water (unless if you don&#x27;t mind taking a cold shower)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-if you are trying to remove the dye mix a very small amount of bleach together (1/4 a teaspoon of bleach and peroxide) and mix it with a clarifying shampoo. Shampoo your hair like normal only leave in the shampoo for a couple of minutes before rinsing it out. This will take the dye right out from your hair! If it doesn&#x27;t take it out as much as you need it to you can repeat the process. You can also add more of the bleach to your shampoo but if it is too strong it will actually bleach your hair again instead of just lifting some of the hair dye.</li>
            <li> This dye works great. bleach hair and it will last. going on a month now and still have great color</li>
            <li> I was extremely satisfied with this product. I&#x27;ve played around with more than a few colors in my hair, and this one has definitely become my favorite.To me, the best part about it is the fact that it hardly fades at all. This (vibrant) color is hot shower friendly.</li>
            <li> Great color, great price and fast shipping! I love Splat hair dye and have bought this product multiple times and definitely will again!</li>
            <li> I have used splat for 2 years. I love it. So if you love bold colors and want to make a statement then get it</li>
            <li> My package came opened with peroxide soaking everything in the box. The only thing usable is the hair dye.</li>
            <li> works best on bleached hair. which i did. the product is messy, so be fully prepared to have stained clothing and/or skin. the shipping was fast and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Everything you need is included. I lightened my hair, had enough for two bleaching so. Then I dyed twice. Hair is a beautiful vibrant orange now. My skin didn&#x27;t stain. The coloring doesn&#x27;t bleed from my hair when I sweat. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> their colors come out really well. they last pretty long too. The fact that it comes with bleach makes it worth while.</li>
            <li> Ive bought 7 bottles.its the best color yet n not sold in stores.i get smirrering multi colors of orange,its bright n easier to rinse...not a big mess like other colors ive tried.im 109 % satisfied</li>
            <li> It is a good product I just recently used the color on my hair  and the color is vibrant and I have compliments on the color. I would  try another color from this company and would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Fun.  I followed the directions and bleached the areas that I wanted to color.  It has been two months and the color is still strong.  I use cool water to wash my hair so I do not wash the color away and a conditioning cleanser.  I actually pulled the pieces of hair that I wanted through a hair cap and it worked great.</li>
            <li> well I revived the product exploded. but from what I could use I enjoyed.</li>
            <li> I love the color, to the fullest.</li>
            <li> I like the product but jeez the orange dye was everywhere inside the package and my box was all soggy and the box it came in looked like it was opened 😒</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for years (over 40).  I used to use manic panic but discovered Splatt a few months ago.  It is by far the best in color and staying power.  I recommend it to all of my friends.  Haven&#x27;t used this color yet but will this weekend. Cannot wait!</li>
            <li> the color turns out great just for the record and if you keep washing it in cold water, it lasts so long! YAY!</li>
            <li> I dye my hair many times a year with different colors and combo&#x27;s using Splat hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband said I should try Orange, I was hesitant. But Now I am glad he talked me into it.. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is bleached white and the orange was bright.  I wash my hair 2-3 times a week in old water to help from fading etc.  this kit does fade faster then the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave the dye in for longer then said on instructions in a cap and you will get longer wear with the color.</li>
            <li> for a splash of orange this does the trick its in for a couple weeks to a month depending on the hair and eventually washes out so for the parents who are like biting your lip like really to your child this is  really the stuff to buy cause it does come out.</li>
            <li> Product worked but was watered down and opened..Not very happy. About quarter of the bottle was gone. Otherwise it was fine.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I&#x27;m really happy with the results. Bright, vibrant color  looks just like the picture on the packaging. The bleach is pretty basic, not the best; but, it gets the job done. The color stains your skin and clothes really bad, so you will have to take extra steps during coloring, to keep from having to wear the stain off of your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been dyeing my hair for years with fun colors and this product is by far the best! It stays for about 2-4 weeks. Longer than any other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for years now, mostly using Manic Panic, but I couldn&#x27;t get my hands on orange Manic Panic, so I ordered this. I dyed my hair in April, with a root touch up in May, and it is now September and the color has not faded at all from what I can tell. I was even on TV and the color popped so much on screen.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually a little upset that it&#x27;s lasted so long, currently, because I want to dye my hair purple or lime green now, but I don&#x27;t want to bleach hair. But hey, that&#x27;s better than having to go the whole summer re-dying my hair every other week or so. I love the color, in fact, the first week when I dyed my hair, I ordered three more boxes of this because I thought it would fade and I would have to fix it - but I haven&#x27;t used them yet.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great color, and it lasts... (which is not something I would say of all Splat dyes, but this one really sticks.) There is no fading, AND no bleeding in the shower (when the color runs from your hair and -often- stains the shower). Great dye, great color, I would definitely recommend this to any stranger (but perhaps not to a friend or family member - because I like being the only one with orange hair in the group).</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the shade of Orange I wanted in my hair; it was more of a reddish-orange color. It stained my skin pretty  bad, and this isn&#x27;t my first time using splat. If you want the color out try buying those hair color removers from your local stores. I&#x27;m going to keep the color, but I&#x27;m not very enthusiastic about it.</li>
            <li> Fades quite quick and received in a used looking condition :/</li>
            <li> Color simply washed out. I was disappointed with this product. Followed instructions on the box and color still did not stay. Bleach works great though.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I recieved my package. When I opened I was sad to see that almost half the bottle of color was spilled out. very dissappointed. I love the color but I didn&#x27;t even get much to work with.</li>
            <li> It got here faster than expected, and I was more than pleased with the color.</li>
            <li> bought this for my son. could not find in area stores...he is very happy.&lt;br /&gt;his nickname is now fire fox.the color is vibrant and glows.</li>
            <li> I dyed half my hair orange, half pink, and it came out great! lasted about 3 months. I will always use this color.</li>
            <li> This product arrived with dye all over inside the box. It  was packaged without a regular cap. It had the lid to use the dye on it.  The color is good, but around 1/3 of the dye was wasted inside of the box. My teen isn&#x27;t pleased.</li>
            <li> I love the color orange so when I saw that splat had an orange I had to try it regardless of all the bad reviews.. I am 62 years old and now have BRIGHT orange streaks in my hair. (I know. I&#x27;m kind of eccentric). I used the bleach for this color and applied it ad waited about an hour to rinse it out.  I have washed my hair 2 or 3 times already and its still just as bright as when I first put it on. I love these Splat colors.</li>
            <li> Good dye with a punch for the pigment. In my ashy/golden blonde hair it lasted a long time even 2 bleachings did not take it out! Easy to use and comes with a bleaching kit in every box. Would recomend for someone.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I did highlights on my own and love how they look I could use a bottle 5-6 times in this method.</li>
            <li> The product had to be shipped to me twice and was damaged both times (don&#x27;t know if it was because of the heat of summer or what) but is a great product. It does fade pretty fast so if you&#x27;re looking for a hair color that will only last a week or two, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so unhappy with what this did to my hair I have used splat before but it came out horrible . It has a terrible smell. The color was all wrong. And my hair was soft and glossy but it damaged it horribly. Don&#x27;t use. Plus the color is almost impossible to get out without cutting or frying your hair.</li>
            <li> Love the color very bright and stays vibrant longer then most the semi-permanent dye. I&#x27;ve used the brand for years and it&#x27;s always give me the color I want.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Condition: New&lt;br /&gt;Brand new, ships safely &amp; securely. Always fresh stock.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t ship so safe and secure.  Box was beat up, dye leaked a bit and got the bleach packet wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However.  I salvaged 98% of the dye.  I&#x27;ve used Splat pink  and purple colors before, and they DO NOT COME OUT easily, which is, for me, a good thing.  All the colors so far have stayed vibrant and beautiful.  Just leave the color on a bit longer than the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a direct dye, there is no ammonia or peroxide in the colorant itself.  Products like &#x27;Color Oops&#x27; will not work to take it out. (Vitamin C and Clarifying shampoo help fade)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bleach kit however?  This works... A little too well.  It&#x27;s pretty intense.  I&#x27;d suggest cutting it with conditioner.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations. If you follow the directions you get the best orange ever. Mine was even more orange than the people they show on the box. I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments from total strangers on the bright color of it. If you love orange you&#x27;ll love Orange Fireballs.</li>
            <li> The color washed out so fast, unlike the rest of the Splat colors. I was extremely disappointed when after 3 days my hair looked tye-dyed rather then a solid Orange.</li>
            <li> Got to love this product was the best hair dye I have ever tried. I have used hair dye before and this has to be the best the color was fantastic!!</li>
            <li> this color is awesome I love it  :) I hope it lasts a while and its really affordable better than going to a store to buy it</li>
            <li> Love this color and I love Splat, color always lasts the longest, smells great, and it&#x27;s gentle. The only con I have is that it stains EVERYTHING! Have lots of clean up supplies handy, use gloves, and do not get on scalp.</li>
            <li> If you have used Splat colors, then you know what you&#x27;re getting yourself into.  I can say that this color does not dilute well, so if you are wanting a paler orange, I wouldn&#x27;t use this brand.</li>
            <li> Awesome vibrant color that shines and becomes a little less vivid over weeks but still has the orange punch that you are looking for. &amp;#60;3 :)</li>
            <li> my daughter was thrilled with the results as was i.....thanks so much for making an awesome product i could use on my teenagers hair!!!</li>
            <li> Long lasting, VERY bright orange. I leave it on for about an hour and get a few months out of it.</li>
            <li> Destroyed my hair completely. I&#x27;ve bleach my hair with other bleaches before, but nothing as bad as this. Not only did this destroy my hair, it actually burnt my scalp, now, I&#x27;m aware bleach can do this if you&#x27;re not careful, but the bleach didn&#x27;t even touch my scalp directly. I started to think I was allergic, but that couldn&#x27;t be right, since I&#x27;ve bleached my hair before. Terrible hair color, go with pravana and some alternative bleach.</li>
            <li> This is just what we wanted! It lasts very well and is easy to use we will use this brand again.</li>
            <li> Excellent! The orange color was hard to find only reviews for, so I&#x27;ll leave one here. It&#x27;s vibrant, bright, and lasts longer than you&#x27;d think it would. I dyed my hair black and orange for Halloween and it was perfect. Bleached out easily too.</li>
            <li> ONE OF THE BEST HAIR PRODUCTS I&#x27;VE EVER USED!!!! COLOR IS VIBRANTVERY GOOD PRODUCT THE COLOR IS LIKE HALOWEEN ORANGE!!!</li>
            <li> The color is very vibrant and gorgeous.  I could only give 4 stars because the dye was runny.  My Daughter buys Splat all the time locally and it is much thicker.  I am not sure if this was runny because of the color or if it was because it was shipped to AZ.  It still worked fine.  My Daughter has thick hair that is medium length.  She needs 2 1/2 - 3 boxes to color her hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first time using this product and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Actually, my daughter is the VERY happy one. I did her hair and she LOVES it!! Easy to use, just follow directions provided!</li>
            <li> I have used the product before so as always I am satisfied. The package came on time and unharmed. Love it</li>
            <li> I cant say anything bad about it. it worked well and made a bright orange if you leave it on for an hour. doesn&#x27;t was out quick either. it lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughters beautiful rainbow hair. It&#x27;s the only hair dye she will use, and she says it leaves her hair feeling soft. Color lasts. Bleach and conditioner included!</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this hair dye to dye FUR! It looks great!!! It&#x27;s VIVID orange and doesn&#x27;t rub off. My only gripe is that if it comes into contact with another color (I dyed the same fur with multiple colors at the same time) it doesn&#x27;t bleed or blend, it recedes from the other color being applied - by the same company. And the &#x27;odor&#x27; of the dye isn&#x27;t that strong. Overall, I&#x27;d use it again for a single fur project, and will be very pleased once again.</li>
            <li> i love this ive use all the colors.people complain bout rinses cuz it must be use correctly.once u dye remember to keep extra for everytime u wash ur hair u use shampoo plus the dye togethere and wash hair.the color will last u longer.it does damage clothing but i havent had a problem make sure hair dries before dressing</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product if you want nice color.&lt;br /&gt;Remember that this product does not change your hair color, but only coats your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using splat for years! If you bleach your hair, the color is definitely mor vibrant and stays longer. From experience with others, there are some people that this doesn&#x27;t work on. It all depends on your hair type.</li>
            <li> Loved the product. The colors in this product are so vivid and extreme. We didn&#x27;t bleach the hair prior to using the dye but the color still came out very orange. The product instructions are clear and simple to follow.</li>
            <li> i have used splat hair dye before, this was my first time using this color. the gloves pretty much suck, but they are latex free, so that is awesome because i have a latex allergy. the bleached worked well, the kit does not include a cap or plastic, i was just bleaching some parts so i used sandwich baggies and it worked wonderfully. the orange color is fricking pretty, and super bright. on bleached hair it comes out looking like hunters orange or safety orange color. i have washed my hair a few times since dyeing it and the fading is minimal. if you only want this color for a week or so- this is not for you. this hair dye stains everything it touches, don&#x27;t spill it!! if you are clumsy like i am, and DO spill it everywhere. use some whitening toothpaste mixed with a little soap and clean it up immediately. i also used leftover hair bleach and an old rag to wipe some orange dye off of my white sink and tub. worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using splat for the last 6 months or so, but only the pink, purple, and blue because these are the only colors that are sold at my local wal-mart. Orange is my favorite color, so when I saw this and read the mostly poor reviews, I decided to bet on the good ones and take a chance in ordering it. I am not disappointed in the slightest! This has worked just as well as any of the other colors splat offers (which is wonderfully). It has been 2 weeks and my hair has barely faded in the slightest (except the ends, but that&#x27;s to be expected when you bleach your hair as much as I do). I did leave the color in for a full hour and a half (since this is technically \\&quot;semi-permanent\\&quot; hair-dye, I always leave it in for at least double the recommended time so that it will keep for weeks. I definitely recommend this product, but I do advise you leave it in for at least an hour if you&#x27;re wanting the color to really stick. Unnatural colors don&#x27;t stay in quite the way that natural ones do. So quit wasting your time reading my review, and add this item to your cart pronto! (also, I&#x27;m the one who uploaded the photo to show you exactly how the color turns out)</li>
            <li> The colour turned out amazingly and lasted a bright almost neon orange for months! There was a slight problem with shipping but it was fixed wonderfully.</li>
