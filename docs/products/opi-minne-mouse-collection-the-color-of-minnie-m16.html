            <li>It&#x27;s very bright and pretty, just as it is in the picture.</li>
            <li>I love OPI, so this just made my collection better!  </li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>I love OPI nail polish and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I just purchased this nail color because of the name and because I love all things Mickey and Minnie Mouse.</li>
            <li>I just put it on and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>but this I love.</li>
            <li>I plan to hide this bottle! :)</li>
            <li>so I was glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Opi is the brand, and this minnie mouse collection color is the one i love.</li>
            <li>Makes my hands look so elegant.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very flattering on and looks like it would be good on a variety of skin tones.</li>
            <li>:)  Since I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll never see it again, I ordered it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I guess the good side of it is that my 12 year old niece loves it!</li>
            <li>Love this color thanks for having it!!</li>
            <li>I did receive a genuine OPI product, and the sticker on the bottom does say \\&quot;The Color of Minnie M16,\\&quot; but</li>
            <li>I was really excited about the color in the photo</li>
            <li>and I love, love, love red.  </li>
            <li>Will order more when I need that color again thanks for having it.</li>
            <li>I had used this color at a local salon and loved it but couldn&#x27;t find it in the store.  </li>
            <li>I have many outfits that are this shade of pink that it will compliment nicely.</li>
            <li>Again if you like red, The Color of Minnie, is very cute...</li>
            <li>My new favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is the best combination of red and pink.</li>
            <li>The perfect mix of red and pink!  </li>
            <li>It just has the right amount of sparkle, and with this being the holiday season it is just right.</li>
            <li>In future I will be doing more research when I buy a color to account for seller error.</li>
            <li>This color is very similar to my 2 all time favorites, Cara Mia Crimson and Cha Ching Cherry, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The pink is very feminine in a cute and unique way.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good color bright:()</li>
            <li>Classic with spunk!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
            <li>This polish does not look very professional since it has so much sparkle.</li>
            <li>All Ears\\&quot; while the title indicates the name \\&quot;The Color of Minnie\\&quot; which is actually a (very pretty) red color with no sparkle.</li>
            <li>I Love the Color, ITS a red with a hint of sparkly pink.</li>
            <li>Its a nice cross between red and pink.</li>
            <li>I thought the color was going to be a solid hot pink/magenta, however it has an iridescence to it</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not pink</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was really excited about the color in the photo but the color I received is not even close. The picture shows a pink sparkly color which is actually called \\&quot;I&#x27;m All Ears\\&quot; while the title indicates the name \\&quot;The Color of Minnie\\&quot; which is actually a (very pretty) red color with no sparkle. In future I will be doing more research when I buy a color to account for seller error. Again if you like red, The Color of Minnie, is very cute...it&#x27;s just not the pink in the picture.  Here&#x27;s a link to the color in the picture: [[ASIN:B00864ZFJI OPI Vintage Minnie Mouse Collection - I&#x27;m All Ears]]</li>
            <li> The perfect mix of red and pink!  I love this color.  Great on fingers and toes.  I hope OPI brings it back.</li>
            <li> I love this color! It&#x27;s very bright and pretty, just as it is in the picture. I have many outfits that are this shade of pink that it will compliment nicely.</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polish and this is one of my favorites. It is a beautiful color that can be work all year.</li>
            <li> Love this color and the price!</li>
            <li> I love OPI, so this just made my collection better!  The pink is very feminine in a cute and unique way.  Classic with spunk!</li>
            <li> this item is beautiful it is a pretty pink with a little sparkle. item arrived as advertised. and within the time frame expected</li>
            <li> I just purchased this nail color because of the name and because I love all things Mickey and Minnie Mouse. I just put it on and LOVE it. Its a nice cross between red and pink. I usually hate red nail polish but this I love. It just has the right amount of sparkle, and with this being the holiday season it is just right.</li>
            <li> This color is very similar to my 2 all time favorites, Cara Mia Crimson and Cha Ching Cherry, and I love it.  I bought it several months ago when the collection was released and a relative &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it.  :)  Since I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll never see it again, I ordered it from Amazon.  I plan to hide this bottle! :)</li>
            <li> Good price and packaging!</li>
            <li> I discovered this color while getting a pedicure.  The nail shop was selling it for an incredible price.  So...I found it on Amazon.com.  LOVE the color! I&#x27;ve always had my toes polished RED! Now they are the color of Minnie!!!</li>
            <li> Love this color thanks for having it!! Will order more when I need that color again thanks for having it.</li>
            <li> Great price, great arrival time, &amp; great product! I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Minnie M16.  I selected it once at the Spa for a pedicure and bought a bottle at that time.  The Spa was out of this product so I ordered it online.  It is almost a red and I love, love, love red.  It is a great summer color so I was glad to find it on Amazon.  It does have a little &amp;#34;glitter shine&amp;#34; but no real glitter.  I would not wear glitter!</li>
            <li> I received my polish in a surprisingly short time.  I had used this color at a local salon and loved it but couldn&#x27;t find it in the store.  I was happy to find it for sale here.  I also purchased the color, I&#x27;m All Ears.  Looking forward to wearing them both this summer.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Beautiful Color! My new favorite.  This is the best combination of red and pink. It&#x27;s very flattering on and looks like it would be good on a variety of skin tones.</li>
            <li> Opi is the brand, and this minnie mouse collection color is the one i love. Makes my hands look so elegant. Xoxo</li>
            <li> I Love the Color, ITS a red with a hint of sparkly pink. Perfect for Valentine&#x27;s day!!</li>
            <li> This polish does not look very professional since it has so much sparkle. I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it if I had known it was so glittery. I guess the good side of it is that my 12 year old niece loves it!</li>
            <li> My fiancé loves this color.</li>
            <li> Tried this color at a salon and then wanted to buy my own for touch-ups and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. Then I thought to try Amazon and there it was, so I bought two! It arrived in five days in perfect condition.  I am very happy now</li>
            <li> The color I received was not even close to the color pictured. I did receive a genuine OPI product, and the sticker on the bottom does say \\&quot;The Color of Minnie M16,\\&quot; but the color in the bottle is actually \\&quot;I&#x27;m ALL Ears M14.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t know how that happened, but it makes me sad. :(</li>
            <li> Good but it&#x27;s not pink it&#x27;s red!!!!!!!  Get it if u want a red okay it&#x27;s a good color bright:()</li>
            <li> Well it was the correct color i wanted, however i have several OPI nail polishes so it bothered me to see that I did not have both my stickers on the bottom of the bottle the seller removed the barcode, it was no serial number on the bottle and it had white scuff across the front! For almost $8 i want my both my barcode and polish name sticker, serial number on the bottle and no white scuff across the front of my bottle!</li>
            <li> I thought the color was going to be a solid hot pink/magenta, however it has an iridescence to it and I am really disappointed.</li>
