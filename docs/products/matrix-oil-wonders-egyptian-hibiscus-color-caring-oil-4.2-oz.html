            <li>It is amazing at that also.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very easy to spread throughout my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays extraordinarily soft throught the week and look awesome.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect for using after you straighten your hair to keep those fly aways down.</li>
            <li>This product is great to just run throught the hair before styling, but my favorite way to use this product is to coat the hair pretty throughouly before bedtime, about once per week, then wash out in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Amazing and wonderful for dry hair.</li>
            <li>After that, I use a brush to better distribute</li>
            <li>Smells lovely - my husband sniffed my head and said it was yummy.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair are product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love this hair product.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on how my hair looks after using this product.</li>
            <li>and I love love love how it smells.</li>
            <li>Adds moisture and helps with frizz, love it :)</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>It does have something of a strong, floral scent, although the scent dissipates after awhile.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy or overly oily, and it&#x27;s hands down the best detangler I have ever used for either myself or my daughters.</li>
            <li>(I think it&#x27;s kind of exotic), but if you are sensitive to fragrances, now you have been forewarned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wear it generally straight, although it often takes on a bit of waviness of its own.  </li>
            <li>I take quarter size in my palm and rub it then smooth it on.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and makes my hair shine and feel so soft!</li>
            <li>but I control it better using my palms and fingers - can concentrate on getting the ends more since those are the most dry areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to find I can buy it on Amazon because it disappears quickly from the salon.</li>
            <li>Gives your hair a nice shine and soft touch</li>
            <li>The true purpose is to help retain my color.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair and it works great.  </li>
            <li>(I have colored my hair dark cherry mahogany with a great looking vibrant purple streak in it )  </li>
            <li>(I do not blow dry or use any kind of heat on it.)  </li>
            <li>I get a lot of frizz and flyaways, and it is because of the frizz and flyaways that I was interested in this</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first two ingredients are silicones, so keep that in mind if you are avoiding silicones.  </li>
            <li>light blend, leaves my hair soft and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Both of my younger girls have super baby fine hair, one curly and one stick straight, and it works well for both.</li>
            <li>The product got to my house quicker than expected and was packaged very secure (always worry about ordering liquids in the mail).</li>
            <li>really like what this did for my hair.frizz and flyaways.  </li>
            <li>really like what this did for my hair.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the reasonable price and prompt shipping.</li>
            <li>My hair color stays vibrant much longer.</li>
            <li>and I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave their hair weighed down.</li>
            <li>will just say a little about my hair type now, so you can decide if my experience will be relevant to you or not.  </li>
            <li>is the complete ingredients list since I didn&#x27;t see it on the product page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair soft and manageable and never greasy.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft</li>
            <li>I actually think it works a little better on my dry hair, but it definitely adds shine and helps control my frizz and flyaways.  </li>
            <li>I usually put a little on my hands (I use more than the 1-2 drops listed on my package, and you will have to experiment a little to find the right amount for you, depending on your hair length and texture) and then rub my hands together and pat them over my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is the only thing that keeps my naturally curly gray hair soft without weighing it down.</li>

            <li> This is the best hair oil product on the market, period.&lt;br /&gt;Very light blend, leaves my hair soft and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;And the smell is heavenly.  Excellent product, and&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried them all.  It&#x27;s a 10, Moroccan oil, etc etc.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair soft and manageable and never greasy.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing and wonderful for dry hair. Smells lovely - my husband sniffed my head and said it was yummy. I put it on after my hair dries. I take quarter size in my palm and rub it then smooth it on.

            <li> Love the smell. It is not greasy at all! Gives your hair a nice shine and soft touch</li>
            <li> Love this hair product.  I have fine, thin hair and it works great.  Does not feel oily or greasy and does not affect the style.  Makes you hair feel as if it has body.</li>
            <li> My stylist gave me samples but no local vendor carries this product. I find this is lighter than Moroccan oil products.</li>

            <li> amazing product!  does not curl your hair or make it do something you don&#x27;t want it to do.  it will take the frayed/dried look away and make it seem like you have flawless hair.  only one tiny drop does wonders so this bottle will last a VERY long time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!  It is cheaper in stores locally (ULTA beauty)  but for time sakes I just ordered on here.

            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite shampoo. This is a great product. Would purchase again.</li>
