            <li>I love using this so much, it&#x27;s good for anything and</li>
            <li>I honestly cannot stand the smell of it</li>
            <li>Never have a used a lip product that performs the way this Rose Salve did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended and smells nice too.</li>
            <li>I prefer all my lip balms in a tube for convenience but the rose salve is so nice</li>
            <li>The nurse happened to have a sealed tin of the rose salve in her locker and said that it would help.</li>
            <li>so make sure it is on a level surface if you keep it in the car or otherwise, you&#x27;ll have rose salve everywhere</li>
            <li>I have no idea why this stuff is so awesome, but it does keep your lips nice and hydrated all day, and almost instantly heals chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>as looking forward to it with so much hype and reviews saying it smells great</li>
            <li>I really love this as a lip balm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not starchy or chunky going on, but has a smooth consistency of rose salve.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>Not to mention her hiney smells like roses! :-)</li>
            <li>than that, it would be a lovely salve.</li>
            <li>However, I just have to apply more layers and more often.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I wish that it would have  more tint.</li>
            <li>It keeps my lips moist for a long time and it smells delicious!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and soaks right in.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Clear &amp; clean, great for the price.</li>
            <li>It is even fine for people with sensitive skin like me and the rest of my fair skinned fam.</li>
            <li>The price is great and I will keep purchasing this for a long time.</li>
            <li>and it is pretty tricky to clean up!</li>
            <li>I bought a full tin 2 years ago</li>
            <li>hands down, this is absolutely the best lip balm there is.</li>
            <li>This salve is fine, nice fragrance, like the bigger tin.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>The scent is soft and sweet, not too strong at all.</li>
            <li>They really should manufacture the tin better so that it really has a good, hard snap.</li>
            <li>Since Carmex recently stopped making my favorite Cherry Carmex</li>
            <li>I honestly love this stuff and have resorted to only using this.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who has skin!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it, instantly!</li>
            <li>Glossy look with a slight rose tint</li>
            <li>Not always easy to open.</li>
            <li>the next morning my top was completely healed!</li>
            <li>I thought $5.50 for a tin of lip salve was a bit much, but I bought it anyway.</li>
            <li>It may seem a bit much to pay for, buts its not</li>
            <li>Very soothing on chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>this has been a life saver I can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li>The 1st order the lid was on too tight, this time they lay on top, (not screw on)</li>
            <li>My only hang up with the product is the price, but seems well worth nonetheless.</li>
            <li>I use it at night on my lips and hands to moisturize and it keeps me pretty hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li>totally worth the money spent on it.</li>
            <li>Your nose will be feeling super sniffy with a few applications of this stuff!</li>
            <li>I expected it to smell more fragrant or at least floral smelling</li>
            <li>Extremely lubricating and highly effecient.</li>

            <li> Plus its not moisturizing long enough.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t smell good. :(</li>
            <li> To let you know how long a tin lasts.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time on your lips, too.</li>
            <li> I spent over ten minutes one time trying to pry it open with no success.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a thicker consistency because I have dry chapped lips.</li>
            <li> and I use it regularly and its only half empty.</li>
            <li> At the time my top lip had cracked open and would bleed regularly and I was using Carmex and it burned like crap and just didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s tinted pink.</li>
            <li> I had to use jar opener to help me pry the lid off and just used a butter knife to scrape out a glob of this salve and put it into one of my empty Carmex containers.</li>
            <li> Not a real issue for me as I leave it on a table at home.  </li>
            <li> I know this is expensive for a chapstick, but it&#x27;s SO WORTH</li>
            <li> so if you were to pack it in your purse it would open up and be a mess!  </li>
            <li> Just rub a little on everyday and it won&#x27;t be long until you wish to stroke your elbows!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been about 6hrs and the rash is no longer bleeding, is less red and looks so much less angry.</li>
            <li> Thank you CO Bigelow for saving my little one&#x27;s rump</li>
            <li> so it was a waste of my money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need to reapply it every few hours.</li>
            <li> , no waxy feel at all, that I use it everyday at home.</li>
            <li> As a hair stylist, my hands get dried out often from being in water all the time and this salve is my miracle ointment.</li>
            <li> My little munchkin is in the NICU and has a RAGING diaper rash (like raw to the point of bleeding).</li>
            <li> Tough, dry elbows?</li>
            <li> No more split, or redness or pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so shallow that it is very hard for me to get a grip on it to pry the lid off.</li>
            <li> Chapped nose from blowing your nose too many times from those nasty allergies or a cold?</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the tin doesn&#x27;t close that well, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I know this sounds crazy, but I applied a small amount of this to my lips before I went to bed and</li>
            <li> but Im sorry</li>
            <li> So I am disappointed with the purchase.</li>
            <li> very disappointed to discover this is a petroleum based</li>
            <li> *hate* it!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love using this so much, it&#x27;s good for anything and totally worth the money spent on it.</li>
            <li> I expected it to smell more fragrant or at least floral smelling but I find it smelling like elder womans. Like medicated stuff. So I am disappointed with the purchase. Plus its not moisturizing long enough. I honestly cannot stand the smell of it so it was a waste of my money.&lt;br /&gt;I as looking forward to it with so much hype and reviews saying it smells great but Im sorry but it doesn&#x27;t smell good. :(</li>
            <li> My 14-year-old daughter loves this salve for her lips. It is all she has used for the last couple years.</li>
            <li> I buy this for all my friends and family because everyone loves it. It is even fine for people with sensitive skin like me and the rest of my fair skinned fam. I use it at night on my lips and hands to moisturize and it keeps me pretty hydrated all day long. The scent is soft and sweet, not too strong at all. It will melt in the car in the summer - so make sure it is on a level surface if you keep it in the car or otherwise, you&#x27;ll have rose salve everywhere and it is pretty tricky to clean up!</li>
            <li> I happened by chance to find this at Bath and Body Works in the mall. I thought $5.50 for a tin of lip salve was a bit much, but I bought it anyway. At the time my top lip had cracked open and would bleed regularly and I was using Carmex and it burned like crap and just didn&#x27;t help. I know this sounds crazy, but I applied a small amount of this to my lips before I went to bed and the next morning my top was completely healed! No more split, or redness or pain. I was amazed! Never have a used a lip product that performs the way this Rose Salve did. To let you know how long a tin lasts. I bought a full tin 2 years ago and I use it regularly and its only half empty. It may seem a bit much to pay for, buts its not and you don&#x27;t need to reapply it every few hours. I can put this on after lunch around 12:00 after I eat and its still on my lips at 4:30 or longer when I get home. This is the best salve you will ever need. A must have!</li>
            <li> One for my purse and one by my nightstand.  This salve works on everything.  Great for cuticles, lips and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and smells nice too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is gluten free and works GREAT! Wonderful gift for friends, stocking stuffers, etc.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Great for my lips.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for decades ... great stuff!</li>
            <li> The best price for this product I&#x27;ve found yet</li>
            <li> Ahhhhmazing product! My lips are so chapped from my acne medication- this has been a life saver I can&#x27;t live without! Glossy look with a slight rose tint and I don&#x27;t have to wear lipstick over.</li>
            <li> Amazing balm. Extremely lubricating and highly effecient. The best thing about this, is that&#x27; it is all purpose use. From lips, to elbows, hands and knees it works incredibly well all over. My only hang up with the product is the price, but seems well worth nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I really love this as a lip balm. Since Carmex recently stopped making my favorite Cherry Carmex I was on the hunt for something to replace it and found this. The scent is very appealing and I like that it&#x27;s tinted pink. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the tin it comes in. I *hate* it!! I spent over ten minutes one time trying to pry it open with no success. It&#x27;s so shallow that it is very hard for me to get a grip on it to pry the lid off. I wish they offered it with a lid that screws on or maybe one that slides open. I had to use jar opener to help me pry the lid off and just used a butter knife to scrape out a glob of this salve and put it into one of my empty Carmex containers. Otherwise I couldn&#x27;t use this. They need to re-design the container.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well!  This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered these and there&#x27;s a problem with the metal container lids.  The 1st order the lid was on too tight, this time they lay on top, (not screw on) so if you were to pack it in your purse it would open up and be a mess!  Not a real issue for me as I leave it on a table at home.  P.S. I prefer all my lip balms in a tube for convenience but the rose salve is so nice, no waxy feel at all, that I use it everyday at home.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why this stuff is so awesome, but it does keep your lips nice and hydrated all day, and almost instantly heals chapped lips.  Amazing.</li>
            <li> Very soothing on chapped lips.  I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> AH-MAZING. You know how sometimes you put on chapstick and it gives you that gross feeling, where you just want to wipe it off? This doesn&#x27;t do that. It&#x27;s not starchy or chunky going on, but has a smooth consistency of rose salve. It smells amazing and soaks right in. It lasts a long time on your lips, too. A tin lasts *forever* I may add! My only issue is that the tin doesn&#x27;t close that well, which is annoying. They really should manufacture the tin better so that it really has a good, hard snap. I know this is expensive for a chapstick, but it&#x27;s SO WORTH IT! I honestly love this stuff and have resorted to only using this.</li>
            <li> hands down, this is absolutely the best lip balm there is. But what&#x27;s even better are the multitude of uses this product can be used for! Tough, dry elbows? Just rub a little on everyday and it won&#x27;t be long until you wish to stroke your elbows! Chapped nose from blowing your nose too many times from those nasty allergies or a cold? Your nose will be feeling super sniffy with a few applications of this stuff! As a hair stylist, my hands get dried out often from being in water all the time and this salve is my miracle ointment. My hands fee absolutely amazing. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who has skin! Even my husband loves to use this stuff!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lip balm. It keeps my lips moist for a long time and it smells delicious! The price is great and I will keep purchasing this for a long time. A very satisfied customer!!!</li>
            <li> Trying to find something to replace another brand, which seems to have gone out of production. This salve is fine, nice fragrance, like the bigger tin.</li>
            <li> My little munchkin is in the NICU and has a RAGING diaper rash (like raw to the point of bleeding). The nurse happened to have a sealed tin of the rose salve in her locker and said that it would help. It has been amazing! It&#x27;s only been about 6hrs and the rash is no longer bleeding, is less red and looks so much less angry. Not to mention her hiney smells like roses! :-) Thank you CO Bigelow for saving my little one&#x27;s rump</li>
            <li> very disappointed to discover this is a petroleum based product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that, it would be a lovely salve. i&#x27;m working on building a clone recipe based in cocoa butter, lanolin, and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> Great product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Only one came.  Great product but needed them for Christmas stocking stuffers and being shorted wasn&#x27;t good!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Not always easy to open. Clear &amp; clean, great for the price. Bought some for gifts!. Good size.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb.  It has a great scent, and so many uses.  I definitely recommend giving this stuff a try in your home.  You&#x27;ll love it, instantly!</li>
            <li> It is good. I was hoping for a thicker consistency because I have dry chapped lips. However, I just have to apply more layers and more often. I love the smell. I wish that it would have  more tint. All in all a good product. I would recommend it and purchase it again.</li>
