            <li>the warming sensation is perfect not to hot!</li>
            <li>Obsidian is ok, but not as great as some people play it up to be.</li>
            <li>Ok the price of the lotion was a great deal I&#x27;ll give them</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Obsidian smells great out of the bottle, but the after tanning smell is just okay.</li>

            <li>Happy Tanning :)</li>
            <li>Lotion works great, love it, but not feeling the scent...</li>
            <li>Product smells good in the beginning and feels nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Really good color, really nice smell.</li>
            <li>If you can handle using this every day in the best bed your salon has available, more power to you.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>So three stars for being a darkening designer skin product but lost two for burning my a$&amp; and avoiding touching my son until I showered!</li>

            <li>it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it had a warm feeling or a tingle to it at all but asked my tannin place</li>
            <li>It soaks up better &amp; your tan will be much more brilliant &amp; healthy looking</li>
            <li>:) Happy Tanning :)</li>
            <li>So I went home and looked on the ever so wonderful website Amazon and found lotions soooo much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Really liked this lotion.</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>the smell was nice and it feels nice on your skin.</li>
            <li>I didnt notice any kind of tingle sensation.</li>
            <li>It felt warm when putting it on, but no bronzing effects at all.</li>
            <li>Gives you a nice color.</li>
            <li>and it smells really nice before and after tanning.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, not too girly, my husband uses it too.</li>
            <li>It has a nice warming effect,that&#x27;s not at all a tingle.</li>
            <li>my salon sells this for about 120$ so its nice to know i can get it at a resonable price and not worring about it</li>
            <li>I would reccomend this lotion to anyone who wants great tanning results!!</li>
            <li>The smell is \\&quot;Caribbean Mist,\\&quot; which smells nice in the bottle and on the skin.</li>
            <li>I get a nice brown color from the lotion.</li>
            <li>and it felt nice.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I just think its the brand name.</li>
            <li>It will make you get too warm from the heaters and made my veins redden through my skin.</li>
            <li>Love the product as well smells awesome and works awesome same as the one in the tanning salon just a lot more affordable on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It came in nice plastic bag,</li>
            <li>The obsidian has a lot of bronzer in it and didnt make me look orange or anything, nice scent to it,</li>
            <li>It feels warm against the skin while tanning but no burn or tingle.</li>
            <li>I like it also with the warm feeling</li>
            <li>I Own A Bottle Purchased And The Salon, And</li>
            <li>This stuff smells kind musty?</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>My fiancé even said he liked the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it as a gift for her, and the price was nice.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t have a tan at all you may be impressed with this product, otherwise don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and does have a nice texture, but I bought it for the tanning results.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really nice in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Over all really nice and can get really nice color.</li>
            <li>All in all this lotion is definitely worth it!!!</li>
            <li>It is an excellent product and I highly re.comend it.</li>
            <li>It is a great lotion, my personal favorite, and my recommendation for anyone wanting beautiful color!</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and rubs in easily, I love it!</li>
            <li>I should have known the price was too good to be true!  </li>
            <li>it came packaged perfectly and brand new.</li>
            <li>It tans quick and has a great smell.</li>
            <li>and I noticed the more you lather on the better the burn (in a good way).</li>
            <li>It has done a wonderful job of giving me good color in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely happy with that lotion, but I ran through it quick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy it could be shipped quickly as well</li>
            <li>This is not a tingle lotion, however there is a very strong warming sensation.</li>
            <li>and I tan very very easily in the sun and in the tanning bed, with or without lotion, so</li>
            <li>this is probably the best lotion by far!</li>
            <li>Best lotion I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li>BEAUTY SUPPLY MASTERS ARE THE BEST TO BUY MY TANNING PRODUCTS BY FAR!</li>
            <li>Pretty good!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price on Amazon - and a great product</li>
            <li>This is by far the best tanning product on the market today.</li>
            <li>Received my product early and very satisfied!!</li>
            <li>That said, I LOVE the warm of indoor tanning (I always turn the fans off)</li>
            <li>so I love the way Obsidian gets warm.</li>
            <li>I ended up loving this tanning lotion :)</li>
            <li>This is by far the best tanning lotion on the market!!!</li>
            <li>This is making my tanning sessions more effective.</li>
            <li>By far the best tanning lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is by far THE Best Tanning lotion I have ever used!</li>
            <li>by far the very best lotuin I have ever used</li>
            <li>By far the best tanning product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Smells nice (not as good as &#x27;Spellbound&#x27; though), and it left my skin incredibly silky.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, good color received.  </li>
            <li>NEVER ever pay full price for this in a tanning salon!!</li>
            <li>I love love love this product I have gotten all my lotions from DS and would recommend them to everyone!</li>
            <li>Very nice smelling and not too powerful.</li>
            <li>Is the best tanning lotion that I used so far :)))</li>
            <li>Love the product will purchase again received quickly after ordering...smells great and darkens after a couple of tans love the color it gives</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and great lasting power.</li>
            <li>I think the best example is to have a heating pad on super hot.</li>
            <li>This works great and it saved me $70 off the tanning salons sale price Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion I&#x27;ve used that still smells great even after tanning, I was complimented on how smelled after I tanned.</li>
            <li>Great product fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because it is very smooth</li>
            <li>I feel nice and hot &amp; like my skin got a GOOD COLOR.</li>
            <li>I love it, the lotion goes on very smooth and hydrates the skin.</li>
            <li>Soaks right in, pleasant smell, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The sensation lasted for a good 30minutes and it was really hot!</li>
            <li>and my tan has become more even.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS LOTION BOUGHT</li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love the tingling sensations it gives off too.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it for this price instead of 120 at the salon.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love obsidian...  </li>
            <li>This lotion is so silky, I love the way it just glides on my skin.</li>
            <li>It was cheaper than Obsidian and worked better.</li>
            <li>LOVE designer skin line.</li>
            <li>I love designer skin lotions</li>
            <li>and it is cheaper than Obsidian!!! :))</li>
            <li>My Queen 16x bronzer was way better than this one claiming to be 30x</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with all of the Obsession line...</li>
            <li>But I still love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I would watch and make sure not to get it in your eyes or mouth because it does burn.</li>
            <li>and I was told by the tanning place here that it is the 2nd best lotion out there without a tinkler.</li>
            <li>I will use it up though because I love how it feels on and it dosent have dha</li>
            <li>and all 3 were better than this.</li>
            <li>I love the silicon based lotions.</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I tried this.</li>
            <li>buy more products from this seller.  </li>
            <li>Actually - better than that</li>
            <li>i love the lotion and the product</li>
            <li>This has a great scent and very silky feel.</li>
            <li>My mother grabbed an extra bottle I had and believes the lotion is the best.</li>
            <li>Luminary gave me more of a brown/bronze color whereas Obsidian gave me more of an orange color.</li>
            <li>and I love that it doesn&#x27;t wash off after you shower.</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>Great product and shipped fast</li>
            <li>:)      </li>
            <li>I switched to Queen for a better smell</li>
            <li>I love Designer Skin products.</li>
            <li>love this location and will order it again</li>
            <li>Coming from a total TANNING JUNKIE, this lotion is the best Ive ever</li>
            <li>Moisterized skin tans faster and more even.</li>
            <li>For those of us who are white and would like color whithout getting the leathery look, this lotion was perfect.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a heat sensation.</li>
            <li>I love Designer Skin lotions.</li>
            <li>But this is actually really comfortable!</li>
            <li>but I am not in love.</li>
            <li>minerals\\&quot;... I was really comfortable!</li>
            <li>I cant say enough how awesome it works!!!  </li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of this in a tanning salon for WAY more $$</li>
            <li>It DID have a nice warming effect and made my skin extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell, the texture and the results.  </li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>Ok I just started using this product</li>
            <li>but if you use it more than twice in a row, that sensation goes away.</li>
            <li>Bombshell all the way :)</li>
            <li>I love Designer Skin &amp; all of their lotions.</li>
            <li>This is their top of the line lotion</li>
            <li>but I sure was not paying $120 for it at salons</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t overwhelming at all</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret it! :)</li>
            <li>The lotion inside was great the real deal.</li>
            <li>I love designer skin tanning lotions and this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>This lotion gives off more of a tingle than a warmer, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>it smells better than most lotions I have used.</li>
            <li>They also charge over $100 more for this lotion.</li>
            <li>I was able to tellfit</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite lotions because I don&#x27;t like the tingle ones.</li>
            <li>Love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this lotion and will be adding it to my taning rotation.</li>
            <li>i LOVE the way it makes you smell after you tan tho..</li>
            <li>I love obsidian tanning lotion...</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I will order more of this product.</li>
            <li>I love that this can be used for both indoor and outdoor tanning.</li>
            <li>Trust me on this :)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Whatever, love you Amazon.</li>
            <li>Excellent product kept me at my current darkness.  </li>
            <li>Ok, received the item, but I purposely looked for item sealed...</li>
            <li>am going to keep it and hopefully rely on his 100% authentic.</li>
            <li>but I think it gives me more of a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; than added color.  </li>
            <li>Wish it had better results though.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Overall: GREAT product!</li>
            <li>I love Designer Skin</li>
            <li>and I have many of their products,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure plenty of people would love the smell.</li>
            <li>But Definitely NOT The Best I&#x27;ve Ever Used</li>
            <li>Used many lotions.  </li>
            <li>I am not darker nor does it make my after tanning skin scent better.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m satisfied with the color of my skin after having used this product</li>
            <li>I am SO GLAD I bought this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say this is the most color I have ever had in my life.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this way.</li>
            <li>Great lotion fast shipping  </li>
            <li>It smells much better than most lotions.</li>
            <li>I tried Obsidian for the first time today, and it worked amazing!</li>
            <li>Smells like a tropical drink! :)</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and bronzed!</li>
            <li>maybe a better way to describe it would be that there just isn&#x27;t any color gained.</li>
            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>Love the amazon prices</li>
            <li>My all time favorite tanning lotion...</li>
            <li>love how it feels on my skin..</li>
            <li>Love the designer skin Obsidian.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and would buy it over Luminary any day.</li>
            <li>I like the scent, the warming effect isn&#x27;t too overwhelming, but most importantly it helps me get amazing color.</li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;ve used many lotions and most leave my skin oily and</li>
            <li>purchased this online because the tanning salon I patronized sold it for much more.</li>
            <li>it smells ok but def not one of my fav for him..</li>
            <li>Will buy again :)  UPDATE::</li>
            <li>, feels great on your skin, leaving it super soft even after you shower and the bottle looks pretty awesome too :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very reasonably priced, smells great, goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>It smells good, feels smooth and leaves you with a nice bronze color so you won&#x27;t have to spend so much time in the tanning bed.  </li>
            <li>The product was pretty good.</li>
            <li>The warm sensation is not bad at all either.</li>
            <li>This lotion will get you dark, but it won&#x27;t do you any good if you kill yourself doing it; then you&#x27;ll just look good in your casket (like you died on a tropical vacation!)</li>
            <li>Hopefully one of my coworkers will be able to handle the strong smell because I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li>This lotion is wonderful not only does it make your skin silky smooth</li>
            <li>Found it on here for WAY much cheaper :) smells good too</li>
            <li>The only good thing about it is it smells good.</li>
            <li>Worth the money for sure!</li>
            <li>Perfect amount of tingling, especially for my fellow winter tanners--and the warming sensation is gentle, unlike most \\&quot;tinglers\\&quot; of its kind.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this from amazing though because my tanning salon sells it for close to $130!</li>
            <li>Love this product, you can tell a huge difference in your color within 2 uses.  </li>
            <li>The smell is incredible, and I have received various compliments on it!</li>
            <li>(light and fruity - peach top notes/smells like a peach-mango smoothie, not too strong/perfumey).  </li>
            <li>Service was great and professional.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it yet because I been really busy, but I hear great reviews on it...</li>
            <li>Feel free to apply liberally but make sure you rub it in all the way</li>
            <li>and it was filled to the top.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m extremely fair skinned and this (plus an HP bed) really seemed to boost my tanning results and the bronzer was not too orange-y.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still use Black, but Obsidian is my new favorite, great formula - goes on extremely smooth, gives me great color, and smells nice</li>
            <li>I love designer skin products and was excited to try Obsidian.</li>
            <li>But other then that its wonderful!</li>
            <li>The comments on the web page are not a lie, is true!</li>
            <li>It is for sure worth the money!</li>
            <li>Love this product, smells great and definitely works.</li>
            <li>It smells good and leaves my skin really silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It works great and II have a nice bronze tan as expected....</li>
            <li>Deffinately smells good though and leaves your skin very very soft!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find it on Amazon for such a great price.</li>
            <li>Probably the best lotion out there right now, especially if you like the warming sensation (not a tingler).</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I found it on Amazon, the people at my spa raved about it at the price of $120, this is such a better deal!!</li>
            <li>I honestly was not aware, i must have missed it in the reviews and on the front of the bottle - lol.</li>
            <li>but I honestly would have been just as happy with the other two based on the price.</li>
            <li>Its a good tanning lotion, but if your looking to stay cheaper, the other two are just as good.</li>
            <li>Awesome lotion, I got really dark, but beware of the tingle after.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell, no weird feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best tanning product I have ever used...</li>
            <li>Goes on clean and smooth, and does not have the orange sticky feel of most bronzers.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best tanning lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I own my own bed and have tried countless lotions (mostly sample packets received free with bulb orders).</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first then tried it and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I have used illuminary, Phoenician (the best), and black 20x</li>
            <li>and I have used it on my face and it was fine.</li>
            <li>But works fine and smells fine.</li>
            <li>It went on smooth and showed results very quickly.</li>
            <li>The rest of my body was fine besides my arms, and I shave both my arms and my legs</li>
            <li>:) This tanning lotion came sealed and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>This is super!</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m super tan :)</li>
            <li>The product smells good and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and so soft!</li>
            <li>I didnt see a huge difference after tanning once with this lotion but</li>
            <li>and i noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>AND a huge plus is the price, compared to the $120.00 price at the salon.</li>
            <li>I used one of those &amp;#34;tanning tattoos&amp;#34; to measure my tan, and I noticed a HUGE difference with just one use.</li>
            <li>PUT ON LIGHTLY ON FACE</li>
            <li>If you want the silky smooth, non-greasy feel with no burned smell hours after tanning, this is the lotion for you.</li>
            <li>I read somewhere that rotating lotions allows you to get the darkest by giving you a broader spectrum of light coverage.  </li>
            <li>How can he sell it so cheap?</li>
            <li>I was sent 2 free samples and card with their information.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product yesterday after reading great reviews on it and seeing the results my friend had with a similar product, Luminary.</li>
            <li>It has a warming feel to it and goes on silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I immediately looked darker and my skin felt amazingly smooth.  </li>
            <li>Overall Obsidian is an amazing lotion but for people like me that it takes a bit more to tan then it might be more of a gradual tan</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I went to use a different lotion that I realized just how great this one is.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a burn or tingle, more like putting on sweats fresh out the dryer or sitting on a heated leather car seat.</li>
            <li>Tans you off the hook, smells great and cuts back on visit to tan by getting you browner quicker.....</li>
            <li>This lotion honestly didn&#x27;t do much for me, i didn&#x27;t notice a difference between this lotion and a cheaper one i used.</li>
            <li>my skin is silky smooth</li>
            <li>it feels so silky and smooth when applied.</li>
            <li>Overall happy with this product</li>
            <li>I seem to burn with cheap lotions but this, NEVER...</li>
            <li>Goes on silky smooth, not greasy.</li>
            <li>but this is genuine.</li>
            <li>It still goes on smooth, but after being exposed to the lights of the tanning bed</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t order this product from Amazon, but I used to work at a tanning salon and it definitely got GREAT reviews.</li>
            <li>Sealed, smells great, and CHEAPER for the SAME product at a salon.</li>
            <li>, the color is noticable after just one use and my skin is silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see anything spectacular out of this lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few tanning bronzers over time, and this one remains the best.</li>
            <li>so cheap I had to buy it</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this lotion would do wonderful things for me, but I&#x27;ve used it for about a month and realize I get darker results when I switch back to my Supre Smoke.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and overall great product!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used walmarts tanning lotion as my back up lotion for when my good ones ran out and that one is better.</li>
            <li>The lotion so far is good for the tan though.</li>
            <li>The lotion I received smelled right, but was thinner, did not have the &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; this lotion is supposed to have, and most importantly did not improve my tan like it should have.  </li>
            <li>right it wasn&#x27;t sealed so we would save on the shipping cost (which was suppose to be free!)</li>
            <li>The price was good, I received my product 1-2 after ordering, I ordered on a Thursday and received my product early Saturday morning, and it was sealed in the original packaging.......</li>
            <li>Price is decent, delivery was fast and packaging great.</li>
            <li>the more heat you will feel because its like you are getting more sun into your skin, just like a high UV day in Florida where I grew up.)  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of cheap bodyspray that was popular in junior high.</li>
            <li>The old saying of &#x27;if it sounds too good to be true&#x27;, it&#x27;s a scam.</li>
            <li>The scent is great, the lotion goes on very nicely, the warming sensation is pleasent, and I got immediate color after using it, but it didn&#x27;t last that long and gave me an orange look from all the bronzers.</li>
            <li>I tan very easily, &amp; this lotion seemed to not get me very tan at all.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE TRIED SO FAR!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite!</li>
            <li>I have been an avid tanner for about 14 years and this lotion exceeded my expectations and is one of the better lotions I have used.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product bc</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>IF IN THE Original Package as though you were getting it from a Tanning Salon.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts long.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product at the tanning salon, retail there was over $100.</li>
            <li>I hope you love this lotion as much I do!</li>
            <li>expiration date is pretty important and should have said so in the description!</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t original lotion because I was allergic to this one but not the one I had bought from the tanning place.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, I did not see any significant change in color.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned of Irish decent male, and I have to agree this product is one of the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I am able to keep a nice colored tan only going onece or twice a week</li>
            <li>I have used several of these premium lotion products and this one is clearly the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and feels great on the skin, and gives you a really nice, dark, brown tan after just a couple of visits.</li>
            <li>I did get a special deal if I purchased 2 bottles, still way overpriced.</li>
            <li>Specially is used in a Sunboard.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend putting it on your face because the tingling becomes burning.. specially at the beach.</li>
            <li>The smell is like others, nothing special about this one.</li>
            <li>I was right!  </li>
            <li>I ordered this a couple days ago and got it today and of course went right to the tanning salon!</li>
            <li>Priced right!</li>
            <li>A AUTHENTIC SEALED BRAND NEW BOTTLE!!</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews I was super excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>I feel great after using it and my tan has advanced to a dark bronze.</li>
            <li>The smell is also great, absolutely no ATO.</li>
            <li>After my first use I notice a more golden tan.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was actually going to work as good as the bottle claimed</li>
            <li>Love that this is so much cheaper online than in salons.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of trial size or single-use containers of tanning lotion and never wanted to buy the full product.  </li>
            <li>I pulled my full 20 minutes in the bed;</li>
            <li>then smell good after (you can always take a shower, but you can only tan at the salon once a day in Florida).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, even though I&#x27;m sensitive to scents, it just gets a body-odor smell afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Noticed a good lasting color difference when I started using this lotion.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft, nice smell.</li>
            <li>While I still love Obsidian, the after smell really started bothering me after a while.</li>
            <li>You will actually smell good after tanning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a full 7 days</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion and would recommend to a friend :)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have tingle,but a more gentle warming sensation.  </li>
            <li>and I got kind of nervous because I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin (eczema)</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a good bronzing lotion.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much more reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>BUT I have used much lower priced lotions by Designer Skin that have had more bronzing power.</li>
            <li>It will have to be washed off with a cool shower since it&#x27;s heated.</li>
            <li>A lil tingle but not bad.</li>
            <li>The lotion does go on easily, and it does smell pretty good compared to other lotions, but I would rather take more time applying lotion and smell strange after than to smell good and see no results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it on here at such a reasonable price and through a seller that was very prompt and great person to work with.</li>
            <li>I either missed that in other reviews or no one else experienced it.  </li>
            <li>Designer skin does make great loions, so don&#x27;t get me wrong, Obsidian is a good lotion if you like lotions with a lot of bronzers, but the color just seemed to fade quickly.</li>
            <li>i was lucky and got it on sale.</li>
            <li>Came quick, undamaged, and unopened.</li>
            <li>I was trying to get back in the hang of using tingle lotions since those give you the best tan possible.  </li>
            <li>It helped me regain my color so quickly</li>
            <li>I like the scent, and the feel is super silky.</li>
            <li>arrived really quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, it has a mild tingle.</li>
            <li>It really helped take my color to the next level.it smells great even after u get out the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>have been tanning for years and have found that this lotion has given me very quick results deep dark smooth tan love it!!!  </li>
            <li>and I have a very pretty brown color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells WONDERFUL and gives a DARK all natural color!</li>
            <li>I was overall very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I used to use DS Luminary and Black, which both have great formulas, but I couldn&#x27;t take the scent of Luminary after awhile, and tried a sachet of this at my salon, and have since converted.  </li>
            <li>This lotion keeps your skin feeling amazing and gets you that dark tan you love.</li>
            <li>Has good bronzer, but not obvious after first use.</li>
            <li>Either way, I loved it enough to buy a whole bottle!</li>
            <li>(if you know MAC makeup coloring) --And I was just using Bombshell &amp; Back to Black&amp;lt;- which was pretty good.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, works very well, leaves skin soft &amp; clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>it made me way darker just on the first use!</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t you think that sampler extra in the box cost alot more for shipping cost then the seal on the bottle!</li>
            <li>I have let several tanning friends try it, and they all love it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I got obsidian real obsidian tanning lotion for 36 bux!!</li>
            <li>This product REALLY WORKS!!</li>
            <li>Owner&#x27;s were QUICK to respond, which made for a nice experience, and, they offered my money back.  </li>
            <li>Very light soft smell too.</li>
            <li>The warming effect is subtle and very pleasant; not at all like a tingle lotion.</li>
            <li>Very high end silicone leaves your skin feeling incredibly smooth and hydrated and the smell?</li>
            <li>I got amazing results after just 1 use and that was in the high pressure which normally takes a couple days in a row to see some darkness.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and after just once, I could tell a big difference.  </li>
            <li>It really does leave you smelling fantastic.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this amazingly cheap product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how amazing this lotion is.</li>
            <li>It also smells amazing, no gross after-tan  smell at all.</li>
            <li>I work at a tanning salon and this lotion is defintely worth the money.</li>
            <li>but you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s worth buying for that fact in itself.</li>
            <li>Make sure to drink plenty of water before going to tan with this one, and of course, don&#x27;t spray any perfume or cologne directly on your skin before tanning or while letting the bronzers work for 2-3 hours after tanning.  </li>
            <li>Favorite lotion so far.</li>
            <li>This item is ok, but I would not reccomend it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Oh well, I can&#x27;t complain considering the nice deep brown color I get from it.</li>
            <li>and I love that my skin feels soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>So nothing exciting.</li>
            <li>but it only got slightly warm for me</li>
            <li>when I got out of the tanning bed, I went to wipe the excess sweat off and started feeling warm in the places where I had wiped (like my back).</li>
            <li>It is the the best cream I have ever used to get a really good base tan before summer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the sensation of my skin being melted by lava is worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny...</li>
            <li>but this was so worth it</li>
            <li>Gives me a nice deep bronze color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard Luminary was nice, must try that next.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definately worth trying, just never buy from the salon.</li>
            <li>Golden brown.</li>
            <li>So far as the bronzing goes, you really can&#x27;t beat it (my tan got noticeably darker from using it, darker than I thought it could be), and it has a nice apricot-y smell</li>
            <li>Liked it just not enough to purchase again.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I like obsidian and luminary the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few lotions over the years and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>I also want to mention that after I had already purchased it, I went back and noticed the \\&quot;warm volcanic minerals\\&quot; on the bottle</li>
            <li>My favorite thus far.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It smells great and really gets you darker than other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I do tan pretty quickly as it is, but this boosts it up like craaazzzyyy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see immediate results as some users claim, however my body got super hot and tingly.</li>
            <li>This item shipped quickly and was exactly what i thought it was going to be.  </li>
            <li>It gets me super tan super fast.</li>
            <li>It smells really good and is EXTREMELY moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It does not give you color right after you get out of the bed</li>
            <li>After opening the package I had to check the scent, consistancy of the lotion, color (Almost every lotion will bronzers will be brown), everything was right on.</li>
            <li>Soaks right in.</li>
            <li>I used this one time and saw a difference in color right out of the bed.  </li>
            <li>Its a great lotion and does get you dark fast.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and is exactly the same product as in the salon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I first bought this lotion last year and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Even though the silicon peels off, it leaves my skin feeling super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin was super soft after using it anf the smell,before and after, was light and citrus.</li>
            <li>I think im just gonna go with a full on tingle like modern bombshell.</li>
            <li>Smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave streaks, gets you dark.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re a morning tanner, or run errands, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, but if you don&#x27;t have time or ability to tan much and want to get dark, this is amazing!</li>
            <li>This is just a standard silicone bronzer like Luminary by Designer skin, but a step more powerful.  </li>
            <li>Glad i kept this lotion n gave it  a second chance, it takes a lil time but is worth it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>It really helps achieving a great tan in just a few visits to the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>There is a slight tingle feels good though.</li>
            <li>I used it later that day in a regular bed and still noticed GREAT COLOR</li>
            <li>It has a ridiculously strong peach smell that is nowhere near the smell of the sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, so there&#x27;s no excuse NOT to buy this lotion! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt that kind of warmth from a regular bronzing lotion, and in certain (private) areas this was more than just a warmth...</li>
            <li>The main area that it makes feel kind of hot is my back side.</li>
            <li>then you know this is an amazing lotion, but what I received was not real.  </li>
            <li>and they said it was real!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of the next day color</li>
            <li>Always put on moisturizing lotion within the first 3 minutes after showering.</li>
            <li>Thanks Designer Skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend you try Liberate first.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on</li>
            <li>So for my wedding next month I decided to give it one more shot.  </li>
            <li>Then I switched to Obsidian my first bronzing lotion in 8 years.  </li>
            <li>Exact match</li>
            <li>so let me first say THANK YOU for the extremely fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>I used Obsidian for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>If you are just beginning to tan, this will probably burn you like your first day on vacation in Florida without any sunscreen and you are from a northern state and never get out there as it is.  </li>
            <li>definitely gave me much more color.  </li>
            <li>It was not completely horrible but it was still a feeling a have never felt without being next to fire!</li>
            <li>I did not get any darker from the first use.  </li>
            <li>I looked exactly like I did before I stepped into the stand up with this obsidian.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Love this tanning lotion, especially for the price !!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more lotion from him.</li>
            <li>big plus :-)</li>
            <li>I used it twice  and just to make sure I felt, what I thought, I  felt what was the over heating of the skin which by the way ,  felt way  to hot for me to try it the third time,and then I  realized ,  </li>
            <li>I did not feel any tingling or overwhelmingly hot sensations when using this product either.</li>
            <li>I am going back for more...</li>
            <li>There is no weird smell like some of these lotions have</li>
            <li>I first thought \\&quot;30 bronzers?</li>
            <li>Just be aware of that.</li>
            <li>I had been tanning with another designer skin lotion that was just a quad bronzer and this definitely gave me much more color.</li>
            <li>Works fast!  </li>
            <li>That Would Make My Tanning so much more addictive!!</li>
            <li>Finally decided to buy it off of my favorite place Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time on Friday</li>
            <li>Gets you tan fast!</li>
            <li>However remember no two peoples skin are exactly alike.  </li>
            <li>Coming from someone that has freckles and doesn&#x27;t tan the easiest at first, that is saying a lot.</li>
            <li>Burned on my first try with this product</li>
            <li>When i first started to use it</li>
            <li>It is worth the money and it is so much cheaper here on amazon.</li>
            <li>I first saw this in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>Gave me color first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only able to tan about 3 times a week</li>
            <li>and IT REALLY WORKS!  </li>
            <li>even the first time) I went.</li>
            <li>I will use it only if I don&#x27;t have anything better at hand.</li>
            <li>Had my skin very bronze and everyone noticed!</li>
            <li>But it most definitely will after 2 or 3 sessions.</li>
            <li>i put it on for the first time, and i must say it DEFINETLY IS A TINGLER LOTION.  </li>
            <li>after about 5 minutes of me putting on  the lotion, i could feel how HOT i was getting.  </li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion and would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>If I am feeling ambitious, I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews I figured it was time to get out of the rut and try a different Designer Skin lotion</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t already know it is hot and if you are a guy learn from my mistake and DO NOT rub this stuff on your um, ball and chain.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m allergic to many different chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I was nervous the first time I used this lotion.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
            <li>They say to be aware that there are generics on the internet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tanning for years, most recently at ZoomTan here in Florida.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal though!</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of taking a hot shower with this lotion on and it BURNS.</li>
            <li>its exactly what I needed...will be ordering two bottles this time instead of one.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a avid tanner....</li>
            <li>or it was hot, but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, it goes on smooth and leaves your skin feeling soft and silky, not oily.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Its the first warming lotion I&#x27;ve ever used not a tingle</li>
            <li>However, when I received the lotion the bottle was nearly open and it appeared as though it had been used with lotion smeared all over the top of the bottle.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m aware of what the manufactures packaging should look like for this lotion.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m overall pleased.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and do not tan all year round, so when I heard of this lotion and read the reviews, I thought I would try it.  </li>
            <li>:  Don&#x27;t know why I went off to a few others in between this review, they were not as good as this product.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to other buyers looking for a good tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>You would think that this lotion is amazing and makes your tanning experience a euphoric experience from other listed reviews and the cost in salons.  </li>
            <li>My body got soooooooo dark and sexy using this lotion!</li>
            <li>and I always walk out with a nice smell not the burnt smell you get with other products.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell amazing, but my skin feels soft and I already look darker.</li>
            <li>At my salon, I was warned that Pink Diamonds was more powerful than Bombshell, but I disagreed.  </li>
            <li>Besides the fact that it gets you super dark, it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this lotion with very high hopes, I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>Really on fire like someone is holding a lighter to your whole body !</li>
            <li>I get compliments on my tan pretty much every day.  </li>
            <li>If you plan on tanning during lunch get ready to stay hot.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for a long time and I still haven&#x27;t found anything better.  </li>
            <li>I tan pretty much every day</li>
            <li>I purchased this lotion because I am getting married very soon</li>
            <li>Nice dark tanning with longevity.</li>
            <li>My favorite bronzing lotion WAS Australian Gold Almost Famous, and my favorite accelerator was Designer Skin Secret Rapture.</li>
            <li>Since I tan all the time I had pretty much hit my plateau and really wanted something to push me over the &#x60;tan limit.&#x27;</li>
            <li>It does make you slightly redder after tanning, but by morning it is a nice bronze color.</li>
            <li>and I am very particular about my tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I liked the product very much so when 2nd bottle was getting low</li>
            <li>It does have a \\&quot;warming\\&quot; sensation if you haven&#x27;t used it in a while on certain parts of your body ( like for me when I used it</li>
            <li>I do not usually care for warming lotions, but the results are well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Have tried many different tanning lotions, this by far exceeds all of them!</li>
            <li>I am darker than my fiance who is of Hispanic decent!</li>
            <li>- it has &#x27;warming sensations&#x27; that feel a little too warm on my face for my taste.</li>
            <li>It did make me a little warm, but nothing to the extent where I had to jump out of the bed.</li>
            <li>As stated on the bottle, you will feel a warm sensation while tanning and for a little while</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s worth spending a little more.</li>
            <li>The best part about this lotion, is that even though it gets you super dark, it does not turn your hands the least bit orange!  </li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON FOR SELLING IT AT THIS PRICE.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really feel the warming until about 7 minutes into tanning, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>It ships really fast</li>
            <li>I can not believe how much the salons take you for.</li>
            <li>and I thank you so much Amazon.</li>
            <li>- my color is a deeper brown and my skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li>and this is after a whole year of tanning, so</li>
            <li>Would much rather have the Illuminary.</li>
            <li>One last warning for those who didn&#x27;t notice the earlier warning lol; keep away from private areas...</li>
            <li>Not so much a fan of after tan smell.  </li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Also it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have been using a lotion that cost twice as much as this stuff</li>
            <li>The volcanic minerals in this lotion provide much needed nourishment that your skin needs.</li>
            <li>Even got free samples which is a big plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Obsidian for about two weeks now and found that I was getting much darker than with the Paradisio.</li>
            <li>Very pleasing,Before and after tanning.</li>
            <li>Also has a very yummy scent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the real stuff.</li>
            <li>got to me fast and sealed.</li>
            <li>This lotion is such great value, especially given the fact that tanning salons charge around double the price!</li>
            <li>It works way better than I had expected.</li>
            <li>I appreciated their customer service and they were very polite.</li>
            <li>I got this in record time and saved so much money, I am the envy of all my fellow tanners.  </li>
            <li>A-Z gets it to you fast</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Lotion performed very well before I sarted to plateau.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t handle tingler lotions, its too much.</li>
            <li>Waaaaay too much fragrance.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very tanned.</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion for 3 years straight.</li>
            <li>As I said I&#x27;ve purchased the real Obsidian before</li>
            <li>but I dont feel like it gave me too much color, but</li>
            <li>i got much much darker after just two sessions.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much of a change in my tan.</li>
            <li>I really like this, and the scent.  </li>
            <li>It is a high-end product and you really get what you pay for with this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like this</li>
            <li>so you know that it&#x27;s the real stuff.</li>
            <li>However,I dont really feel the warming.</li>
            <li>but it lets me know that it really does have the bronzing power</li>
            <li>Delivery time fast.</li>
            <li>but I just really don&#x27;t like fruity scents</li>
            <li>I bought this after I spent two months in bootcamp without being able to tan.</li>
            <li>Of course, if you buy it at the tanning salon it will cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>Although \\&quot;Sealed\\&quot; Is Not The Real Thing.</li>
            <li>Very Unsatisfied With What I Recieved.</li>
            <li>I am VERY fair-skinned (with freckles)</li>
            <li>I basically bought it on a whim after that, because I wanted to get it really fast</li>
            <li>I have been dying to try obsidian but couldn&#x27;t justify spending that much at the salon.</li>
            <li>Its very creamy and goes in to the skin.</li>
            <li>otherwise you feel an intense warming sensation.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Factory sealed and the real deal.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my tan...</li>
            <li>My boyfriend didn&#x27;t even know I&#x27;d been tanning (he really hates the way my skin smells after I tan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With all of the rave reviews I expected it to be better than my $15 (price on Amazon) bottle of lotion.</li>
            <li>Thank You SOOOOO Much</li>
            <li>he doesn&#x27;t really like it either...</li>
            <li>Even many hours later my skin felt soft and moisterized.</li>
            <li>is a nice brown shade, not too yellow not too red.</li>
            <li>but Amazon ! Was not tampered with at all , brand new , legitimate, real product ,not an impression, this is a real deal on Designer Skin tanning lotion !</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;m a new mom who also works</li>
            <li>I am not dumb if the bottle is not sealed it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used my Luminary about once every 2 weeks due to the strength, and more as a touch-up than anything else.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that every other lotion I have tried is better than this one.</li>
            <li>Also because of the volcanic minerals in the lotion,I found it to be a more thicker lotion,and found it to be used up quicker than other lotions.</li>
            <li>I heard so many great things about this lotion, but I was disappointed in it&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li>I will not use it again, but what is not right for me may be ok for  someone else.</li>
            <li>After tanning, your body will feel a little more hot than normal.     </li>
            <li>The bronzers really do work and they are a great color - not the typical orangy tone you get from other bronzers or the streaky look.  </li>
            <li>It went on so smooth and you can see minor results after one use.</li>
            <li>I will be sticking with this one for as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see how dark I get after a couple more sessions.</li>
            <li>Im definitely VERY tan after the 2nd or 3rd time in the stand up bed, since then i&#x27;ve gone probably 5 more times.</li>
            <li>i go to kept telling me that Obsidian was better and said it got them so dark and all that.</li>
            <li>Oh and your skin will feel like absolute silk with no icky residue.</li>
            <li>The product itself is ok, but definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;ve kept it pretty well.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion has a nice smell but does not have near the bronzing action that I expected.</li>
            <li>A beautiful dark tan that least for long time when use in high pressure bed :)</li>
            <li>Much better than the Black 20x</li>
            <li>Better than black.</li>
            <li>so you come out smelling less like burnt flesh and hair and more like a tropical garden.</li>
            <li>Half-price sounds much better, and it is definitely the same formula.</li>
            <li>and I am blown away by how much better Obsidian is than the more expensive lotion.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am willing to try another packet in a higher power bed for a longer time to see if it makes a difference, I wouldn&#x27;t buy a bottle though.</li>
            <li>It bronzed ok and warmed occasionally, and by occasionally</li>
            <li>I researched several different \\&quot;top rated\\&quot; lotions and decided on this one.  </li>
            <li>(And I have tried many different kinds at all different price points).  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have struggled with eczema my whole life, and this product did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Not strong enough to leave my skin burning hours after tanning, but just strong enough so that I am warm when I&#x27;m in the bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me this is a good Con to take your mind off that the bottle isn&#x27;t sealed and that your getting the real stuff which might only be the small sampler inside.     </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>And Ive always known about \\&quot;Designer Skin\\&quot;, from when I went tanning once a month in high school.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that one.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this lotion for someone who has an established tan.</li>
            <li>I have been going to the tanning bed on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday each week and tanning in a high pressure bed, a 10 minute bed, and a 12 minute bed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to any fellow tanatics/tanaholics who feel they have reached their peak and feel they are not getting any tanner.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and was the lotion is says on the bottle</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>(with the exception of jwoww and even that worked a little better than this)</li>
            <li>It doesnt smell bad after tanning and it has a wonderful warmth when its on your skin.</li>
            <li>Smelled great, but I&#x27;m wondering if I got fake?</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed while applying this lotion was a general warmth.  </li>
            <li>After two uses I was getting comments on how dark I was becoming.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is a GREAT bronzer but fails to provide the \\&quot;warming\\&quot; sensation they mention.</li>
            <li>On a last note, this lotion is amazingly (surprisingly) powerful, and should be used in moderation.  </li>
            <li>Finally, this lotion is the first I have used out of all Designer Skins lotions that really leaves you smelling like a fresh peach with no after tan odor present.</li>
            <li>I liked the feel of this lotion but the smell is not nice at all.</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s a mix between a tingler and a normal lotion.</li>
            <li>Barely noticed any color after the first application.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worse when someone gives you good reason to not trust the product.    </li>
            <li>Same exact product, authentic as can be, for less.</li>
            <li>I would rather pay s&amp;h and KNOW that the product is safe and original, as the seal is broken where the top screws on (not sure if they are all like that or not)</li>
            <li>and I had a super dark color with the first use.</li>
            <li>I felt a slight warming sensation ONLY the first time I used it, and even then, it&#x27;s barely worth mentioning because it was so mild.  </li>
            <li>Depending on time of year (I live in Indiana,)</li>
            <li>As a thank you for the tip they offered to order my bottles whenever I need a new tanning lotion</li>
            <li>I orginally found out about this lotion through the tanning place where I live.</li>
            <li>Even though the store/owner called me,I am still concerned that the product was not in the \\&quot;complete\\&quot; new package/box.  </li>
            <li>The addition of the tingle additive will save you from having to buy a new bottle of lotion just for the tingle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always a gamble for me when buying new skin &amp; beauty products.  </li>
            <li>Came sealed and brand new..</li>
            <li>This is definitely for advanced indoor tanners who want to take their tan to the next level.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true Designer Skin, it creates immediate color, and the warming effect feels great in a cold bed in the morning!  </li>
            <li>I went back today to a different bed that a lady recommended and OH MY LORD I got soooooooo hot in that bed!!</li>
            <li>This lotion also makes your skin feel very soft.    </li>
            <li>The lotion works well outside of the tanning bed as well which I like very much,</li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I tried Obsidian</li>
            <li>Not harsh on the skin !</li>
            <li>Got it 5 days early!</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t get it near your eyes!</li>
            <li>and I think you would see great results if you can get over the smell!! :(</li>
            <li>Not only are you hot from well laying in a tanning bed but from the minerals in the lotion.</li>
            <li>And it makes your skin so soft!  </li>
            <li>First time to buy from an individual.</li>
            <li>PROMPT SELLER, RECEIVED PRODUCT EARLY - PLEANSANT SURPRISE - THANK YOU!</li>
            <li>Not good for tanning in the summer in Arizona...gets too warm.</li>
            <li>Sadly, Not The Same Product!!!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried so many tanning products...but no more.</li>
            <li>At the tanning salon I go to they charge over $100 for the same exact bottle...</li>
            <li>Ive only used it one time with a level 4 bed and it worked the first time.</li>
            <li>Its the exact same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used numerous high priced lotions, and this just didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>Slight tingle, but nothing you cant handle!! :)</li>
            <li>I am so pale and can never get a tan but after only a few times using this stuff I got such great color!</li>
            <li>The bottle is HUGE and since it&#x27;s silicone based, it spreads and will last a long time..</li>
            <li>Like Luminary and Black, Obsidian contains a Silicone Emulsion that leaves your skin velvety smooth.</li>
            <li>After using Obsidian, i decided to purchase Liberate by Designer Skin instead, and let me tell you, that lotion is way better at delivering that dark brown, lasting tan that we all desire.</li>
            <li>First of all can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price, and received the product in 4 days, much sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li>Overall, it does what most other Designer Skin lotions do for me, so I don&#x27;t really see the point of paying extra.</li>
            <li>and it gives you a rich dark color and leaves your skin feeling hydrated after tanning.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time a few months ago, and didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with the results but was surprised when my skin began to tingle and slightly burn within a minute of putting it on.  </li>
            <li>Oh but thank you for the free little sampler lotion inside the order,</li>
            <li>AT FIRST MAY BE A LITTLE TO HOT</li>
            <li>More than 20x bronzing is hard to find and this has 30x.</li>
            <li>This is my oldest daughter&#x27;s favorite lotion, &amp; she gets DARK!!!</li>
            <li>I am fair skin, Irish and German decent and usually just burn and peel and remain the white paste no matter what I do.  </li>
            <li>This product worked well &amp; made my skin feel really soft &amp; no streaking with the bronzer.</li>
            <li>and wow what a savings to buying it at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>After you shower you still feel as if your skin is moisterized and soft.</li>
            <li>I really am questioning this seller and want my money back, bc this is not what I was buying.</li>
            <li>This is supposed to be the strongest bronzing lotion that Designer Skin makes as far as I know, and after trying it I wouldn&#x27;t doubt it.  </li>
            <li>I did SO MUCH research on which tanning lotion to get, Ive never been this into tanning (I purchased a month unlimited at my local tanning salon)</li>
            <li>I have used it twice so far.  </li>
            <li>Both times I noticed a considerable color change.  </li>
            <li>maybe I got stuck with a old one??</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this lotion 5 stars is because it is very greasy.</li>
            <li>So far-</li>
            <li>arrived early</li>
            <li>I do not look like leather, I have a natural glow.</li>
            <li>I ordered it on Friday and received it on Tuesday 5 days early.</li>
            <li>I noticed a considerable color change.</li>
            <li>and makes my skin soooo soft.</li>
            <li>With designer skin it&#x27;s obvious that you are paying sooo damn much just for the packaging.</li>
            <li>Overall I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>as it is so there might be only so much bronzers can do for you.</li>
            <li>and I have developed noticable color in a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to think this boosted my natural tan.</li>
            <li>It may be an old bottle or something.</li>
            <li>Definitely the real thing too</li>
            <li>Also arrived early.  </li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling much like a baby&#x27;s behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loaded with silicone so not my &amp;#34;ideal natural product&amp;#34; but it does what it is intended</li>
            <li>and it makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I love to tan, I have been tanning on and off throughout the last few years of my life.</li>
            <li>Smells good before and doesn&#x27;t acquire weird after tanning smell.</li>
            <li>It is a little warm but doesn&#x27;t have the extreme tingle and plus its made by designer skin</li>
            <li>Even though I work at the salon I still spend $$$ for it, which I won&#x27;t be doing anymore; next time I need lotion, I&#x27;m coming right back here!</li>
            <li>Beware it does have a slight tinge too it and it really made my face hot with a burning feeling.</li>
            <li>It smells a little yucky but worth the results!</li>
            <li>I have to be extremely careful to shower right after bc</li>
            <li>It smells amazing to me and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the feeling of fire or heat as other reviews state.</li>
            <li>This got me super dark in just one tan.   </li>
            <li>I barely noticed, and when I do, its only in certain places.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell good, but after a few tans it leaves your skin moisturized and gives it a dark tan.</li>
            <li>But, be advised, if you&#x27;re not generally a fan of the Designer Skin scents, you probably *really* won&#x27;t like this one.</li>
            <li>Although there is a slight tingle and redness on the skin for the first visits the enriched formula left my dry itchy skin so smooth, so rich, so DARK!</li>
            <li>I go to tries to charge $130 for the same bottle, so you&#x27;re in the right place!</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t too fond of the volcanic action, but she got dark real fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be getting comments about how you look Mexican in no time; I&#x27;m always getting comments like that as it is, but my ancestry is half European Jew</li>
            <li>That was a little sketchy to me, but the lotion smells and feels like the true lotion</li>
            <li>So from my experience with these lotions, sometimes the more expensive a product is doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never developed color this fast from tanning in a salon.  </li>
            <li>I would say it is probably worth the $40 I paid but definitely not worth the $133</li>
            <li>My body went back to normal.</li>
            <li>Immediately I noticed extra heat in the tanning bed, (which is normal.  </li>
            <li>Did exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>but you get super dark!</li>
            <li>Gets you super Dark!  </li>
            <li>and definitely didn&#x27;t live up to it for me.</li>
            <li>i definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new lotion.</li>
            <li>Would DEFINITELY recommend this lotion to anyone looking to try something new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different lotions; including some fairly powerful tingle lotions like Bombshell and Pink Diamonds.  </li>
            <li>It only smells coming out of the bottle, I really don&#x27;t notice it once I put it on and rub it in, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen other peoples say this lotion gets really hot</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter worked for a tan company in St. Louis that tried to tell her this wasn&#x27;t the same as the OVER PRICED EXACT SAME bottle they were selling!</li>
            <li>Super dark tan after only one use.  </li>
            <li>Because of its warming actions i definitely only would recommend this to people who have been tanning for quite some time and have already hit a plateau in their color, and have already started using high pressure beds so they can gauge if the warming sensation is their skin burning or simply the lotion.</li>
            <li>this product has crushed gem stones in it, that is why it is marked up so high at the tanning salon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Does have a little heat to it, but i barely noticed, except on my face, since i am used to hot action lotions.</li>
            <li>It does not have a great smell, but too bad either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this lotion only twice so far</li>
            <li>My old standby was Australian Gold Bronzing Fire Glaze.  </li>
            <li>actually just keep it away from any sensitive areas of the body and all mucus membranes.  </li>
            <li>So far, I have only used this tanning lotion once.</li>
            <li>Obsidian has a warming to the skin when applied,But goes away in about 30 minutes.(Keep away from your sensitive areas including your eyes).Once applied,it has a velvety feel on your skin and would desribe the smell as cross between a mango and grapfruit.</li>
            <li>I ordered this yesterday early enough in the day to have it delivered by tomorrow.</li>
            <li>I have only used it twice so far</li>
            <li>Be careful around your face, especially near or under your eyes.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel extra soft and never plugged my pores.</li>
            <li>When I first heard about the lotion, everyone told me how DARK it got them</li>
            <li>Simply squeeze your regular tanning lotion in your hand, add the lava drops, mix it between your hands, and apply to your skin like normal.</li>
            <li>It arrived quicker than the expected due date and was in its original packaging.</li>
            <li>It is thick and creamy and has light warming affect, not tingling and burning.</li>
            <li>My skin has a hard time tanning, I got this lotion because I thought it was strong enough to help me tan.</li>
            <li>I usually tan in the open sun high pressure bed, which is already a very hot bed by itself, so i can definitely feel the warming or &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34; sensation in this product.</li>
            <li>and I just placed an order today for a new JWoww Private Reserve so that I can try to get the tan I use to have back</li>
            <li>so I thought this would maybe start me out small before I went to a sizzle in the future, but this didn&#x27;t seem to warm my skin any different than any other lotion.  </li>
            <li>I went back to using my John Abate Titanium lotion (mild tingle with no bronzers to come off in the shower or on my razor), and saw dramatic results with a dark tan that looked more human.</li>
            <li>I have been slacking on tanning over the last year which means I was super pale,</li>
            <li>Also, maybe the first couple times using this lotion, go a little less on your usual time in the bed to see how you&#x27;ll react (AGAIN THIS STUFF IS REALLY STRONG!)  </li>
            <li>have ordered several tanning lotions from Amazon and this is the first one that has been a let down.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t that a little much?!</li>
            <li>it may be a little hot.</li>
            <li>I looked everywhere and foud the same exact lotion on here for much much less.</li>
            <li>so I have the olive complexion that gets dark fast already.  </li>
            <li>I really want to be DARK this summer --</li>
            <li>Not worth that much.</li>
            <li>I am a frequent tanner and had already built my base tan before using it so the warm volcanic minerals didnt really bother me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always rotated my lotions daily, and I have 6 different bottles of lotion right now (5 Designer Skin and 1 bottle of Australian Gold&#x27;s Sinfully Black.)  </li>
            <li>but obsidian,,  is not anything special... does not feel as good on your skin as any of the others.. and has a horrible after smell..</li>
            <li>It has a slight silicone feel to it which felt very moisturizing, not at all like, say, a silicone face primer.</li>
            <li>It eliminated the number of times I needed to go tanning to about half of what I used to do because I would get so much color each time (</li>
            <li>within the first week, I could definitely see that I went a few shades darker.</li>
            <li>It does have a slight warming feeling but its never all over just in certain spot.will definitely use again.</li>
            <li>But again, if your focus is on purely getting dark, THIS IS THE STUFF TO BUY!</li>
            <li>As for bronzers, I dont really see it doing anything different than my Black</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned with freckles but have tanned well before with less expensive lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used luminous, black, believe, paint it black, and a bunch of other tanning lotions and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>I will not be using the Obsidian in anything other than a regular bed (which at my salon consists of regular bulbs and 2 high pressure facial bronzers.)  </li>
            <li>I am complimented SO much on how dark I am after weeks of use of this product!</li>
            <li>Now I won&#x27;t be fooled by the new hype on other lotions.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion if you&#x27;re looking for dark color and no tingle factor.</li>
            <li>I NEVER EVER get this dark in natural sunlight, let alone a tanning bed!!</li>
            <li>and i know the difference between a good lotion and a bad one.</li>

            <li> :) Everything was perfect.    </li>
            <li> I was not informed of the heating sensation and I kinda freaked out when i started to feel so warm that it felt someone was holding a fire to my rear!</li>
            <li> love it best smelling lotion there is!</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin browning quite nicely!</li>
            <li> everything went/was BETTER THAN GREAT!</li>

            <li> As always my awesome all-time favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells great but tan wise not for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product - works awesome and</li>
            <li> great product, loved the way it made my skin feel</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion, smells perfect and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> It does not tingle and has a pleasant smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Pleasant citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> The bronzers are great and don&#x27;t appear orange just  a nice warm tan!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loved it..</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion.</li>
            <li> Anyway good lotion</li>
            <li> So if you do not like that feeling at all, this would not be a good lotion for you.</li>
            <li> Now who knows maybe the lotion is good?</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Gives excellent color, applies evenly and feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I have gotten really good results with this lotion.</li>
            <li> and it was also good.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something with a good bronzer</li>
            <li> It smells reeeaaalllllyyy good too.</li>
            <li> I was using Paradisio a 10(times) bronzing lotion also by Designer Skin which I think is a good lotion,But wanted to try something diffrent.</li>
            <li> - you smell GOOD.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be good for hydration.</li>
            <li> I loved how when I get out of the tanning bed</li>
            <li> Great product, gives a nice tan.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> so I can be a good color</li>
            <li> , I had to put in a good word.</li>
            <li> It smells good too.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews thinking it was going to work good</li>
            <li> and once it does its gorgeous color.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Good lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s A Good Lotion</li>

            <li> And it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was fair</li>
            <li> and it had a good rating, so</li>
            <li> Its good</li>

            <li> Find another product, Designer Skin just didn&#x27;t do a good job with this one.</li>
            <li> I Have tried this lotion in a sample and Loved it</li>
            <li> It gives me a good brown tan and the warm feeling is great.</li>
            <li> I have very very fair skin and do not tan easily so for something to work</li>

            <li> I just love, love, love it!!!</li>
            <li> the warming sensation is perfect not to hot!</li>
            <li> Obsidian is ok, but not as great as some people play it up to be.</li>
            <li> Ok the price of the lotion was a great deal I&#x27;ll give them</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Obsidian smells great out of the bottle, but the after tanning smell is just okay.</li>
            <li> very satisfied</li>
            <li> Happy Tanning :)</li>
            <li> Lotion works great, love it, but not feeling the scent...</li>
            <li> Product smells good in the beginning and feels nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Really good color, really nice smell.</li>
            <li> If you can handle using this every day in the best bed your salon has available, more power to you.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> So three stars for being a darkening designer skin product but lost two for burning my a$&amp; and avoiding touching my son until I showered!</li>

            <li> It soaks up better &amp; your tan will be much more brilliant &amp; healthy looking</li>
            <li> :) Happy Tanning :)</li>
            <li> So I went home and looked on the ever so wonderful website Amazon and found lotions soooo much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Really liked this lotion.</li>
            <li> I liked it</li>
            <li> the smell was nice and it feels nice on your skin.</li>
            <li> I didnt notice any kind of tingle sensation.</li>
            <li> It felt warm when putting it on, but no bronzing effects at all.</li>
            <li> Gives you a nice color.</li>
            <li> and it smells really nice before and after tanning.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, not too girly, my husband uses it too.</li>
            <li> It has a nice warming effect,that&#x27;s not at all a tingle.</li>
            <li> my salon sells this for about 120$ so its nice to know i can get it at a resonable price and not worring about it</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this lotion to anyone who wants great tanning results!!</li>
            <li> The smell is \\&quot;Caribbean Mist,\\&quot; which smells nice in the bottle and on the skin.</li>
            <li> I get a nice brown color from the lotion.</li>
            <li> and it felt nice.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I just think its the brand name.</li>
            <li> It will make you get too warm from the heaters and made my veins redden through my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the product as well smells awesome and works awesome same as the one in the tanning salon just a lot more affordable on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It came in nice plastic bag,</li>
            <li> The obsidian has a lot of bronzer in it and didnt make me look orange or anything, nice scent to it,</li>
            <li> It feels warm against the skin while tanning but no burn or tingle.</li>
            <li> I like it also with the warm feeling</li>
            <li> I Own A Bottle Purchased And The Salon, And</li>
            <li> This stuff smells kind musty?</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> My fiancé even said he liked the smell of it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it as a gift for her, and the price was nice.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have a tan at all you may be impressed with this product, otherwise don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, and does have a nice texture, but I bought it for the tanning results.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really nice in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Over all really nice and can get really nice color.</li>
            <li> All in all this lotion is definitely worth it!!!</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product and I highly re.comend it.</li>
            <li> It is a great lotion, my personal favorite, and my recommendation for anyone wanting beautiful color!</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and rubs in easily, I love it!</li>
            <li> I should have known the price was too good to be true!  </li>
            <li> it came packaged perfectly and brand new.</li>
            <li> It tans quick and has a great smell.</li>
            <li> and I noticed the more you lather on the better the burn (in a good way).</li>
            <li> It has done a wonderful job of giving me good color in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely happy with that lotion, but I ran through it quick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy it could be shipped quickly as well</li>
            <li> This is not a tingle lotion, however there is a very strong warming sensation.</li>
            <li> and I tan very very easily in the sun and in the tanning bed, with or without lotion, so</li>
            <li> this is probably the best lotion by far!</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li> BEAUTY SUPPLY MASTERS ARE THE BEST TO BUY MY TANNING PRODUCTS BY FAR!</li>
            <li> Pretty good!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price on Amazon - and a great product</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tanning product on the market today.</li>
            <li> Received my product early and very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> That said, I LOVE the warm of indoor tanning (I always turn the fans off)</li>
            <li> so I love the way Obsidian gets warm.</li>
            <li> I ended up loving this tanning lotion :)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tanning lotion on the market!!!</li>

            <li> by far the very best lotuin I have ever used</li>
            <li> By far the best tanning product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Smells nice (not as good as &#x27;Spellbound&#x27; though), and it left my skin incredibly silky.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, good color received.  </li>
            <li> NEVER ever pay full price for this in a tanning salon!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product I have gotten all my lotions from DS and would recommend them to everyone!</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling and not too powerful.</li>

            <li> Love the product will purchase again received quickly after ordering...smells great and darkens after a couple of tans love the color it gives</li>
            <li> It has a great smell and great lasting power.</li>
            <li> I think the best example is to have a heating pad on super hot.</li>
            <li> This works great and it saved me $70 off the tanning salons sale price Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I&#x27;ve used that still smells great even after tanning, I was complimented on how smelled after I tanned.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because it is very smooth</li>
            <li> I feel nice and hot &amp; like my skin got a GOOD COLOR.</li>
            <li> I love it, the lotion goes on very smooth and hydrates the skin.</li>
            <li> Soaks right in, pleasant smell, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> The sensation lasted for a good 30minutes and it was really hot!</li>
            <li> and my tan has become more even.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION BOUGHT</li>
            <li> GLAD</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> I love the tingling sensations it gives off too.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it for this price instead of 120 at the salon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love obsidian...  </li>
            <li> This lotion is so silky, I love the way it just glides on my skin.</li>
            <li> It was cheaper than Obsidian and worked better.</li>
            <li> LOVE designer skin line.</li>
            <li> I love designer skin lotions</li>
            <li> and it is cheaper than Obsidian!!! :))</li>
            <li> My Queen 16x bronzer was way better than this one claiming to be 30x</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with all of the Obsession line...</li>
            <li> But I still love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I would watch and make sure not to get it in your eyes or mouth because it does burn.</li>
            <li> and I was told by the tanning place here that it is the 2nd best lotion out there without a tinkler.</li>
            <li> I will use it up though because I love how it feels on and it dosent have dha</li>
            <li> and all 3 were better than this.</li>
            <li> I love the silicon based lotions.</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I tried this.</li>
            <li> buy more products from this seller.  </li>
            <li> Actually - better than that</li>
            <li> i love the lotion and the product</li>
            <li> This has a great scent and very silky feel.</li>
            <li> My mother grabbed an extra bottle I had and believes the lotion is the best.</li>
            <li> Luminary gave me more of a brown/bronze color whereas Obsidian gave me more of an orange color.</li>
            <li> and I love that it doesn&#x27;t wash off after you shower.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> Great product and shipped fast</li>
            <li> :)      </li>
            <li> I switched to Queen for a better smell</li>
            <li> I love Designer Skin products.</li>
            <li> love this location and will order it again</li>
            <li> Coming from a total TANNING JUNKIE, this lotion is the best Ive ever</li>
            <li> Moisterized skin tans faster and more even.</li>
            <li> For those of us who are white and would like color whithout getting the leathery look, this lotion was perfect.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a heat sensation.</li>
            <li> I love Designer Skin lotions.</li>
            <li> But this is actually really comfortable!</li>
            <li> but I am not in love.</li>
            <li> minerals\\&quot;... I was really comfortable!</li>
            <li> I cant say enough how awesome it works!!!  </li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this in a tanning salon for WAY more $$</li>
            <li> It DID have a nice warming effect and made my skin extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell, the texture and the results.  </li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> Ok I just started using this product</li>
            <li> but if you use it more than twice in a row, that sensation goes away.</li>
            <li> Bombshell all the way :)</li>
            <li> I love Designer Skin &amp; all of their lotions.</li>
            <li> This is their top of the line lotion</li>
            <li> but I sure was not paying $120 for it at salons</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t overwhelming at all</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret it! :)</li>
            <li> The lotion inside was great the real deal.</li>
            <li> I love designer skin tanning lotions and this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> This lotion gives off more of a tingle than a warmer, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li> it smells better than most lotions I have used.</li>
            <li> They also charge over $100 more for this lotion.</li>
            <li> I was able to tellfit</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lotions because I don&#x27;t like the tingle ones.</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this lotion and will be adding it to my taning rotation.</li>
            <li> i LOVE the way it makes you smell after you tan tho..</li>
            <li> I love obsidian tanning lotion...</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I will order more of this product.</li>
            <li> I love that this can be used for both indoor and outdoor tanning.</li>
            <li> Trust me on this :)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whatever, love you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent product kept me at my current darkness.  </li>
            <li> Ok, received the item, but I purposely looked for item sealed...</li>
            <li> am going to keep it and hopefully rely on his 100% authentic.</li>
            <li> but I think it gives me more of a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; than added color.  </li>
            <li> Wish it had better results though.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Overall: GREAT product!</li>
            <li> I love Designer Skin</li>
            <li> and I have many of their products,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure plenty of people would love the smell.</li>
            <li> But Definitely NOT The Best I&#x27;ve Ever Used</li>
            <li> Used many lotions.  </li>
            <li> I am not darker nor does it make my after tanning skin scent better.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m satisfied with the color of my skin after having used this product</li>
            <li> I am SO GLAD I bought this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say this is the most color I have ever had in my life.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this way.</li>
            <li> Great lotion fast shipping  </li>
            <li> It smells much better than most lotions.</li>
            <li> I tried Obsidian for the first time today, and it worked amazing!</li>
            <li> Smells like a tropical drink! :)</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and bronzed!</li>
            <li> maybe a better way to describe it would be that there just isn&#x27;t any color gained.</li>
            <li> I love this product..</li>
            <li> Love the amazon prices</li>
            <li> My all time favorite tanning lotion...</li>
            <li> love how it feels on my skin..</li>
            <li> Love the designer skin Obsidian.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and would buy it over Luminary any day.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, the warming effect isn&#x27;t too overwhelming, but most importantly it helps me get amazing color.</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;ve used many lotions and most leave my skin oily and</li>
            <li> purchased this online because the tanning salon I patronized sold it for much more.</li>
            <li> it smells ok but def not one of my fav for him..</li>
            <li> Will buy again :)  UPDATE::</li>
            <li> , feels great on your skin, leaving it super soft even after you shower and the bottle looks pretty awesome too :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very reasonably priced, smells great, goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> It smells good, feels smooth and leaves you with a nice bronze color so you won&#x27;t have to spend so much time in the tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> The product was pretty good.</li>
            <li> The warm sensation is not bad at all either.</li>
            <li> This lotion will get you dark, but it won&#x27;t do you any good if you kill yourself doing it; then you&#x27;ll just look good in your casket (like you died on a tropical vacation!)</li>
            <li> Hopefully one of my coworkers will be able to handle the strong smell because I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful not only does it make your skin silky smooth</li>
            <li> Found it on here for WAY much cheaper :) smells good too</li>
            <li> The only good thing about it is it smells good.</li>
            <li> Worth the money for sure!</li>
            <li> Perfect amount of tingling, especially for my fellow winter tanners--and the warming sensation is gentle, unlike most \\&quot;tinglers\\&quot; of its kind.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this from amazing though because my tanning salon sells it for close to $130!</li>
            <li> Love this product, you can tell a huge difference in your color within 2 uses.  </li>
            <li> The smell is incredible, and I have received various compliments on it!</li>
            <li> (light and fruity - peach top notes/smells like a peach-mango smoothie, not too strong/perfumey).  </li>
            <li> Service was great and professional.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet because I been really busy, but I hear great reviews on it...</li>
            <li> Feel free to apply liberally but make sure you rub it in all the way</li>
            <li> and it was filled to the top.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m extremely fair skinned and this (plus an HP bed) really seemed to boost my tanning results and the bronzer was not too orange-y.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still use Black, but Obsidian is my new favorite, great formula - goes on extremely smooth, gives me great color, and smells nice</li>
            <li> I love designer skin products and was excited to try Obsidian.</li>
            <li> But other then that its wonderful!</li>
            <li> The comments on the web page are not a lie, is true!</li>
            <li> It is for sure worth the money!</li>
            <li> Love this product, smells great and definitely works.</li>
            <li> It smells good and leaves my skin really silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It works great and II have a nice bronze tan as expected....</li>
            <li> Deffinately smells good though and leaves your skin very very soft!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find it on Amazon for such a great price.</li>
            <li> Probably the best lotion out there right now, especially if you like the warming sensation (not a tingler).</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found it on Amazon, the people at my spa raved about it at the price of $120, this is such a better deal!!</li>
            <li> I honestly was not aware, i must have missed it in the reviews and on the front of the bottle - lol.</li>
            <li> but I honestly would have been just as happy with the other two based on the price.</li>
            <li> Its a good tanning lotion, but if your looking to stay cheaper, the other two are just as good.</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion, I got really dark, but beware of the tingle after.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell, no weird feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best tanning product I have ever used...</li>
            <li> Goes on clean and smooth, and does not have the orange sticky feel of most bronzers.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best tanning lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I own my own bed and have tried countless lotions (mostly sample packets received free with bulb orders).</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first then tried it and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I have used illuminary, Phoenician (the best), and black 20x</li>
            <li> and I have used it on my face and it was fine.</li>
            <li> But works fine and smells fine.</li>
            <li> It went on smooth and showed results very quickly.</li>
            <li> The rest of my body was fine besides my arms, and I shave both my arms and my legs</li>
            <li> :) This tanning lotion came sealed and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> This is super!</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m super tan :)</li>
            <li> The product smells good and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and so soft!</li>
            <li> I didnt see a huge difference after tanning once with this lotion but</li>
            <li> and i noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> AND a huge plus is the price, compared to the $120.00 price at the salon.</li>
            <li> I used one of those &amp;#34;tanning tattoos&amp;#34; to measure my tan, and I noticed a HUGE difference with just one use.</li>
            <li> PUT ON LIGHTLY ON FACE</li>
            <li> If you want the silky smooth, non-greasy feel with no burned smell hours after tanning, this is the lotion for you.</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that rotating lotions allows you to get the darkest by giving you a broader spectrum of light coverage.  </li>
            <li> How can he sell it so cheap?</li>
            <li> I was sent 2 free samples and card with their information.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product yesterday after reading great reviews on it and seeing the results my friend had with a similar product, Luminary.</li>
            <li> It has a warming feel to it and goes on silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I immediately looked darker and my skin felt amazingly smooth.  </li>
            <li> Overall Obsidian is an amazing lotion but for people like me that it takes a bit more to tan then it might be more of a gradual tan</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I went to use a different lotion that I realized just how great this one is.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a burn or tingle, more like putting on sweats fresh out the dryer or sitting on a heated leather car seat.</li>
            <li> Tans you off the hook, smells great and cuts back on visit to tan by getting you browner quicker.....</li>
            <li> This lotion honestly didn&#x27;t do much for me, i didn&#x27;t notice a difference between this lotion and a cheaper one i used.</li>
            <li> my skin is silky smooth</li>
            <li> it feels so silky and smooth when applied.</li>
            <li> Overall happy with this product</li>
            <li> I seem to burn with cheap lotions but this, NEVER...</li>
            <li> Goes on silky smooth, not greasy.</li>
            <li> but this is genuine.</li>
            <li> It still goes on smooth, but after being exposed to the lights of the tanning bed</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order this product from Amazon, but I used to work at a tanning salon and it definitely got GREAT reviews.</li>
            <li> Sealed, smells great, and CHEAPER for the SAME product at a salon.</li>
            <li> , the color is noticable after just one use and my skin is silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see anything spectacular out of this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few tanning bronzers over time, and this one remains the best.</li>
            <li> so cheap I had to buy it</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this lotion would do wonderful things for me, but I&#x27;ve used it for about a month and realize I get darker results when I switch back to my Supre Smoke.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and overall great product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used walmarts tanning lotion as my back up lotion for when my good ones ran out and that one is better.</li>
            <li> The lotion so far is good for the tan though.</li>
            <li> The lotion I received smelled right, but was thinner, did not have the &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; this lotion is supposed to have, and most importantly did not improve my tan like it should have.  </li>
            <li> right it wasn&#x27;t sealed so we would save on the shipping cost (which was suppose to be free!)</li>
            <li> The price was good, I received my product 1-2 after ordering, I ordered on a Thursday and received my product early Saturday morning, and it was sealed in the original packaging.......</li>
            <li> Price is decent, delivery was fast and packaging great.</li>
            <li> the more heat you will feel because its like you are getting more sun into your skin, just like a high UV day in Florida where I grew up.)  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of cheap bodyspray that was popular in junior high.</li>
            <li> The old saying of &#x27;if it sounds too good to be true&#x27;, it&#x27;s a scam.</li>
            <li> The scent is great, the lotion goes on very nicely, the warming sensation is pleasent, and I got immediate color after using it, but it didn&#x27;t last that long and gave me an orange look from all the bronzers.</li>
            <li> I tan very easily, &amp; this lotion seemed to not get me very tan at all.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED SO FAR!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite!</li>
            <li> I have been an avid tanner for about 14 years and this lotion exceeded my expectations and is one of the better lotions I have used.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product bc</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> IF IN THE Original Package as though you were getting it from a Tanning Salon.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts long.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product at the tanning salon, retail there was over $100.</li>
            <li> I hope you love this lotion as much I do!</li>
            <li> expiration date is pretty important and should have said so in the description!</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t original lotion because I was allergic to this one but not the one I had bought from the tanning place.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, I did not see any significant change in color.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned of Irish decent male, and I have to agree this product is one of the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I am able to keep a nice colored tan only going onece or twice a week</li>
            <li> I have used several of these premium lotion products and this one is clearly the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and feels great on the skin, and gives you a really nice, dark, brown tan after just a couple of visits.</li>
            <li> I did get a special deal if I purchased 2 bottles, still way overpriced.</li>
            <li> Specially is used in a Sunboard.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend putting it on your face because the tingling becomes burning.. specially at the beach.</li>
            <li> The smell is like others, nothing special about this one.</li>
            <li> I was right!  </li>
            <li> I ordered this a couple days ago and got it today and of course went right to the tanning salon!</li>
            <li> Priced right!</li>
            <li> A AUTHENTIC SEALED BRAND NEW BOTTLE!!</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I was super excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> I feel great after using it and my tan has advanced to a dark bronze.</li>
            <li> The smell is also great, absolutely no ATO.</li>
            <li> After my first use I notice a more golden tan.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was actually going to work as good as the bottle claimed</li>
            <li> Love that this is so much cheaper online than in salons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of trial size or single-use containers of tanning lotion and never wanted to buy the full product.  </li>
            <li> I pulled my full 20 minutes in the bed;</li>
            <li> then smell good after (you can always take a shower, but you can only tan at the salon once a day in Florida).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, even though I&#x27;m sensitive to scents, it just gets a body-odor smell afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Noticed a good lasting color difference when I started using this lotion.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft, nice smell.</li>
            <li> While I still love Obsidian, the after smell really started bothering me after a while.</li>
            <li> You will actually smell good after tanning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a full 7 days</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion and would recommend to a friend :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have tingle,but a more gentle warming sensation.  </li>
            <li> and I got kind of nervous because I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin (eczema)</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a good bronzing lotion.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much more reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> BUT I have used much lower priced lotions by Designer Skin that have had more bronzing power.</li>
            <li> It will have to be washed off with a cool shower since it&#x27;s heated.</li>
            <li> A lil tingle but not bad.</li>
            <li> The lotion does go on easily, and it does smell pretty good compared to other lotions, but I would rather take more time applying lotion and smell strange after than to smell good and see no results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it on here at such a reasonable price and through a seller that was very prompt and great person to work with.</li>
            <li> I either missed that in other reviews or no one else experienced it.  </li>
            <li> Designer skin does make great loions, so don&#x27;t get me wrong, Obsidian is a good lotion if you like lotions with a lot of bronzers, but the color just seemed to fade quickly.</li>
            <li> i was lucky and got it on sale.</li>
            <li> Came quick, undamaged, and unopened.</li>
            <li> I was trying to get back in the hang of using tingle lotions since those give you the best tan possible.  </li>
            <li> It helped me regain my color so quickly</li>
            <li> I like the scent, and the feel is super silky.</li>
            <li> arrived really quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, it has a mild tingle.</li>
            <li> It really helped take my color to the next level.it smells great even after u get out the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> have been tanning for years and have found that this lotion has given me very quick results deep dark smooth tan love it!!!  </li>
            <li> and I have a very pretty brown color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells WONDERFUL and gives a DARK all natural color!</li>
            <li> I was overall very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I used to use DS Luminary and Black, which both have great formulas, but I couldn&#x27;t take the scent of Luminary after awhile, and tried a sachet of this at my salon, and have since converted.  </li>
            <li> This lotion keeps your skin feeling amazing and gets you that dark tan you love.</li>
            <li> Has good bronzer, but not obvious after first use.</li>
            <li> Either way, I loved it enough to buy a whole bottle!</li>
            <li> (if you know MAC makeup coloring) --And I was just using Bombshell &amp; Back to Black&amp;lt;- which was pretty good.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, works very well, leaves skin soft &amp; clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> it made me way darker just on the first use!</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t you think that sampler extra in the box cost alot more for shipping cost then the seal on the bottle!</li>
            <li> I have let several tanning friends try it, and they all love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I got obsidian real obsidian tanning lotion for 36 bux!!</li>
            <li> This product REALLY WORKS!!</li>
            <li> Owner&#x27;s were QUICK to respond, which made for a nice experience, and, they offered my money back.  </li>
            <li> Very light soft smell too.</li>
            <li> The warming effect is subtle and very pleasant; not at all like a tingle lotion.</li>
            <li> Very high end silicone leaves your skin feeling incredibly smooth and hydrated and the smell?</li>
            <li> I got amazing results after just 1 use and that was in the high pressure which normally takes a couple days in a row to see some darkness.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and after just once, I could tell a big difference.  </li>
            <li> It really does leave you smelling fantastic.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this amazingly cheap product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how amazing this lotion is.</li>
            <li> It also smells amazing, no gross after-tan  smell at all.</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon and this lotion is defintely worth the money.</li>
            <li> but you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s worth buying for that fact in itself.</li>
            <li> Make sure to drink plenty of water before going to tan with this one, and of course, don&#x27;t spray any perfume or cologne directly on your skin before tanning or while letting the bronzers work for 2-3 hours after tanning.  </li>
            <li> Favorite lotion so far.</li>
            <li> This item is ok, but I would not reccomend it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Oh well, I can&#x27;t complain considering the nice deep brown color I get from it.</li>
            <li> and I love that my skin feels soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li> So nothing exciting.</li>
            <li> but it only got slightly warm for me</li>
            <li> when I got out of the tanning bed, I went to wipe the excess sweat off and started feeling warm in the places where I had wiped (like my back).</li>
            <li> It is the the best cream I have ever used to get a really good base tan before summer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the sensation of my skin being melted by lava is worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny...</li>
            <li> but this was so worth it</li>
            <li> Gives me a nice deep bronze color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard Luminary was nice, must try that next.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definately worth trying, just never buy from the salon.</li>
            <li> Golden brown.</li>
            <li> So far as the bronzing goes, you really can&#x27;t beat it (my tan got noticeably darker from using it, darker than I thought it could be), and it has a nice apricot-y smell</li>
            <li> Liked it just not enough to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I like obsidian and luminary the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few lotions over the years and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li> I also want to mention that after I had already purchased it, I went back and noticed the \\&quot;warm volcanic minerals\\&quot; on the bottle</li>
            <li> My favorite thus far.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It smells great and really gets you darker than other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I do tan pretty quickly as it is, but this boosts it up like craaazzzyyy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see immediate results as some users claim, however my body got super hot and tingly.</li>
            <li> This item shipped quickly and was exactly what i thought it was going to be.  </li>
            <li> It gets me super tan super fast.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and is EXTREMELY moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It does not give you color right after you get out of the bed</li>
            <li> After opening the package I had to check the scent, consistancy of the lotion, color (Almost every lotion will bronzers will be brown), everything was right on.</li>
            <li> Soaks right in.</li>
            <li> I used this one time and saw a difference in color right out of the bed.  </li>
            <li> Its a great lotion and does get you dark fast.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and is exactly the same product as in the salon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I first bought this lotion last year and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Even though the silicon peels off, it leaves my skin feeling super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin was super soft after using it anf the smell,before and after, was light and citrus.</li>
            <li> I think im just gonna go with a full on tingle like modern bombshell.</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave streaks, gets you dark.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re a morning tanner, or run errands, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, but if you don&#x27;t have time or ability to tan much and want to get dark, this is amazing!</li>
            <li> This is just a standard silicone bronzer like Luminary by Designer skin, but a step more powerful.  </li>
            <li> Glad i kept this lotion n gave it  a second chance, it takes a lil time but is worth it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> It really helps achieving a great tan in just a few visits to the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> There is a slight tingle feels good though.</li>
            <li> I used it later that day in a regular bed and still noticed GREAT COLOR</li>
            <li> It has a ridiculously strong peach smell that is nowhere near the smell of the sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , so there&#x27;s no excuse NOT to buy this lotion! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt that kind of warmth from a regular bronzing lotion, and in certain (private) areas this was more than just a warmth...</li>
            <li> The main area that it makes feel kind of hot is my back side.</li>
            <li> then you know this is an amazing lotion, but what I received was not real.  </li>
            <li> and they said it was real!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of the next day color</li>
            <li> Always put on moisturizing lotion within the first 3 minutes after showering.</li>
            <li> Thanks Designer Skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend you try Liberate first.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on</li>
            <li> So for my wedding next month I decided to give it one more shot.  </li>
            <li> Then I switched to Obsidian my first bronzing lotion in 8 years.  </li>
            <li> Exact match</li>
            <li> so let me first say THANK YOU for the extremely fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> I used Obsidian for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> If you are just beginning to tan, this will probably burn you like your first day on vacation in Florida without any sunscreen and you are from a northern state and never get out there as it is.  </li>
            <li> definitely gave me much more color.  </li>
            <li> It was not completely horrible but it was still a feeling a have never felt without being next to fire!</li>
            <li> I did not get any darker from the first use.  </li>
            <li> I looked exactly like I did before I stepped into the stand up with this obsidian.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion, especially for the price !!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more lotion from him.</li>
            <li> big plus :-)</li>
            <li> I used it twice  and just to make sure I felt, what I thought, I  felt what was the over heating of the skin which by the way ,  felt way  to hot for me to try it the third time,and then I  realized ,  </li>
            <li> I did not feel any tingling or overwhelmingly hot sensations when using this product either.</li>
            <li> I am going back for more...</li>
            <li> There is no weird smell like some of these lotions have</li>
            <li> I first thought \\&quot;30 bronzers?</li>
            <li> Just be aware of that.</li>
            <li> I had been tanning with another designer skin lotion that was just a quad bronzer and this definitely gave me much more color.</li>
            <li> Works fast!  </li>
            <li> That Would Make My Tanning so much more addictive!!</li>
            <li> Finally decided to buy it off of my favorite place Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time on Friday</li>
            <li> Gets you tan fast!</li>
            <li> However remember no two peoples skin are exactly alike.  </li>
            <li> Coming from someone that has freckles and doesn&#x27;t tan the easiest at first, that is saying a lot.</li>
            <li> Burned on my first try with this product</li>
            <li> When i first started to use it</li>
            <li> It is worth the money and it is so much cheaper here on amazon.</li>
            <li> I first saw this in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Gave me color first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only able to tan about 3 times a week</li>
            <li> and IT REALLY WORKS!  </li>
            <li> even the first time) I went.</li>
            <li> I will use it only if I don&#x27;t have anything better at hand.</li>
            <li> Had my skin very bronze and everyone noticed!</li>
            <li> But it most definitely will after 2 or 3 sessions.</li>
            <li> i put it on for the first time, and i must say it DEFINETLY IS A TINGLER LOTION.  </li>
            <li> after about 5 minutes of me putting on  the lotion, i could feel how HOT i was getting.  </li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion and would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> If I am feeling ambitious, I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I figured it was time to get out of the rut and try a different Designer Skin lotion</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t already know it is hot and if you are a guy learn from my mistake and DO NOT rub this stuff on your um, ball and chain.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m allergic to many different chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I was nervous the first time I used this lotion.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
            <li> They say to be aware that there are generics on the internet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for years, most recently at ZoomTan here in Florida.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal though!</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of taking a hot shower with this lotion on and it BURNS.</li>
            <li> its exactly what I needed...will be ordering two bottles this time instead of one.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a avid tanner....</li>
            <li> or it was hot, but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, it goes on smooth and leaves your skin feeling soft and silky, not oily.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Its the first warming lotion I&#x27;ve ever used not a tingle</li>
            <li> However, when I received the lotion the bottle was nearly open and it appeared as though it had been used with lotion smeared all over the top of the bottle.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m aware of what the manufactures packaging should look like for this lotion.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m overall pleased.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and do not tan all year round, so when I heard of this lotion and read the reviews, I thought I would try it.  </li>
            <li> :  Don&#x27;t know why I went off to a few others in between this review, they were not as good as this product.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to other buyers looking for a good tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> You would think that this lotion is amazing and makes your tanning experience a euphoric experience from other listed reviews and the cost in salons.  </li>
            <li> My body got soooooooo dark and sexy using this lotion!</li>
            <li> and I always walk out with a nice smell not the burnt smell you get with other products.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell amazing, but my skin feels soft and I already look darker.</li>
            <li> At my salon, I was warned that Pink Diamonds was more powerful than Bombshell, but I disagreed.  </li>
            <li> Besides the fact that it gets you super dark, it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this lotion with very high hopes, I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> Really on fire like someone is holding a lighter to your whole body !</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my tan pretty much every day.  </li>
            <li> If you plan on tanning during lunch get ready to stay hot.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time and I still haven&#x27;t found anything better.  </li>
            <li> I tan pretty much every day</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion because I am getting married very soon</li>
            <li> Nice dark tanning with longevity.</li>
            <li> My favorite bronzing lotion WAS Australian Gold Almost Famous, and my favorite accelerator was Designer Skin Secret Rapture.</li>
            <li> Since I tan all the time I had pretty much hit my plateau and really wanted something to push me over the &#x60;tan limit.&#x27;</li>
            <li> It does make you slightly redder after tanning, but by morning it is a nice bronze color.</li>
            <li> and I am very particular about my tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I liked the product very much so when 2nd bottle was getting low</li>
            <li> It does have a \\&quot;warming\\&quot; sensation if you haven&#x27;t used it in a while on certain parts of your body ( like for me when I used it</li>
            <li> I do not usually care for warming lotions, but the results are well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Have tried many different tanning lotions, this by far exceeds all of them!</li>
            <li> I am darker than my fiance who is of Hispanic decent!</li>
            <li> - it has &#x27;warming sensations&#x27; that feel a little too warm on my face for my taste.</li>
            <li> It did make me a little warm, but nothing to the extent where I had to jump out of the bed.</li>
            <li> As stated on the bottle, you will feel a warm sensation while tanning and for a little while</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s worth spending a little more.</li>
            <li> The best part about this lotion, is that even though it gets you super dark, it does not turn your hands the least bit orange!  </li>
            <li> THANKS AMAZON FOR SELLING IT AT THIS PRICE.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really feel the warming until about 7 minutes into tanning, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> It ships really fast</li>
            <li> I can not believe how much the salons take you for.</li>
            <li> and I thank you so much Amazon.</li>
            <li> - my color is a deeper brown and my skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li> and this is after a whole year of tanning, so</li>
            <li> Would much rather have the Illuminary.</li>
            <li> One last warning for those who didn&#x27;t notice the earlier warning lol; keep away from private areas...</li>
            <li> Not so much a fan of after tan smell.  </li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Also it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have been using a lotion that cost twice as much as this stuff</li>
            <li> The volcanic minerals in this lotion provide much needed nourishment that your skin needs.</li>
            <li> Even got free samples which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Obsidian for about two weeks now and found that I was getting much darker than with the Paradisio.</li>
            <li> Very pleasing,Before and after tanning.</li>
            <li> Also has a very yummy scent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the real stuff.</li>
            <li> got to me fast and sealed.</li>
            <li> This lotion is such great value, especially given the fact that tanning salons charge around double the price!</li>
            <li> It works way better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> I appreciated their customer service and they were very polite.</li>
            <li> I got this in record time and saved so much money, I am the envy of all my fellow tanners.  </li>
            <li> A-Z gets it to you fast</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Lotion performed very well before I sarted to plateau.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t handle tingler lotions, its too much.</li>
            <li> Waaaaay too much fragrance.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very tanned.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for 3 years straight.</li>
            <li> As I said I&#x27;ve purchased the real Obsidian before</li>
            <li> but I dont feel like it gave me too much color, but</li>
            <li> i got much much darker after just two sessions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a change in my tan.</li>
            <li> I really like this, and the scent.  </li>
            <li> It is a high-end product and you really get what you pay for with this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this</li>
            <li> so you know that it&#x27;s the real stuff.</li>
            <li> However,I dont really feel the warming.</li>
            <li> but it lets me know that it really does have the bronzing power</li>
            <li> Delivery time fast.</li>
            <li> but I just really don&#x27;t like fruity scents</li>
            <li> I bought this after I spent two months in bootcamp without being able to tan.</li>
            <li> Of course, if you buy it at the tanning salon it will cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> Although \\&quot;Sealed\\&quot; Is Not The Real Thing.</li>
            <li> Very Unsatisfied With What I Recieved.</li>
            <li> I am VERY fair-skinned (with freckles)</li>
            <li> I basically bought it on a whim after that, because I wanted to get it really fast</li>
            <li> I have been dying to try obsidian but couldn&#x27;t justify spending that much at the salon.</li>
            <li> Its very creamy and goes in to the skin.</li>
            <li> otherwise you feel an intense warming sensation.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Factory sealed and the real deal.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my tan...</li>
            <li> My boyfriend didn&#x27;t even know I&#x27;d been tanning (he really hates the way my skin smells after I tan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With all of the rave reviews I expected it to be better than my $15 (price on Amazon) bottle of lotion.</li>
            <li> Thank You SOOOOO Much</li>
            <li> he doesn&#x27;t really like it either...</li>
            <li> Even many hours later my skin felt soft and moisterized.</li>
            <li> is a nice brown shade, not too yellow not too red.</li>
            <li> but Amazon ! Was not tampered with at all , brand new , legitimate, real product ,not an impression, this is a real deal on Designer Skin tanning lotion !</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m a new mom who also works</li>
            <li> I am not dumb if the bottle is not sealed it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used my Luminary about once every 2 weeks due to the strength, and more as a touch-up than anything else.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that every other lotion I have tried is better than this one.</li>
            <li> Also because of the volcanic minerals in the lotion,I found it to be a more thicker lotion,and found it to be used up quicker than other lotions.</li>
            <li> I heard so many great things about this lotion, but I was disappointed in it&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li> I will not use it again, but what is not right for me may be ok for  someone else.</li>
            <li> After tanning, your body will feel a little more hot than normal.     </li>
            <li> The bronzers really do work and they are a great color - not the typical orangy tone you get from other bronzers or the streaky look.  </li>
            <li> It went on so smooth and you can see minor results after one use.</li>
            <li> I will be sticking with this one for as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see how dark I get after a couple more sessions.</li>
            <li> Im definitely VERY tan after the 2nd or 3rd time in the stand up bed, since then i&#x27;ve gone probably 5 more times.</li>
            <li> i go to kept telling me that Obsidian was better and said it got them so dark and all that.</li>
            <li> Oh and your skin will feel like absolute silk with no icky residue.</li>
            <li> The product itself is ok, but definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;ve kept it pretty well.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion has a nice smell but does not have near the bronzing action that I expected.</li>
            <li> A beautiful dark tan that least for long time when use in high pressure bed :)</li>
            <li> Much better than the Black 20x</li>
            <li> Better than black.</li>
            <li> so you come out smelling less like burnt flesh and hair and more like a tropical garden.</li>
            <li> Half-price sounds much better, and it is definitely the same formula.</li>
            <li> and I am blown away by how much better Obsidian is than the more expensive lotion.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am willing to try another packet in a higher power bed for a longer time to see if it makes a difference, I wouldn&#x27;t buy a bottle though.</li>
            <li> It bronzed ok and warmed occasionally, and by occasionally</li>
            <li> I researched several different \\&quot;top rated\\&quot; lotions and decided on this one.  </li>
            <li> (And I have tried many different kinds at all different price points).  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have struggled with eczema my whole life, and this product did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough to leave my skin burning hours after tanning, but just strong enough so that I am warm when I&#x27;m in the bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me this is a good Con to take your mind off that the bottle isn&#x27;t sealed and that your getting the real stuff which might only be the small sampler inside.     </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> And Ive always known about \\&quot;Designer Skin\\&quot;, from when I went tanning once a month in high school.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that one.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this lotion for someone who has an established tan.</li>
            <li> I have been going to the tanning bed on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday each week and tanning in a high pressure bed, a 10 minute bed, and a 12 minute bed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to any fellow tanatics/tanaholics who feel they have reached their peak and feel they are not getting any tanner.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and was the lotion is says on the bottle</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> (with the exception of jwoww and even that worked a little better than this)</li>
            <li> It doesnt smell bad after tanning and it has a wonderful warmth when its on your skin.</li>
            <li> Smelled great, but I&#x27;m wondering if I got fake?</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed while applying this lotion was a general warmth.  </li>
            <li> After two uses I was getting comments on how dark I was becoming.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is a GREAT bronzer but fails to provide the \\&quot;warming\\&quot; sensation they mention.</li>
            <li> On a last note, this lotion is amazingly (surprisingly) powerful, and should be used in moderation.  </li>
            <li> Finally, this lotion is the first I have used out of all Designer Skins lotions that really leaves you smelling like a fresh peach with no after tan odor present.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of this lotion but the smell is not nice at all.</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s a mix between a tingler and a normal lotion.</li>
            <li> Barely noticed any color after the first application.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worse when someone gives you good reason to not trust the product.    </li>
            <li> Same exact product, authentic as can be, for less.</li>
            <li> I would rather pay s&amp;h and KNOW that the product is safe and original, as the seal is broken where the top screws on (not sure if they are all like that or not)</li>
            <li> and I had a super dark color with the first use.</li>
            <li> I felt a slight warming sensation ONLY the first time I used it, and even then, it&#x27;s barely worth mentioning because it was so mild.  </li>
            <li> Depending on time of year (I live in Indiana,)</li>
            <li> As a thank you for the tip they offered to order my bottles whenever I need a new tanning lotion</li>
            <li> I orginally found out about this lotion through the tanning place where I live.</li>
            <li> Even though the store/owner called me,I am still concerned that the product was not in the \\&quot;complete\\&quot; new package/box.  </li>
            <li> The addition of the tingle additive will save you from having to buy a new bottle of lotion just for the tingle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a gamble for me when buying new skin &amp; beauty products.  </li>
            <li> Came sealed and brand new..</li>
            <li> This is definitely for advanced indoor tanners who want to take their tan to the next level.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true Designer Skin, it creates immediate color, and the warming effect feels great in a cold bed in the morning!  </li>
            <li> I went back today to a different bed that a lady recommended and OH MY LORD I got soooooooo hot in that bed!!</li>
            <li> This lotion also makes your skin feel very soft.    </li>
            <li> The lotion works well outside of the tanning bed as well which I like very much,</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I tried Obsidian</li>
            <li> Not harsh on the skin !</li>
            <li> Got it 5 days early!</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t get it near your eyes!</li>
            <li> and I think you would see great results if you can get over the smell!! :(</li>
            <li> Not only are you hot from well laying in a tanning bed but from the minerals in the lotion.</li>
            <li> And it makes your skin so soft!  </li>
            <li> First time to buy from an individual.</li>
            <li> PROMPT SELLER, RECEIVED PRODUCT EARLY - PLEANSANT SURPRISE - THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Not good for tanning in the summer in Arizona...gets too warm.</li>
            <li> Sadly, Not The Same Product!!!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried so many tanning products...but no more.</li>
            <li> At the tanning salon I go to they charge over $100 for the same exact bottle...</li>
            <li> Ive only used it one time with a level 4 bed and it worked the first time.</li>
            <li> Its the exact same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used numerous high priced lotions, and this just didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> Slight tingle, but nothing you cant handle!! :)</li>
            <li> I am so pale and can never get a tan but after only a few times using this stuff I got such great color!</li>
            <li> The bottle is HUGE and since it&#x27;s silicone based, it spreads and will last a long time..</li>
            <li> Like Luminary and Black, Obsidian contains a Silicone Emulsion that leaves your skin velvety smooth.</li>
            <li> After using Obsidian, i decided to purchase Liberate by Designer Skin instead, and let me tell you, that lotion is way better at delivering that dark brown, lasting tan that we all desire.</li>
            <li> First of all can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price, and received the product in 4 days, much sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> Overall, it does what most other Designer Skin lotions do for me, so I don&#x27;t really see the point of paying extra.</li>
            <li> and it gives you a rich dark color and leaves your skin feeling hydrated after tanning.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time a few months ago, and didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with the results but was surprised when my skin began to tingle and slightly burn within a minute of putting it on.  </li>
            <li> Oh but thank you for the free little sampler lotion inside the order,</li>
            <li> AT FIRST MAY BE A LITTLE TO HOT</li>
            <li> More than 20x bronzing is hard to find and this has 30x.</li>
            <li> This is my oldest daughter&#x27;s favorite lotion, &amp; she gets DARK!!!</li>
            <li> I am fair skin, Irish and German decent and usually just burn and peel and remain the white paste no matter what I do.  </li>
            <li> This product worked well &amp; made my skin feel really soft &amp; no streaking with the bronzer.</li>
            <li> and wow what a savings to buying it at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> After you shower you still feel as if your skin is moisterized and soft.</li>
            <li> I really am questioning this seller and want my money back, bc this is not what I was buying.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be the strongest bronzing lotion that Designer Skin makes as far as I know, and after trying it I wouldn&#x27;t doubt it.  </li>
            <li> I did SO MUCH research on which tanning lotion to get, Ive never been this into tanning (I purchased a month unlimited at my local tanning salon)</li>
            <li> I have used it twice so far.  </li>
            <li> Both times I noticed a considerable color change.  </li>
            <li> maybe I got stuck with a old one??</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this lotion 5 stars is because it is very greasy.</li>
            <li> So far-</li>
            <li> arrived early</li>
            <li> I do not look like leather, I have a natural glow.</li>
            <li> I ordered it on Friday and received it on Tuesday 5 days early.</li>
            <li> I noticed a considerable color change.</li>
            <li> and makes my skin soooo soft.</li>
            <li> With designer skin it&#x27;s obvious that you are paying sooo damn much just for the packaging.</li>
            <li> Overall I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> as it is so there might be only so much bronzers can do for you.</li>
            <li> and I have developed noticable color in a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to think this boosted my natural tan.</li>
            <li> It may be an old bottle or something.</li>
            <li> Definitely the real thing too</li>
            <li> Also arrived early.  </li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling much like a baby&#x27;s behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loaded with silicone so not my &amp;#34;ideal natural product&amp;#34; but it does what it is intended</li>
            <li> and it makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I love to tan, I have been tanning on and off throughout the last few years of my life.</li>
            <li> Smells good before and doesn&#x27;t acquire weird after tanning smell.</li>
            <li> It is a little warm but doesn&#x27;t have the extreme tingle and plus its made by designer skin</li>
            <li> Even though I work at the salon I still spend $$$ for it, which I won&#x27;t be doing anymore; next time I need lotion, I&#x27;m coming right back here!</li>
            <li> Beware it does have a slight tinge too it and it really made my face hot with a burning feeling.</li>
            <li> It smells a little yucky but worth the results!</li>
            <li> I have to be extremely careful to shower right after bc</li>
            <li> It smells amazing to me and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the feeling of fire or heat as other reviews state.</li>
            <li> This got me super dark in just one tan.   </li>
            <li> I barely noticed, and when I do, its only in certain places.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell good, but after a few tans it leaves your skin moisturized and gives it a dark tan.</li>
            <li> But, be advised, if you&#x27;re not generally a fan of the Designer Skin scents, you probably *really* won&#x27;t like this one.</li>
            <li> Although there is a slight tingle and redness on the skin for the first visits the enriched formula left my dry itchy skin so smooth, so rich, so DARK!</li>
            <li> I go to tries to charge $130 for the same bottle, so you&#x27;re in the right place!</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t too fond of the volcanic action, but she got dark real fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be getting comments about how you look Mexican in no time; I&#x27;m always getting comments like that as it is, but my ancestry is half European Jew</li>
            <li> That was a little sketchy to me, but the lotion smells and feels like the true lotion</li>
            <li> So from my experience with these lotions, sometimes the more expensive a product is doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never developed color this fast from tanning in a salon.  </li>
            <li> I would say it is probably worth the $40 I paid but definitely not worth the $133</li>
            <li> My body went back to normal.</li>
            <li> Immediately I noticed extra heat in the tanning bed, (which is normal.  </li>
            <li> Did exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> but you get super dark!</li>
            <li> Gets you super Dark!  </li>
            <li> and definitely didn&#x27;t live up to it for me.</li>
            <li> i definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new lotion.</li>
            <li> Would DEFINITELY recommend this lotion to anyone looking to try something new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different lotions; including some fairly powerful tingle lotions like Bombshell and Pink Diamonds.  </li>
            <li> It only smells coming out of the bottle, I really don&#x27;t notice it once I put it on and rub it in, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other peoples say this lotion gets really hot</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter worked for a tan company in St. Louis that tried to tell her this wasn&#x27;t the same as the OVER PRICED EXACT SAME bottle they were selling!</li>
            <li> Super dark tan after only one use.  </li>
            <li> Because of its warming actions i definitely only would recommend this to people who have been tanning for quite some time and have already hit a plateau in their color, and have already started using high pressure beds so they can gauge if the warming sensation is their skin burning or simply the lotion.</li>
            <li> this product has crushed gem stones in it, that is why it is marked up so high at the tanning salon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Does have a little heat to it, but i barely noticed, except on my face, since i am used to hot action lotions.</li>
            <li> It does not have a great smell, but too bad either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion only twice so far</li>
            <li> My old standby was Australian Gold Bronzing Fire Glaze.  </li>
            <li> actually just keep it away from any sensitive areas of the body and all mucus membranes.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have only used this tanning lotion once.</li>
            <li> Obsidian has a warming to the skin when applied,But goes away in about 30 minutes.(Keep away from your sensitive areas including your eyes).Once applied,it has a velvety feel on your skin and would desribe the smell as cross between a mango and grapfruit.</li>
            <li> I ordered this yesterday early enough in the day to have it delivered by tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice so far</li>
            <li> Be careful around your face, especially near or under your eyes.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel extra soft and never plugged my pores.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about the lotion, everyone told me how DARK it got them</li>
            <li> Simply squeeze your regular tanning lotion in your hand, add the lava drops, mix it between your hands, and apply to your skin like normal.</li>
            <li> It arrived quicker than the expected due date and was in its original packaging.</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy and has light warming affect, not tingling and burning.</li>
            <li> My skin has a hard time tanning, I got this lotion because I thought it was strong enough to help me tan.</li>
            <li> I usually tan in the open sun high pressure bed, which is already a very hot bed by itself, so i can definitely feel the warming or &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34; sensation in this product.</li>
            <li> and I just placed an order today for a new JWoww Private Reserve so that I can try to get the tan I use to have back</li>
            <li> so I thought this would maybe start me out small before I went to a sizzle in the future, but this didn&#x27;t seem to warm my skin any different than any other lotion.  </li>
            <li> I went back to using my John Abate Titanium lotion (mild tingle with no bronzers to come off in the shower or on my razor), and saw dramatic results with a dark tan that looked more human.</li>
            <li> I have been slacking on tanning over the last year which means I was super pale,</li>
            <li> Also, maybe the first couple times using this lotion, go a little less on your usual time in the bed to see how you&#x27;ll react (AGAIN THIS STUFF IS REALLY STRONG!)  </li>
            <li> have ordered several tanning lotions from Amazon and this is the first one that has been a let down.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t that a little much?!</li>
            <li> it may be a little hot.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere and foud the same exact lotion on here for much much less.</li>
            <li> so I have the olive complexion that gets dark fast already.  </li>
            <li> I really want to be DARK this summer --</li>
            <li> Not worth that much.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent tanner and had already built my base tan before using it so the warm volcanic minerals didnt really bother me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always rotated my lotions daily, and I have 6 different bottles of lotion right now (5 Designer Skin and 1 bottle of Australian Gold&#x27;s Sinfully Black.)  </li>
            <li> but obsidian,,  is not anything special... does not feel as good on your skin as any of the others.. and has a horrible after smell..</li>
            <li> It has a slight silicone feel to it which felt very moisturizing, not at all like, say, a silicone face primer.</li>
            <li> It eliminated the number of times I needed to go tanning to about half of what I used to do because I would get so much color each time (</li>
            <li> within the first week, I could definitely see that I went a few shades darker.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight warming feeling but its never all over just in certain spot.will definitely use again.</li>
            <li> But again, if your focus is on purely getting dark, THIS IS THE STUFF TO BUY!</li>
            <li> As for bronzers, I dont really see it doing anything different than my Black</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned with freckles but have tanned well before with less expensive lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used luminous, black, believe, paint it black, and a bunch of other tanning lotions and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> I will not be using the Obsidian in anything other than a regular bed (which at my salon consists of regular bulbs and 2 high pressure facial bronzers.)  </li>
            <li> I am complimented SO much on how dark I am after weeks of use of this product!</li>
            <li> Now I won&#x27;t be fooled by the new hype on other lotions.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion if you&#x27;re looking for dark color and no tingle factor.</li>
            <li> I NEVER EVER get this dark in natural sunlight, let alone a tanning bed!!</li>
            <li> and i know the difference between a good lotion and a bad one.</li>
            <li> Deep dark tan let my skin feeling soft and not dry</li>
            <li> I was wanting to get dark relatively quickly (over a few months) for graduation/photos and</li>
            <li> I would personally highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be warned, while it is not a full tingle lotion</li>
            <li> If I begin to feel warm or sweat, I&#x27;ll turn the fan on before hopping in (which is sometimes odd in late December, but this has been an odd year with days that the temp was in the 60&#x27;s.)  </li>
            <li> I have never tanned very well in the past, but now, everyone thinks I just got back from the beach!</li>
            <li> Perfume and cologne absorbed through open pores can intensify heat sickness, so just use common sense and be careful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied tingle lotions below the belt, and generally I&#x27;ve never had a problem, but</li>
            <li> recently tried Obsidian at the recommendation of my tanning salon, and mentally rolled my eyes as I heard the same selling pitch from the salon.  </li>
            <li> It makes me tan faster in less amount of times than any other tanning lotion I have used, and for my very pale and freckly skin type : less times in the bed the better.</li>
            <li> The warm feeling isnt bad at all,I cant handle tingles AT ALL.</li>
            <li> and to top it off it caused a rash all over my body &amp; made me ich like crazy.</li>
            <li> Everyone keeps asking how I have gotten so dark in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> But over all it does get me dark if i use it back to back in a week.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice deep dark tan instantly.</li>
            <li> but I take a LONG time to tan</li>
            <li> i wasnt going tanning a lot because i went at night and skipped a lot because i wouldnt feel like it after a long day</li>
            <li> My military paycheck definitely cannot afford that!</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to wait long to receive it.</li>
            <li> Never burns in the sun angel bed as long as he uses this.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t go out of my way to write reviews (sorry sellers), but I honestly couldn&#x27;t wait to write a review for this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for 2 weeks and already have a really good base tan.  </li>
            <li> I did a lay down and under my chest where I havent tanned that well since i normally do stand up, that warmed up ALOT about a half hour AFTER I tanned)</li>
            <li> I switched back to my other lotion.</li>
            <li> I still was also considering other brands, but obviously attracted to DS.</li>
            <li> This is the second high-end Designer Skin product I have used, the other one being Luminary.</li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference with just one use, and I had already been tanning with other lotions for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> but I got bored of the same old thing and tried something new</li>
            <li> although after using this my skin became extremely dry (even flaking) and i have never had this problem.  </li>
            <li> The last round left me with orange after glows.  </li>
            <li> I will say that after I shower a few hours later or the next day I can see a hint of the color on my towel - it doesn&#x27;t stain or anything</li>
            <li> I sent her a message with a few questions and she wrote back later that day.</li>
            <li> Im not near as dark as I was last year using my Luminous product.</li>
            <li> Has a slight tingle that lasts just long enough for you to get your tan on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Luminary that I&#x27;ve ordered through Amazon before also, and that has a SIMILAR effect to the Obsidian...but not nearly as powerful.  </li>
            <li> did I get dark on the second</li>
            <li> Not painful or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the smell that much, but I have been tanning 5-6 yrs and really have gotten sick to the same smells being put into tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> which is the maximum amount of time allowed per day in the type of bed I was in; (on a side note I had decided not to use the regular bed at my salon, but what they call a Sunstorm which has burning bulbs above you and bronzing bulbs below, so you do 10 minutes on each side for an even, BUT STRONGER THAN USUAL tan.  </li>
            <li> what do you know...found it for less than a third of the cost of the salon.</li>
            <li> IT HAS A SLIGHT WARMING SENSATION BUT DOESN&#x27;T BURN YOU AND MAKE YOU RED</li>
            <li> Once I finish this bottle I&#x27;ll switch back to Black 20x or a Jwoww.</li>
            <li> I just finished up the last of the bottle, &amp; throughout my use, I just saw a slight color from time to time.  </li>
            <li> I actually thought that I was less tan than before going into the salon.</li>
            <li> I have very pale and sensitive skin, nor do I get a tan at all and from using Obsidian</li>
            <li> It took a bit long than my other lotions, to reach me...</li>
            <li> anyone have any other suggestions for a dark tanning lotion, possibly that is not Designer Skin?</li>
            <li> but finally I got a little color.  </li>
            <li> Obsidian is the only lotion that has ever gotten me dark!</li>
            <li> but I get better results with the least expensive lotion my tanning salon sells.  </li>
            <li> so the smell does not really matter to me.     </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t about to waste an entire application of the strongest Designer Skin bronzer on the market.  </li>
            <li> However; until you are used to this lotion...PLEASE BE CAREFUL.  </li>
            <li> I have only tanned a few times and am already getting a tan</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually relaxing with the tanning bed heat, with a few fans going, and then the volcanic minerals working on you, too.</li>
            <li> I did not really feel the heat of the \\&quot;volcanic</li>
            <li> Was everything I expected it to be and shipped</li>
            <li> I have heard that fake lotions are sometimes sold on the internet, so maybe this isn&#x27;t much good because it was a fake?</li>
            <li> -- I am at a really nice base color -- from nw 15 - to nw30 difference</li>
            <li> (I HATE THAT KIND).</li>
            <li> Not worth the bigger expense in comparison to less inexpensive products.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of these accusations, but they are true!</li>
            <li> Plain and simple...</li>
            <li> The other great thing about this is that is doesn&#x27;t have the nasty smell after you tan.  </li>
            <li> I waited and it never really came for me as other people have described.</li>
            <li> also did not notice any serious benefits as far as my tan goes.</li>
            <li> but it does create a slight warming effect, though it is comfortable for me if you do not have a base tan or have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very scary, fine but scary.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed after the first time I used it, as I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my tan, but I&#x27;ve used it for 3 sessions now</li>
            <li> I picked this lotion up to tide me over until my other one came it.</li>
            <li> I never experimentationd this before w any other lotion.</li>
            <li> i would not recommend any other lotion.</li>
            <li> I would of with 3 uses of other lotions.</li>
            <li> I read in other reviews that people did notice the warming sensation so</li>
            <li> The first time I used a packet at the salon, this happened to me and it felt weird.</li>
            <li> I tan every other day and have for months</li>
            <li> I am amazed, I&#x27;ve used other products that feel like your tan washes away</li>
            <li> other than you just feel sweaty &amp;</li>
            <li> This is not a hot cream, so there is no tingling sensation or burning in the sunbed.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have a lot of time to research and compare other lotions.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t wear away in a couple of days like some other bronzers.</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews about how it burns when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I wanted a good lotion but could not afford to get one, at least for what the stupid salon charges anyway.</li>
            <li> somehow it completely eliminates that disgusting after tan odor of burnt skin which i love, no lotion has ever done that for me before.</li>
            <li> I usually take a long time to tan even with other lotions.</li>
            <li> Nothing negative other than it does not actually do ALL it says it can do.  </li>
            <li> I had seen other reviews that stated that after two times in the tanning bed they received a slight tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve undergone chemo, can&#x27;t make it to the tanning bed hardly at all, am short of money, and my skin stopped tanning when the chemo started.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is the shape of the bottom makes it hard to get every last drop out of the container!</li>
            <li> &amp; I haven&#x27;t gotten as dark as all the reviews claimed.</li>
            <li> He is jealous of how dark I am now.  </li>
            <li> It did get me dark though.</li>
            <li> I barely noticed the warming effect, it was just enough to make me sweat without making me uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> im relatively dark</li>
            <li> so i thought it was just the lotion that wasnt getting me dark like the girls at the tanning salon</li>
            <li> so i dont get too dark.</li>
            <li> With ordering lotion online, I know there is always that worry that its fake, but this is 100% the real deal.</li>
            <li> Will this give you an *immediate* dark color boost?</li>
            <li> After giving this about two weeks I was dark.</li>
            <li> and I am hoping for a dark brown like that again.</li>
            <li> After a summer I am DARK, DARK, DARK...</li>
            <li> Totally not worth the money I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> I had just spent a few weeks in the tropics.</li>
            <li> FOR YOU OR TURN FACE TANNER DOWN.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be let down.</li>
            <li> I swear by designer skin and once again this product didn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> There is nothing negative about this product in my opinion, but there is no WOW factor about it compared to the other two products.</li>
            <li> Its not worth half the money even here on amazon.</li>
            <li> No joke this stuff made my skin super hott and was very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I will stick to Luminary or Black from now on.</li>
            <li> I have used black 20x and luminary tanning lotion by designer skin</li>
            <li> I like black 20x</li>
            <li> I have already used Black 20x and Luminary samples(both by Designer Skin).  </li>
            <li> So now its between Obsidian and Black Noir (2012)</li>
            <li> Ive used black Noir once</li>
            <li> It does have a slight tingle feeling, so don&#x27;t use on your face.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion in half the time I was supposed to.</li>
            <li> The smell is slightly fruity, but not at all overbearing.</li>
            <li> If you can get some tan extenders like, Desighner Skin&#x27;s Black.</li>
            <li> If you can maybe do a package deal with Desighner Skin&#x27;s Obsidian with the Desighner Skin&#x27;s tan extending Black.....</li>
            <li> Not super greasy like some lotions I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve gone through half the bottle and haven&#x27;t had any streaking or unsightly splotches on my hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> Half the price</li>
            <li> With my past experience of tanning in salons, it usually takes about 2 weeks of tanning 5-6 times a week to develop a deep color.  </li>
            <li> This works just like it is advertised and $100.00 less than the tanning salon.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the JWoww Private Reserve (gold bottle) from the salon and paid the ridiculous retail price for it.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical at such a low price.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight tingle to it so if you would not like this go with Designer skin&#x27;s Black instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already purchased a bottle of what I was using previously</li>
            <li> Has a slight warming feeling but that goes away after about 2 uses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not have a bad after-tan smell, and my skin feels super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> just one of the MANY ways they do BAD BUSINESS!</li>
            <li> I have never been this dark in my life!</li>
            <li> I have fair/normal skin that requires a little work to get a tan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion 3 times already and I am DARK!</li>
            <li> I have used Black the most,this one blows Black out the water!</li>
            <li> This product made me sooooo dark!  </li>
            <li> Always gives me a dark tan that lasts!</li>
            <li> so I have little to no time to do things for myself.  </li>
            <li> and im already a little darker after just two uses.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this lotion, I&#x27;ve never bought lotion online before</li>
            <li> Ive noticed too that it does flake a little, just a little.</li>
            <li> It usually takes me at LEAST 10-15 tanning sessions to build up any kind of base color.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is,is you have hard water it will be extremely hard to get soap to lather on your body with this.</li>
            <li> Gets me very dark....</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a lotion you should try if you plan on doing other things after you tan!!</li>
            <li> I tried Obsidian today, and let me tell you it went beyond what I expected!!!</li>
            <li> I have been doing indoor tanning on and off for a few years now and cannot get any darker</li>
            <li> YOU WILL SEE THE DIFFRENCE IN A FEW DAYS OF TANNING.</li>
            <li> I feel 5x darker than I did a few days ago.</li>
            <li> First I find it very difficult to tan.  </li>
            <li> When I bought from a local salon, I don&#x27;t remember if it was broken or not...</li>
            <li> You can see results after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> No streeking or  heavy overlapping lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and  </li>
            <li> it does take a few sessions to see results</li>
            <li> I want to mention that I have red hair so for me not to get color is pretty bad!</li>
            <li> I got it for over half the price that they were selling for in the salons!</li>
            <li> My only complaint wS a cpl gemstones fell off before I received it and the lil string thing was broken.</li>
            <li> It was like instant sun-poisoning; I felt nauseous, weak, and shaky, and I probably could have passed out at any moment...</li>
            <li> I mean about half the time I used it.  </li>
            <li> The price on this was extremely competitive!!!</li>
            <li> and I went from PALE, and I mean PALE, to looking like</li>
            <li> With that in mind I was still kinda shocked by how much it burned (I started by putting it on my face</li>
            <li> I have worked at tanning salons in the past</li>
            <li> I was not sure about ordering a lotion online.</li>
            <li> I used it yesterday in my usual (20 minute) bed...</li>
            <li> It is not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> Apply a tan extender lotion or coconut oil everyday at least two times.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if this happens for everyone, but I like it,</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t review stuff</li>
            <li> The scent is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> but I was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used sample packs of this in the past but could never afford the retail price of this lotion.</li>
            <li> Another negative to this lotion is the way my legs have started to look after a few months of use</li>
            <li> I have used indoor tanning equipment and lotions for the past 24 years</li>
            <li> It smells kinda weird later but its tolerable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the lotion that I got wasn&#x27;t the real deal Designer Skin Obsidian, but I was heavily heavily disappointed with what I got in the mail.</li>
            <li> and I have a VERY pale complexion.</li>
            <li> I am very pale, and pastey...</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with receiving fake tanning lotion, as long as you buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The bottle was in some plastic wrap while the one from the manufacturer comes in a hard plastic package.</li>
            <li> so I was so dark!!!</li>
            <li> AT LEAST 4 TO 6 HRS BEFORE YOU SHOWER.</li>
            <li> My advice to all tanners, if you can avoid showering for @ least 3 hours after tanning, do it.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I get absolutely no color boost whatsoever with this lotion.</li>
            <li> I keep this on after tanning for at least 8 hours to get the bronzing and when I shower I use Hemp lotion afterwards and it prolongs my tan.  </li>
            <li> Consistency is thick and silky.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I was not willing to pay that.  </li>
            <li> and I usually have a very hard time getting a tan.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is really unpleasant smelling, but that&#x27;s just a personal preference</li>
            <li> Salon prices are RIDICULOUS.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about ordering this online.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money, I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Slight tingle at the end of tanning, nothing crazy.  </li>
            <li> The lotion was very thick and smelled like grapefruit.</li>
            <li> It Was NOT SEALED which then makes me think it is NOT AUTHENTIC!!</li>
            <li> I have a little one that I&#x27;m afraid</li>
            <li> I bought this with skepticism since some reviews on here are poor, but i must say this product did wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because all the rave reviews, I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
            <li> I have always been leery of the heavy bronzing lotions, I was afraid I would look orange or streak.</li>
            <li> Personally, I really don&#x27;t like the scent of any of the Designer Skin products I&#x27;ve used, and this &amp;#34;Caribbean Mist&amp;#34; is the worst one.</li>
            <li> I Am Not Happy With Product</li>
            <li> again something I&#x27;ve never experienced with another lotion.</li>
            <li> No boost, no amazing color, no wonderful smell... NOT a thing.</li>
            <li> being a false product etc.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to any serious tanner and hope it works just as well for you as it does for me!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seriously three shades darker!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion brand new in a sealed package online instead of paying the outrageous mark-up they charge at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Designer Skin lotions and have never been so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed and</li>
            <li> YOU WONT GO WRONG WITH THIS LOTION AT ALL.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it burned a bit.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to tan even the fake tanning and nothing takes to my skin.  </li>
            <li> it was downright uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> so i&#x60;ll keep it in my rotation but sadly I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Not too expensive.</li>
            <li> It did not leave any weird greasy feel to my fingers or my body.</li>
            <li> It has broken the barrier on my tanning and I am darker than I have ever been, without turning orange!</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t give you any weird gunk on your skin that you have to scrub off in the shower.</li>
            <li> The warming part may make you feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Not burned....just uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to tanning salons that told me NOT to purchase this tanning lotion online because it&#x27;s fake</li>
            <li> This fake lotion also flakes off your skin after your tanning session.  </li>
            <li> The texture is weird to me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is because I bought it online, but I heard buying online can sometimes be skeptical.  </li>
            <li> the fact that using an expensive brand lotion in a tanning bed didn&#x27;t give results blows my mind.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say so</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all</li>
            <li> My salon has signs all over about how online lotions can be counterfeit and dangerous.</li>
            <li> It still gives some result but it makea me feel dirty.</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely fake!  </li>
            <li> No damage just unpleasant.</li>
            <li> was even very faint itself.</li>
            <li> its silicone emulsion and goes on your skin and evaporates into it without leaving you feeling disgusting, sweaty or caked with thick creamy lotion.</li>
            <li> The vendors was very difficult to communicate with.</li>
            <li> The bad points...</li>
            <li> &quot; you get with this is to bad</li>
            <li> The smell is fruity and doesn&#x27;t turn bad after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> this lotion has caused my skin to take on the strangest look I&#x27;ve ever seen, almost looking like I got a bad spray tan with the way the color was along my legs.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it stinks!</li>
            <li> I did as directed and started with a base tan it took 3 weeks</li>
            <li> and this lotion helps me achieve a base for when I am headed somewhere sunny.</li>
            <li> I hate that the silicon peels off my skin almost after using it, too.</li>
            <li> And the smell isnt that bad at all!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My tanning salon charges $120.00 for this product - are they insane?</li>
            <li> BUT the smell of this lotion after you tan is awful!!!</li>
            <li> But I was very disappointed to see the bottle not sealed!</li>
            <li> The worst part of all is that IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell awful like with some lotions!</li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>
            <li> i was sweating so badly, every part of my body was heating up like it was in an oven, and this was happening before i even got in the tanning bed!!!!!  </li>
            <li> No slimy feeling or nasty smell either!</li>
            <li> this stuff isn&#x27;t the worst</li>
            <li> But perhaps the worst part was the smell.</li>
            <li> This is the worst tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Designer Skin never disappoints</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loved it..wasn&#x27;t too fond of the volcanic action, but she got dark real fast.</li>
            <li> This works great and it saved me $70 off the tanning salons sale price Thanks!</li>
            <li> Does the job! Not harsh on the skin !</li>
            <li> I bought this with skepticism since some reviews on here are poor, but i must say this product did wonders for me. This is definitely for advanced indoor tanners who want to take their tan to the next level. I have very sensitive skin and have struggled with eczema my whole life, and this product did not irritate my skin. I usually tan in the open sun high pressure bed, which is already a very hot bed by itself, so i can definitely feel the warming or &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34; sensation in this product. I have been doing indoor tanning on and off for a few years now and cannot get any darker, i simply go to relax and to maintain my color, but after starting to use this lotion i have been gaining color and my tan has become more even.  Because of its warming actions i definitely only would recommend this to people who have been tanning for quite some time and have already hit a plateau in their color, and have already started using high pressure beds so they can gauge if the warming sensation is their skin burning or simply the lotion. I recommend this to any serious tanner and hope it works just as well for you as it does for me!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION BOUGHT AT TANNING SALON COST ME 125.00 DOLLARS GLAD I FOUND ON AMAZON. YOU WONT GO WRONG WITH THIS LOTION AT ALL. YOU WILL SEE THE DIFFRENCE IN A FEW DAYS OF TANNING. I WAS AMAZED BY IT. PUT ON LIGHTLY ON FACE AT FIRST MAY BE A LITTLE TO HOT FOR YOU OR TURN FACE TANNER DOWN. BEST TO WAIT AT LEAST 4 TO 6 HRS BEFORE YOU SHOWER. HELPS TO LET IT BUILD UP INTO YOUR SKIN. IM SNOW WHITE IT TANS ME AND NO ORANGE LOOKING EITHER. GREAT LOTION. THANKS AMAZON FOR SELLING IT AT THIS PRICE.</li>
            <li> Got it 5 days early! Smells great if you like frutie smells. I didn&#x27;t think it had a warm feeling or a tingle to it at all but asked my tannin place and they said it was real! I went 2x and seen a big change in color! It does not give you color right after you get out of the bed it&#x27;s more of the next day color but you get super dark!</li>
            <li> It definitely does the job. If you want the silky smooth, non-greasy feel with no burned smell hours after tanning, this is the lotion for you. I buy at my salon since my tanning package allows me 50% off all lotions. My advice to all tanners, if you can avoid showering for @ least 3 hours after tanning, do it. Always put on moisturizing lotion within the first 3 minutes after showering. It soaks up better &amp; your tan will be much more brilliant &amp; healthy looking if you do this each &amp; every time. :) Happy Tanning :)</li>
            <li> Super dark tan after only one use.  I love the smell.  This is hands down the best tanning product I have ever used...</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion I have ever used. I didn&#x27;t think it was actually going to work as good as the bottle claimed but it does. I love it! it made me way darker just on the first use! I love the tingling sensations it gives off too. So glad I found it for this price instead of 120 at the salon.</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon and this lotion is defintely worth the money. Ya it&#x27;s expensive but you get your moneys worth. I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first then tried it and fell in love with it. I have very pale and sensitive skin, nor do I get a tan at all and from using Obsidian I am now the darkest I have ever been, and I&#x27;m not orange. I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion only twice so far and I feel like it&#x27;s already taken me over my \\&quot;tanning plateau\\&quot;. I can&#x27;t really feel the warming until about 7 minutes into tanning, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Besides the fact that it gets you super dark, it smells fantastic! It has a mango-y type scent and best of all, NO BURNT SMELL afterwards, not even a trace. This is the first lotion I&#x27;ve used that still smells great even after tanning, I was complimented on how smelled after I tanned. So it&#x27;s worth buying for that fact in itself. I feel 5x darker than I did a few days ago. I love obsidian...  Of course, buy it on amazon- don&#x27;t get ripped off in the salons. It ships really fast, so there&#x27;s no excuse NOT to buy this lotion! :)</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion. I would say it is probably worth the $40 I paid but definitely not worth the $133 the salon charges. I can not believe how much the salons take you for. I wanted a good lotion but could not afford to get one, at least for what the stupid salon charges anyway. So I went home and looked on the ever so wonderful website Amazon and found lotions soooo much cheaper. This lotion is so silky, I love the way it just glides on my skin. It does not have a great smell, but too bad either. It has a warming sensation to it but not a tingle. The main area that it makes feel kind of hot is my back side. Weird. Anyway good lotion and I thank you so much Amazon. I have referred all my tanning friends to you!</li>
            <li> Love that this is so much cheaper online than in salons. Salon prices are RIDICULOUS. This product worked well &amp; made my skin feel really soft &amp; no streaking with the bronzer.</li>
            <li> My tanning salon charges $120.00 for this product - are they insane? Definitely worth the price on Amazon - and a great product - my color is a deeper brown and my skin is much smoother. Thanks Designer Skin!</li>
            <li> Obsidian is ok, but not as great as some people play it up to be. The scent is great, the lotion goes on very nicely, the warming sensation is pleasent, and I got immediate color after using it, but it didn&#x27;t last that long and gave me an orange look from all the bronzers. Designer skin does make great loions, so don&#x27;t get me wrong, Obsidian is a good lotion if you like lotions with a lot of bronzers, but the color just seemed to fade quickly. After using Obsidian, i decided to purchase Liberate by Designer Skin instead, and let me tell you, that lotion is way better at delivering that dark brown, lasting tan that we all desire. It was cheaper than Obsidian and worked better. So from my experience with these lotions, sometimes the more expensive a product is doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better! I&#x27;d recommend you try Liberate first.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this same product for 3 times the price at the salon I knew I could find it cheaper and I did, tyvm</li>
            <li> I love designer skin products and was excited to try Obsidian. Great but unfortunately it burned a bit. And don&#x27;t get it near your eyes! I have to be extremely careful to shower right after bc I have a little one that I&#x27;m afraid may get it in his eyes or mouth. I will stick to Luminary or Black from now on. So three stars for being a darkening designer skin product but lost two for burning my a$&amp; and avoiding touching my son until I showered!</li>
            <li> I tan a lot for medical reasons and the women at my tanning salon talked me into this 136$ bottle of lotion.. i was lucky and got it on sale. although after using this my skin became extremely dry (even flaking) and i have never had this problem.  I felt like i was burning in the bed and this is after a whole year of tanning, so I switched back to my other lotion. My body went back to normal. I wasn&#x27;t happy with this product and will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading the reviews on here. I own my own bed and have tried countless lotions (mostly sample packets received free with bulb orders). Really liked this lotion. Very nice smelling and not too powerful. Since I tan all the time I had pretty much hit my plateau and really wanted something to push me over the &#x60;tan limit.&#x27; This did the trick. I have been an avid tanner for about 14 years and this lotion exceeded my expectations and is one of the better lotions I have used. I would personally highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be warned, while it is not a full tingle lotion - it has &#x27;warming sensations&#x27; that feel a little too warm on my face for my taste. I honestly was not aware, i must have missed it in the reviews and on the front of the bottle - lol. It did not occure to me until after I felt the heat. So if you do not like that feeling at all, this would not be a good lotion for you.</li>
            <li> I have used black 20x and luminary tanning lotion by designer skin so I decided to try obsidian tanning lotion for something different. There is nothing negative about this product in my opinion, but there is no WOW factor about it compared to the other two products. I am a frequent tanner and had already built my base tan before using it so the warm volcanic minerals didnt really bother me. It did make me a little warm, but nothing to the extent where I had to jump out of the bed. I like this product but I honestly would have been just as happy with the other two based on the price. Its a good tanning lotion, but if your looking to stay cheaper, the other two are just as good.</li>
            <li> Smells like ass works great</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! The bronzer is terrific and I noticed a difference in color in 2 sessions. LOVE designer skin line. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I like black 20x, I like 14 karat gold, I like Luminary.. but obsidian,,  is not anything special... does not feel as good on your skin as any of the others.. and has a horrible after smell.. I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I picked this lotion up to tide me over until my other one came it. When I first put it on I liked it the smell was nice and it feels nice on your skin. I didnt notice any kind of tingle sensation.It went on so smooth and you can see minor results after one use. BUT the smell of this lotion after you tan is awful!!! Thankfully I tan after work but it&#x27;s not a lotion you should try if you plan on doing other things after you tan!! I love designer skin lotions but this one is just not up to par!!!!! I gave it three stars because it is very smooth and I think you would see great results if you can get over the smell!! :( I would recommend buying Devoted Creations Reborn Couture! It smells great before and after tanning! Its a 40X bronzer and it is cheaper than Obsidian!!! :))</li>
            <li> I just used this lotion for the first time and it makes your body feel lik its on fire!!!!!!!! Really on fire like someone is holding a lighter to your whole body ! I WANT MY MONEY BACK I DONT WANT IT NOR WILL I EVER USE IT AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of trial size or single-use containers of tanning lotion and never wanted to buy the full product.  Why?  Because they all stink.  And they all worked the same, meaning, that I could just use a regular lotion for the moisturizing effect and follow-up at home with a bronzing lotion for the same results I got from the tanning lotions for a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried Obsidian at the recommendation of my tanning salon, and mentally rolled my eyes as I heard the same selling pitch from the salon.  But, afterwards, I was floored.  It smells really good and is EXTREMELY moisturizing.  Also, I&#x27;m extremely fair skinned and this (plus an HP bed) really seemed to boost my tanning results and the bronzer was not too orange-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still a cheapskate, so suffice to say I balked at the $100+ price tag at the salon, even though I was tempted.  So I did as I always do; I went home and searched for it on Amazon.  Half-price sounds much better, and it is definitely the same formula.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product bc a good friend of mine who works in a tanning salon said this product was awesome. Also after reading all the reviews this seemed to be a tanners dream lotion. I got the product &amp; hit the beds. Well when I got out of the bed the lotion was flaking off. I never experimentationd this before w any other lotion. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 3 weeks &amp; I haven&#x27;t gotten as dark as all the reviews claimed. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR OPTIMAL TANNING EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Lot of hype (especially from the chicks at the tanning salon) and definitely didn&#x27;t live up to it for me. Would much rather have the Illuminary. If you want a warmer tan without the tingle, then pick this. If you don&#x27;t want tingle or warming, but an awesome tan...pick Illuminary.</li>
            <li> First I find it very difficult to tan.  I am fair skin, Irish and German decent and usually just burn and peel and remain the white paste no matter what I do.  I&#x27;ve tried everything to tan even the fake tanning and nothing takes to my skin.  So for my wedding next month I decided to give it one more shot.  I did as directed and started with a base tan it took 3 weeks but finally I got a little color.  Then I switched to Obsidian my first bronzing lotion in 8 years.  The last round left me with orange after glows.  But with this product I had results in 2 visits.  Although there is a slight tingle and redness on the skin for the first visits the enriched formula left my dry itchy skin so smooth, so rich, so DARK! It was amazing.  I have never been this dark in my life! No peeling, no discoloration, all even color.  I am darker than my fiance who is of Hispanic decent! He is jealous of how dark I am now.  I would recommend this lotion to any skin type and the results speak for themselves!</li>
            <li> Exact match and wow what a savings to buying it at the tanning salon. Now my wife won&#x27;t break my wallet to be tanned. Now if I could only buy Tan sessions cheaper on here.</li>
            <li> Just got my Obsidian today so let me first say THANK YOU for the extremely fast shipping!  Ordered on Friday, received on Monday. :) Everything was perfect.    On to the product..    I used Obsidian for the first time today.  Mind you I have been tanning for 2 weeks and already have a really good base tan.  I have already used Black 20x and Luminary samples(both by Designer Skin).  The results that I got today however surpassed anything I could have hoped for.  The smell is amazing and after just once, I could tell a big difference.  My color has evened out and darkened up. I didn&#x27;t feel the :heat up: like theirs have talked about and it didn&#x27;t give me any tingle sensation.      Definitely would buy from this seller and again and would definitely buy Obsidian again!!</li>
            <li> This product has a great smell even after you tan, some reviews have said that it does&#x27;nt, but not in my case. It is thick and creamy and has light warming affect, not tingling and burning. After you shower you still feel as if your skin is moisterized and soft.</li>
            <li> Smelled great, but I&#x27;m wondering if I got fake? It felt warm when putting it on, but no bronzing effects at all. I have tried other Designer Skin lotions and have never been so disappointed. My Queen 16x bronzer was way better than this one claiming to be 30x</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BE FOOLED BY THE STARS, ITS THE ONLY WAY PPL WILL READ THIS!  Ok the price of the lotion was a great deal I&#x27;ll give them that, the smell of the lotion; well I&#x27;m a guy so the smell does not really matter to me.     BUT!!!!  Why does the seller GUARENTEE A AUTHENTIC SEALED BRAND NEW BOTTLE!! Because when I recieved my bottle It Was NOT SEALED which then makes me think it is NOT AUTHENTIC!! When a customer is promised one thing and pays the money for what the seller is puting out there, then the seller needs to keep thier word! Now who knows maybe the lotion is good? But I was very disappointed to see the bottle not sealed! I am not dumb if the bottle is not sealed it only means the lotion inside could have been exchanged or tampered with! OH thats right it wasn&#x27;t sealed so we would save on the shipping cost (which was suppose to be free!) Are you Kidding Me!     SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME HOW REMOVING THE SEAL ON THE BOTTLE SAVES YOU SHIPPING COST!!!!!????    I don&#x27;t trust anyone anyways, but it&#x27;s worse when someone gives you good reason to not trust the product.    Oh but thank you for the free little sampler lotion inside the order, To me this is a good Con to take your mind off that the bottle isn&#x27;t sealed and that your getting the real stuff which might only be the small sampler inside.     HMMMM I WONDER, don&#x27;t you think that sampler extra in the box cost alot more for shipping cost then the seal on the bottle! I really am questioning this seller and want my money back, bc this is not what I was buying.</li>
            <li> Designer Skin is the only lotion I will ever use. Obsidian is great! Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and my tan never took off to the next level until I tried Obsidian. It has a wonderful tingling feel and good smell. I feel great after using it and my tan has advanced to a dark bronze. I have let several tanning friends try it, and they all love it!</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome!  I have never tanned very well in the past, but now, everyone thinks I just got back from the beach! The seller that I bought it from (Glamour Tanning) is excellent too!</li>
            <li> My old standby was Australian Gold Bronzing Fire Glaze.  I tried this lotion and loved it.  I get compliments on my tan pretty much every day.  Amazon price is WAY cheaper than my salon too.  I cannot recommend this tanning lotion enough.</li>
            <li> Ok, let me start by saying this stuff is not for the faint of heart or for beginners.  If you are just beginning to tan, this will probably burn you like your first day on vacation in Florida without any sunscreen and you are from a northern state and never get out there as it is.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of different lotions; including some fairly powerful tingle lotions like Bombshell and Pink Diamonds.  At my salon, I was warned that Pink Diamonds was more powerful than Bombshell, but I disagreed.  I&#x27;ve used Luminary that I&#x27;ve ordered through Amazon before also, and that has a SIMILAR effect to the Obsidian...but not nearly as powerful.  Let me start by saying THIS IS NOT A TINGLE LOTION.  This is just a standard silicone bronzer like Luminary by Designer skin, but a step more powerful.  This is supposed to be the strongest bronzing lotion that Designer Skin makes as far as I know, and after trying it I wouldn&#x27;t doubt it.  So I begin like I always do; with application.  Depending on time of year (I live in Indiana,) I put my lotion on just before getting into the tanning bed.  If I begin to feel warm or sweat, I&#x27;ll turn the fan on before hopping in (which is sometimes odd in late December, but this has been an odd year with days that the temp was in the 60&#x27;s.)  The first thing I noticed while applying this lotion was a general warmth.  I also tan nude, so I apply even below the belt, and this turned out to be a mistake.  I&#x27;ve applied tingle lotions below the belt, and generally I&#x27;ve never had a problem, but I got so worried with this that I almost decided not to tan.  I&#x27;ve never felt that kind of warmth from a regular bronzing lotion, and in certain (private) areas this was more than just a warmth...it was downright uncomfortable.  I decided to just be a man about it, and go through with it.  I wasn&#x27;t about to waste an entire application of the strongest Designer Skin bronzer on the market.  Immediately I noticed extra heat in the tanning bed, (which is normal.  The stronger a lotion is; the more heat you will feel because its like you are getting more sun into your skin, just like a high UV day in Florida where I grew up.)  I pulled my full 20 minutes in the bed; which is the maximum amount of time allowed per day in the type of bed I was in; (on a side note I had decided not to use the regular bed at my salon, but what they call a Sunstorm which has burning bulbs above you and bronzing bulbs below, so you do 10 minutes on each side for an even, BUT STRONGER THAN USUAL tan.  This may have been another mistake with this lotion.)  So I finally get out of the bed, and immediately feel like I&#x27;m going to fall over.  It was like instant sun-poisoning; I felt nauseous, weak, and shaky, and I probably could have passed out at any moment...BUT I WASN&#x27;T GOING TO TELL ANYONE THAT LOL.  I&#x27;ve always rotated my lotions daily, and I have 6 different bottles of lotion right now (5 Designer Skin and 1 bottle of Australian Gold&#x27;s Sinfully Black.)  I read somewhere that rotating lotions allows you to get the darkest by giving you a broader spectrum of light coverage.  I&#x27;ve always used my Luminary about once every 2 weeks due to the strength, and more as a touch-up than anything else.  From this point forward, the Obsidian is taking the place of my Luminary (which I&#x27;m almost out of,) and considering it feels even stronger than the Luminary I will not be using the Obsidian in anything other than a regular bed (which at my salon consists of regular bulbs and 2 high pressure facial bronzers.)  On a last note, this lotion is amazingly (surprisingly) powerful, and should be used in moderation.  If you can handle using this every day in the best bed your salon has available, more power to you.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be getting comments about how you look Mexican in no time; I&#x27;m always getting comments like that as it is, but my ancestry is half European Jew so I have the olive complexion that gets dark fast already.  However; until you are used to this lotion...PLEASE BE CAREFUL.  I think people can actually hurt themselves with this one.  Make sure to drink plenty of water before going to tan with this one, and of course, don&#x27;t spray any perfume or cologne directly on your skin before tanning or while letting the bronzers work for 2-3 hours after tanning.  Perfume and cologne absorbed through open pores can intensify heat sickness, so just use common sense and be careful.  Also, maybe the first couple times using this lotion, go a little less on your usual time in the bed to see how you&#x27;ll react (AGAIN THIS STUFF IS REALLY STRONG!)  One last warning for those who didn&#x27;t notice the earlier warning lol; keep away from private areas...actually just keep it away from any sensitive areas of the body and all mucus membranes.  This lotion will get you dark, but it won&#x27;t do you any good if you kill yourself doing it; then you&#x27;ll just look good in your casket (like you died on a tropical vacation!) &#x3D;p  Happy tanning all.</li>
            <li> I have worked at tanning salons in the past and i know the difference between a good lotion and a bad one. this is probably the best lotion by far! i used to pay $120.00 a bottle for this. i would not recommend any other lotion.</li>
            <li> I was not sure about ordering a lotion online. This lotion is amazing!! I would reccommend it!! It tans quick and has a great smell. Gives you a nice color.</li>
            <li> Love this product, smells great and definitely works. Came quick, undamaged, and unopened. Bought from here twice and am looking forward to my next purchase! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Gives excellent color, applies evenly and feels silky smooth. Has that silicone emulsion texture. It also smells great.. No after-tan burnt skin odor! . Favorite lotion so far.</li>
            <li> Designer Skin Obsidian 30x Bronzing Matrix Tanning Lotion is a great tanning lotion. It has a great feel to it and it smells really nice before and after tanning. As stated on the bottle, you will feel a warm sensation while tanning and for a little while after. I have gotten really good results with this lotion. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I was super excited to try this product. I ordered it on a Thursday, and it arrived on Tuesday. After work I rushed to try it out at my salon. I was not disappointed. I have been slacking on tanning over the last year which means I was super pale, within one use I achieved the tan I would of with 3 uses of other lotions. Smells nice (not as good as &#x27;Spellbound&#x27; though), and it left my skin incredibly silky. Even many hours later my skin felt soft and moisterized. Can&#x27;t wait to see how dark I get after a couple more sessions. Would definitely recommend!    Also, I told the ladies who run my tanning salon about the great deal I got on Amazon and they were so impressed with the price they ordered six bottles to sell. As a thank you for the tip they offered to order my bottles whenever I need a new tanning lotion so I won&#x27;t have to pay shipping.    All and all a great purchase! Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with all of the Obsession line...I only see the results I want when using a bed called the Matrix (it&#x27;s one of those non-burn beds). I am able to keep a nice colored tan only going onece or twice a week and I have a VERY pale complexion.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this lotion would do wonderful things for me, but I&#x27;ve used it for about a month and realize I get darker results when I switch back to my Supre Smoke. The smell is great but I&#x27;d rather be tan then smell good after (you can always take a shower, but you can only tan at the salon once a day in Florida).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone have any other suggestions for a dark tanning lotion, possibly that is not Designer Skin?</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  Skin feels awesome afterwards too.  Definitely see a difference each time I tan with it. Not so much a fan of after tan smell.  But I still love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I orginally found out about this lotion through the tanning place where I live. But there they wanted $90+tax. I looked everywhere and foud the same exact lotion on here for much much less. I have only tanned a few times and am already getting a tan and I noticed the more you lather on the better the burn (in a good way). I would watch and make sure not to get it in your eyes or mouth because it does burn. If you plan on tanning during lunch get ready to stay hot. Not only are you hot from well laying in a tanning bed but from the minerals in the lotion. All in all this is a great product and I was told by the tanning place here that it is the 2nd best lotion out there without a tinkler. Dont hesitate BUY NOW!!</li>
            <li> I have olive skin, so 30 mins at the beach and I already have tan lines .. But I still wanted a lotion. I did SO MUCH research on which tanning lotion to get, Ive never been this into tanning (I purchased a month unlimited at my local tanning salon) And Ive always known about \\&quot;Designer Skin\\&quot;, from when I went tanning once a month in high school. I still was also considering other brands, but obviously attracted to DS. I almost bought the Luminary, but decided to go with this one. Im definitely VERY tan after the 2nd or 3rd time in the stand up bed, since then i&#x27;ve gone probably 5 more times. So now its between Obsidian and Black Noir (2012) Ive used black Noir once and it was also good. Plus the bottle is gorgeous!</li>
            <li> unfortunately I get absolutely no color boost whatsoever with this lotion. I also dont feel any warming at alll. I will use it up though because I love how it feels on and it dosent have dha so i&#x60;ll keep it in my rotation but sadly I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.  I have used it twice so far.  Both times I noticed a considerable color change.  I had been tanning with another designer skin lotion that was just a quad bronzer and this definitely gave me much more color.  In regards to the warming effect of the lotion I did not notice anything.  I have never used a sizzle lotion so I thought this would maybe start me out small before I went to a sizzle in the future, but this didn&#x27;t seem to warm my skin any different than any other lotion.  If you are looking for something with a good bronzer I recommend this lotion.  If you are looking for a sizzle than I do not recommend it.  I read in other reviews that people did notice the warming sensation so maybe I got stuck with a old one??</li>
            <li> I have used illuminary, Phoenician (the best), and black 20x and all 3 were better than this. The great points...the smell is awesome! It really does leave you smelling fantastic. I noticed that when I got to my car. Also it is very moisturizing. I love the silicon based lotions. The bad points...I was not informed of the heating sensation and I kinda freaked out when i started to feel so warm that it felt someone was holding a fire to my rear! The sensation lasted for a good 30minutes and it was really hot! It was not completely horrible but it was still a feeling a have never felt without being next to fire! I think the best example is to have a heating pad on super hot. Some people can&#x27;t even feel it. I did! I can see how some people may get an irritation. The worst part of all is that IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK! I&#x27;ve found that every other lotion I have tried is better than this one. (with the exception of jwoww and even that worked a little better than this) I did not get any darker from the first use.  With the before mentioned lotions I  have. I looked exactly like I did before I stepped into the stand up with this obsidian. I want to mention that I have red hair so for me not to get color is pretty bad! The best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used is phoenician. There are no bronzers in it but it is an accelerator. I got amazing results after just 1 use and that was in the high pressure which normally takes a couple days in a row to see some darkness. I highly recommend that one. also womanizer by oc. It smells a little yucky but worth the results! I hope this review helps someone make an informed decision. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I have been using a lotion that cost twice as much as this stuff and I am blown away by how much better Obsidian is than the more expensive lotion. I have only tanned twice in the last week and I have noticed that my tan is not fading. It smells great, feels great and gives me awesome color. I am SO glad I tried this. I would recommend it to anyone. Best lotion I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li> I tried Obsidian today, and let me tell you it went beyond what I expected!!! Like Luminary and Black, Obsidian contains a Silicone Emulsion that leaves your skin velvety smooth. The volcanic minerals in this lotion provide much needed nourishment that your skin needs. The 30X Bronzer is this lotion broke through my tanning plateau and I had a super dark color with the first use. Plus, this lotion is a thermogenic, meaning it provides a warming sensation while tanning. Finally, this lotion is the first I have used out of all Designer Skins lotions that really leaves you smelling like a fresh peach with no after tan odor present. The smell is incredible, and I have received various compliments on it! All in all this lotion is definitely worth it!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tanning product on the market today. Quality doesn&#x27;t cost, it pays. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have some problems with tanning. I&#x27;ve undergone chemo, can&#x27;t make it to the tanning bed hardly at all, am short of money, and my skin stopped tanning when the chemo started.  I go tanning now about 3 times a month, and I was looking for a tanning lotion to support that. I can tell you, this stuff is AMAZING!  I tan 3 times a month and about once a week use a self bronzer lotion, and I&#x27;m back to being tan again! My boyfriend noticed.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this lotion 5 stars is because it is very greasy. I always wear my yucky-clothes while tanning, because this stuff (with the DHA) makes them smell. I tan, go home, sit for a couple hours or sleep in it, and shower. You do NOT want to have to go out after you use this! So if you&#x27;re a morning tanner, or run errands, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, but if you don&#x27;t have time or ability to tan much and want to get dark, this is amazing! The smell is nice, even though I&#x27;m sensitive to scents, it just gets a body-odor smell afterwards.  But again, if your focus is on purely getting dark, THIS IS THE STUFF TO BUY! Just remember to leave it on and not hit the shower immediately!  (For those who don&#x27;t know- tanning 3 times a month is hardly enough to maintain a tan, let alone build one. But with this stuff I&#x27;m getting darker every time! Almost immediate results too!!) I&#x27;m in love, never going back to all the expensive bottles they sell at my salon.</li>
            <li> Received my product early and very satisfied!! Even got free samples which is a big plus. My tanning salon sells this lotion for $125 which is outragous for just the lotion. This is the best price around and will def. buy more products from this seller.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I looove this lotion! I&#x27;ve used it once since I received it and I&#x27;m already darker. It smells reeeaaalllllyyy good too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy it every time if it was cheaper. Moisturizing and great for in the tanning beds. I hear this is the best of the best.</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion, especially for the price !!</li>
            <li> Has a slight tingle that lasts just long enough for you to get your tan on. Noticed a good lasting color difference when I started using this lotion. Much better than the Black 20x I tried last go around. Good prompt delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion that i have ever put on my skin. Not only does it smell good, but after a few tans it leaves your skin moisturized and gives it a dark tan. I would definitely recommend this lotion to any one!</li>
            <li> I love to tan, I have been tanning on and off throughout the last few years of my life. Ive tried TONS of different tanning lotions and am trying to find one that sticks out from the rest. So far, I have only used this tanning lotion once. I do tan pretty quickly as it is, but this boosts it up like craaazzzyyy. I only went once and people are commenting on how i \\&quot;glow\\&quot; and \\&quot;have you been in the sun lately?\\&quot; Its amazing a tanning lotion could do that after just once!!!! I will write another review once I have used it more! So far- LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Great tanner. I priced this product at my tanning salon and they wanted $130. Nice fragrance, not too girly, my husband uses it too. Beware it does have a slight tinge too it and it really made my face hot with a burning feeling. No damage just unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I bought this from the sellar,because of all the great reviews it had and at a great price. I was using Paradisio a 10(times) bronzing lotion also by Designer Skin which I think is a good lotion,But wanted to try something diffrent.I&#x27;ve used Obsidian for about two weeks now and found that I was getting much darker than with the Paradisio.Obsidian has a warming to the skin when applied,But goes away in about 30 minutes.(Keep away from your sensitive areas including your eyes).Once applied,it has a velvety feel on your skin and would desribe the smell as cross between a mango and grapfruit.Very pleasing,Before and after tanning.Also because of the volcanic minerals in the lotion,I found it to be a more thicker lotion,and found it to be used up quicker than other lotions.Yes I would buy this again.Great lotion.</li>
            <li> Great value. ..arrived early</li>
            <li> My body got soooooooo dark and sexy using this lotion! I ordered it from Amazon on a Friday afternoon and got it the following Wednesday. You can&#x27;t beat the price!! I used it yesterday in my usual (20 minute) bed...however (and I don&#x27;t recommend this) I stay in about 25 to 30 minutes because the owner at the gym I tan at hasn&#x27;t changed the God forsaken bulbs in like 3 years!! I didn&#x27;t see immediate results as some users claim, however my body got super hot and tingly. I went back today to a different bed that a lady recommended and OH MY LORD I got soooooooo hot in that bed!! The lotion goes on great, smells wonderful, and man oh man did I get dark on the second go around! I NEVER EVER get this dark in natural sunlight, let alone a tanning bed!! I compare my level of darkness of spending a week on the beach in Panama City, Florida in July! Great product..my best friend tried it too and LOVES IT. Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> One of the best tanning lotions I have used. Not too expensive. It is not a tingle but does have some warmth to it.</li>
            <li> I have used this every time I go to the tanning beds and I always walk out with a nice smell not the burnt smell you get with other products. Also the \\&quot;burning\\&quot; or \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; you get with this is to bad I have never used this type before and I used it all over including my face and it almost felt like mint tea tingle. Not painful or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> works so good and smells good too! the warming sensation is perfect not to hot! love it best smelling lotion there is!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! It has a nice warming effect,that&#x27;s not at all a tingle. Also has a very yummy scent.</li>
            <li> This lotion is incredible.  After two uses I was getting comments on how dark I was becoming.  It keeps your from getting that after-tan smell, as well.  Actually - better than that - you smell GOOD.  And it makes your skin so soft!  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I got obsidian real obsidian tanning lotion for 36 bux!! How can he sell it so cheap? Well I don&#x27;t know the answer to that but I can assure you it&#x27;s the real stuff. Salons in my area sell it from 64 bux to 164 bux!! It&#x27;s the best smelling and feeling lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I encourage all tanners to try it from theetanman! I will definitely be buying more lotion from him.</li>
            <li> i buy it here now... it came packaged perfectly and brand new. i love the lotion and the product got to me fast and sealed. my salon sells this for about 120$ so its nice to know i can get it at a resonable price and not worring about it being a false product etc. thank you!</li>
            <li> This product REALLY WORKS!! It warms up during the tanning and you can feel it work. I do not look like leather, I have a natural glow.</li>
            <li> This has a great scent and very silky feel. Seems to be good for hydration. Has good bronzer, but not obvious after first use. It does have a slight tingle feeling, so don&#x27;t use on your face. It does make you slightly redder after tanning, but by morning it is a nice bronze color. It seems to advance your tan...big plus :-)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion! It also smells amazing!!! Sun stay technology is really great too! I loved how when I get out of the tanning bed I don&#x27;t smell awful like with some lotions! I would reccomend this lotion to anyone who wants great tanning results!!</li>
            <li> I have been using these product for couple of years. Unfortunately have stopped tanning but will use this product as a moisturizer as it is outstanding.  My mother grabbed an extra bottle I had and believes the lotion is the best.</li>
            <li> This lotion is such great value, especially given the fact that tanning salons charge around double the price! The product was a gift for my daughter and arrived within plenty of time for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft, nice smell.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion in half the time I was supposed to. It works way better than I had expected. I paid about 1/4th of what I would have at my salon, and the service was awesome. I was sent 2 free samples and card with their information. I will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This item is ok, but I would not reccomend it if you have sensitive skin. this product has crushed gem stones in it, that is why it is marked up so high at the tanning salon&#x27;s. it also has volcanic particals which can cause your skin to over heat. I used it twice  and just to make sure I felt, what I thought, I  felt what was the over heating of the skin which by the way ,  felt way  to hot for me to try it the third time,and then I  realized ,  I was right!  It causes the skin to over heat, it does not have a tingle in it but they should warn you about the volcanic particals that causes this problem. I will not use it again, but what is not right for me may be ok for  someone else. Darker tanned skin seems to not have a problem with this item, but I did.</li>
            <li> this lotion is awesome!!!! have been tanning for years and have found that this lotion has given me very quick results deep dark smooth tan love it!!!  would recommend you try it.....</li>
            <li> This is litteraly the best lotion that I&#x27;ve ever used. Buy it! Trust this seller. You won&#x27;t be let down.</li>
            <li> Even though the store/owner called me,I am still concerned that the product was not in the \\&quot;complete\\&quot; new package/box.  They said it was to save on s&amp;h.  I would rather pay s&amp;h and KNOW that the product is safe and original, as the seal is broken where the top screws on (not sure if they are all like that or not) When I bought from a local salon, I don&#x27;t remember if it was broken or not...I do like the product IF IN THE Original Package as though you were getting it from a Tanning Salon.  I can&#x27;t see any big difference in my tanning.  Product smells good in the beginning and feels nice on the skin.  Owner&#x27;s were QUICK to respond, which made for a nice experience, and, they offered my money back.  I elected to keep it and try it.  I appreciated their customer service and they were very polite.</li>
            <li> Glad i kept this lotion n gave it  a second chance, it takes a lil time but is worth it. A beautiful dark tan that least for long time when use in high pressure bed :)</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this lotion with very high hopes, I was not disappointed! The smell is slightly fruity, but not at all overbearing. After I get out of the tanning bed I did not have any odor on me. I went to smell my arm and the scent of the lotion was even very faint itself. It has a slight silicone feel to it which felt very moisturizing, not at all like, say, a silicone face primer. It did not leave any weird greasy feel to my fingers or my body. I had seen other reviews that stated that after two times in the tanning bed they received a slight tan. I was very skeptical of these accusations, but they are true! After two fairly short sessions in e tanning bed I noticed my skin browning quite nicely! I did not feel any tingling or overwhelmingly hot sensations when using this product either. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I got this in record time and saved so much money, I am the envy of all my fellow tanners.  Will order again and recommend for my friends to do the same.</li>
            <li> Great product, gives a nice tan.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It has broken the barrier on my tanning and I am darker than I have ever been, without turning orange! :) This tanning lotion came sealed and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Have tried many different tanning lotions, this by far exceeds all of them! It feels like silk on your skin and does not leave a greasy film.  You can see results after a few uses.  I have seen a deeper, darker tan than ever before. I am going back for more... one for me and one for a friend!  This is super!</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful not only does it make your skin silky smooth but you get a great tan too!!The seller A-Z gets it to you fast I ordered it on Friday and received it on Tuesday 5 days early.Thank You</li>
            <li> This lotion is a GREAT bronzer but fails to provide the \\&quot;warming\\&quot; sensation they mention. Oh well, I can&#x27;t complain considering the nice deep brown color I get from it. Its also incredibly moisturizing- even after you step out of the bed! The smell is fruity and doesn&#x27;t turn bad after you&#x27;re done. The tanning salons will charge you almost $100 for a bottle of this but Amazon gives you a great deal! I highly recommend this lotion if you&#x27;re looking for dark color and no tingle factor.</li>
            <li> My favorite Indoor Tanning Lotion! I have fair/normal skin that requires a little work to get a tan and this lotion helps me achieve a base for when I am headed somewhere sunny. Smells great and lasts long. I don&#x27;t think it is a tingle lotion, but sometimes i get hints of a tingle. Nothing like a legit tingle lotion though.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of this lotion but the smell is not nice at all. It did get me dark though.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product yesterday after reading great reviews on it and seeing the results my friend had with a similar product, Luminary. I ordered this yesterday early enough in the day to have it delivered by tomorrow. It hasn&#x27;t shipped yet even though I picked two-day shipping, so I doubt it will be here by the time I need it. Very annoying.</li>
            <li> The product is very good. thanks</li>
            <li> I like this lotion, but I prefer Designer Skin&#x27;s Luminary over Obsidian. Luminary gave me more of a brown/bronze color whereas Obsidian gave me more of an orange color. I felt that Luminary tanned me quicker and the color lasted longer as well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion ever! I&#x27;ve used luminous, black, believe, paint it black, and a bunch of other tanning lotions and this is definitely my favorite. This doesn&#x27;t give you a weird after smell and doesn&#x27;t stain your hands which is my favorite part. It has a warming feel to it and goes on silky smooth. After tanning I feel twice as tan and I love that it doesn&#x27;t wash off after you shower. Also, it doesn&#x27;t give you any weird gunk on your skin that you have to scrub off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion.  It is the best bronzer I have tried.  There is no weird smell like some of these lotions have and I love that my skin feels soft afterwards.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great product and shipped fast</li>
            <li> Excellent!! Wonderful price for an amazing product! I&#x27;ll never buy Designer Skin anywhere else but Amazon ! Was not tampered with at all , brand new , legitimate, real product ,not an impression, this is a real deal on Designer Skin tanning lotion !&lt;br /&gt;Corrin</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing.  I have only used it twice so far and I am already 3 shades darker.  I am not orange at all and I have a very pretty brown color.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a bad after-tan smell, and my skin feels super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I did not realize that this was a warming lotion, I didnt read all of the details.  I do not usually care for warming lotions, but the results are well worth it.  It is not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> Lotion performed very well before I sarted to plateau. I would highly recommend this lotion for someone who has an established tan. Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> I agree with MarMar! I&#x27;ve used this lotion 3 times already and I am DARK! It&#x27;s amazing! I first thought \\&quot;30 bronzers? Isn&#x27;t that a little much?! I don&#x27;t want to be orange.\\&quot; It gives you beautiful color and, as promised by Designer Skin, it lasts a while. The smell is \\&quot;Caribbean Mist,\\&quot; which smells nice in the bottle and on the skin. It smelled a bit musky after a while. Just be aware of that. This lotion also makes your skin feel very soft.    To me, it&#x27;s a mix between a tingler and a normal lotion. Just enough heat, but without the burn. It&#x27;s actually relaxing with the tanning bed heat, with a few fans going, and then the volcanic minerals working on you, too. After tanning, your body will feel a little more hot than normal.     Be careful around your face, especially near or under your eyes. The warming part may make you feel uncomfortable. The first time I used a packet at the salon, this happened to me and it felt weird. Not burned....just uncomfortable. Either way, I loved it enough to buy a whole bottle! :)      EDIT: While I still love Obsidian, the after smell really started bothering me after a while. I switched to Queen for a better smell</li>
            <li> Thanks for this amazingly cheap product. It is $126 in the salons!! I love Designer Skin products. Great SELLER. First time to buy from an individual. Exceptional experience.</li>
            <li> love this location and will order it again</li>
            <li> I like this lotion. I noticed a considerable color change. I had been tanning with another designer skin lotion that was just a quad bronzer and this definitely gave me much more color.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product at the tanning salon, retail there was over $100. I did get a special deal if I purchased 2 bottles, still way overpriced. I liked the product very much so when 2nd bottle was getting low my daughter suggested I check out Amazon and what do you know...found it for less than a third of the cost of the salon. The product has a pleasant scent and gives me a great tan in just a couple of visit. The lotion works well outside of the tanning bed as well which I like very much, that way I don&#x27;t have to purchase several different types of product.</li>
            <li> Coming from a total TANNING JUNKIE, this lotion is the best Ive ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t handle tingler lotions, its too much. This lotion is the best of everything, it gets me SUPER&lt;br /&gt;dark and makes my skin soooo soft. Very light soft smell too. Ive used a million different lotions,&lt;br /&gt;and felt as if I had hit my &#x27;tanning plateau&#x27; but this lotion got me so tan. I can feel it working in the&lt;br /&gt;bed! It says it has volcanic minerals in it, but it is NOT a tingler, its a bronzer. LOVE this lotion!</li>
            <li> this is the must have tanning lotion.  Works fast!  Great moisturizer. Amazing fragrance. I will be ordering a second bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Obsidian is the only lotion that has ever gotten me dark! I started using it 3 weeks ago and I went from PALE, and I mean PALE, to looking like I had just spent a few weeks in the tropics. Everyone keeps asking how I have gotten so dark in such a short amount of time. I have been going to the tanning bed on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday each week and tanning in a high pressure bed, a 10 minute bed, and a 12 minute bed. Rotating tanning beds helps you to achieve a great tan. Obsidian smells great out of the bottle, but the after tanning smell is just okay. Once you hit a &amp;#34;tanning plateau&amp;#34; (which everyone does at one point or another), purchase lava drops. Lava drops are a tingle additive. Simply squeeze your regular tanning lotion in your hand, add the lava drops, mix it between your hands, and apply to your skin like normal. The addition of the tingle additive will save you from having to buy a new bottle of lotion just for the tingle. And ALWAYS keep your skin moisterized! Apply a tan extender lotion or coconut oil everyday at least two times. Moisterized skin tans faster and more even. I hope you love this lotion as much I do!</li>
            <li> You guys done a superb job...... everything went/was BETTER THAN GREAT! BEAUTY SUPPLY MASTERS ARE THE BEST TO BUY MY TANNING PRODUCTS BY FAR! The price was good, I received my product 1-2 after ordering, I ordered on a Thursday and received my product early Saturday morning, and it was sealed in the original packaging....... Everything went Awesomely! If you can get some tan extenders like, Desighner Skin&#x27;s Black. If you can maybe do a package deal with Desighner Skin&#x27;s Obsidian with the Desighner Skin&#x27;s tan extending Black.....I would be your #1 customer, well I already am, but just saying...... That Would Make My Tanning so much more addictive!! Thank you, Beauty Supply Masters...... Your the Best! Tequila</li>
            <li> First of all can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price, and received the product in 4 days, much sooner than I expected. I tan every other day and have for months, recently I felt I had hit the infamous \\&quot;tanning plateau\\&quot; at which point I was not seeing any more color, or getting any darker. 1 use of this lotion and I definitely got DARKER! My favorite bronzing lotion WAS Australian Gold Almost Famous, and my favorite accelerator was Designer Skin Secret Rapture. This lotion combines the best of both. Goes on clean and smooth, and does not have the orange sticky feel of most bronzers. After several uses the color is a Deep Brown Tan, not the fake looking orange that most bronzers create after repeated use. The smell is also great, absolutely no ATO. You will actually smell good after tanning. This lotion is not a tingle but it does create a slight warming effect, though it is comfortable for me if you do not have a base tan or have sensitive skin it may be a little hot. All in all great lotion, great color, great smell, silky-smooth, and best of all great price! 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This item shipped quickly and was exactly what i thought it was going to be.  For those of us who are white and would like color whithout getting the leathery look, this lotion was perfect.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion and have used it in several different types of beds. I can&#x27;t stand the fruity smell. It reminds me of cheap bodyspray that was popular in junior high. As for the \\&quot;warming\\&quot; actions? I barely noticed, and when I do, its only in certain places. This lotion does not have a tingle...it&#x27;s more of a heat sensation. As for bronzers, I dont really see it doing anything different than my Black 20X. Once I&#x27;ve showered, there&#x27;s no risk of it sweating off onto clothes. I appreciate that. Overall, it does what most other Designer Skin lotions do for me, so I don&#x27;t really see the point of paying extra.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because all the rave reviews, I&#x27;m not happy. It does smell great, moisturizer is great. Accelerated tanning? NO and to top it off it caused a rash all over my body &amp; made me ich like crazy. I Have never ever had problems with skin rashes,etc ever in my life. I definatley do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love Designer Skin lotions. This is just one of my favorites. Its a great lotion and does get you dark fast. Specially is used in a Sunboard. The warm feeling isnt bad at all,I cant handle tingles AT ALL. But this is actually really comfortable! And the smell isnt that bad at all! The salon I go to had the bottle for well over $130 and I couldnt bring myself to purchase it at that price. I have used Black the most,this one blows Black out the water! The only problem is,is you have hard water it will be extremely hard to get soap to lather on your body with this. But other then that its wonderful!</li>
            <li> I tried a packet of this today, and yes I do see a difference after just one use but I am not in love. I did not really feel the heat of the \\&quot;volcanic minerals\\&quot;... I was really comfortable! So nothing exciting. The smell was also okay, but after I got home I thought it was a weird musky smell similar to cat urine?! Not kidding. SO! Overall, I am willing to try another packet in a higher power bed for a longer time to see if it makes a difference, I wouldn&#x27;t buy a bottle though. Sorry! It&#x27;s hyped up.</li>
            <li> With designer skin it&#x27;s obvious that you are paying sooo damn much just for the packaging. Screw that. Waaaaay too much fragrance. Don&#x27;t even think about putting it on your face</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion, I got really dark, but beware of the tingle after. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a tingle lotion, but there&#x27;s definitely some heat after you get out!</li>
            <li> My friend got this and recommended it so i tried it!  I cant say enough how awesome it works!!!  It smells amazing as well!!  This stuff works wonders!!  Great price! Fast shipping and overall great product!! Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this in a tanning salon for WAY more $$ and I loved it. Found it on here for WAY much cheaper :) smells good too</li>
            <li> The lotion was very thick and smelled like grapefruit. Then after I tanned I smelled like popcorn.  lol  Definitely not something you would want to go to work in after you tan.  It DID have a nice warming effect and made my skin extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> I used to use DS Luminary and Black, which both have great formulas, but I couldn&#x27;t take the scent of Luminary after awhile, and tried a sachet of this at my salon, and have since converted.  I still use Black, but Obsidian is my new favorite, great formula - goes on extremely smooth, gives me great color, and smells nice (light and fruity - peach top notes/smells like a peach-mango smoothie, not too strong/perfumey).  I also no longer use an accelerator if I haven&#x27;t tanned in a while, this alone does the job.</li>
            <li> I have seen these in the tanning salon for months, but just couldn&#x27;t see spending over $100 for this product.  Finally decided to buy it off of my favorite place Amazon.com.  I used it for the first time on Friday and I love the smell, the texture and the results.  I immediately looked darker and my skin felt amazingly smooth.  I will ALWAYS buy all of my indoor tanning lotion fron Amazon.com from now on.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and do not tan all year round, so when I heard of this lotion and read the reviews, I thought I would try it.  It has done a wonderful job of giving me good color in a short amount of time.  I have tanned 2 times and have already been complimented on my color from people I work with.  The other great thing about this is that is doesn&#x27;t have the nasty smell after you tan.  I am so glad that I found it on Amazon, the people at my spa raved about it at the price of $120, this is such a better deal!!</li>
            <li> Item was expired, didn&#x27;t mention that in the product description. ....expiration date is pretty important and should have said so in the description!</li>
            <li> The smell is just amazing! Keeps you smelling good for hours after you use it! Best lotion I have ever used! Gets you tan fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to tanning salons that told me NOT to purchase this tanning lotion online because it&#x27;s fake and it&#x27;s not going to work the same. Well I&#x27;m not an expert but I can tell you that it works! I got a glowing tan after using it 3 times! I love it...</li>
            <li> Ok I just started using this product and I&#x27;m already way darker after 3 uses. It smells amazing to me and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the feeling of fire or heat as other reviews state. However remember no two peoples skin are exactly alike.  I have very very fair skin and do not tan easily so for something to work I am amazed, I&#x27;ve used other products that feel like your tan washes away and I definitely don&#x27;t with this one! Overall I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really want to be DARK this summer -- This is my 2nd year/ time ever tanning &amp; sticking to it so I can be a good color - It&#x27;s still winter but I take a LONG time to tan -- I am at a really nice base color -- from nw 15 - to nw30 difference (if you know MAC makeup coloring) --And I was just using Bombshell &amp; Back to Black&amp;lt;- which was pretty good. I still use Bombshell but I ran out and bought this, Some people says it makes you \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; IT DOES NOT. It does have a \\&quot;warming\\&quot; sensation if you haven&#x27;t used it in a while on certain parts of your body ( like for me when I used it I did a lay down and under my chest where I havent tanned that well since i normally do stand up, that warmed up ALOT about a half hour AFTER I tanned) but if you use it more than twice in a row, that sensation goes away. other than you just feel sweaty &amp; like you went tanning. Which I perfer tingles. I feel nice and hot &amp; like my skin got a GOOD COLOR. But over all it does get me dark if i use it back to back in a week. But as for the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; nope. Bombshell all the way :)</li>
            <li> I love Designer Skin &amp; all of their lotions. This is their top of the line lotion and it&#x27;s the BEST if you&#x27;re looking for some quick color. I get a nice brown color from the lotion. I highly recommend this to anyone! If you don&#x27;t want to try the \\&quot;warming\\&quot; in this lotion, check out Luminary by Designer Skin</li>
            <li> I have heard that Obsidian is the best tanning lotion you can buy but I sure was not paying $120 for it at salons soo I decided to order it from here instead, this item came two days after I purchased it so I was very happy. Obsidian smells amazinggg even my husband told me I smelled great after using this one day. It goes on very smooth and rubs in easily, I love it! I didnt see a huge difference after tanning once with this lotion but within the first week, I could definitely see that I went a few shades darker. I&#x27;ve seen other peoples say this lotion gets really hot but it only got slightly warm for me and I have used it on my face and it was fine. Overall Obsidian is an amazing lotion but for people like me that it takes a bit more to tan then it might be more of a gradual tan but it smells great, feels great on your skin, leaving it super soft even after you shower and the bottle looks pretty awesome too :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this a couple days ago and got it today and of course went right to the tanning salon! Not only does it smell amazing, but my skin feels soft and I already look darker. One thing I noticed, and I&#x27;m not sure if this happens for everyone, but I like it, when I got out of the tanning bed, I went to wipe the excess sweat off and started feeling warm in the places where I had wiped (like my back). It wasn&#x27;t overwhelming at all and it felt nice. Love this lotion! It&#x27;s my new favorite!</li>
            <li> I used it only 3 times and I&#x27;m very tanned. The comments on the web page are not a lie, is true! Is the best tanning lotion that I used so far :)))</li>
            <li> Great product! I am complimented SO much on how dark I am after weeks of use of this product! Goes on smooth!! Smells WONDERFUL and gives a DARK all natural color! I would recommend this to ANYONE wanting a BEAUTIFUL tan!!! You won&#x27;t regret it! :)</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely fake!  I should see amazing results with this but I get better results with the least expensive lotion my tanning salon sells.  I should have known the price was too good to be true!  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I used this last year. It is the the best cream I have ever used to get a really good base tan before summer. This is not a hot cream, so there is no tingling sensation or burning in the sunbed.  But best of all it smells nice.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t original lotion because I was allergic to this one but not the one I had bought from the tanning place.</li>
            <li> No joke this stuff made my skin super hott and was very uncomfortable. I guess I didn&#x27;t read that part when I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did not notice any serious benefits as far as my tan goes. I don&#x27;t think the sensation of my skin being melted by lava is worth it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand why the bottle was opened and not sealed. The lotion inside was great the real deal. very satisfied</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. I love designer skin tanning lotions and this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> This lotion gives off more of a tingle than a warmer, in my opinion. I hate that the silicon peels off my skin almost after using it, too. However, if you want to be brown then this is your &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; lotion. Even though the silicon peels off, it leaves my skin feeling super soft and smooth. Do not pay the salon price, though.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how amazing this lotion is. It wasn&#x27;t until I went to use a different lotion that I realized just how great this one is. It&#x27;s worth every penny... Smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave streaks, gets you dark. I usually don&#x27;t review stuff but this was so worth it, I had to put in a good word. BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these lotions. I love it, the lotion goes on very smooth and hydrates the skin. The color afterwards is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for 3 years straight. It gets me super tan super fast. Coming from someone that has freckles and doesn&#x27;t tan the easiest at first, that is saying a lot. It smells good and leaves my skin really silky smooth. This lotion retails for $120 in salons. Worth the money for sure!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion. It helped me get darker than any lotion I have EVER used, and I would 100% buy again. it smells better than most lotions I have used. It made my skin feel extra soft and never plugged my pores. That said, I LOVE the warm of indoor tanning (I always turn the fans off) so I love the way Obsidian gets warm. It isn&#x27;t a burn or tingle, more like putting on sweats fresh out the dryer or sitting on a heated leather car seat. During the 2013-14 winter, Obsidian was literally a ray of warmth! My salon has signs all over about how online lotions can be counterfeit and dangerous. They also charge over $100 more for this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have gotten great color by using this.  I was able to tellfit was working by my second session in the tanning bed.  It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I thought it would be but my color is great.  I would use it again.</li>
            <li> This product made me sooooo dark!  I am absolutely in love with it and will continue to use it every time I tan!</li>
            <li> Burned on my first try with this product</li>
            <li> Love this product, you can tell a huge difference in your color within 2 uses.  Will definately order this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time and I still haven&#x27;t found anything better.  I worked in the tanning industry and have had the opportunity to sample many products, this is the best.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time.  As always my awesome all-time favorite lotion. Will continue to buy this lotion. Gives me a nice deep bronze color.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product I have gotten all my lotions from DS and would recommend them to everyone!</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with receiving fake tanning lotion, as long as you buy from Amazon. Do no select some second rate seller just because it&#x27;s a dollar cheaper. Sometimes it&#x27;s worth spending a little more. This is one of my favorite lotions because I don&#x27;t like the tingle ones. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever made the investment at the salon then you know this is an amazing lotion, but what I received was not real.  The lotion I received smelled right, but was thinner, did not have the &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; this lotion is supposed to have, and most importantly did not improve my tan like it should have.  As I said I&#x27;ve purchased the real Obsidian before and it gives you a rich dark color and leaves your skin feeling hydrated after tanning.  This fake lotion also flakes off your skin after your tanning session.  So my suggestion is invest in the real product and don&#x27;t waste your money on this fairly convincing fake one.</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion. Always seem to get great color when using this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion works great! Always gives me a dark tan that lasts! It arrived quicker than the expected due date and was in its original packaging. I would recommend this lotion to anyone looking for a great product for indoor tanning.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion brand new in a sealed package online instead of paying the outrageous mark-up they charge at the tanning salon. In my opinion, I did not see any significant change in color. It spotted up my skin in some areas, and it came off while shaving, leaving this brown goop on my razor, and a white face with a somewhat light-brown tint on the rest of my body. I went back to using my John Abate Titanium lotion (mild tingle with no bronzers to come off in the shower or on my razor), and saw dramatic results with a dark tan that looked more human. This is the second high-end Designer Skin product I have used, the other one being Luminary. For me... they just don&#x27;t work for the money.</li>
            <li> I have always been leery of the heavy bronzing lotions, I was afraid I would look orange or streak. I was very surprised when I tried Obsidian and I got AMAZING color! I barely noticed the warming effect, it was just enough to make me sweat without making me uncomfortable. My skin was super soft after using it anf the smell,before and after, was light and citrus. I really enjoyed using this lotion and will be adding it to my taning rotation.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about the lotion, everyone told me how DARK it got them yadda yadda but I dont feel like it gave me too much color, but im relatively dark as it is so there might be only so much bronzers can do for you. i LOVE the way it makes you smell after you tan tho.. NO BURNT SKIN SMELL! somehow it completely eliminates that disgusting after tan odor of burnt skin which i love, no lotion has ever done that for me before. the texture of the lotion is amazing as well. its silicone emulsion and goes on your skin and evaporates into it without leaving you feeling disgusting, sweaty or caked with thick creamy lotion. it does tend to leave you feeling tingly/hot in some areas but its nothing to be concerned about. the feeling only lasts while you tan and stops afterwards. nothing like a tingle lotion. overall i like the lotion, the color i have from it is a nice brown shade, not too yellow not too red.</li>
            <li> The product was pretty good. It bronzed ok and warmed occasionally, and by occasionally I mean about half the time I used it.  Deffinately smells good though and leaves your skin very very soft! Will probably order again or atleast another Designer Skin product! Service was great and professional. Came in a couple of days from CA to MA.</li>
            <li> I was using Designer Skin Luminary when the girls that work at the tanning salon i go to kept telling me that Obsidian was better and said it got them so dark and all that. I refused to buy it at the salon since it was like $100. I ended up ordering it from Amazon. When i first started to use it i wasnt going tanning a lot because i went at night and skipped a lot because i wouldnt feel like it after a long day so i thought it was just the lotion that wasnt getting me dark like the girls at the tanning salon had said. I was disapointed but i then started to go in the mornings regularly and i noticed a huge difference. I finally feel like i am tan now. I also think i am going to switch to another lotion now so i dont get too dark. I believe this lotion is great it just depends on how often you go tanning. I also like the smell of the lotion before &amp;after.. some tanning lotions give you a burnt smell after but this doesn&#x27;t. I ended up loving this tanning lotion :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used numerous high priced lotions, and this just didn&#x27;t do much for me. Smells great. Thats about it. I&#x27;ve used walmarts tanning lotion as my back up lotion for when my good ones ran out and that one is better. Honestly, I just think its the brand name. I&#x27;ve heard Luminary was nice, must try that next.  Happy Tanning :)</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It doesnt smell bad after tanning and it has a wonderful warmth when its on your skin. i got much much darker after just two sessions. i definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new lotion. It is worth the money and it is so much cheaper here on amazon.</li>
            <li> I love obsidian tanning lotion...I tried the sample packets and love it!! Just bought a bottle. Luminary by designer skin does not even compare!! This got me super dark in just one tan.   It smells great.  It is NOT A TINGLER...IT HAS A SLIGHT WARMING SENSATION BUT DOESN&#x27;T BURN YOU AND MAKE YOU RED LIKE A TINGLER LOTION</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST TANNING LOTION OUT THERE! ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!  PROMPT SELLER, RECEIVED PRODUCT EARLY - PLEANSANT SURPRISE - THANK YOU! WILL DEFINITELY BUY FROM AGAIN !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once, and seem to look browner. One thing to note: there is a warming sensation. This is not a tingle lotion, however there is a very strong warming sensation. It lasted about 30 minutes for me.  The lotion so far is good for the tan though. It smells good too. I will update as I continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Love this.  It&#x27;s true Designer Skin, it creates immediate color, and the warming effect feels great in a cold bed in the morning!  People asked where I&#x27;d been on vacation!  The smell is amazing as well, even hours after tanning.  Not super greasy like some lotions I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve gone through half the bottle and haven&#x27;t had any streaking or unsightly splotches on my hands and feet.  Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the speedy shipping, I appreciate it.  I&#x27;ve told all my friends about you.  Happy Holidays to you all.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple...this is the best there is!!! Very high end silicone leaves your skin feeling incredibly smooth and hydrated and the smell? It&#x27;s amazing. When I use it I have people ask me all the time what I&#x27;m wearing it smells THAT GOOD!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Fabulous!  I Love It!!! I will order more of this product. Got three shades darker. Amazing how well it works.</li>
            <li> Love the product will purchase again received quickly after ordering...smells great and darkens after a couple of tans love the color it gives</li>
            <li> Bought this in lieu of spending hundreds at the tanning place. Did exactly what I expected. IT helps with the tan, but it does have the warming sensation. Not good for tanning in the summer in Arizona...gets too warm. Don&#x27;t use in a hydro bed. It will make you get too warm from the heaters and made my veins redden through my skin. Very scary, fine but scary.&lt;br /&gt;Helped build the tan.</li>
            <li> Better than black. Tans you off the hook, smells great and cuts back on visit to tan by getting you browner quicker.....which is a good thing!! Slight tingle, but nothing you cant handle!! :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a change in my tan. But works fine and smells fine.</li>
            <li> Half the price and it works awesome! I would recommend this lotion. No after tan smell or red color to your skin after tanning. Lots of bronzers.</li>
            <li> I like  this lotion. It is a little warm but doesn&#x27;t have the extreme tingle and plus its made by designer skin</li>
            <li> It smells nice, works very well, leaves skin soft &amp; clean feeling.  No streeking or  heavy overlapping lines. Priced right!</li>
            <li> Great product! I love that this can be used for both indoor and outdoor tanning. The scent is not overwhelming. It really helps achieving a great tan in just a few visits to the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I really like this, and the scent.  The scent bothers my dog, but once it has soaked it he will come back around. I will buy again</li>
            <li> Lotion works great, love it, but not feeling the scent...that&#x27;s the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars....the scent gets on my nerves...love the scent of designer skin aphrodisiac..was hoping for something similar</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tanning lotion on the market!!! I use all of Designer skins products, but this one in my opinion, is the best of the best. This is the Mercedes Benz of tanning lotions. It is a high-end product and you really get what you pay for with this. I just love, love, love it!!! I highly recommend this to any fellow tanatics/tanaholics who feel they have reached their peak and feel they are not getting any tanner. Trust me on this :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. NEVER ever pay full price for this in a tanning salon!! They will rip you off and charge you over $100.00 for it. Amazon is the cheapest I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I saw results immediately. I would highly recommend to other buyers looking for a good tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I first saw this in the tanning salon. They were talking it up, and it was ONLY $100+. Whatever, love you Amazon. Anyway... I liked the smell, no weird feeling afterwards. I didn&#x27;t notice deep dark tan instantly. What I did notice is that I had a medical issue that I couldn&#x27;t tan for like 3 weeks, and even towards the end of that period the nurse ask me if I had been tanning! I was still so dark, when normaly after that time I would almost be back to my normal color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definately worth trying, just never buy from the salon.</li>
            <li> I have used this product 4 times and have already got a baseline tan.  I am a fair skinned of Irish decent male, and I have to agree this product is one of the best I have ever used.  It does not tingle and has a pleasant smell to it.  Would recommend this product for anyone wanting the next level of tanning</li>
            <li> I have been in the tanning field for 9 years. I swear by designer skin and once again this product didn&#x27;t let me down. It&#x27;s amazing and a great buy! Will buy again from the seller.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews thinking it was going to work good but I was not satisfied. I don&#x27;t really like this I&#x27;ve used it a few times and  it has not did anything for me. Smells great but tan wise not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a full 7 days and where I tan has awesome beds. NOTHING!! Do not buy this product online. Buy it where you tan so you know that it&#x27;s the real stuff. The old saying of &#x27;if it sounds too good to be true&#x27;, it&#x27;s a scam. That&#x27;s what this is. Do not buy!!! The only good thing about it is it smells good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product kept me at my current darkness.  You have to give it a day before it settles in and once it does its gorgeous color. Golden brown. There is a slight tingle feels good though.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time and in good condition. Love the product as well smells awesome and works awesome same as the one in the tanning salon just a lot more affordable on Amazon. I will be ordering it again through Amazon. Gave me color first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Great lotion! This is making my tanning sessions more effective. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Let me just start by saying... I&#x27;ve been around the block when it comes to tanning lotion, and this is IT. Perfect amount of tingling, especially for my fellow winter tanners--and the warming sensation is gentle, unlike most \\&quot;tinglers\\&quot; of its kind. So far as the bronzing goes, you really can&#x27;t beat it (my tan got noticeably darker from using it, darker than I thought it could be), and it has a nice apricot-y smell so you come out smelling less like burnt flesh and hair and more like a tropical garden. Oh and your skin will feel like absolute silk with no icky residue. By far the best tanning lotion I have ever used. The tanning salon I go to tries to charge $130 for the same bottle, so you&#x27;re in the right place!</li>
            <li> Ok, received the item, but I purposely looked for item sealed... It came in nice plastic bag, however&lt;br /&gt;You can peal open at one end, should be no problem until I took out lotion it was not sealed in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I figured it would come with some sort seal over cap or bottle.  Anyone can put lotion in a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to keep it and hopefully rely on his 100% authentic. Will give another rating after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Just if you are looking for a bottle sealed like I Was this is not it.</li>
            <li> So i heard great reviews online about this lotion and decided to give it a try.  I was trying to get back in the hang of using tingle lotions since those give you the best tan possible.  I decided to start with a warming lotiion so i could get used to it.  The obsidian has a lot of bronzer in it and didnt make me look orange or anything, nice scent to it, A LOT of moisture. However,I dont really feel the warming. I was a little disappointed and next time I think im just gonna go with a full on tingle like modern bombshell. Liked it just not enough to purchase again.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m a new mom who also works so I have little to no time to do things for myself.  I&#x27;ve never developed color this fast from tanning in a salon.  I researched several different \\&quot;top rated\\&quot; lotions and decided on this one.  The bronzers really do work and they are a great color - not the typical orangy tone you get from other bronzers or the streaky look.  I don&#x27;t wash my hands after I put it on and it never gives me the sunless tanner stain on my hands or between my fingers.  I will say that after I shower a few hours later or the next day I can see a hint of the color on my towel - it doesn&#x27;t stain or anything but it lets me know that it really does have the bronzing power it says it does.  With my past experience of tanning in salons, it usually takes about 2 weeks of tanning 5-6 times a week to develop a deep color.  I&#x27;m only able to tan about 3 times a week and I have developed noticable color in a week. I&#x27;ve also used this lotion when laying out by the pool.  It&#x27;s very reasonably priced, smells great, goes on smoothly and IT REALLY WORKS!  I also have been using a daily moisturizer called Ocean Potion - Ever Glow.  It has a hint of sunless tanner in it but I think it gives me more of a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; than added color.  I&#x27;m definitely happy with the combination of both of these lotions.</li>
            <li> This is the best bronzer I have ever used.  It smells good, feels smooth and leaves you with a nice bronze color so you won&#x27;t have to spend so much time in the tanning bed.  I definately recommend!!</li>
            <li> Good lotion. Wish it had better results though.</li>
            <li> The seller is awesome! I recieved Obsidian just 3 days after I ordered it. With ordering lotion online, I know there is always that worry that its fake, but this is 100% the real deal. After opening the package I had to check the scent, consistancy of the lotion, color (Almost every lotion will bronzers will be brown), everything was right on. I used it later that day in a regular bed and still noticed GREAT COLOR and I still smelt reallyyy good! :)  I used to work at a salon and I&#x27;ve used sample packs of this in the past but could never afford the retail price of this lotion. I&#x27;m so glad I found it on here at such a reasonable price and through a seller that was very prompt and great person to work with. I sent her a message with a few questions and she wrote back later that day. Overall: GREAT product! GREAT seller! I will be buying from this Amazon store again.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and this product defiantly helps me tan, in the booth and at the beach. I have never been as tan as I am when using this. It tingles.. A LOT but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.. I don&#x27;t recommend putting it on your face because the tingling becomes burning.. specially at the beach.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best tanning lotion I have ever used. It eliminated the number of times I needed to go tanning to about half of what I used to do because I would get so much color each time (even the first time) I went. It smells great and feels great on my skin. Very good stuff...top of the line!</li>
            <li> I like that this product warms the body, without leaving your skin feeling itchy and red.</li>
            <li> Delivery time fast. The product itself is ok, but definitely not worth the price. I will use it only if I don&#x27;t have anything better at hand. I prefer tingle myself and the best is mood by designer skin.</li>
            <li> Had my skin very bronze and everyone noticed! A lil tingle but not bad.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion expecting it to help me tan. My skin has a hard time tanning, I got this lotion because I thought it was strong enough to help me tan. This lotion honestly didn&#x27;t do much for me, i didn&#x27;t notice a difference between this lotion and a cheaper one i used.</li>
            <li> Will this give you an *immediate* dark color boost? No. But it most definitely will after 2 or 3 sessions. I was a little disappointed after the first time I used it, as I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my tan, but I&#x27;ve used it for 3 sessions now and I definitely see a difference now! It&#x27;s very moisturizing and feels great on the skin, and gives you a really nice, dark, brown tan after just a couple of visits. The warming effect is subtle and very pleasant; not at all like a tingle lotion. You will feel a warming sensation, but it doesn&#x27;t tingle or burn. It feels nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for 4 stars is the scent. Personally, I really don&#x27;t like the scent of any of the Designer Skin products I&#x27;ve used, and this &amp;#34;Caribbean Mist&amp;#34; is the worst one. I love Designer Skin and I have many of their products, but I just really don&#x27;t like fruity scents and that&#x27;s what their stuff is. In my opinion, this is really unpleasant smelling, but that&#x27;s just a personal preference and it doesn&#x27;t keep me from using it. I&#x27;m sure plenty of people would love the smell. It only smells coming out of the bottle, I really don&#x27;t notice it once I put it on and rub it in, so it&#x27;s not a big deal. But, be advised, if you&#x27;re not generally a fan of the Designer Skin scents, you probably *really* won&#x27;t like this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s A Good Lotion But Definitely NOT The Best I&#x27;ve Ever Used</li>
            <li> I usually take a long time to tan even with other lotions. After giving this about two weeks I was dark. I do not regret buying it and will purchase this one again. Everyone at my salon loves it, too.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for some time.  Used many lotions.  Read the reviews on this and have to say.  It&#x27;s great.  Soaks right in, pleasant smell, not overpowering.  No just been tanning smell to this.  I do get tons of compliments on my tan when I use this.  Slight tingle at the end of tanning, nothing crazy.  I keep this on after tanning for at least 8 hours to get the bronzing and when I shower I use Hemp lotion afterwards and it prolongs my tan.  Will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 5/1/2011:  Don&#x27;t know why I went off to a few others in between this review, they were not as good as this product.  Now I won&#x27;t be fooled by the new hype on other lotions.  I will be sticking with this one for as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> i saw all of the hype about this lotion and i HAD to try it out for myself.  wellllllll......i put it on for the first time, and i must say it DEFINETLY IS A TINGLER LOTION.  DO NOT PUT THIS ON YOUR FACE!!!!!!  after about 5 minutes of me putting on  the lotion, i could feel how HOT i was getting.  i was sweating so badly, every part of my body was heating up like it was in an oven, and this was happening before i even got in the tanning bed!!!!!  i could tell a big difference though after tanning.  my skin is silky smooth and im already a little darker after just two uses.  great stuff here!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion and would definitely buy again! it feels so silky and smooth when applied. It feels warm against the skin while tanning but no burn or tingle. Smells good before and doesn&#x27;t acquire weird after tanning smell. The bronzers are great and don&#x27;t appear orange just  a nice warm tan!</li>
            <li> I bought this after I spent two months in bootcamp without being able to tan. This stuff is amazing! It helped me regain my color so quickly and so far I&#x27;ve kept it pretty well. It also smells amazing, no gross after-tan  smell at all. I highly recommend buying this from amazing though because my tanning salon sells it for close to $130! My military paycheck definitely cannot afford that!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I like obsidian and luminary the same. It gives me a good brown tan and the warm feeling is great. FYI, don&#x27;t put on your face. It burns!! I keep switching back and forth between obsidian and luminary because they both wok about the same. The last time I used this one I was also going to the beach every weekend while tanning during the week so I was so dark!!! I&#x27;d like to think this boosted my natural tan. Now it is winter and I am hoping for a dark brown like that again. My luminary just ran out so I bought this. If I am feeling ambitious, I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff it helps get the tan faster with the 30x bronzer in it. Plus it has a sun stay Hydration that helps with moisturizing. I like it also with the warm feeling u get from it.</li>
            <li> Designer skin has always had great products. yyyy yyyy yyyy yy yy yy yy yy yy yy yy uyb yy</li>
            <li> It smells amazing!! More than 20x bronzing is hard to find and this has 30x. It makes me tan faster in less amount of times than any other tanning lotion I have used, and for my very pale and freckly skin type : less times in the bed the better.</li>
            <li> Love this product - works awesome and the bronzers in it are great too. I&#x27;ve used it indoor and outdoor with no problems! And I&#x27;m super tan :)</li>
            <li> Love this warming sensation lotion! I bought mine from solarium and it&#x27;s 100% authentic! It&#x27;s no one and done lotion it does take a few sessions to see results but they&#x27;re good when they come in. I like the scent, and the feel is super silky. Overall happy with this product</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for 2 years now, before tanning I am very pale, and pastey... After a summer I am DARK, DARK, DARK... I seem to burn with cheap lotions but this, NEVER... I am in LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li> BEST BRONZER I HAVE TRIED SO FAR!!!!!! WORTH EVERY PENNY! don&#x27;t like the smell that much, but I have been tanning 5-6 yrs and really have gotten sick to the same smells being put into tanning lotions. they say its like citrus or something, but it just smells like tanning to me</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter worked for a tan company in St. Louis that tried to tell her this wasn&#x27;t the same as the OVER PRICED EXACT SAME bottle they were selling! That is a lie and a joke!  Pacific Beach STL sells this for $120 a botle...just one of the MANY ways they do BAD BUSINESS!</li>
            <li> If you can afford it, Obsidian is great. Of course, if you buy it at the tanning salon it will cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> I Am Not Happy With Product At AlL. This Product Although \\&quot;Sealed\\&quot; Is Not The Real Thing. I Own A Bottle Purchased And The Salon, And When Compared...Sadly, Not The Same Product!!! Very Unsatisfied With What I Recieved. The Consistency Is Not The Same and The Smell Is Off. I Will Not Be purchasing Again.</li>
            <li> three stars...it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with this product than any of the others I have used.  I am not darker nor does it make my after tanning skin scent better.  Nothing negative other than it does not actually do ALL it says it can do.  Not worth the bigger expense in comparison to less inexpensive products.</li>
            <li> This lotion will get you tan, and if you&#x27;re looking for it online like I was, because its like 140 $ in the tanning salons, I&#x27;d recommend a different smelling lotion though. This stuff smells kind musty? Musky? I don&#x27;t know what word I&#x27;m looking for, but the smell sticks around a loonng while afterwards, and I could just not stand it so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I figured it was time to get out of the rut and try a different Designer Skin lotion so I ordered a bottle of Obsidian.  Overall I am pleased with the results but was surprised when my skin began to tingle and slightly burn within a minute of putting it on.  I either missed that in other reviews or no one else experienced it.  Once I finish this bottle I&#x27;ll switch back to Black 20x or a Jwoww.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion and would recommend to a friend :)</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome.  Doesn&#x27;t have tingle,but a more gentle warming sensation.  I tan pretty much every day and I could tell a difference after just one use.  No slimy feeling or nasty smell either!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve only gone to the tanning bed three times and I&#x27;m seriously three shades darker! The product smells good and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and so soft! I definitely recommend this to anyone and will be buying it again! AND a huge plus is the price, compared to the $120.00 price at the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few lotions over the years and this is by far the best one. Goes on silky smooth, not greasy. Soaks right in. And it smells so good. LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> great product, arrived quickly, fabulous price. Cheaper than buying from a salon. I would recommend this product to others. It has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m satisfied with the color of my skin after having used this product but if you don&#x27;t already know it is hot and if you are a guy learn from my mistake and DO NOT rub this stuff on your um, ball and chain. I let out a shriek in the tanning bed and had to grab my hand towel to take it off.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried so many tanning products...but no more. this one is the best i&#x27;ve ever tried. you are brown, not orange. It has a great smell and great lasting power. glad i made this purchase!!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing!  I purchased this lotion because I am getting married very soon and I didn&#x27;t want to look like a ghost up at the altar.  I am VERY fair-skinned (with freckles) and I usually have a very hard time getting a tan.  This was one of the first lotions that came up when I googled \\&quot;best tanning lotions\\&quot;. I basically bought it on a whim after that, because I wanted to get it really fast and I didn&#x27;t have a lot of time to research and compare other lotions.  I thought the price was fair and it had a good rating, so I went for it.  I am SO GLAD I bought this stuff.  It usually takes me at LEAST 10-15 tanning sessions to build up any kind of base color.  I used this one time and saw a difference in color right out of the bed.  After only 4 tans, people started saying, \\&quot;You look dark!\\&quot; I have NEVER heard that from anyone in my life! I&#x27;ve been to the tanning bed probably a total of 10 times since buying this product and I have to say this is the most color I have ever had in my life.  I also want to mention that after I had already purchased it, I went back and noticed the \\&quot;warm volcanic minerals\\&quot; on the bottle and I got kind of nervous because I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin (eczema) and I&#x27;m allergic to many different chemicals.  It&#x27;s always a gamble for me when buying new skin &amp; beauty products.  I basically expect everything I&#x27;ve never used before to break me out.  I was nervous the first time I used this lotion.  I felt a slight warming sensation ONLY the first time I used it, and even then, it&#x27;s barely worth mentioning because it was so mild.  Every time after then, I felt no sensation, and this lotion has not caused my skin to break out AT ALL.  Which is a miracle for me and my skin. I LOVE this stuff and I will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> I will forever purchase my designer skin this way. I have been dying to try obsidian but couldn&#x27;t justify spending that much at the salon. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this way. Luminary is next for me!</li>
            <li> Great lotion fast shipping  I haven&#x27;t used it yet because I been really busy, but I hear great reviews on it... I can&#x27;t wait to use it it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This is by far THE Best Tanning lotion I have ever used! (And I have tried many different kinds at all different price points).  Gets you super Dark!  I noticed a big difference with just one use, and I had already been tanning with other lotions for 2 weeks.  It smells good for a tanning lotion; you don&#x27;t smell the greatest after tanning in general but the sent of the lotion was good.  My fiancé even said he liked the smell of it.  The best part about this lotion, is that even though it gets you super dark, it does not turn your hands the least bit orange!  No Orange &#x3D; Happy Katie!  It is for sure worth the money!</li>
            <li> This works just like it is advertised and $100.00 less than the tanning salon.  It smells much better than most lotions.</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle thinking it was going to awesome at $100+ dollors. Not worth that much. Its good but it wasn&#x27;t for me. I am already tan and I wanted to get darker. I did not feel like i was getting the tan i wanted with this. It dosent have a bronzer in it. The texture is weird to me. Its very creamy and goes in to the skin. I would recommond this for someone that is just starting to tan that is not wanting a bronzer.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this lotion, I&#x27;ve never bought lotion online before and I am very particular about my tanning lotion. This lotion smells very good, it kind of smells like grapefruit. After tanning I felt it did it&#x27;s job and then some, I could feel it working. It&#x27;s NOT reddening lotion though by any means (I HATE THAT KIND). Feel free to apply liberally but make sure you rub it in all the way otherwise you feel an intense warming sensation.</li>
            <li> I tried Obsidian for the first time today, and it worked amazing! I used one of those &amp;#34;tanning tattoos&amp;#34; to measure my tan, and I noticed a HUGE difference with just one use. And it has a very nice smell too it unlike some lotions, and it still smells wonderful well after tanning. Would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a good bronzing lotion. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Barely noticed any color after the first application. Totally not worth the money I paid for it.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I heard so many great things about this lotion, but I was disappointed in it&#x27;s performance.  I tan very easily, &amp; this lotion seemed to not get me very tan at all.  I just finished up the last of the bottle, &amp; throughout my use, I just saw a slight color from time to time.  I don&#x27;t know if it is because I bought it online, but I heard buying online can sometimes be skeptical.  Good luck if you buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Smells like a tropical drink! :) Leaves skin smooth and bronzed! Does have a little heat to it, but i barely noticed, except on my face, since i am used to hot action lotions. HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
            <li> The product is not all that it is made up to be.  The vendors was very difficult to communicate with.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. Lotion is just like the one in the salon.  Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Factory sealed and the real deal. They say to be aware that there are generics on the internet but this is genuine. Probably the best lotion out there right now, especially if you like the warming sensation (not a tingler).</li>
            <li> Pretty good! One of the best that I have used. I like that I got it for over half the price that they were selling for in the salons!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!!! At the tanning salon I go to they charge over $100 for the same exact bottle... It works great and II have a nice bronze tan as expected.... Thanks &amp;#34;Designer Skin&amp;#34; !!!!!</li>
            <li> Used in indoor tanning places! Smells great! Gives great color also! Highly recommend and was the lotion is says on the bottle</li>
            <li> Smells good. Makes my tush tickle for about 20 minutes after tanning. Overall thumbs up and would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I first bought this lotion last year and I really liked it. It went on smooth and showed results very quickly. I reordered it this year and it still works kinda but it&#x27;s different. It still goes on smooth, but after being exposed to the lights of the tanning bed the lotion starts to bead up. Later on it will litteraly rub off in orange peals. I don&#x27;t know why it does this. It may be an old bottle or something. It still gives some result but it makea me feel dirty.</li>
            <li> This is my oldest daughter&#x27;s favorite lotion, &amp; she gets DARK!!! I ordered it as a gift for her, and the price was nice. It took a bit long than my other lotions, to reach me...but I had made a mistake in choosing my address label before changing it to my daughter&#x27;s name...so hopefully next time it will be faster&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for years, most recently at ZoomTan here in Florida. I purchased the JWoww Private Reserve (gold bottle) from the salon and paid the ridiculous retail price for it. I was extremely happy with that lotion, but I ran through it quick so I decided to try another lotion that the salon sells, but to buy it on Amazon. I&#x27;m not sure if the lotion that I got wasn&#x27;t the real deal Designer Skin Obsidian, but I was heavily heavily disappointed with what I got in the mail. I used it for the first time a few months ago, and didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference at all. I actually thought that I was less tan than before going into the salon. I thought maybe it was a fluke so I continued to use the lotion and the results have continued to disappoint. The color that I get isn&#x27;t tan, it isn&#x27;t orange either but maybe a better way to describe it would be that there just isn&#x27;t any color gained. I&#x27;m Native American and I tan very very easily in the sun and in the tanning bed, with or without lotion, so the fact that using an expensive brand lotion in a tanning bed didn&#x27;t give results blows my mind. The lotion does go on easily, and it does smell pretty good compared to other lotions, but I would rather take more time applying lotion and smell strange after than to smell good and see no results. Another negative to this lotion is the way my legs have started to look after a few months of use, I&#x27;m an even tanner and I have never seen my skin spot up, but this lotion has caused my skin to take on the strangest look I&#x27;ve ever seen, almost looking like I got a bad spray tan with the way the color was along my legs. The rest of my body was fine besides my arms, and I shave both my arms and my legs so I&#x27;m thinking that had something to do with the spotting, but again something I&#x27;ve never experienced with another lotion. Overall I&#x27;m regretting buying this lotion and I just placed an order today for a new JWoww Private Reserve so that I can try to get the tan I use to have back, I miss it!!!!!</li>
            <li> great product, loved the way it made my skin feel</li>
            <li> Love thos lotion! Works great. A warming sensation but not overbearing. Definitely the real thing too and I was skeptical at such a low price. Will buy again. My only complaint wS a cpl gemstones fell off before I received it and the lil string thing was broken.</li>
            <li> Best Tanning lotion I have used!!</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I will ever use in tanning bed.. I love this product.. Gets me very dark....</li>
            <li> I have used several of these premium lotion products and this one is clearly the best. It&#x27;s the best combo of performance, feel and smell there is. It does have a slight tingle to it so if you would not like this go with Designer skin&#x27;s Black instead. These are the two best products on the market PERIOD.</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel silky smooth when using this lotion to to mention the great tan you get!  Love the amazon prices.. Makes these lotions affordable!</li>
            <li> The lady at my tanning salon tried to get me to purchase this from the store but it was $85 (ON SALE!).  Needless to say I was not willing to pay that.  I will be purchasing this again (online) once mine runs out.  It works great and it&#x27;s much more reasonably priced.  I&#x27;m happy it could be shipped quickly as well so I didn&#x27;t have to wait long to receive it.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion has a nice smell but does not have near the bronzing action that I expected. I have used indoor tanning equipment and lotions for the past 24 years so I have used an array of products. This is a good product BUT I have used much lower priced lotions by Designer Skin that have had more bronzing power.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order this product from Amazon, but I used to work at a tanning salon and it definitely got GREAT reviews. It has a ton of bronzers and it gives you great color. The bottle is HUGE and since it&#x27;s silicone based, it spreads and will last a long time.. A little goes a long way. It is a warming lotion though, which some people don&#x27;t like. It doesn&#x27;t tingle and some people (like me) don&#x27;t even feel its warming effects. In salons, this lotion is $110+, this is a PHENOMENAL deal! It is a great lotion, my personal favorite, and my recommendation for anyone wanting beautiful color!</li>
            <li> I used to work at a tanning salon and I only used this lotion. I was terrified to buy online because of the rumors but I could not afford the salon prices anymore. This is the real deal though! Smells and feels how it is suppose to and it was filled to the top. Came wrapped in plastic, unopened. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Sealed, smells great, and CHEAPER for the SAME product at a salon. I 1st saw this at my salon for 125$!!!! Aint no way I was going to pay for that. Same exact product, authentic as can be, for less. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> My all time favorite tanning lotion...nothing beats the color it gives me...love how it feels on my skin..by far the very best lotuin I have ever used</li>
            <li> Love the designer skin Obsidian. After my first use I notice a more golden tan. Smells good also.</li>
            <li> this stuff isn&#x27;t the worst and it is not the best product i have tried. arrived really quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li> Smells great. It will have to be washed off with a cool shower since it&#x27;s heated. I made the mistake of taking a hot shower with this lotion on and it BURNS. It gives you a great even tan. No orange coloring whatsoever. Designer skin products are my favorite!!</li>
            <li> Great product...its exactly what I needed...will be ordering two bottles this time instead of one.  Came sealed and brand new..Also arrived early.  Great all the way around</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have a tan at all you may be impressed with this product, otherwise don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> You would think that this lotion is amazing and makes your tanning experience a euphoric experience from other listed reviews and the cost in salons.  My personal experience and I&#x27;m a avid tanner.... skip on it.  Its not worth half the money even here on amazon. Sorry to say so but I just don&#x27;t like it.  It did absolutely nothing for my tan... No boost, no amazing color, no wonderful smell... NOT a thing. I couldn&#x27;t stand that I still got that funky after tan smell and as for the warming factor... I waited and it never really came for me as other people have described. Find another product, Designer Skin just didn&#x27;t do a good job with this one.</li>
            <li> I used to be a die-hard Designer Skin Luminary fan but I got bored of the same old thing and tried something new and I am SO glad that I did! I love this lotion and would buy it over Luminary any day. I like the scent, the warming effect isn&#x27;t too overwhelming, but most importantly it helps me get amazing color. I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it</li>
            <li> I have been tanning on and off for years and have tried them all.  I did read prior reviews and I agree the smell is great, the color is noticable after just one use and my skin is silky smooth. I recall some reviews mentioning a tingle or it was hot, but I disagree.  My favorite thus far.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy. Price is decent, delivery was fast and packaging great.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and is exactly the same product as in the salon&#x27;s. I have had no problem with it and would totally buy it again</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t go out of my way to write reviews (sorry sellers), but I honestly couldn&#x27;t wait to write a review for this lotion. Where to start...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the smell is amazing. It smells fruity before you get into the bed AND after you get out of the bed. I&#x27;ve used every lotion under the sun (pun intended) and have never come across one that covers up the &amp;#34;burnt skin&amp;#34; smell your skin has after tanning, but this lotion seems to do the trick! My boyfriend didn&#x27;t even know I&#x27;d been tanning (he really hates the way my skin smells after I tan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it goes on smooth and leaves your skin feeling soft and silky, not oily. Again, I&#x27;ve used many lotions and most leave my skin oily and almost &amp;#34;wet-like&amp;#34; after I put them on. This one didn&#x27;t. It left my skin feeling much like a baby&#x27;s behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, it has a mild tingle. Not strong enough to leave my skin burning hours after tanning, but just strong enough so that I am warm when I&#x27;m in the bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, I was darker after like, two tanning sessions. That speaks for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars! Would DEFINITELY recommend this lotion to anyone looking to try something new.</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; way below tan salon retail smells like men&#x27;s cologne</li>
            <li> One of the best lotions that I have ever used you get the color it promises loved it</li>
            <li> My son loves it. Never burns in the sun angel bed as long as he uses this.  Loaded with silicone so not my &amp;#34;ideal natural product&amp;#34; but it does what it is intended and I hope we get out of this phase soon.</li>
            <li> Was everything I expected it to be and shipped quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Packed and sealed in plastic sealed around the bottle to assure it wasn&#x27;t opened.</li>
            <li> With this great lotion, my tan has appeared to enhance. It also smells delicious! I will order again sometime. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Was gone within a month. This lotion keeps your skin feeling amazing and gets you that dark tan you love.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned with freckles but have tanned well before with less expensive lotion. I really didn&#x27;t see anything spectacular out of this lotion. With all of the rave reviews I expected it to be better than my $15 (price on Amazon) bottle of lotion. I have heard that fake lotions are sometimes sold on the internet, so maybe this isn&#x27;t much good because it was a fake? It smells nice, and does have a nice texture, but I bought it for the tanning results. I doubt that I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Deep dark tan let my skin feeling soft and not dry</li>
            <li> Pretty good, good color received.  The smell is like others, nothing special about this one.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! Everything about it!!!! It smells great and really gets you darker than other lotions I&#x27;ve tried. Even works when I put it on and I go out and do yard work! Cant beat the price.. it sells for $100 at the salon i go to. Definitely recommend! !</li>
            <li> purchased this online because the tanning salon I patronized sold it for much more. It worked well and accelerated my tan as promised. it has a pleasing smell and won&#x27;t leave you streaky. only complaint is the shape of the bottom makes it hard to get every last drop out of the container!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few tanning bronzers over time, and this one remains the best. Nice dark tanning with longevity. Doesn&#x27;t wear away in a couple of days like some other bronzers. The price on this was extremely competitive!!!</li>
            <li> I am so pale and can never get a tan but after only a few times using this stuff I got such great color!</li>
            <li> Great product, Great Transaction!</li>
            <li> I was overall very pleased with this product. I had read other reviews about how it burns when you put it on. With that in mind I was still kinda shocked by how much it burned (I started by putting it on my face, I thought I was having an allergic reaction) but once you realize that that&#x27;s just how it feels on your skin, I got used to it. I was wanting to get dark relatively quickly (over a few months) for graduation/photos and this did the trick.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all and it stinks! I didnt notice any difference in my tan at all. wont buy again</li>
            <li> I Have tried this lotion in a sample and Loved it so when I seen it on here so cheap I had to buy it .......Thank You SOOOOO Much</li>
            <li> Really good color, really nice smell. Its the first warming lotion I&#x27;ve ever used not a tingle, it&#x27;s really nice in the winter.  Over all really nice and can get really nice color.</li>
            <li> its great give u a nice brown color but feels too hot after tan but is a great product so a recomend to buy anyway....</li>
            <li> After trying a sample of this lotion at the salon I was very excited to find it on Amazon for such a great price. However, when I received the lotion the bottle was nearly open and it appeared as though it had been used with lotion smeared all over the top of the bottle. But perhaps the worst part was the smell. It has a ridiculously strong peach smell that is nowhere near the smell of the sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered several tanning lotions from Amazon and this is the first one that has been a let down. Hopefully one of my coworkers will be able to handle the strong smell because I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product and I highly re.comend it. covers well and it makes your skin soft.I have used three bottles of this lotion.</li>
            <li> ive been using thsi product forever and cant wait for it to make me darker once again! obsidian is truely a great bronzer</li>
            <li> bought this for my BF and it leaves his skin flaky N peels off some stuff... it smells ok but def not one of my fav for him.. he doesn&#x27;t really like it either...</li>
            <li> The best tanning lotion! Worth every penny. Pleasant citrus scent.  Consistency is thick and silky.  By far the best tanning product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion! Ive only used it one time with a level 4 bed and it worked the first time. It came sealed. It smells kinda weird later but its tolerable. The warm sensation is not bad at all either. Just perfect. Will buy again :)  UPDATE:: So its been about a month since I purchased this lotion. Ive been using it about four times a week in a level 3 and 4 bed. It seems to have just stopped working. Im not near as dark as I was last year using my Luminous product. Ive noticed too that it does flake a little, just a little. Its good lotion, just not the best. I hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> It really helped take my color to the next level.it smells great even after u get out the tanning bed. It does have a slight warming feeling but its never all over just in certain spot.will definitely use again.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about ordering this online. I&#x27;ve worked at a tanning salon for years and I had always heard horror stories about customers buying their lotion online only to find that it was a knock off.  But I thought hey, I can always get my money back so I gave it a chance, I&#x27;m glad I did! The lotion was sealed, and I compared it to the lotion at the store I work at.  Its the exact same. Even though I work at the salon I still spend $$$ for it, which I won&#x27;t be doing anymore; next time I need lotion, I&#x27;m coming right back here!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did! This is the worst tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. No results at all. I&#x27;ve already purchased a bottle of what I was using previously (Ed Hardy Body Shots). This was a complete waste of money, I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It works wonders!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this lotion before. I used to work at a tanning salon so I&#x27;m aware of what the manufactures packaging should look like for this lotion. The bottle was in some plastic wrap while the one from the manufacturer comes in a hard plastic package. That was a little sketchy to me, but the lotion smells and feels like the true lotion so I&#x27;m overall pleased. This is my favorite tanning lotion, smells perfect and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Has a slight warming feeling but that goes away after about 2 uses.</li>
