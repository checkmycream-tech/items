            <li>This product gives your hair such great volume!</li>
            <li>but this bottle does it more in a thicker amount.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE and swear by this product.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love love LOVE the root pump.</li>

            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this SO much..</li>
            <li>It truly does wonders for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Its a tall can, so beware - you may have to adjust some shelving in your medicine cabinet for it to fit.</li>
            <li>prefer the slightly messy undone look, &amp; this product is perfect for that.</li>

            <li>Have FUN with your hair!</li>
            <li>You do get big sexy hair with lots of body, love this product!</li>
            <li>This mousse gives my flay, heavy hair volume, and smells incredible.  </li>
            <li>I love my Big Sexy and I received it in a timely FASHION.</li>
            <li>Love this, new to trying it and would recommend.</li>
            <li>This product works really well and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This one doesnt give the most volume I&#x27;ve ever had, but it feels so soft!</li>
            <li>After the first try with this product,  I saw my hair have volume and movement, in the style that I created in the morning!</li>
            <li>My hair is super fine, and I have tried many different products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent more money on high end hair products, this is definitely cheaper and works great!!!</li>
            <li>It really works well in my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>if I put just the right amount, I get a nice lift - I&#x27;m not amazed by this product and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again because the price definitely outweighed the benefit.</li>
            <li>Part your hair where you want volume and spray right on the roots.</li>
            <li>if you use it right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having trouble finding any honest vendors of this product!</li>
            <li>Easy to spray on roots and even if you get busy doing something</li>
            <li>(One way you can tell is that a new barcode sticker is placed over the original barcode on the can.)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t discovered big sexy hair products, you should.&lt;br /&gt;Root</li>
            <li>The most recent can I bought was just like this.</li>
            <li>I have tried many &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; brands such as Sebastian, Paul Mitchell, Redkin, but they did not provide what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Love this mousse, only one that I have found that does not flake.  </li>
            <li>It gives good volume without making the hair stiff.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>I think the &amp;#34;Plus&amp;#34; is a bit much for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I really don&#x27;t like the fragrance --</li>
            <li>it really helps with volume.</li>
            <li>It works,and you don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>My daughter that has straight hair uses it to hold curls.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really see a difference when using this.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mousse, but when you buy it at a drugstore (or through a third party vendor like Sexy Hair seems to be using here), the product is usually expired and comes out as a liquid rather than a foam.</li>
            <li>I have very long, fine hair that lacks volume</li>
            <li>It is so great you can mist hair on the second day with water &amp; it will fluff back up again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can say my hair looks pretty and alive again.</li>
            <li>Less is more.</li>
            <li>I am going to try to use a round brush when blow-drying and see if that enhances the results, other than that it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I really like that I can spray this moose directly on my roots.</li>
            <li>I have used other products similar but always go back to the Sexy hair Big Sexy Root Pump Plus Mousse.</li>
            <li>I could hardly LIVE without this hair product (ha) ...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it &amp; the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>The product itself does exactly what is needed... gives an extra UMPH to your roots, for a natural volumizing look.</li>
            <li>Too heavy for my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>Part your hair in key spots (crown and top for example) and squirt a little to the roots and then spread out a bit from there.</li>
            <li>I did the mousse would not firm up, and does not give hair the volume I expect from this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so self conscious about it.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that really gives me volume and gets me compliments.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a solid product for a reasonable price .</li>
            <li>usually the spray will be a fine mist</li>
            <li>I now use it regularly with consistent and universal results.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>It is the only thing that will give my fine blonde hair texture and volume without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Even after shaking each can for more than 60 seconds, the mousse comes out of the can as a wet mess!  </li>
            <li>Also be careful not to apply to much of this product.</li>
            <li>I prefer this volumizing product over others, and the fact that it&#x27;s in a spray form makes it so much more convenient and less messy than working mousse in with your hands.  </li>
            <li>Amazon refunded the price for the product, though I could not ship it back, which I felt bad about (something about security issues), so the customer service from Amazon was great.  </li>
            <li>I very thin fine hair and this gives my hair a real boost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Big Sexy Hair root pump plus for a couple of years now and just recently started ordering on Amazon to save a little money (about 5 dollars less than what I would otherwise be paying in stores).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a female with naturally thinning grey hair which turned to helmet-head in humidity or generally by the end of any day, no matter how I styled.</li>
            <li>Not sticky or heavy, and no weird smell.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, but my hair has very fine strands, so it often looks very thin.</li>
            <li>Thin fine hair here..</li>
            <li>This product really helps give it a little extra boost.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive mousses but keep coming back to this.  </li>

            <li> the support and lift is still there when you blow dry.</li>
            <li> However, these bottles are the small size, NOT the large size like I usually get</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is the the volume doesn&#x27;t seem to last through the day.</li>
            <li> It keeps my short curly hair styled perfectly by a few pumps worked through the roots with fingers &amp; voila&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This stuff does the job when applied to wet hair.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> Plus a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other kinds and they don&#x27;t come close to giving me the volume this one does.</li>
            <li> I eliminated other products like moose, setting gels, hair spray and worry.</li>
            <li> i usually like this product, but the one I received from Amazon seems different.</li>
            <li> and it gets a little dry</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for people with thin and/or flat hair.</li>
            <li> I usually put three big globs on for my hair which is a little longer than mid-length.</li>
            <li> I moved to Louisiana from California where the humidity ruins my &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m knocking it down a star.</li>
            <li> It does not give much volume and makes my hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry anymore about the limp hair day after washing.</li>
            <li> No more..  </li>
            <li> I ordered them because they turned out to be a bit cheaper than they were where I usually get them in store.</li>

            <li> Sprayer broken.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to thin to spray into your hand</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I very thin fine hair and this gives my hair a real boost. It&#x27;s my favorite styling product.</li>
            <li> Great product for fine hair</li>
            <li> Nice volume and body product. Smell isn&#x27;t overpowering or potent. Plus a little goes a long way! Will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This mousse gives your hair a lot of volume.  I usually put three big globs on for my hair which is a little longer than mid-length. It is the best mousse for volume that I have used from the various products that I have tried. I also use a root boost for additional volume. But if I just use this product plus a conditioner and shine product, the volume and conditioning is very good too. I really love the way this product makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> My favorite mousse. I&#x27;ve tried other kinds and they don&#x27;t come close to giving me the volume this one does.</li>
            <li> Helps with volume but seems sticky and reduces shine</li>
            <li> I ordered six cans of the Root Pump Plus, and none of the cans are useable.  Even after shaking each can for more than 60 seconds, the mousse comes out of the can as a wet mess!  It is supposed to be a firm mousse texture, but no matter how much shaking I did the mousse would not firm up, and does not give hair the volume I expect from this product.  Amazon refunded the price for the product, though I could not ship it back, which I felt bad about (something about security issues), so the customer service from Amazon was great.  I will stick to buying the Root Pump from my local store, though.</li>
            <li> Works great on my fine hair!</li>
            <li> Thin fine hair here.. Works great! Not sticky residue and does seem to plump my hair up a bit!</li>
            <li> Sprayer broken. The only way to use this is to spray into the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go a day without it. I look like a different person because of this stuff. Love it!</li>
            <li> I had a stylist use this on me over 10 years ago.. and it left an impression on me for life. Its a tall can, so beware - you may have to adjust some shelving in your medicine cabinet for it to fit. The product itself does exactly what is needed... gives an extra UMPH to your roots, for a natural volumizing look. LOVE LOVE LOVE this SO much.. that I just bought a trial size. ;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I know just how to use this product yet.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t discovered big sexy hair products, you should.&lt;br /&gt;Root pump is fab. It keeps my short curly hair styled perfectly by a few pumps worked through the roots with fingers &amp; voila&#x27;. I look like an expensive salon did a Meg Ryan hairdo.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the slightly messy undone look, &amp; this product is perfect for that. It is so great you can mist hair on the second day with water &amp; it will fluff back up again.&lt;br /&gt;I keep a larger size canister @ home, a smaller one for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Of all the styling products you could buy, big sexy hair has the best. I also love their spray &amp; play &amp; their newest product, push up. Have FUN with your hair!</li>
            <li> Does nothing to my long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure about this product - if I put to much on, my hair feels gross - if I put just the right amount, I get a nice lift - I&#x27;m not amazed by this product and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again because the price definitely outweighed the benefit.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mousse, but when you buy it at a drugstore (or through a third party vendor like Sexy Hair seems to be using here), the product is usually expired and comes out as a liquid rather than a foam. The most recent can I bought was just like this. (One way you can tell is that a new barcode sticker is placed over the original barcode on the can.) Disappointing. I&#x27;m having trouble finding any honest vendors of this product!</li>
            <li> Great product for your money!! I love it!! I&#x27;ve spent more money on high end hair products, this is definitely cheaper and works great!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I was worried it wouldnt be as big as I hoped it would. But it was just the size I needed without the expense of buying it in stores.</li>
            <li> I could hardly LIVE without this hair product (ha) ... It is very good for fine hair.  I have used other products similar but always go back to the Sexy hair Big Sexy Root Pump Plus Mousse.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.  I moved to Louisiana from California where the humidity ruins my &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; every morning before I get to work.  No more..  This is the best I&#x27;ve found.  I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive mousses but keep coming back to this.  The price is good and so is the product.</li>
            <li> Great for lifting at the roots! Easy to spray on roots and even if you get busy doing something and it gets a little dry the support and lift is still there when you blow dry.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair has gotten thinner and thinner. I&#x27;m so self conscious about it. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that really gives me volume and gets me compliments. You need to use it correctly, though. Most mousse you shake and then spray into your hand to apply. Not with this mousse. Part your hair where you want volume and spray right on the roots. It&#x27;s to thin to spray into your hand and it won&#x27;t work like it&#x27;s meant to. Let me know if it works for you?</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected it to be.The product work really well if you use it right. I have a lot of hair, but my hair has very fine strands, so it often looks very thin. This product really helps give it a little extra boost. The only complaint that I have is the the volume doesn&#x27;t seem to last through the day. I am going to try to use a round brush when blow-drying and see if that enhances the results, other than that it is a great product.  Also be careful not to apply to much of this product.</li>
            <li> I have dead straight flat hair. So Ive used so many root boosters. This one doesnt give the most volume I&#x27;ve ever had, but it feels so soft! My hair feels wonderful when full of product, and that is why I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this, new to trying it and would recommend.</li>
            <li> This product gives your hair such great volume! I use it everday!</li>
            <li> This product works really well and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This stuff does the job when applied to wet hair.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair and then wear rollers to bed. I don&#x27;t have to worry anymore about the limp hair day after washing. I&#x27;ll be using this stuff until it doesn&#x27;t exist anymore. Since I&#x27;m 67 I&#x27;ll cease to exist before this stuff! LOL  :-)</li>
            <li> usually the spray will be a fine mist but this bottle does it more in a thicker amount. I just spray it in my hand then spread it around on my hair. Defeats the purpose of the spray but the product itself works well still</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE and swear by this product. I&#x27;ve been using Big Sexy Hair root pump plus for a couple of years now and just recently started ordering on Amazon to save a little money (about 5 dollars less than what I would otherwise be paying in stores). When applying it at the roots, it provides incredible lift and volume.</li>
            <li> This is my stand by for Mousse.  I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without it.  It really works well in my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> I think the &amp;#34;Plus&amp;#34; is a bit much for me</li>
            <li> Loved it nice light product for your hair, not sticky just keep your hair nice and bodied! Works perfect for a nice curl too !</li>
            <li> The best mousse I can get my hands on...I have tried many &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; brands such as Sebastian, Paul Mitchell, Redkin, but they did not provide what I was looking for. The anti-humidity aspect of this product is on key, and the volumizing properties are apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I really don&#x27;t like the fragrance -- so I&#x27;m knocking it down a star. Otherwise, a solid product for a reasonable price .</li>
            <li> I use this every time I wash my hair before I blow dry, it helps me go an extra day or 2 without having to wash and look greasy. It give me great volume at the root!</li>
            <li> Great purchase!  Pumps up roots just enough on my fine/thick hair.</li>
            <li> Whatever makes this work, it WORKS for me! I&#x27;m a female with naturally thinning grey hair which turned to helmet-head in humidity or generally by the end of any day, no matter how I styled. After the first try with this product,  I saw my hair have volume and movement, in the style that I created in the morning! I now use it regularly with consistent and universal results. I eliminated other products like moose, setting gels, hair spray and worry. I can say my hair looks pretty and alive again. Yea! Recommendation: Part your hair in key spots (crown and top for example) and squirt a little to the roots and then spread out a bit from there. This is not recommended to squirt in your hands and then rub in like a moose. Less is more.</li>
            <li> it really helps with volume.</li>
            <li> Used this for a while now.  Best I have found for this purpose.</li>
            <li> i usually like this product, but the one I received from Amazon seems different. It does not give much volume and makes my hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as expected.  Perfect condition.</li>
            <li> My hair is super fine, and I have tried many different products. I use TIGI Catwalk Your Highness Volume Tween 25.36oz Volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner with this product and it seems to work very nice!</li>
            <li> Good root lifter, hairdresser claims it is one of the best on the market, I always try different products, passed.</li>
            <li> It works,and you don&#x27;t need much.  This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great product, have been using for years.  have not been disappointed at all.  will continue to order if it saves me money!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! It truly does wonders for my fine hair. I have very long, fine hair that lacks volume and I use this mousse for extra volume. The results are fabulous.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this product makes my hair behave.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to spend lots of time messing with my hair now.</li>
            <li> You do get big sexy hair with lots of body, love this product!</li>
            <li> Pay attention to the size on these. I ordered them because they turned out to be a bit cheaper than they were where I usually get them in store. However, these bottles are the small size, NOT the large size like I usually get so it turns out to be more expensive. You can definitely get them cheaper elsewhere. Otherwise, I love love LOVE the root pump. It is the only thing that will give my fine blonde hair texture and volume without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I love it.  I would definitely recommend it &amp; the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product give your hair a boost but it also helps your hair hold its style. My daughter that has straight hair uses it to hold curls.</li>
            <li> Thank You! I love my Big Sexy and I received it in a timely FASHION. kEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love this mousse, only one that I have found that does not flake.  I have used it for years and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> This mousse gives my flay, heavy hair volume, and smells incredible.  I prefer this volumizing product over others, and the fact that it&#x27;s in a spray form makes it so much more convenient and less messy than working mousse in with your hands.  This is my second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not sticky or heavy, and no weird smell. Just gives nice body to the hair.</li>
            <li> The item I received was not the item pictured.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really see a difference when using this. just ok</li>
            <li> Great product and great price! I will definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> I really like that I can spray this moose directly on my roots. It gives good volume without making the hair stiff.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Just what I was looking for to add volume to my bangs that normally go flat. It does not feel like there&#x27;s any product in my hair after blow drying. Definitely recommend for people with thin and/or flat hair.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Gives me lift with no stiffness</li>
            <li> This product did the job in terms of giving my hair more volume at the roots, but it made my scalp itch horribly. I sent an email to the seller and was promptly refunded my money. Smells good, though.</li>
            <li> Love the product! Packaging was horrible!</li>
