            <li>When I saw it as an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; on Amazon at a wonderful price, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  </li>
            <li>This is a good item that lives up to it&#x27;s name and claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanx!</li>
            <li>it works good !</li>
            <li>Great brush - separates, deposits w/o clumping, lengthens, doesn&#x27;t take the curl out lashes and wears well all day and night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>and I am perfectly happy with it.</li>

            <li>My favorite mascara!  </li>
            <li>Well I do, and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I always got to Good Guide to make sure that I am not using harmful products (I&#x27;m kind of picky), and this mascara came up in my search.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to people who have asked me what kind of mascara I wear.</li>
            <li>~Nice</li>
            <li>Best mascara for a really inexpensive price.</li>
            <li>Have used this mascara for years; completely smudgeproof; can sleep in it and wake up with beautiful eyelashes!</li>
            <li>This one is 1/3 the price and works the best by far.</li>
            <li>but this one is pretty great</li>
            <li>Great item, works well, and fast delivery also.  </li>
            <li>There are much better mascara&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li>For me, I have to apply, apply, apply, and apply again before there is more than a hint of mascara on my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I searched for the top waterproof mascaras and this one was on most all of the lists.</li>
            <li>I have used Voluminous mascara for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried mascaras from many of the well known department store cosmetic counters but have not found one that performs better than this.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased to not be paying something like $25.</li>
            <li>prefer waterproof though I know many don&#x27;t like waterproof mascaras</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>Happy with Amazon&#x27;s commitment to fast shipping, but this mascara does nothing for a middle-aged woman.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Why spend $25 or more when this works better for $5?</li>
            <li>It goes on relatively easily and stays on.  </li>
            <li>I love Loreal products, the Waterproof mascara is true to its&#x27; word.</li>
            <li>This product goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t flake and is truly waterproof.  </li>
            <li>and you find many useful things at a reduced price when you spend $25.  </li>
            <li>Since I love Amazon, I can always find $25 worth of stuff when I need an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find a cheap, waterproof, mascara that fit my criteria.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed a nice dark brown with a good brush that isn&#x27;t made of plastic spikes.  </li>
            <li>This works way better then any eyebrow gel or pencil and looks way more natural.</li>
            <li>I easily clean off residue after shower w/cocoa butter</li>
            <li>So I use an eyelash curler then apply this to top and bottom lashes and it makes them really plump and luscious.</li>
            <li>That means I&#x27;ll actually take it off more often, which is better for my lashes.</li>
            <li>Worth it, i like it, but didn&#x27;t use yet</li>
            <li>It also comes in different colors that enhance your own color.</li>
            <li>me, the mascara is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t notice any flaking during the day, so I consider it a pretty much maintenance free product.  </li>
            <li>It does not clump, makes my lashes look full, dries very fast, and it really is waterproof.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having problems finding a good waterproof mascara that isn&#x27;t black.  </li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite mascara, and I&#x27;ve probably tried a dozen different kinds.</li>
            <li>Love the product, and, get the same one when I run out.</li>
            <li>First time I thought it was a fluke.</li>
            <li>What I like about this mascara is that it goes on very nicely, extends my lash length a little, makes my lashes fuller, and it&#x27;s waterproof, but get this -- when it&#x27;s NEW.  </li>
            <li>No mascaras are perfect, sadly, but this one stays on and does not flake nearly as much as some of the others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any issues with &amp;#34;raccoon eyes,&amp;#34; even after wearing it for 10-12 hour days, though my lids aren&#x27;t especially oily that I&#x27;ve had that problem with other waterproof mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my eyelashes look really long, and I can keep adding layers to make them as striking as I want.</li>
            <li>long time love of mine.</li>
            <li>Nice dark brown color.  </li>
            <li>My lashes end up looking full and natural without clumping.</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t know better, I have thought with the first application that the container was nearly empty.  </li>
            <li>Too many leave smear marks on my eyelids throughout the day, even when they are dry.  </li>
            <li>The brush is dry, and even after two or more coats, it does not seem to add volume.  </li>
            <li>I always use the waterproof to last through my long days, even on through my evenings, still looking good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also waterproof all day (for real) and it actually comes off easily, too.</li>
            <li>It really enhances my eyes lashes.</li>
            <li>I like a mascara that really adds mascara to the lashes.  </li>
            <li>Fresh, not dried out.</li>
            <li>The brush separates my lashes very well</li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily with no clumping, as long as you wiggle the brush from side to side as you go form root to tip.</li>
            <li>The color is a true black/brown which is desirable for older, or a more natural eyelash coloring, than the harsh black many wear.  </li>
            <li>would of been better if it was black</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the mascara is worth that extra inconvenience, but I know some people would see that as a deal breaker.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A friend had the same thing happen to her waterproof mascara (same brand), but interestingly this didn&#x27;t happen to her non-waterproof mascara (same brand.)  </li>
            <li>Comes off easy with a little coconut oil or waterproof eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>It is not sticky and looks natural.</li>
            <li>(and I DO NOT pump the mascara like we all did in the old days).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly waterproof, yet looks natural.</li>
            <li>I have long lashes but the ends are blonde and they stick straight out.</li>
            <li>Didnt last very long and didn&#x27;t change the look of my lashes that much</li>
            <li>eyelashes are long and thick now thanks to LiLash (takes about 3 months, if you&#x27;re interested), but I&#x27;m still using this mascara.</li>
            <li>Is easier to take off with a little makeup remover, although if you scrub hard enough with soap and water, it will mostly come off.</li>

            <li> Is easier to take off with a little makeup remover, although if you scrub hard enough with soap and water, it will mostly come off.</li>
            <li> Not sure why so many negative reviews -</li>
            <li> Was packaged like new, but it was dried out and took forever to get enough on my lashes to even notice!  </li>
            <li> No better and no worse than others...</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried them all, from expensive to cheap.</li>
            <li> Is it strange that I use this on my eyebrows?</li>
            <li> long story).  </li>
            <li> It was dried out indicating they sent me an old product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this in black, and as you&#x27;d expect, the black-brown is less noticeable, but the two are otherwise the same as far as formula and end result.</li>
            <li> I have pretty short and probably average-volume lashes, and this fills them out without being too dramatic.</li>
            <li> With 20 percent off, your purchase of this item is for less than you can purchase it at any big chain store.</li>
            <li> Also remember to reapply only while the previous coat is still wet.</li>
            <li> took off a star because unless I am being careful, it does tend to clump.</li>
            <li> This mascara is waterproof,  however it certainly is not voluminous.  </li>
            <li> Other mascaras seemed to just emphasize the thinness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> And clumps much less.  </li>
            <li> I only put a very little bit on now - hardly need mascara anymore.</li>
            <li> It adds a little bit of length, but not a ton.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is it&#x27;s very hard to get off.  </li>
            <li> and it looked like I had put nothing on, even though I had even skipped my lower lashes (as I knew I would be crying...</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with flaking all over my face -</li>
            <li> ended up throwing it out waste</li>
            <li> This is my go-to mascara for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> for a mascara I need everyday..</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> And my lashes don&#x27;t feel stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m a bit lazy about taking off makeup at night.</li>
            <li> It can be a little tough to get off.</li>
            <li> could hardly tell I had mascara on.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s extremely hard to find waterproof black-brown.  </li>
            <li> since i receive the item coz it came late before i bought another 1.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead, so black is too dramatic for me.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you use Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program and have at least five subscription items in a month, you will get a 20 percent discount on this item.</li>
            <li> and it starts getting thick and clumpy</li>
            <li> Thin and flaky, it went into the garbage as soon as I could replace it.</li>
            <li> I needed a mascara that was not too expensive, but also was not harmful to my health.</li>
            <li> I have had lots of expensive ones like Peter Thomas Roth, Lancôme, mally and Too faced.</li>
            <li> When my eyelashes were thin (before I started using the miracle that is LiLash - OMG!!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it was just a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the mascara.</li>

            <li> The best &amp;#34;over-the-counter&amp;#34; waterproof mascara at the drugstore! Great brush - separates, deposits w/o clumping, lengthens, doesn&#x27;t take the curl out lashes and wears well all day and night. It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sworn by this mascara for years. I&#x27;ve tried others, but I keep coming back to this stuff. It&#x27;s the only mascara I&#x27;ve found that can truly stand up to water without running or flaking off. When my allergies get going and my eyes water, this mascara stays put. It can be a little tough to get off. Liquid removers on a cotton ball aren&#x27;t going to do it. I use Albolene to remove it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having problems finding a good waterproof mascara that isn&#x27;t black.  I needed a nice dark brown with a good brush that isn&#x27;t made of plastic spikes.  This product goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t flake and is truly waterproof.  Comes off easy with a little coconut oil or waterproof eye makeup remover.  I will buy it until they no longer make it.</li>
            <li> Worth it, i like it, but didn&#x27;t use yet since i receive the item coz it came late before i bought another 1.</li>
            <li> this didnt state it was waterproof when i purchased and i got waterproof</li>
            <li> Is it strange that I use this on my eyebrows? Well I do, and it&#x27;s amazing. This works way better then any eyebrow gel or pencil and looks way more natural. It&#x27;s also cheaper too! Only thing is that I have to go over my eyebrow lines with a cotton swab since this has no precision</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem waterproof at all. I cried through this and it looked like I had put nothing on, even though I had even skipped my lower lashes (as I knew I would be crying...long story).  I&#x27;m on the hunt for the ultimate waterproof mascara that isn&#x27;t clumpy and lasts all day. If you know of one, PLEASE tell me in a comment.  I think I&#x27;ve tried them all, from expensive to cheap.</li>
            <li> The best I have found for waterproof</li>
            <li> Great item, works well, and fast delivery also.  Works well for those that likes to go swimming.  This is a good item that lives up to it&#x27;s name and claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanx!</li>
            <li> Didnt last very long and didn&#x27;t change the look of my lashes that much</li>
            <li> Never stayed on my lashes for longer than an hour or two..</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara!  Does not smudge and stays on all day.  Nice dark brown color.  Waterproof.  Is easier to take off with a little makeup remover, although if you scrub hard enough with soap and water, it will mostly come off.</li>
            <li> It really enhances my eyes lashes. It also comes in different colors that enhance your own color.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, great service</li>
            <li> I like a mascara that really adds mascara to the lashes.  I have to go over my lashes several times to even see the color.  There are much better mascara&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to receiving this as I needed waterproof mascara, and I trust the L&#x27;Oreal brand.  For me, I have to apply, apply, apply, and apply again before there is more than a hint of mascara on my lashes.  If I didn&#x27;t know better, I have thought with the first application that the container was nearly empty.  I was disappointed in the mascara.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara.  It goes on relatively easily and stays on.  The only problem I have with it is it&#x27;s very hard to get off.  I&#x27;ve lost  lashes trying to get it off even when using makeup remover towelettes or a cream based makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Product was unusable. It was dried out indicating they sent me an old product.</li>
            <li> I searched for the top waterproof mascaras and this one was on most all of the lists. I was having trouble with flaking all over my face - I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m a bit lazy about taking off makeup at night. But in this case, it does seal any remnants of yesterday&#x27;s mascara and doesn&#x27;t flake. It&#x27;s also waterproof all day (for real) and it actually comes off easily, too. That means I&#x27;ll actually take it off more often, which is better for my lashes. It&#x27;s a win-win! Not sure why so many negative reviews - this mascara is the best I&#x27;ve seen in years, and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 40 years now....</li>
            <li> It is not sticky and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Just like I&#x27;ve gotten in the store. Fresh, not dried out. Good price.</li>
            <li> No better and no worse than others...it does not seem to be waterproof!</li>
            <li> could hardly tell I had mascara on.  Didn&#x27;t plump up the volume at all.  ended up throwing it out waste</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best waterproof I have found.  No mascaras are perfect, sadly, but this one stays on and does not flake nearly as much as some of the others I&#x27;ve used.  And clumps much less.  Also, it&#x27;s extremely hard to find waterproof black-brown.  I&#x27;m a redhead, so black is too dramatic for me.  I try others, but keep going back to this one.</li>
            <li> It lasts, but goes on clumpy.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best!!  It does not clump, makes my lashes look full, dries very fast, and it really is waterproof.  I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to mascara for everyday wear. I have pretty short and probably average-volume lashes, and this fills them out without being too dramatic. It adds a little bit of length, but not a ton. My lashes end up looking full and natural without clumping. I haven&#x27;t experienced any issues with &amp;#34;raccoon eyes,&amp;#34; even after wearing it for 10-12 hour days, though my lids aren&#x27;t especially oily that I&#x27;ve had that problem with other waterproof mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this in black, and as you&#x27;d expect, the black-brown is less noticeable, but the two are otherwise the same as far as formula and end result. I&#x27;d recommend either depending on your preference.</li>
            <li> I needed a mascara that was not too expensive, but also was not harmful to my health. I always got to Good Guide to make sure that I am not using harmful products (I&#x27;m kind of picky), and this mascara came up in my search. I was excited to find a cheap, waterproof, mascara that fit my criteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a month and I am perfectly happy with it. It makes my eyelashes look really long, and I can keep adding layers to make them as striking as I want. At the end of the day, all of it is still on my eyelashes, and not on my face. I haven&#x27;t tested swimming with it on, but I do have to use makeup remover to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off a star because unless I am being careful, it does tend to clump. All I have to do is scrape off the excess product on the brush, and it won&#x27;t clump on my eyelashes. In my opinion, the mascara is worth that extra inconvenience, but I know some people would see that as a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the mascara is worth every penny. It is cheap, safe, and works great!</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite mascara, and I&#x27;ve probably tried a dozen different kinds. When my eyelashes were thin (before I started using the miracle that is LiLash - OMG!!), it was the only mascara that made them look thicker. Other mascaras seemed to just emphasize the thinness. It also doesn&#x27;t glop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes are long and thick now thanks to LiLash (takes about 3 months, if you&#x27;re interested), but I&#x27;m still using this mascara. I only put a very little bit on now - hardly need mascara anymore.</li>
            <li> I have used Voluminous mascara for years and love it. I have tried mascaras from many of the well known department store cosmetic counters but have not found one that performs better than this. I have recommended this product to people who have asked me what kind of mascara I wear. Also, if you use Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program and have at least five subscription items in a month, you will get a 20 percent discount on this item. With 20 percent off, your purchase of this item is for less than you can purchase it at any big chain store.</li>
            <li> I love Loreal products, the Waterproof mascara is true to its&#x27; word. It&#x27;s a must have in the summer, I can sweat in my work-outs and not look like a raccon in the aftermath.</li>
            <li> For the money, this is my preferred mascara.  The color is a true black/brown which is desirable for older, or a more natural eyelash coloring, than the harsh black many wear.  I always use the waterproof to last through my long days, even on through my evenings, still looking good.  I easily clean off residue after shower w/cocoa butter and I don&#x27;t notice any flaking during the day, so I consider it a pretty much maintenance free product.  The brush separates my lashes very well and I&#x27;m pleased to not be paying something like $25. for a mascara I need everyday..</li>
            <li> long time love of mine. I&#x27;ve tried plenty of mascaras and have purchased this one countless times because it actually holds my curl and its voluminous and doesn&#x27;t clump. fave fave fave&lt;br /&gt;I prefer waterproof though I know many don&#x27;t like waterproof mascaras but this one is pretty great</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.  Too many leave smear marks on my eyelids throughout the day, even when they are dry.  This one doesn&#x27;t do that.  And my lashes don&#x27;t feel stiff.</li>
            <li> This mascara is waterproof as claimed.  However, it does clump.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily with no clumping, as long as you wiggle the brush from side to side as you go form root to tip. Also remember to reapply only while the previous coat is still wet.</li>
            <li> Have used this mascara for years; completely smudgeproof; can sleep in it and wake up with beautiful eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Love the product, and, get the same one when I run out.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  Like it.</li>
            <li> Happy with Amazon&#x27;s commitment to fast shipping, but this mascara does nothing for a middle-aged woman.  Thin and flaky, it went into the garbage as soon as I could replace it.</li>
            <li> What I like about this mascara is that it goes on very nicely, extends my lash length a little, makes my lashes fuller, and it&#x27;s waterproof, but get this -- when it&#x27;s NEW.  About a month or two into the tube and it starts getting thick and clumpy, the wand gets coated thicker and thicker with coagulated mascara (in spite of cleaning it), (and I DO NOT pump the mascara like we all did in the old days).  This is the 2nd time it&#x27;s happened. First time I thought it was a fluke. A friend had the same thing happen to her waterproof mascara (same brand), but interestingly this didn&#x27;t happen to her non-waterproof mascara (same brand.)  I&#x27;m switching brands.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It goes on perfectly and with 2 quick coats, adds ton of volume.</li>
            <li> it works good ! would of been better if it was black</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years.  When I saw it as an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; on Amazon at a wonderful price, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  You can search for &amp;#34;add-ons&amp;#34; on Amazon and you find many useful things at a reduced price when you spend $25.  Since I love Amazon, I can always find $25 worth of stuff when I need an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  It&#x27;s truly waterproof, yet looks natural. It doesn&#x27;t clump lashes together and make you look like you have spiders on your eyes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is waterproof,  however it certainly is not voluminous.  The brush is dry, and even after two or more coats, it does not seem to add volume.  I am switching back to what I was using before.  The reason I gave this a try was because it was on Amazon subscribe and save.  It&#x27;s not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> ~Nice product~Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Best mascara for a really inexpensive price. I have had lots of expensive ones like Peter Thomas Roth, Lancôme, mally and Too faced. This one is 1/3 the price and works the best by far. I have long lashes but the ends are blonde and they stick straight out. So I use an eyelash curler then apply this to top and bottom lashes and it makes them really plump and luscious. Why spend $25 or more when this works better for $5?</li>
            <li> Was packaged like new, but it was dried out and took forever to get enough on my lashes to even notice!  I&#x27;m hoping it was just a bad batch.</li>
