            <li>Sometimes you&#x27;ll feel that cooling quality again and smell the pleasant odor of the product instead of sweat.  </li>
            <li>GREAT SERVICES NICE AND FASTER SHIPPING</li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>Great product and am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>it is nice to know I smell good.</li>
            <li>I liked it even before I ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m being generous with 2 stars (instead of 1) because it has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like a Bengay kind of tingle that neither burns nor irritates nor overpowers with scent.  </li>
            <li>Arrived when expected - great product at great price.  </li>
            <li>What more could a guy ask for?</li>
            <li>refreshing, i get complimented on how i smell</li>
            <li>It is actually a refreshing feeling.  </li>
            <li>which is why I got it since most deodorants seem to smell like that porta potty deodorizer.</li>
            <li>I was hoping the stripe would make it more effective, but I had an issue with a couple of them crumbling when I first used them</li>
            <li>Fair price and fast ship.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I use and It works great.</li>
            <li>A bit poetic, but true.  </li>
            <li>Hoping for a full refund or exchange to listed/newer formulation of this product.</li>
            <li>All the cool people are using it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t you want to be cool?</li>
            <li>Rarely do I have issues in the underarm department ...</li>
            <li>So, it is literally a pretty cool product.  </li>
            <li>My grocery store no longer stocks right guard with power stripe.</li>
            <li>Stops the funk,stops the sweat,no irritation,long lasting and love the scent.</li>
            <li>Will recommend to anyone interested in this product.</li>
            <li>I gave her a funny look and asked her if she was just smelling my armpits...</li>
            <li>All items arrived very well packaged!</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and just a tad flowery or sweet, like a distant breeze from a flower garden: you get a gentle whiff of flowers and fresh air on a cool breeze.  </li>
            <li>I havebeen using this for a long time; it is one of my favorite grooming items.  </li>
            <li>I always use this product and it might not really last 72 hours and that&#x27;s fine with me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent as an antiperspirant, but it smells almost exactly like a litter box after application.</li>
            <li>I think this deodorant works a bit better than previous Right Guard products.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I really lite it, so I ordered it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>but this anti-perspirant turns me into a really sweaty person.  </li>
            <li>I have really smelly hairy chubby man pits.</li>
            <li>Very deceiving.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>I really like this sent</li>
            <li>Buy it if you have been pleased with Right Guard in the past.</li>
            <li>I am lucky to get 1 hour of protection before starting to sweat.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>In general, I don&#x27;t sweat very much at all.  </li>
            <li>The old product is much inferior to the newer version, so I returned it.</li>
            <li>I was accustomed to using; the new one was pictured on the Amazon ad.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting that from an item fulfilled directly by Amazon ...</li>
            <li>It lasts a good amount of time, is not too overbearing, and doesn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable at anytime.</li>
            <li>Clearing out a whole train car when you sit down?  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the product I received was the old version, not, the New &amp; Improved Right Guard Total Defense stick</li>

            <li> and that is how long I need it to last.</li>
            <li> and it keeps me dry throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The deodorant has an icy effect that is a bit weird at first, but it goes away.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s wrong with this formula, but I&#x27;m honestly not sure that it is better than no anti-perspirant at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had tried to pick it up at Walmart but unbelievably Walmart had sold out of countless rows of this product.</li>
            <li> Her response was &amp;#34;You smell amazing.&amp;#34; While I still find it odd that she smells me whenever I give her a hug</li>
            <li> Less stinky at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> used it for the past 6 months and will continue to.</li>
            <li> I bought the bonus size but got the small size...</li>
            <li> and it just didn&#x27;t work as well as the less expensive Degree that i usually use.</li>
            <li> This fights off that bad smell.</li>
            <li> It is truly terrible at preventing sweat.  </li>

            <li> My grocery store no longer stocks right guard with power stripe. I really lite it, so I ordered it from Amazon. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant at a good price.</li>
            <li> Well, I need it and this is what I use. I liked it even before I ordered from Amazon. Now its just easier and cheaper</li>
            <li> Very effective.  My son uses these, too.</li>
            <li> In general, I don&#x27;t sweat very much at all.  Rarely do I have issues in the underarm department ... but this anti-perspirant turns me into a really sweaty person.  It is truly terrible at preventing sweat.  I&#x27;m being generous with 2 stars (instead of 1) because it has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite product claims of \\&quot;48 Hour Protection,\\&quot; I am lucky to get 1 hour of protection before starting to sweat.  I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s wrong with this formula, but I&#x27;m honestly not sure that it is better than no anti-perspirant at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be returning to Degree, which (gasp!) actually works.</li>
            <li> I always use this product and it might not really last 72 hours and that&#x27;s fine with me it last me a work day and that is how long I need it to last. I had tried to pick it up at Walmart but unbelievably Walmart had sold out of countless rows of this product.</li>
            <li> Stops the funk,stops the sweat,no irritation,long lasting and love the scent. What more could a guy ask for?</li>
            <li> I buy this all the time. used it for the past 6 months and will continue to. I have really smelly hairy chubby man pits. This fights off that bad smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent as an antiperspirant, but it smells almost exactly like a litter box after application. Like a cat litter box.</li>
            <li> Very deceiving. I bought the bonus size but got the small size... I wasn&#x27;t expecting that from an item fulfilled directly by Amazon ... Way to go!:(</li>
            <li> Less stinky at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> refreshing, i get complimented on how i smell</li>
            <li> Not what the pictures is the size was smaller not 3.0 it came  2.6 oz</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product I received was the old version, not, the New &amp; Improved Right Guard Total Defense stick I was accustomed to using; the new one was pictured on the Amazon ad. The old product is much inferior to the newer version, so I returned it. Hoping for a full refund or exchange to listed/newer formulation of this product.</li>
            <li> All the cool people are using it.  Don&#x27;t you want to be cool?</li>
            <li> Fair price and fast ship. Will re order</li>
            <li> Great product and am completely satisfied. No issues whatsoever. Will recommend to anyone interested in this product. Will do business again with.</li>
            <li> I only use this brand This is the only product I use and It works great. I would highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the stripe would make it more effective, but I had an issue with a couple of them crumbling when I first used them and it just didn&#x27;t work as well as the less expensive Degree that i usually use.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  The scent is fresh and just a tad flowery or sweet, like a distant breeze from a flower garden: you get a gentle whiff of flowers and fresh air on a cool breeze.  A bit poetic, but true.  Nothing overpowering, thankfully.  The deodorant has an icy effect that is a bit weird at first, but it goes away.  Like a Bengay kind of tingle that neither burns nor irritates nor overpowers with scent.  It is actually a refreshing feeling.  I think this deodorant works a bit better than previous Right Guard products.  Especially when you start to sweat.  Sometimes you&#x27;ll feel that cooling quality again and smell the pleasant odor of the product instead of sweat.  So, it is literally a pretty cool product.  Buy it if you have been pleased with Right Guard in the past.</li>
            <li> I havebeen using this for a long time; it is one of my favorite grooming items.  Smells great; works great.</li>
            <li> Got smelly pits?  Sweat stains on your shirt?  Clearing out a whole train car when you sit down?  Then this is for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine. Packed well and it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, great price</li>
            <li> Once you settle on a deodorant, it is not something that you like to switch often. I really like this sent and it keeps me dry throughout the day. The one thing is that it is hard to consistently find this sent in stores for whatever reason. As a result I order hear on Amazon and never have to worry about having it on hand.</li>
            <li> Always on time and a great product!</li>
            <li> I gave her a funny look and asked her if she was just smelling my armpits... Her response was &amp;#34;You smell amazing.&amp;#34; While I still find it odd that she smells me whenever I give her a hug it is nice to know I smell good. I like the smell too which is why I got it since most deodorants seem to smell like that porta potty deodorizer. It lasts a good amount of time, is not too overbearing, and doesn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable at anytime. I hope they never stop making this one.</li>
            <li> best stuff on the market. However DO NOT BUY this one (gel version):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Right-Guard-Defense-Anti-Perspirant-Deodorant/dp/B001J6O5V4/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1412696422&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;right+guard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel version is like glue! You cannot even wash it off your hands.</li>
            <li> Great value. All items arrived very well packaged!</li>
