            <li>I&#x27;m also going to purchase a moisturizing cream from this company because this product works so great.</li>
            <li>I have no idea why it has good reviews</li>
            <li>it said it was good for scars.</li>
            <li>this is great and leaves my skin smooth and shiny after i exfoliate !</li>

            <li>smells nice</li>
            <li>It is effective for the complexion.  </li>
            <li>All opinions are my own, of course, and I truly recommend investing in this product if you have problematic skin.</li>
            <li>My new Best Friend:-)</li>
            <li>I have been through many, many high name brands of acne creams for scarring, and this is the most effective for me!!!  </li>
            <li>Better off trying the hyaluronic acid by Cosmedica, so much better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>It made me break out more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this serum.</li>
            <li>This product works so much better at keeping my skin smooth and cystic acne</li>
            <li>love it - smooth skin</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t suffering from acne, this is still an excellent product to use once a day, every other day, as a precaution.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>This is truly an amazing product, particularly for anyone who has oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave your face dry</li>
            <li>The reviews were positive, and so I decided to give it a try!!  </li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing but break me out even more.</li>
            <li>I apply this in the a.m., and use the Watts Cool Retinol Serum at night.</li>
            <li>Works great and want to try out other Watts Beauty products.</li>
            <li>I was looking at other products from this company, which have great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Prices are very reasonable (thank you!)  </li>
            <li>Applied on fresh skin morning and night, I have seen a quick disappearance of acne in a matter of days (in regards to hormonal and surface acne).</li>
            <li>but it is a bit sticky when you first put it on!</li>
            <li>I got it along with the Watts hyaluronic moisturizing serum, My extremely dry dehydrated skin is staying most all thru the day and looking more fresh, dewy and glowing.</li>
            <li>Applying a small amount around and on the nose has also significantly reduced the presence of blackheads, which is a great bonus.</li>
            <li>I will buy again if it stays on here as is; it is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I was able to eliminate the white heads with 2x daily use, so I take that as a success!!!</li>
            <li>A little bit of product goes a long way, so this is an excellent skincare investment.</li>
            <li>I use this with a moisturizer over and mineral makeup, and so far I can see a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>product really saved my skin from a Holiday disaster!  </li>
            <li>I was able to show my face without being totally embarrassed and was without Make-up covering it!….I</li>
            <li>I was also starting to get wrinkles on my top lip.</li>
            <li>Does wonders for my skin and is much more affordable than similar products in a salon or spa.  </li>
            <li>This serum never peels, feels much milder, and seems to make more of a lasting difference.</li>
            <li>After I finish this bottle, I will certainly purchase another.  </li>
            <li>I was elated to see this new addition!!</li>
            <li>I was really thrilled….to have this along in my travels……</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li>The freeze serum really freezes my 11 lines but peels sometimes.</li>
            <li>I may have  been using it too much.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very oily</li>
            <li>Thank you sooooo much.</li>
            <li>just haven&#x27;t used it dedicatedly enough to know of it&#x27;s power on acne which is what I originally purchased it for.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this product, and I am very thankful to Watts Beauty for allowing me to try it at a discounted rate.</li>
            <li>If any of you have seen any of my previous reviews, you know that I am an avid Watts fan!!!</li>
            <li>It does seem to have less additives than many commercial skincare products and I certainly appreciate that.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It was incredible how quickly the serum started to work on some very bad blotchy-red acne.</li>
            <li>continued  to use the serum night and day, and by the 3rd or 4th day the acne had really subsided.</li>
            <li>Now i gave it to my 13 years old daughter too.</li>
            <li>People with dry skin can also benefit from this product, as the formula is rather thin and absorbs quickly - just be sure to moisturize thoroughly afterwards, irregardless of your skin type.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced compared to other skin serums.</li>
            <li>Good product cleared up some spots and decreased dark spots, although not a  complete miracle worker.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that addresses both of those concerns and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>A little squirt covers my whole face neck and decollete.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really had a super bad break out, just before &amp;#34;The Thanksgiving Get-Together&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It calms down existing breakouts and, although it doesn&#x27;t make cystic spots go down overnight, I can see a definite improvement in my skin overall.</li>
            <li> I actually have less wrinkles now compared to when I was using the freeze serum.</li>
            <li> It certainly didn&#x27;t make my skin any worse, but I can&#x27;t say it helped either.  </li>
            <li> But, I think some of my skin came off my face due to use.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this would do for an active eruption of cystic acne, etc., but</li>
            <li> as far as scarring, and uneven skin tones, this is the BOMB!!!</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult acne that leaves behind dark marks (hyperpigmentation).</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist, I pay special attention to the skin of my clients, because skin that is in poor condition will not wear makeup well, no matter how expensive the makeup may be.</li>
            <li> I have used many of their serums and have NEVER been disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I am still a grown woman who suffers from the occasional breakout, and since I have been using this product as needed my breakouts are virtually gone overnight!</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t look very bad, but I&#x27;d say there was about 1-3 big bump developing on my face on a weekly basis, with my period approaching my face looked significantly worse.</li>
            <li> I have the worst forehead wrinkles (especially those 11 ones between my eyebrows).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really expensive.</li>
            <li> but it is unlikely that I will reorder.</li>
            <li> Contains Carrageenan which makes my skin flare up like crazy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how i found you,but through my desperate search in finding a miracle,you are the answer of my prayers.</li>
            <li> But, I am fearful of over effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> I used to get a horrible cystic acne pimple once a month that took an additional month to heal no matter what I used on it.</li>

            <li> this is great and leaves my skin smooth and shiny after i exfoliate ! smells nice but it is a bit sticky when you first put it on!</li>
            <li> Contains Carrageenan which makes my skin flare up like crazy.</li>
            <li> Reduces redness and size of my overall acne.</li>
            <li> Works great and want to try out other Watts Beauty products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 weeks since I started using it and my cystic acne is almost gone. My skin didn&#x27;t look very bad, but I&#x27;d say there was about 1-3 big bump developing on my face on a weekly basis, with my period approaching my face looked significantly worse. I was able to eliminate the white heads with 2x daily use, so I take that as a success!!! I use this with a moisturizer over and mineral makeup, and so far I can see a huge improvement. The brown spots are not gone but it cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li> Well, how can I say this, without sounding like I&#x27;m exaggerating?….This product really saved my skin from a Holiday disaster!  I really had a super bad break out, just before &amp;#34;The Thanksgiving Get-Together&amp;#34;. It was incredible how quickly the serum started to work on some very bad blotchy-red acne. I was able to show my face without being totally embarrassed and was without Make-up covering it!….I continued  to use the serum night and day, and by the 3rd or 4th day the acne had really subsided. I was really thrilled….to have this along in my travels……My new Best Friend:-)</li>
            <li> Shipping was prompt and well assembled.  Prices are very reasonable (thank you!)  Good product cleared up some spots and decreased dark spots, although not a  complete miracle worker.  I will buy again if it stays on here as is; it is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave your face dry</li>
            <li> Works well softens the skin.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing but break me out even more. I have no idea why it has good reviews but it did not work for me at all. Better off trying the hyaluronic acid by Cosmedica, so much better.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so smooth. I love it. Not drying either.</li>
            <li> I  have been US t this product for about a month and I definitely can see an improvement in my skin .</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  I use it day and night under a homemade moisturizer containing Watts Argan Oil.  Watts has great beauty products at an affordable price</li>
            <li> Initially using this product caused a lot of dryness on my forehead.  I figured out it because I was using a retinol based cream. I decided to eliminate the retionol cream and I&#x27;m glad I did. This product works so much better at keeping my skin smooth and cystic acne free!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used to get a horrible cystic acne pimple once a month that took an additional month to heal no matter what I used on it. Now, I don&#x27;t get any unless I run out of this product. Bomb!!</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult acne that leaves behind dark marks (hyperpigmentation). This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that addresses both of those concerns and does not dry out my skin. I noticed results after about a month of nightly applications. Very reasonably priced compared to other skin serums.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever!</li>
            <li> I have the worst forehead wrinkles (especially those 11 ones between my eyebrows). I was also starting to get wrinkles on my top lip. I was using Ling Freeze Serum (which I love!), but I was running out and it&#x27;s really expensive. The freeze serum really freezes my 11 lines but peels sometimes. This serum never peels, feels much milder, and seems to make more of a lasting difference. I actually have less wrinkles now compared to when I was using the freeze serum.</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my skin and is much more affordable than similar products in a salon or spa.  Will be reordering!</li>
            <li> I was looking at other products from this company, which have great reviews.  I came across this product and decided to give it a try since i had amazon points.  I&#x27;m not disappointed.  I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks and I can see changes.  My face is clearer.  It seems to help fade some acne scars as well as make acne dissapear faster.  After I finish this bottle, I will certainly purchase another.  I&#x27;m also going to purchase a moisturizing cream from this company because this product works so great.</li>
            <li> I know that it seemed to lighten my skin and my complexion cleared up.  But, I think some of my skin came off my face due to use.  I may have  been using it too much.  Now, I do not use daily.  But, around twice a week.  It is effective for the complexion.  But, I am fearful of over effectiveness.  It is an acid.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help with acne. It made me break out more and it&#x27;s very oily</li>
            <li> I am 42 .Science my childhood i was fighting with acne.I don&#x27;t even know how i found you,but through my desperate search in finding a miracle,you are the answer of my prayers.Now i gave it to my 13 years old daughter too.Thank you sooooo much.The results are truly amazing!!</li>
            <li> I did not see noteworthy results from the product after about 1.5 months of use.  It certainly didn&#x27;t make my skin any worse, but I can&#x27;t say it helped either.  It does seem to have less additives than many commercial skincare products and I certainly appreciate that.  I will continue to use until I run out but it is unlikely that I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I am still a grown woman who suffers from the occasional breakout, and since I have been using this product as needed my breakouts are virtually gone overnight!</li>
            <li> Great Seller-Great item-Highly Recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It broke my face out. If you&#x27;re prone for acne I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. I threw it away after the 1st week.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with the intention of getting rid of acne. It did nothing for my acne or dark spots, however I&#x27;ve had raised scar on the bridge of my nose for almost 4 years and after using this serum all over my face, the scar is completely gone. I definitely recommend for scars or wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Great product! Is helping to fade my hyper pigmentation, and is moisturizing too. I have very sensitive skin and I have no problems with breakouts with this. This will be my 3rd purchase!</li>
            <li> I have rather severe, cystic hormonal acne and have tried every product imaginable. I absolutely LOVE this serum. It calms down existing breakouts and, although it doesn&#x27;t make cystic spots go down overnight, I can see a definite improvement in my skin overall. Also, I showed it to my facialist and she was really impressed by the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> I got this bcuz it said it was good for scars. I just had a melanoma removed from my cheek and reconstructive surgery. I&#x27;ve been putting it on my scar and it appears to be flattening out. I&#x27;ll update with progress. I got it along with the Watts hyaluronic moisturizing serum, My extremely dry dehydrated skin is staying most all thru the day and looking more fresh, dewy and glowing. I put the glycolic on 1st then this serum over it, then my moisturizer. A little squirt covers my whole face neck and decollete.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be contacting the company about a refund.</li>
            <li> love it - smooth skin</li>
            <li> If any of you have seen any of my previous reviews, you know that I am an avid Watts fan!!! I have used many of their serums and have NEVER been disappointed!! After a recent bout with my acne, I was looking for something to resolve that as well as the scarring. I was elated to see this new addition!! The reviews were positive, and so I decided to give it a try!!  THANK YOU WATTS!!!  Withing 3-4 days of applying, my acne scars have started to diminish!  I apply this in the a.m., and use the Watts Cool Retinol Serum at night. I have been through many, many high name brands of acne creams for scarring, and this is the most effective for me!!!  I don&#x27;t know how this would do for an active eruption of cystic acne, etc., but as far as scarring, and uneven skin tones, this is the BOMB!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting...just haven&#x27;t used it dedicatedly enough to know of it&#x27;s power on acne which is what I originally purchased it for.</li>
            <li> This is truly an amazing product, particularly for anyone who has oily, acne prone skin. As a makeup artist, I pay special attention to the skin of my clients, because skin that is in poor condition will not wear makeup well, no matter how expensive the makeup may be. Thus, I am always on the lookout for simple acne solutions that target the problem at the core, and that not only help get rid of acne, but help heal the skin as well. The combination of salicylic and glycolic acids penetrates deep into the pores, helping get rid of acne. Applied on fresh skin morning and night, I have seen a quick disappearance of acne in a matter of days (in regards to hormonal and surface acne). People with dry skin can also benefit from this product, as the formula is rather thin and absorbs quickly - just be sure to moisturize thoroughly afterwards, irregardless of your skin type. If you aren&#x27;t suffering from acne, this is still an excellent product to use once a day, every other day, as a precaution. Applying a small amount around and on the nose has also significantly reduced the presence of blackheads, which is a great bonus. I highly recommend using this product, and I am very thankful to Watts Beauty for allowing me to try it at a discounted rate. All opinions are my own, of course, and I truly recommend investing in this product if you have problematic skin. A little bit of product goes a long way, so this is an excellent skincare investment.</li>
