            <li>Good deal!!</li>
            <li>This variety pack is excellent!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an excellent product to either try or give as a gift.  </li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful, too.</li>
            <li>Lathers beautifully.</li>
            <li>Great smell.</li>
            <li>and it was a great sample pack.</li>
            <li>They all smell great in the closet before they are use.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to try them out without committing to a 3 oz bar.  </li>
            <li>The soaps are great and make a good gift.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the soap bars are great, smell really nice and cleans you up well.</li>
            <li>is good</li>
            <li>quality is good though I was cheated on quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>I liked the soap, but not it&#x27;s form.</li>
            <li>I liked the variety although there was no way to know which one was what scent.</li>
            <li>Nice for traveling too</li>
            <li>Ordered the product and the description claims to come with 6 bars and presents itself to be packaged in a nice box for gifting.</li>
            <li>These were some great soaps, I loved getting a variety of them, and it certainly beats Dove or any generic-type soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that goat&#x27;s mild is also good for eczema.</li>
            <li>I love Zum soaps.</li>
            <li>Some of them are so potently scented that when I put a bar in the bathroom, we can smell it in the bedroom.</li>
            <li>Will keep for myself as I love Zum soaps</li>
            <li>I love to use this product.</li>
            <li>I gave this 3 stars only because Zum is awesome soap.  </li>
            <li>Better than a bath gel and healthier for your skin, too.</li>
            <li>SMELLS INTERESTING.</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>love the scents and the trial</li>
            <li>I love variety.</li>
            <li>Love the goat milk soap.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s better as hand soap than shower soap, but I definitely enjoyed them while they lasted.</li>
            <li>Loved the scents, however I wish the bars were cut more consistently.</li>
            <li>They were packaged in the cute box, but with one SUPER strong mint soap making them ALL smell like mint.  </li>
            <li>I do wish they gave you a break down of which scents are included, but they are all wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I received this in quick time and love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>Fine for sampling scents but would have liked to see a slip of paper telling what scents were included in package in case I liked something and wanted to buy it in regular 3oz size.  </li>
            <li>My kids even enjoy this soap.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to try out the different soaps they sell.</li>
            <li>They do have a light mint smell.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin squeeky clean.</li>
            <li>I would not buy that many large bars.</li>
            <li>I am using one right now and have looked at every bar on there website and still can&#x27;t figure it out!</li>
            <li>I have nothing against Zum Bar, they make wonderful products but at least change the product picture</li>
            <li>Love this stuff made my skin really soft and i smelled great for a long time, my husband has sensitive skin and he was able to use this.</li>
            <li>I love all the Zum products I&#x27;ve tried, but I sometimes wonder about new scent combinations.  </li>
            <li>These little bars of soap make me happy.</li>
            <li>The soaps themselves are fine, but if you are buying this to try the different smells, this is a HUGE bummer.  </li>
            <li>it has a great aroma and it cleans very well with little residue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>BUT VERY PRICY!</li>
            <li>I love the variety of the different scents and textures.  </li>
            <li>The goat&#x27;s milk formula is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>Very fragrant.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap</li>
            <li>The whole box is 9 oz</li>
            <li>Kind of messy.</li>
            <li>I would much rather spend the extra money and get a full bar that doesn&#x27;t crumble and cause all this frustration.</li>
            <li>These small samples allow me to enjoy different fragrances more often.</li>
            <li>They do NOT look like the picture in the description, and they are NOT delivered in the cute little box.  </li>
            <li>This is a very high quality soap with natural ingredients, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Anyone who&#x27;s interested should purchase directly from Indigo Wild or another seller.</li>
            <li>It was nice to get a chance to try a little of the different kinds.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many and this bundle pack will give you around six small size bars to sample.</li>
            <li>You are better off going to your local farmers market or health food store and buying some other organic bars.</li>
            <li>However, the soaps are different and I don&#x27;t like the aromas as well as my first order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this as a Christmas gift in 2012 and it makes my skin so soft, I ordered some for myself this year.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this Zum Bundle directly from Indigo Wild</li>
            <li>The soaps smell super yummy and they last for a long time.  </li>
            <li>But you get several smells in one box, which is fun &amp; doesn&#x27;t commit you to one scent for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Arrived with only 4 bars bundled with a Zum Rub rubber band in a clear plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Potential purchasers -- go to the Zum Bar website and order directly from them if you want the box.</li>
            <li>has more green and less purple and another could have more purple and less green.</li>
            <li>waste your time ordering this, order it straight from Indigo Wild.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed because I really liked the smell of the soap on my first order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed because I really liked the smell of the soap on my first order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat</li>
            <li> My only complaint was the bars are a bit small, so they don&#x27;t last more than a week in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first negative review I have posted on Amazon</li>
            <li> DOESNT LAST LONG.</li>
            <li> Some of them are such thin slivers that they crumble with the first use!  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;slices&#x27; are too thin and quickly break-up when you use them.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and I find this soap softens and soothes.  </li>
            <li> This combination provides the opportunity to try a little before I buy a big bar.</li>
            <li> These are just enough for a few baths &amp; then they are gone --</li>
            <li> My order didn&#x27;t come with a boxed package like shown and the cuts were not consistent.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have ready used the bars of soap</li>
            <li> 50% less product.  </li>
            <li> Also the packaging doesn&#x27;t allow the fragrance to come through which is disappointing since it works as a solid air freshener until used and the plastic is non-favorable towards Indigo Wild&#x27;s ideals since they package their products in recyclable, compostable materials.  </li>
            <li> We went through the box in less than 12 days.</li>
            <li> Not cool....</li>
            <li> $$$$$ FOR LITTLE DISCARDED CHIPS OF SOAP.</li>
            <li> NOT FOR EVERYDAY USE</li>
            <li> But they were so small, they disappeared after less than 10 washes.  </li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer that there should be a small paper separating them because it confuses the nose.</li>
            <li> I also had to go to their website to find a match for the small piece</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, some of them stain our white washcloths.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to give this as a Christmas gift, but now i am going to have to seek out some sort of decorative box or it just looks like a messy pile of soap!</li>
            <li> This review is tough.  </li>
            <li> However the box arrived opened (broken seal) and damaged.  </li>
            <li> I broke out in a really bad, itchy, stinging, burning red painful rash that did not go away for days.  </li>
            <li> but I am not happy about this purchase!</li>
            <li> very thin slices.  </li>
            <li> That was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Slabs of soap tied with a string and in a plastic baggie :(  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating!!</li>
            <li> However, I was very disappointed that this item did not come in a box despite the fact that the description says &amp;#34;Bundle IN A BOX&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have researched the horrible side effects from castor oil being put on the skin.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I liked the soap, but not it&#x27;s form. The &#x27;slices&#x27; are too thin and quickly break-up when you use them. Kind of messy.</li>
            <li> I love Zum soaps. I have tried many and this bundle pack will give you around six small size bars to sample. I agree with another reviewer that there should be a small paper separating them because it confuses the nose. I also had to go to their website to find a match for the small piece so I know which one to buy in a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;Being these are hand made in batches, you might get the same scent as someone else but the color variation could be one bar has more green and less purple and another could have more purple and less green. I am using the lavender mint to point this out as an example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great lather. Great smell. Wonderful product to try.</li>
            <li> The quality of the soap bars are great, smell really nice and cleans you up well. However the bars are just not big enough, they&#x27;re nothing like shown above. You are better off going to your local farmers market or health food store and buying some other organic bars. I have nothing against Zum Bar, they make wonderful products but at least change the product picture so people know what they&#x27;ll actually be receiving upon purchase. My order didn&#x27;t come with a boxed package like shown and the cuts were not consistent.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling soap I&#x27;ve ever found. Some of them are so potently scented that when I put a bar in the bathroom, we can smell it in the bedroom. The goat&#x27;s milk formula is gentle on my skin. The colors are beautiful, too. Unfortunately, some of them stain our white washcloths.  However, these are so inconsistently cut!  Some of them are such thin slivers that they crumble with the first use!  They do NOT look like the picture in the description, and they are NOT delivered in the cute little box.  I would much rather spend the extra money and get a full bar that doesn&#x27;t crumble and cause all this frustration.</li>
            <li> Not cool.... ordered as a gift and did not come in the box as pictured.  Slabs of soap tied with a string and in a plastic baggie :(  Will keep for myself as I love Zum soaps but I am not happy about this purchase!</li>
            <li> I ordered Zum Bundle again thinking I would get the same soaps I got last order.  However, the soaps are different and I don&#x27;t like the aromas as well as my first order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed because I really liked the smell of the soap on my first order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat</li>
            <li> This review is tough.  I like zum products a lot, and was looking forward to trying a bunch of the soaps.  The soaps themselves are fine, but if you are buying this to try the different smells, this is a HUGE bummer.  They were packaged in the cute box, but with one SUPER strong mint soap making them ALL smell like mint.  I tried separating them to try to find the culprit, but to no avail.  They all smell like mint which I personally don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Very fragrant. Lathers beautifully. I love to use this product. I&#x27;ve read that goat&#x27;s mild is also good for eczema.</li>
            <li> Product it packaged just like the picture and it was a great sample pack. My kids even enjoy this soap. Very happy customer.</li>
            <li> This was not packaged the way that is shows.  There isnt any packaging at all, the product came with a ribbon semi around it and it came in a plastic sandwich bag.  I wanted to give this as a Christmas gift, but now i am going to have to seek out some sort of decorative box or it just looks like a messy pile of soap!</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars only because Zum is awesome soap.  However, I was very disappointed that this item did not come in a box despite the fact that the description says &amp;#34;Bundle IN A BOX&amp;#34;.  The packages came rubber banded together - no boxes.  I bought two since I intended to give them as gifts.  Potential purchasers -- go to the Zum Bar website and order directly from them if you want the box.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift in 2012 and it makes my skin so soft, I ordered some for myself this year.  Smells wonderful, too.  I received this in quick time and love the way it makes my skin feel.  Better than a bath gel and healthier for your skin, too.</li>
            <li> I liked the variety although there was no way to know which one was what scent. I like a variety in my shower so it works for me. Nice for traveling too</li>
            <li> I really like this soap it has a great aroma and it cleans very well with little residue.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy the larger size bars if possible</li>
            <li> I wish I would have researched the horrible side effects from castor oil being put on the skin.  I broke out in a really bad, itchy, stinging, burning red painful rash that did not go away for days.  In addition it caused itching in my private areas that was like a living hell.  I would never purchase this soap again!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff made my skin really soft and i smelled great for a long time, my husband has sensitive skin and he was able to use this.</li>
            <li> It was nice to get a chance to try a little of the different kinds.  They all smell great in the closet before they are use.</li>
            <li> $$$$$ FOR LITTLE DISCARDED CHIPS OF SOAP. DOESNT LAST LONG. SMELLS INTERESTING. DRYING. OK BUT VERY PRICY! NOT FOR EVERYDAY USE</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it as soap yet. I put it in bowls around the house to scent the air.</li>
            <li> The soaps are great and make a good gift.  However the box arrived opened (broken seal) and damaged.  That was disappointing.</li>
            <li> These are just enough for a few baths &amp; then they are gone -- very thin slices.  But you get several smells in one box, which is fun &amp; doesn&#x27;t commit you to one scent for a long time.  I&#x27;m all about spa smells and Zum fits the bill!</li>
            <li> This is a great way to try out the different soaps they sell. I like them all. They do have a light mint smell. Leaves skin squeeky clean.</li>
            <li> love the scents and the trial size.i am very happy with every soap i have purchased from here.it is good</li>
            <li> Loved the scents, however I wish the bars were cut more consistently. Some were slivers that crumbled on one use, others were cut sufficient enough up give you a week of use.  Fine for sampling scents but would have liked to see a slip of paper telling what scents were included in package in case I liked something and wanted to buy it in regular 3oz size.  I am using one right now and have looked at every bar on there website and still can&#x27;t figure it out! Very frustrating!!</li>
            <li> These little bars of soap make me happy. I love variety. These small samples allow me to enjoy different fragrances more often. I would not buy that many large bars. This combination provides the opportunity to try a little before I buy a big bar. Love the goat milk soap. My skin is dry and I find this soap softens and soothes.  Good deal!!</li>
            <li> Ordered the product and the description claims to come with 6 bars and presents itself to be packaged in a nice box for gifting. Arrived with only 4 bars bundled with a Zum Rub rubber band in a clear plastic bag. Since they were all bundled together, they all smelled the same even though it was obvious they were of different varieties. Could not gift the package since it looked like I had bought it from the back of a wholesale truck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap quality is good though I was cheated on quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first negative review I have posted on Amazon but I felt it necessary since when I was concerned about ordering additional bars of soap I realized I had not received what I had ordered. Unfortunately, I have ready used the bars of soap so asking for a refund is not possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time ordering this, order it straight from Indigo Wild.</li>
            <li> Pkg is bent and can&#x27;t give it as a gift., I will have to find another present for a friend. but not from Aum</li>
            <li> The scents come to life with the steam. This is a very high quality soap with natural ingredients, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This variety pack is excellent!  The soaps smell super yummy and they last for a long time.  I love the variety of the different scents and textures.  I do wish they gave you a break down of which scents are included, but they are all wonderful.  I would definitly get this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this Zum Bundle directly from Indigo Wild and it&#x27;s an excellent product to either try or give as a gift.  The one from this seller does NOT come in a box, is packaged in plastic so it&#x27;s un-giftable, and contains approx. 50% less product.  Also the packaging doesn&#x27;t allow the fragrance to come through which is disappointing since it works as a solid air freshener until used and the plastic is non-favorable towards Indigo Wild&#x27;s ideals since they package their products in recyclable, compostable materials.  The plastic also made the fragrances blend so that I couldn&#x27;t differentiate individual scents.  Two stars because of packaging.  Anyone who&#x27;s interested should purchase directly from Indigo Wild or another seller.</li>
            <li> These were some great soaps, I loved getting a variety of them, and it certainly beats Dove or any generic-type soap. My only complaint was the bars are a bit small, so they don&#x27;t last more than a week in the shower. Perhaps it&#x27;s better as hand soap than shower soap, but I definitely enjoyed them while they lasted.</li>
            <li> But they were so small, they disappeared after less than 10 washes.  We went through the box in less than 12 days.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter in law who is into making soaps- She likes the smell and appearance of the soap as well as the packaging.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Gives you a chance to try different scents.  I just wish it would tell you which scents you are trying!</li>
            <li> I love all the Zum products I&#x27;ve tried, but I sometimes wonder about new scent combinations.  This is a great way to try them out without committing to a 3 oz bar.  The whole box is 9 oz and you get end cuts of 5 or 6 kinds.  The only problem is that I want to order them all!!!</li>
