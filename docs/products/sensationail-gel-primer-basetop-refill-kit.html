            <li>I gave this product 5stars because it&#x27;s the best at home gel nail kit</li>
            <li>Sensationail is the best home gel product!  </li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>It is a great product.</li>
            <li>I use this nail system and it works great.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and the brush holds the perfect amount.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply, and then when you add your color it looks wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I bought my own gel nail set.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I can use this amazing product and do it at home for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I have my own LED lamp that I got off of eBay</li>
            <li>I started doing my own nails almost a year ago because I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep going to the salon.  </li>
            <li>So, the original Nailene product is great...</li>
            <li>Of all the gel polishes,  this is by far the best set.  </li>
            <li>So far this product is working great!</li>
            <li>But this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this replacement bottle, it worked great.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I find that it lasts up to more than two weeks.  </li>
            <li>And make sure you use the base/top coat from this brand.</li>
            <li>I thought it was because I had not used the product in many months, so I bought replacements.</li>
            <li>love gel nail polish and</li>
            <li>this is an affordable way to be able to do it yourself.</li>
            <li>Sky is the limit on designs and then seal it with top coat.</li>
            <li>love it .</li>
            <li>I love the colors they have available</li>
            <li>Wish more colors were available</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to find an easy at home</li>
            <li>Decided to do my own nails after saw I needed to cut my budget, thanks!</li>
            <li>thanks, love it!</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>Once I figured out how to properly use the base/top coat, my nails stayed in great condition and didn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li>The polish stays on for a full two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Sally Hansen is quite good, but almost twice the price, Red Carpet tends to recede from the edges of my nails before I can get them into the curer.  </li>
            <li>I will never have to pay full cost for nails</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it</li>
            <li>You can only use with LED light!</li>
            <li>Well I was glad they provided me with the extra bottle even though I paid for one.</li>
            <li>I love the gel polish and this really helps it last longer.</li>
            <li>but it certainly has not hurt either.</li>
            <li>So eventually I&#x27;m going to have so much primer</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>One was leaking a bit &amp; the other was fine.</li>
            <li>When I received my item, I was surprised to see TWO bottles!</li>
            <li>Very shiny and smooth, but I&#x27;m not sure why the gel primer and base/top coat have to come together.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>I had run out of the Gel Primer and didn&#x27;t want to purchase another complete set.  </li>
            <li>Most gels have both a top coat and a base coat; why?</li>
            <li>Using the light drying system it lasts at least a week or longer.</li>

            <li> The base and top coat dry in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if I will need to purchase online in the future.</li>
            <li> Plus, you can find it on sale at Walgreens and other places all the time.</li>
            <li> Now I can use all the other colors I have but still have the gel coating to keep the polish on.</li>
            <li> There is not much in the bottle, for the price that is my only complaint</li>
            <li> This product is both the base and top coat in one.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the Base and Top coat which came in the starter kit.</li>
            <li> The Base and Top coat and</li>
            <li> And no more waiting by a fan for  my nails to dry .better nails and less time</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t arrive in it black box as I thought it would</li>
            <li> Also, FYI I got this at Wal-Mart for less than $9.00.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I usually just file the product down and then add again.  </li>
            <li> the color polish both clumped and became hard on my nail and on the brush when I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> I tried to remove the hard coating that clumped on the brush, and the brush came apart.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ll probably never even use it all because I&#x27;m forced to buy it when I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> its very small for the price.</li>
            <li> I have gotten bored of the colors provided and didn&#x27;t want to keep spending $9 - $10 on each color.  </li>

            <li> Good product! You can only use with LED light!</li>
            <li> Of all the gel polishes,  this is by far the best set.  Using the light drying system it lasts at least a week or longer.</li>
            <li> I like this product however I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size of the bottle. it&#x27;s not the regular size bottle of polish. its very small for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Most gels have both a top coat and a base coat; why? I don&#x27;t know.  This product is both the base and top coat in one. It is easy to apply and the brush holds the perfect amount. The base and top coat dry in 30 seconds. Additionally, the container also holds their nourishing serum which is applied to the nails. I can&#x27;t tell what improvements it makes on the nail but it certainly has not hurt either.</li>
            <li> Buy it at Target because they sell this same item for $11.99. So far this product is working great!</li>
            <li> Instead of paying money to the nail shop, I bought what they USE in the nail shop. It is a great product. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Makes doing my gel nails at home a breeze</li>
            <li> When I received my item, I was surprised to see TWO bottles! One was leaking a bit &amp; the other was fine. It had a note that said they  have provided me with another bottle. It didn&#x27;t arrive in it black box as I thought it would, it just came in another yellow, bubble wrap envelope. Well I was glad they provided me with the extra bottle even though I paid for one.</li>
            <li> I like this Base/top refill kit.  It is so easy to apply, and then when you add your color it looks wonderful.  I find that it lasts up to more than two weeks.  I use nail tips and have been using this product now for over two months only have replaced by tips once.  I usually just file the product down and then add again.  It seems to work for my.  My job is a gardener at a museum and I am definitely impressed.  This product only needs to be applied when you redo your nails.</li>
            <li> I use this nail system and it works great. I no longer have to spend $35+ dollars on a gel mani. I can use this amazing product and do it at home for a fraction of the cost. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5stars because it&#x27;s the best at home gel nail kit i&#x27;ve found so far. I love the colors they have available and it&#x27;s really easy to use. I have my own LED lamp that I got off of eBay and I&#x27;ve had no problems using that instead of their lamp. If you&#x27;re looking to find an easy at home gel nail kit I suggest getting the SensatioNail brand. And make sure you use the base/top coat from this brand. I made the mistake initially of using a different base/top coat because I figured they were all created equal. Nope. But this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Very shiny and smooth, but I&#x27;m not sure why the gel primer and base/top coat have to come together. I wish the base/top coat could be purchased by itself but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. The primer will last forever and the base and top coat only lasts for about 10 manicures. So eventually I&#x27;m going to have so much primer that I&#x27;ll probably never even use it all because I&#x27;m forced to buy it when I don&#x27;t need it. Also, FYI I got this at Wal-Mart for less than $9.00.</li>
            <li> I love the gel polish and this really helps it last longer. Definitely worth it and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer. Decided to do my own nails after saw I needed to cut my budget, thanks!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product.  The polish stays on for a full two weeks.  I had run out of the Gel Primer and didn&#x27;t want to purchase another complete set.  The pharmacies are beginning to stock individual refills now so I&#x27;m not sure if I will need to purchase online in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the Base and Top coat which came in the starter kit. The Base and Top coat and the color polish both clumped and became hard on my nail and on the brush when I tried to use it. I thought it was because I had not used the product in many months, so I bought replacements. The first time I used this replacement bottle, it worked great. I just tried to use it a 2nd time, 3 weeks after I opened the package. The same thing happened again. It is unusable. I tried to remove the hard coating that clumped on the brush, and the brush came apart. If I had my receipt, I would return the product. It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Sensationail is the best home gel product!  I&#x27;ve tried them all...Sally Hansen is quite good, but almost twice the price, Red Carpet tends to recede from the edges of my nails before I can get them into the curer.  This never happens with Sensationail!  I highly recommend it!  Plus, you can find it on sale at Walgreens and other places all the time.</li>
            <li> Once I figured out how to properly use the base/top coat, my nails stayed in great condition and didn&#x27;t chip. I&#x27;m so happy I bought my own gel nail set.</li>
            <li> So, the original Nailene product is great...but you run out of stuff.  Tis is the same brand, works equally as well.</li>
            <li> I started doing my own nails almost a year ago because I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep going to the salon.  I have gotten bored of the colors provided and didn&#x27;t want to keep spending $9 - $10 on each color.  I decided to give regular nail polish a try and it worked!  Now I can use all the other colors I have but still have the gel coating to keep the polish on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only primer that doesn&#x27;t irritate my nails!</li>
            <li> you need to put uv protection in your product</li>
            <li> love gel nail polish and this is an affordable way to be able to do it yourself. thanks, love it!</li>
            <li> There is not much in the bottle, for the price that is my only complaint</li>
            <li> I will never have to pay full cost for nails and since I have purchased this kit in one month it has paid for itself.  My friends and family and people on the street offer to pay me to do there nails . Sky is the limit on designs and then seal it with top coat. And no more waiting by a fan for  my nails to dry .better nails and less time love it . Wish more colors were available</li>
