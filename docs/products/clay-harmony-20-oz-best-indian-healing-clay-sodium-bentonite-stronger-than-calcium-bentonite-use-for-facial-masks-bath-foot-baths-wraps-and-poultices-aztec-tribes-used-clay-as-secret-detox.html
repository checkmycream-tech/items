            <li>In my opinion, including &amp;#34;baths&amp;#34; in their headline was misleading and should either be removed, or should be qualified with additional information so people looking for clay baths will bypass this product and buy one that is more appropriate for their use.</li>

            <li>The sellers have been super though!</li>
            <li>It does not leave a smooth mask on the face.</li>
            <li>I used this clay as a facial mask using water and Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar with great results.</li>
            <li>I make my own skin products and have tried many many different ingredients.</li>

            <li>When I explained the purpose of my purchase, they immediately suggested the Ultra Pure version and sent a supply at no additional cost.</li>
            <li>I mix a large batch and keep it in the refrigerator....</li>

            <li>for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Many companies claim they stand behind their products until you make a claim.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Fast with shipping and the size of the product is deff worth the money. Much bigger than I thought. I just got mine yesterday and although I didn&#x27;t try it yet, I know I&#x27;ll LOVE it :)</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the the calcium clay but the sodium was just way too intense. I left the mask on maybe five mins too long and it literally burnt my face. Leaving blisters and red marks that hurt for days. The product is good just be careful.</li>
            <li> Good product with good customer service</li>
            <li> Too expensive for the size of the package! Other than that great quality! Buy with confidence,if you&#x27;re looking for quality clay!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product not knowing anything about the benefits of clay. This company responded immediately and help me understand and select the correct clay. When I explained the purpose of my purchase, they immediately suggested the Ultra Pure version and sent a supply at no additional cost. Many companies claim they stand behind their products until you make a claim. This company went the extra mile. Because the rash/infection on the leg goes from the ankle to the knee, it will take awhile. I use the clay in the Poultices form. It had an immediate effect on the rash. So far so good.</li>
            <li> i use clay often in our home, and this stuff is just weird..its like its been plasticized or something...does not mix well, takes forever to dry...i do not like it at all. I do love healing clays, but not this one. The sellers have been super though!</li>
            <li> My horse has a condition called scratches on his hind legs...he has had it&lt;br /&gt;for several years. I have tried every cream, lotion or potion on the&lt;br /&gt;market, OTC  or prescribed.....all of them help a bit but then there are always&lt;br /&gt;new  outbreaks. I&#x27;ve started using your clay as a paste three times a week and&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t  believe the relief my &amp;#34;Sam&amp;#34; has experienced. He is quite happy to&lt;br /&gt;wear  soothing  &amp;#34;clay sox&amp;#34; , it also keeps the flies away from in infected&lt;br /&gt;area. I mix a large batch and keep it in the refrigerator....Thank you , thank&lt;br /&gt;you.....</li>
            <li> The clay is very sticky. It is hard to apply it on the face. It does not leave a smooth mask on the face. I am not happy with what I purchased.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed when I learned after receipt of the product that the quantity provided is only sufficient for 1 to 2 baths. I was unable to determine that from the information provided prior to ordering the product. The recommended quantity for a bath is 8 to 16 ounces. Because the package is only 20 ounces to begin with, that means you can only get only 1 to 2 baths per package, which is not at all what I was seeking.  It appears this product is really setup for masks and perhaps foot baths (4 oz to 6 oz), but not actual baths. It would be helpful if they would be more forthcoming in their advertising. In my opinion, including &amp;#34;baths&amp;#34; in their headline was misleading and should either be removed, or should be qualified with additional information so people looking for clay baths will bypass this product and buy one that is more appropriate for their use.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful way to do a detox.  I use it as a foot bath for Mom who has Parkinsons disease.  She is unable to do a bath with her disease at this point so that is why we are doing the foot bath.  It is too soon to really notice a hugh difference as we just started this 2 months ago.  But I have been doing detox baths for years and swear by them.  It is the metals and toxins in our body&#x27;s that really cause disease as well as a poor diet and no exercise.</li>
            <li> Great customer service. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly. Good quality clay mask!</li>
            <li> This product is great I use I ttyl8r for my natural hair.  It helps keep my hair r clean.  I us e it once e&lt;br /&gt;A month to keep y hair healthy</li>
            <li> I just love this clay...its soft, smooth and so creamy on the skin! I feel super clean and refreshed after I use it in baths!!!</li>
            <li> I used this clay as a facial mask using water and Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar with great results. It left my skin feeling very clean and soft. I did follow up with a good moisturizer. I have read many review about how it reduces the size of pores and am looking forward&lt;br /&gt;to seeing the results.</li>
            <li> worked miracles when dermatologist had no answers</li>
            <li> Really nice and smooth clay...Liked for my face...not a fan for my hair!</li>
            <li> I make my own skin products and have tried many many different ingredients. This clay is the best. Mix it with organic castor oil and smear it thick on the face. After 10-20 minutes you&#x27;ll see little white bumps all over. It&#x27;s all the crap coming out of your skin! Wipes of with warm water and towel, but be warned, it is very sticky!</li>
            <li> When you give yourself a facial it will make you look years younger than you actually are.</li>
