            <li>Awesome idea to whoever created this.</li>
            <li>Great space saver!</li>
            <li>One of the best make-up purchases I have ever made!</li>
            <li>Wonderful way to organize all your makeup.  </li>
            <li>amazing for keeping organized and even saving money!!!.</li>
            <li>The best way to do this is with an oven (or you can use the plates of a flatiron although you run the risk of ruining your flatiron</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working out great.</li>
            <li>THE GOOD:</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Just a nice sleek Z pallet.</li>
            <li>Liked the Z Palette better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice palette.  </li>
            <li>but you will have to do your own research on that)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well and the magnet is good and strong.  </li>
            <li>they are very easy to use and i will explain how below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loved it came fast :)!!</li>
            <li>perfect for putting all of your favorite eye makeup in one place (apparently)</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>Felt better in my hand and was easier to use than MU Forever metal tin&lt;br</li>
            <li>More expensive&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would be better in a purse, but think about it...</li>
            <li>Will definately order more as my collection grows.</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>With that said, the case provides better protection to your makeup than most of the plastic cases they come in&lt;br</li>
            <li>As i have not stored powder and creams in the same case I haven&#x27;t experimented with the best way to prevent this from happening but off the top of my head i would suggest maybe leaving a tissue covering your cream products.</li>
            <li>You will find you can depot most any powder product, add a magnet, and pop it in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most always this will be either cardboard or plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you wont be able to do as many at one time)&lt;br</li>
            <li>as im sure you now metal can heat up in the oven and</li>
            <li>Love this it even comes with Magnets  </li>
            <li>Worked great, came fast.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is not my first palette,I like and good quality</li>
            <li>love the room and how light weight this is</li>
            <li>love love love worth every cent</li>
            <li>If you insert a screw driver into that gap and press upward the insert should easily pop out.</li>
            <li>This one 8s almost filled</li>
            <li>: These guys are great for a host of different functions.</li>
            <li>Study magnet, plastic protective cover for magnet to keep tray clean</li>
            <li>Once the horrid task of depotting your make up is done this fabulous palette clears up space and makes it easy to see exactly what you have.  </li>
            <li>From your every day makeup user to a Professional makeup artist, they will help anyone keep organized and tidy.</li>
            <li>these pans can and will get very hot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice and quick now to have everything together with just one lid to open!</li>
            <li>It can fit so much</li>
            <li>PRO: Was surprising sturdier than expected not being metal&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it just wish it came with more magnets as the back of the palette isnt quite strong enough to keep my eye shadows in place</li>
            <li>It feels more like high end glossy paper and cardboard with a clear, soft plastic sheet on the top.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super high quality!</li>
            <li>: the first warning i want to put out there is mac shadows do not magnetize well with these pallets.</li>
            <li>first thing you want to consider when depotting is what material the makeup is contained in.</li>
            <li>With the plastic melted you should be able to use your screw driver to poke the plastic enough to lift the metal up, then use your tweezers to separate it from the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These pallets are especially handy for the casual makeup user.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bigger than my other palettes so it doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly where I want it.</li>
            <li>I was able to fit in 15 small &amp; medium eye shadows, 4 contour colors, 1 powdered eyeliner and 7 blushes.</li>
            <li>most plastic containers whether they be single shadow or a pallet have three parts.</li>
            <li>This is a great investment and a terrific time-saver - you no longer have to open all of those individual pots!  </li>
            <li>and you have your whole look in a slim</li>
            <li>If you have some little spaces left between items, turn your square eye shadows so that a single point is at the top (diamond-shape) and you can squeeze more pots in!  </li>
            <li>WARNING heat will very quickly melt cream product so be careful with these in particular</li>
            <li>some cases you will get lucky and your metal pan is already properly magnetized for the Z Pallet.</li>
            <li>Most of the time the insert can be taken out easily by prying a small flat screw driver between the plastic insert and the bottom of the pallet.</li>
            <li>The top was a little unweildly for my taste</li>
            <li>Clear window showing shadows very helpful&lt;br</li>
            <li>when trying to pop out the makeup the metal pan can bend, If the pan bends to much this will cause your makeup to break (this can be fixed</li>
            <li>Now not only do I use eye shadows i used to never reach for because they weren&#x27;t right in front of me, It also has helped me know what colors i have.</li>
            <li>Switch out your favorite colors into a medium or small Z Palette for purse or travel.</li>
            <li>you are going to use it as i mentioned above with a cream foundation or concealer in it, be aware that those creams are a magnet for dust from the powders around it.</li>
            <li>(watch at first for all materials are different.</li>
            <li>That palette is pretty big</li>
            <li>You will enjoy the time-savings and the less clutter.</li>
            <li>if this is the case, make sure there is no glue residue left (if there is just cut a small sheet of paper out and use the glue to adhere it to the bottom side so that the glue wont stick to the pallet)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have expected something a little more substantial.</li>
            <li>If you cannot peel it off you can normally melt it off with the same process you used above to melt the glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> so sometimes you can simply use something flat to go between the cardboard and the metal pan to pop it out or cut the cardboard.</li>
            <li> I think the price for the palette is a little high for the quality of the materials used, however.  </li>
            <li> Generally a product that is encased in cardboard doesnt have a lot of glue holding it down</li>
            <li> if you wrap it in a tissue, the magnet should work through it and it would filter out any powder that tries to invade</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL though.</li>
            <li> the pan does not pop out when applying minimal pressure, then see the heating technique in the plastic section below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL.</li>
            <li> For example, in mac individual shadows, you will see at the point where the lid snaps closed to the case a small gap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They can get very messy with a broken shadow and for some reason the slick magnetic surface of the pallet proves to be very difficult to clean up any loose product, even while using a damp cloth.</li>
            <li> It cuts down on the clutter from bulky packaging.  </li>
            <li> Jordana baked shadows would not fit</li>
            <li> Now when i am browsing at sephora, if i see a green eye shadow that i like, i can just picture my green pallet in my head and say &amp;#34;HEY!</li>
            <li> Jordana baked shadows which are very round would not fit in either :</li>
            <li> No more bag of quads, singles or sets you have to sift through.</li>
            <li> I waited so long to order a very expensive palette for it to arrive broken!</li>
            <li> If it was not easily done before, or you were afraid you were going to break your eye shadow, then you will want to heat glue (and plastic)</li>
            <li> BAD</li>
            <li> I hated having to fish for the color</li>
            <li> I must say but the horrible part is that it arrived broken!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I hated having to fish for the color I knew I had in &#x27;one of these quads..&#x27; So I purchased a Z palette, this is my second one and I love them. Once the horrid task of depotting your make up is done this fabulous palette clears up space and makes it easy to see exactly what you have.  No more bag of quads, singles or sets you have to sift through. Just a nice sleek Z pallet. 🙌 yay!</li>
            <li> I love this! I ordered a ton of makeup from makeup geek and MAC just for this and it&#x27;s working out great. Not to mention when you buy the make up for this it&#x27;s a lot cheaper. This one 8s almost filled so I am definately planning on buying a second. Awesome idea to whoever created this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bigger than my other palettes so it doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly where I want it. But it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> AFREAKINGMAZING!! love the room and how light weight this is, I just wish it had a mirror or something in between so I could have two side instead of one.</li>
            <li> Love it just wish it came with more magnets as the back of the palette isnt quite strong enough to keep my eye shadows in place</li>
            <li> It is not my first palette,I like and good quality</li>
            <li> Great space saver! It also is deep enough to hold raised, domed blushes. If you have some little spaces left between items, turn your square eye shadows so that a single point is at the top (diamond-shape) and you can squeeze more pots in!  I was able to fit in 15 small &amp; medium eye shadows, 4 contour colors, 1 powdered eyeliner and 7 blushes. Take your blush brush and sweep it across your blushes to achieve an ombre, well-mixed shadowy color. This is a great investment and a terrific time-saver - you no longer have to open all of those individual pots!  Switch out your favorite colors into a medium or small Z Palette for purse or travel. Or have several - 1 for eye shadows, 1 for blush &amp; contour, 1 for eye liners, 1 for eyebrows!  You will enjoy the time-savings and the less clutter. It&#x27;s so nice and quick now to have everything together with just one lid to open!</li>
            <li> Tried this and the MU Forever version. Liked the Z Palette better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Z Palette&lt;br /&gt;  PRO: Was surprising sturdier than expected not being metal&lt;br /&gt;  PRO: Clear window showing shadows very helpful&lt;br /&gt;  PRO: Magnet sturdy for pots&lt;br /&gt;  PRO: Felt better in my hand and was easier to use than MU Forever metal tin&lt;br /&gt;  PRO:  Lid was easier to use on Z, MUF lid felt unwieldy&lt;br /&gt;  PRO:  Study magnet, plastic protective cover for magnet to keep tray clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; CON:  More expensive&lt;br /&gt;  CON:  Neither should be used in a purse as the shadows would crumble with movement&lt;br /&gt;  CON: Jordana baked shadows which are very round would not fit in either :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MU4Ever PROs&lt;br /&gt;  The top was a little unweildly for my taste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MU4Ever CONs&lt;br /&gt;  Would be better in a purse, but think about it...any heavy movement with either palette would cause the shadows to break up, so neither are really purse ready&lt;br /&gt;  Seem just a tad slimmer for my shadows than the Z Palette&lt;br /&gt;  Jordana baked shadows would not fit</li>
            <li> One of the best make-up purchases I have ever made!</li>
            <li> Nice palette.  Works well and the magnet is good and strong.  I think the price for the palette is a little high for the quality of the materials used, however.  I would have expected something a little more substantial. It feels more like high end glossy paper and cardboard with a clear, soft plastic sheet on the top. It makes it lighter for travel but not as luxurious as I would have hoped for at that price point.  It&#x27;s about the only thing out there, though, as a palette that&#x27;s versatile for all shapes of product pots.</li>
            <li> Loved it came fast :)!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful way to organize all your makeup.  It cuts down on the clutter from bulky packaging.  Will definately order more as my collection grows.</li>
            <li> Comes with metal magnetic metal stickers, so no need to buy additional!</li>
            <li> I love this palette. It can fit so much and it&#x27;s super high quality!</li>
            <li> THE GOOD: amazing for keeping organized and even saving money!!!. I have depotted every eye shadow pallet i owned, organized all the individuals by color, and popped them into z pallets. Now not only do I use eye shadows i used to never reach for because they weren&#x27;t right in front of me, It also has helped me know what colors i have. Now when i am browsing at sephora, if i see a green eye shadow that i like, i can just picture my green pallet in my head and say &amp;#34;HEY! i already have a color like that&amp;#34; instead of having to mentally go back through all my pallets. It has virtually stopped my buying of eye shadows because i actually know what i have now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pallet isn&#x27;t only meant for eye shadow. I have depotted blush, bronzers, highlighters, and even foundation and concealer. These pallets are especially handy for the casual makeup user. You buy one and can have everything you need in one slim pallet. a quad of eyeshadows, a duo of blushes, a compact powder or cream foundation and concealer and some pressed powder and you have your whole look in a slim case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD: the first warning i want to put out there is mac shadows do not magnetize well with these pallets. If you are planning on using a mac shadow you will need to use the provided magnetic stickers. they are very easy to use and i will explain how below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can get very messy with a broken shadow and for some reason the slick magnetic surface of the pallet proves to be very difficult to clean up any loose product, even while using a damp cloth. With that said, the case provides better protection to your makeup than most of the plastic cases they come in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you are going to use it as i mentioned above with a cream foundation or concealer in it, be aware that those creams are a magnet for dust from the powders around it. As i have not stored powder and creams in the same case I haven&#x27;t experimented with the best way to prevent this from happening but off the top of my head i would suggest maybe leaving a tissue covering your cream products. if you wrap it in a tissue, the magnet should work through it and it would filter out any powder that tries to invade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO SUM IT UP: These guys are great for a host of different functions. From your every day makeup user to a Professional makeup artist, they will help anyone keep organized and tidy. If you haven&#x27;t found them already, check out the slew of you tube videos on depotting makeup. You will find you can depot most any powder product, add a magnet, and pop it in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;if you haven&#x27;t researched or are a bit overwhelmed by you tube, here is a brief overview of how i depot makeup for the pallets. WARNING heat will very quickly melt cream product so be careful with these in particular&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the first thing you want to consider when depotting is what material the makeup is contained in. All of your makeup will be baked into a metal pan but what your trying to figure out is what the metal pan is attached to. Most always this will be either cardboard or plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMOVING THE EYE SHADOW FROM ITS CASE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR CARDBOARD: depending on the quality of the cardboard and the amount of glue that was used these can be quite simple. Generally a product that is encased in cardboard doesnt have a lot of glue holding it down so sometimes you can simply use something flat to go between the cardboard and the metal pan to pop it out or cut the cardboard. BE CAREFUL though. when trying to pop out the makeup the metal pan can bend, If the pan bends to much this will cause your makeup to break (this can be fixed but you will have to do your own research on that)&lt;br /&gt;If the pan does not pop out when applying minimal pressure, then see the heating technique in the plastic section below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR PLASTIC: most plastic containers whether they be single shadow or a pallet have three parts. The lid, the the bottom, and the insert. The insert iswhat the pans will be nested in. Most of the time the insert can be taken out easily by prying a small flat screw driver between the plastic insert and the bottom of the pallet. For example, in mac individual shadows, you will see at the point where the lid snaps closed to the case a small gap. If you insert a screw driver into that gap and press upward the insert should easily pop out. This will be the easiest way to remove your metal pan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removing the metal pan from the cardboard or plastic. If it was not easily done before, or you were afraid you were going to break your eye shadow, then you will want to heat glue (and plastic) that adheres the metal pan to its case. The best way to do this is with an oven (or you can use the plates of a flatiron although you run the risk of ruining your flatiron and you wont be able to do as many at one time)&lt;br /&gt;with the oven set it to about 200 and place the eye shadows inside on a piece of foil. wait about 5 - 10 minutes (watch at first for all materials are different. Glue will melt faster than the plastic)&lt;br /&gt;With cardboard it is now simply a matter of the glue melting enough to unstick the metal and then you can pull it off. BE CAREFUL. as im sure you now metal can heat up in the oven and these pans can and will get very hot. I suggest using tweezers for this part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic you may have to wait a bit longer. With the plastic melted you should be able to use your screw driver to poke the plastic enough to lift the metal up, then use your tweezers to separate it from the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ATTACHING YOUR MAGNET&lt;br /&gt;in some cases you will get lucky and your metal pan is already properly magnetized for the Z Pallet. if this is the case, make sure there is no glue residue left (if there is just cut a small sheet of paper out and use the glue to adhere it to the bottom side so that the glue wont stick to the pallet)&lt;br /&gt;If the metal is not already magnetic adhere one of the stickers that come with itto the bottom and pop it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont forget to take a sharpie and label the shadow, or alternatively, use the label that came with the shadow. If you cannot peel it off you can normally melt it off with the same process you used above to melt the glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;organize and play!</li>
