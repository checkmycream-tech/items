            <li>The pins will lock together and you will probably be amazed, happy, and hoard these like I do!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve seen them in the hair of others, and they look wonderful!  </li>
            <li>But they do hold my hair, so to be around the house they work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Practice makes perfect!</li>
            <li>Great for avoiding kinks in straightened hair that you want to put up.</li>

            <li>They are amazingly effective!</li>
            <li>I love it&#x27;s the best my friends like it and my mom?</li>
            <li>though it has its caveats and doesn&#x27;t work perfectly for me, Its wonderfully refreshing to have my hair up out of my way in a neat bun.</li>
            <li>They make putting your hair up so easy and it looks great!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and very easy to hide!</li>

            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>but for me they&#x27;re amazing.  </li>
            <li>A truly amazing product.</li>
            <li>I recommended to my friends because it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li>and I really liked them</li>
            <li>These are so handy if you want to put your hair into a bun.  </li>
            <li>These things are amazing, and SO easy to use!  </li>
            <li>you use them, just be sure that you are catching some of the hair that is on your head, or they won&#x27;t hold in place as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and comfortable too!</li>
            <li>Sometimes you hear about things being to good to be true</li>
            <li>Item has great length works great if you have medium to long hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and own lots of products to attempt to contain it.</li>
            <li>and I was so in love</li>
            <li>They work much better than bobby pins.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be able to do more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use a ponytail holder to put my hair up any more.</li>
            <li>I really think they are a great invention.</li>
            <li>However, if your hair has many layers it may not look as neat because of the stray hairs that comes out of the bun.</li>
            <li>and I like the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use so many bobby pins.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m more used to how I need to keep my hair together.</li>
            <li>These are ok.</li>
            <li>Seriously never been more impressed that a product was EXACTLY as advertised.</li>
            <li>There are many better products available that can be used to make the hair styles advertised and work much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another great thing: they&#x27;re seamless!</li>
            <li>, I do have to use a scrunchy to gather all of it in a pony tail first, but the bun doesn&#x27;t look cute as the pictures at all!  </li>
            <li>and they work so easily</li>
            <li>It is also easy to use and holds all day.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and remove.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would be good to keep my hair in place as a new mom.  </li>
            <li>They were comfortable in my hair too.</li>
            <li>These spin pins are too smooth to hold hair.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re anal about preventing damage like I am, you know how important that is.</li>
            <li>Genuine Goody Spin Pins have a smooth ball at the ends so you will not scratch you head if a pin goes close to the scalp, and so theyt glide through your hair.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t always have to do this if you feel its secure enough!&lt;br</li>
            <li>A cheap (yet pricey at $7)</li>
            <li>(which is becoming more often with my practice!), but the extra hair tie makes it feel much more secure to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing the Goody Spin Pin Mini  in my hair right now and LOVE them.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very long and thick,..these pins hold my hair in a bun nicely , recommend them better then elastics!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are shorter then the genuine Goody Spin Pins by 1 full</li>
            <li>I re-twisted it, but it wouldn&#x27;t stay in its original shape, and was ineffective for use in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>They give a very grippy hold, and since they are spirals, they go through the hair in many places at once.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love these pins.</li>
            <li>well this one is actually true.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They really do keep your hair in a secure bun all day.  </li>
            <li>so they are worth it.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not quite secure enough for me to use during workouts, but for everyday use, they&#x27;re wonderful!</li>
            <li>These pins work far better than bobby pins for me, but even if I end up using three the bun will still start sliding out within an hour or two and requires me re-pinning.</li>
            <li>insert comes with instructions for how to use these for three different styles, but they&#x27;re really versatile to use for any kind of bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I twist it into a loose bun or french twist and run two of these through it, and I&#x27;m good to go through dance class or all day!</li>
            <li>Thankfully, they&#x27;re super easy to throw in your hair and it only takes a minute to fix the updo!</li>
            <li>I even slept in them the first night and awoke with a bun on my head still.</li>
            <li>I suggest checking there first.</li>
            <li>That is pretty remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>You can also make many different styles with them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed (for me) that the higher you place the bun on your head,</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t work out the first time, try again to get the feel of working the pins in your hair.</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair but a lot of it, two of these babies easily hold my hair in a nice tight bun all day if I need it to.</li>
            <li>These pins do have decent hold, but you still have to be careful when styling your hair to make sure it is secure.</li>
            <li>Can do so many things with them and they hold like a dream - never need to resort to 18,000 bobby pins to keep my thick, fine hair in place again!</li>
            <li>(it works better for me if I do a half bun vs full)</li>
            <li>Works great on wet Or dry hair.</li>
            <li>, I happily relied on these daily for a few months, and I wish they had been better-quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!  </li>
            <li>I bought mine from NY Discounts and they were REAL GOODY.</li>
            <li>really like them.</li>
            <li>For an extra measure, I secure a hair tie around the finished bun to keep it in place.</li>
            <li>While the bun stays with just the two pins, I like to fasten an extra hair tie around to secure the bun for it to stay in longer.</li>
            <li>absolutely be returning this for a refund.</li>
            <li>It really does work and</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried bobby pins (good quality ones) as well as thick clips and nothing</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased the mini pins (which comes with three smaller spin pins) and they worked</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also want to be sure that you don&#x27;t accidentally lock them into each other when you&#x27;re twisting each one into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Two spin pins hold all of it quite well and quite comfortably all day long.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve been looking for better ways to keep my hair up in dance classes, and I was curious enough that I thought these were worth a try.</li>
            <li>I guess for somebody with less hair it would look much better.  </li>
            <li>First place one pin, then place the second pin at a 90 degree angle intersecting the first pin.</li>
            <li>I love these Goody Spin Pins and now have two sets of the larger ones, as well as the smaller three-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about several times struggling with my hair after my purchase, my buns fell apart just as quickly as my army of scrunchies.</li>
            <li>I was able to make a tight bun, as well as a looser \\&quot;messy\\&quot; bun.</li>
            <li>Love these little guys.  </li>
            <li>These pins, while expensive, are great for holding buns in place.</li>
            <li>They work just as well as my usual scrunchy and are suitable for the office.</li>
            <li>I can put up my hair up in a bun, make it neat or messy and love the way my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy a few more sets to stash in my purse, car, desk, ...</li>
            <li>then I section off my hair into two sections and make a small bun on each side making sure I twist the hair really well before twisting into a bun.</li>
            <li>well, i&#x27;m sure they work on hair slightly longer than mine!  </li>
            <li>Occasionally I don&#x27;t have to do this if I miraculously manage to get it right</li>
            <li>Super easy way to keep my long hair up, and not even half as damaging as using hair ties.</li>
            <li>, I own them in both the short and long versions - dark hair for my chestnut hair, and light hair for my blonde daughter.</li>
            <li>also like using these at night to make a soft, high bun</li>
            <li>After hurrying to the grocery market to purchase these after watching the enticing commercial, I&#x27;ll admit I was pretty eager to try these</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll definitely get results ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I would definitely give two a try first.</li>
            <li>are unfinished on the edges, and came in a cheap bag, not original packaging.  </li>
            <li>However once I started using spin pins that problem is fixed.</li>
            <li>These Spin pins hold your style in place and are nearly invisible in your hair.</li>
            <li>It makes a soft bun</li>
            <li>I have long and very wavy hair and am always looking for something to hold my hair up.  </li>
            <li>Yes, they&#x27;re more expensive than traditional hairpins, but they&#x27;re absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>my husband removed it and smoothed it over, but if he hadn&#x27;t done such a good job, the place would definitely have snagged and broken my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These hold your bun nice and tight for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li>Most bobby pins are slightly uncomfortable and can pull at hair when removed even gently.</li>
            <li>; I have shoulder length, straight and sleek Asian hair that I never know what to do with besides the basic pony tail and braid.</li>
            <li>Love these suckers!</li>
            <li>I just got back from the Dollar Tree store and found the same exact product there only for $1.00.</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t try to grip too little hair with them, they will pretty much hold any style together.&lt;br</li>
            <li>little background information first</li>
            <li>Currently a bun isn&#x27;t very achievable due to the layers in my hair</li>
            <li>seamless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product on Amazon from seller &#x27;Down Home Styles&#x27; and received the real deal, in sealed Goody packaging.</li>
            <li>After watching countless youtube videos and determined practicing to get this right, my hair finally managed to stay in a messy bun.</li>
            <li>And because I don&#x27;t have to cinch my hair up tightly to get it to stay put, not only do I not get headaches like I used to get from tight or heavy ponytails, but I can take my hair down at the end of the day and it still looks great - no wave across the back of my head where there had been a ponytail holder binding it together!</li>
            <li>Its a little hard to explain this through text, but when inserting the pinsmake sure you weave them slowly up and down like a sewing needle for it to gather more hair</li>
            <li>If you are the type who likes to have a lose twisted bun on your head after your hair dries to give large waves this is perfect since the alternative with a hair tie leaves behind a dent (at least in my thin/med hair).</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried bobby pins (good quality ones) as well as thick clips and nothing</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased the mini pins (which comes with three smaller spin pins) and they worked</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also want to be sure that you don&#x27;t accidentally lock them into each other when you&#x27;re twisting each one into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Two spin pins hold all of it quite well and quite comfortably all day long.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve been looking for better ways to keep my hair up in dance classes, and I was curious enough that I thought these were worth a try.</li>
            <li> I guess for somebody with less hair it would look much better.  </li>
            <li> First place one pin, then place the second pin at a 90 degree angle intersecting the first pin.</li>
            <li> I love these Goody Spin Pins and now have two sets of the larger ones, as well as the smaller three-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about several times struggling with my hair after my purchase, my buns fell apart just as quickly as my army of scrunchies.</li>
            <li> I was able to make a tight bun, as well as a looser \\&quot;messy\\&quot; bun.</li>
            <li> Love these little guys.  </li>
            <li> These pins, while expensive, are great for holding buns in place.</li>
            <li> They work just as well as my usual scrunchy and are suitable for the office.</li>
            <li> I can put up my hair up in a bun, make it neat or messy and love the way my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy a few more sets to stash in my purse, car, desk, ...</li>
            <li> then I section off my hair into two sections and make a small bun on each side making sure I twist the hair really well before twisting into a bun.</li>
            <li> well, i&#x27;m sure they work on hair slightly longer than mine!  </li>
            <li> Occasionally I don&#x27;t have to do this if I miraculously manage to get it right</li>
            <li> Super easy way to keep my long hair up, and not even half as damaging as using hair ties.</li>
            <li> , I own them in both the short and long versions - dark hair for my chestnut hair, and light hair for my blonde daughter.</li>
            <li> also like using these at night to make a soft, high bun</li>
            <li> After hurrying to the grocery market to purchase these after watching the enticing commercial, I&#x27;ll admit I was pretty eager to try these</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definitely get results ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I would definitely give two a try first.</li>
            <li> are unfinished on the edges, and came in a cheap bag, not original packaging.  </li>
            <li> However once I started using spin pins that problem is fixed.</li>
            <li> These Spin pins hold your style in place and are nearly invisible in your hair.</li>
            <li> It makes a soft bun</li>
            <li> I have long and very wavy hair and am always looking for something to hold my hair up.  </li>
            <li> Yes, they&#x27;re more expensive than traditional hairpins, but they&#x27;re absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> my husband removed it and smoothed it over, but if he hadn&#x27;t done such a good job, the place would definitely have snagged and broken my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These hold your bun nice and tight for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li> Most bobby pins are slightly uncomfortable and can pull at hair when removed even gently.</li>
            <li> ; I have shoulder length, straight and sleek Asian hair that I never know what to do with besides the basic pony tail and braid.</li>
            <li> Love these suckers!</li>
            <li> I just got back from the Dollar Tree store and found the same exact product there only for $1.00.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t try to grip too little hair with them, they will pretty much hold any style together.&lt;br</li>
            <li> little background information first</li>
            <li> Currently a bun isn&#x27;t very achievable due to the layers in my hair</li>
            <li> seamless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product on Amazon from seller &#x27;Down Home Styles&#x27; and received the real deal, in sealed Goody packaging.</li>
            <li> After watching countless youtube videos and determined practicing to get this right, my hair finally managed to stay in a messy bun.</li>
            <li> And because I don&#x27;t have to cinch my hair up tightly to get it to stay put, not only do I not get headaches like I used to get from tight or heavy ponytails, but I can take my hair down at the end of the day and it still looks great - no wave across the back of my head where there had been a ponytail holder binding it together!</li>
            <li> Its a little hard to explain this through text, but when inserting the pinsmake sure you weave them slowly up and down like a sewing needle for it to gather more hair</li>
            <li> If you are the type who likes to have a lose twisted bun on your head after your hair dries to give large waves this is perfect since the alternative with a hair tie leaves behind a dent (at least in my thin/med hair).</li>
            <li> I have incredibly long and thick hair and these pins were able to keep my hair up in a tight bun for an entire day with no need to readjust!</li>
            <li> can do a french twist and it holds all day long and</li>
            <li> I have these in both long and short.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length layered hair and it&#x27;s pretty thick</li>
            <li> My favorite hair style is a bun which is hard when you have ridiculously thick hair like me.</li>
            <li> but prior I had very long thick straight hair and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> Helps hole up her long curly hair without the pull of rubber bands.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> I use one pin per bun and it holds all night long.</li>
            <li> Half the time, I only have to use one to hold a simple style.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair that you put up on occasion, you NEED these!</li>
            <li> I bought these to hold a french twist in place and they worked extremely well.</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry after a shower in the evening until is about 90% dry</li>
            <li> Also, they only lasted for a few months- after that, one of them totally spazzed out in my hair</li>
            <li> Certainly not a new Goody</li>
            <li> I have very very long hair, and a single pin keeps my hair up neatly all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are almost black in color not deep brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only wish they made these in plain silver for those of us who have decided not to color our long graying hair.  </li>
            <li> I have attempted to do buns with an arsenal of bobby pins and hair ties, but after a while it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble after my weak buns fell apart almost instantly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only little pieces of my bangs/sides fall out.  </li>
            <li> Color is just what I wanted though size-wise they are a little smaller than I had imagined, but still work.</li>
            <li> Works fine so not a huge issue if it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I have very thick straight hair</li>
            <li> My only complaint was I ordered a quantity of two packages but only got one.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this if you have thin hair/not too much hair</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that extends several inches below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical when I bought them, but now I wear them in my hair almost every</li>
            <li> wish I had heeded the other one-star reviews.  </li>
            <li> I think if you have really coarse thick heavy hair you might actually need three.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are not the real deal they are fake,  knock-offs,</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about these actually holding my thick hair, but they really work.</li>
            <li> I have semi thick asian hair 5inches pass my shoulders and this worked.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase any other pins for my hair again!</li>
            <li> BUT I have medium thick hair and these seem really long as they poke out the other side.</li>
            <li> When I use elastics to hold a bun, gravity pulls it down in less than 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This arrived with no goody brand packaging and was black in color.</li>
            <li> I also have slightly layered hair</li>
            <li> ends are sharp, and raw.  </li>
            <li> but then my hold is not as tight.</li>
            <li> but I was skeptical the first time if it would work with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> You actually hear your hair being broken as you twist one in and will scratch your scalp if you get the pin too</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> Its a fantastic product after a little practice, but minus one star for the horrible instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have trouble doing anything but a bun with them, and I usually find it easier to put up with damp</li>
            <li> I have very long, very thick hair</li>
            <li> I think the goody ones are dark brown unless they have a secret black pin line I haven&#x27;t seen in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well they would work for individuals with thin/fine hair</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure how else to describe it.</li>
            <li> but I still have a hard time imagining them holding anything but the thickest hair.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s hard to pin sometimes.</li>
            <li> However, these don&#x27;t work well with thick hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair like me, you are tired of stretching out your bobby pins when you style your hair.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately these are not as sturdy and storng as the goody brand ones I usually buy.</li>
            <li> so sometimes my hair sticks out in awkward places that I have to pin down with a bobby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;legs\\&quot; splayed apart and twisted in different directions and it was very difficult to get it out.).</li>
            <li> The Spin Pins works well despite my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s just bent metal!</li>
            <li> disappointment with them is that they are not as well-made as they could be.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how expensive these are for just TWO hairpins!</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of twisting and untwisting Spin Pins, you will not be disappointed.  </li>

            <li> These pins do have decent hold, but you still have to be careful when styling your hair to make sure it is secure.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and own lots of products to attempt to contain it. Most bobby pins are slightly uncomfortable and can pull at hair when removed even gently. I tried these on a fluke and I was so in love, I own them in both the short and long versions - dark hair for my chestnut hair, and light hair for my blonde daughter. The pins spin in and never hit my scalp or pull my hair. First place one pin, then place the second pin at a 90 degree angle intersecting the first pin. The pins will lock together and you will probably be amazed, happy, and hoard these like I do!</li>
            <li> These pins, while expensive, are great for holding buns in place. They work much better than bobby pins. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> well, i&#x27;m sure they work on hair slightly longer than mine!  i&#x27;ve seen them in the hair of others, and they look wonderful!  must keep trying.....</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length layered hair and it&#x27;s pretty thick and I&#x27;ve tried bobby pins (good quality ones) as well as thick clips and nothing holds a bun or a twist.  Currently a bun isn&#x27;t very achievable due to the layers in my hair but prior I had very long thick straight hair and nothing worked.  I had originally purchased the mini pins (which comes with three smaller spin pins) and they worked okay but they didn&#x27;t hold for hours on end.  I purchased the bigger ones for my sister and I really liked them so I bought them for myself as well the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can do a french twist and it holds all day long and only little pieces of my bangs/sides fall out.  I highly recommend these!  I am absolutely in love with them and they work so easily and you can&#x27;t even tell they&#x27;re in my hair.  I&#x27;m not sure how well they would work for individuals with thin/fine hair but for me they&#x27;re amazing.  Before I would just put my hair in a ponytail and call it a day but now I can do a french twist and as soon as it grows out some I&#x27;ll be able to do more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase any other pins for my hair again!</li>
            <li> Love this item because I no longer have to use Hair bands or pins! Item has great length works great if you have medium to long hair. Works great on wet Or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about these actually holding my thick hair, but they really work. I was able to make a tight bun, as well as a looser \\&quot;messy\\&quot; bun. They were comfortable in my hair too. I like them.</li>
            <li> Love these little guys.  Kinda pricey, but I can&#x27;t see them breaking ... ever ... so they are worth it.  You just twist a couple of these into your bun and it stays and stays.  No pulling and hair breakage like with claws and bobby pins.  Once you get the hang of twisting and untwisting Spin Pins, you will not be disappointed.  I only wish they made these in plain silver for those of us who have decided not to color our long graying hair.  When my hair gets a bit grayer, I will likely spray paint mine silver.  I have these in both long and short.  Both sizes work well.  If your bun is smallish, purchase the smaller ones.  They hold just as well.</li>
            <li> I just found the Goody Spin Pins.  I have long and very wavy hair and am always looking for something to hold my hair up.  I&#x27;m wearing the Goody Spin Pin Mini  in my hair right now and LOVE them.  I can put up my hair up in a bun, make it neat or messy and love the way my hair looks.  I definitely would recommend trying the Goody Spin Pins.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be good to keep my hair in place as a new mom.  However, these don&#x27;t work well with thick hair.  I would recommend this if you have thin hair/not too much hair (it works better for me if I do a half bun vs full)</li>
            <li> Spin Pins are amazing! Love these suckers! Can do so many things with them and they hold like a dream - never need to resort to 18,000 bobby pins to keep my thick, fine hair in place again!</li>
            <li> Seriously never been more impressed that a product was EXACTLY as advertised. I bought mine from NY Discounts and they were REAL GOODY. No pain when they slide against your scalp. And no matter how or where in a twist or bun you place them they stay put I even slept in them the first night and awoke with a bun on my head still. If you are the type who likes to have a lose twisted bun on your head after your hair dries to give large waves this is perfect since the alternative with a hair tie leaves behind a dent (at least in my thin/med hair). Can&#x27;t say enough but 5STARS</li>
            <li> My favorite hair style is a bun which is hard when you have ridiculously thick hair like me. However once I started using spin pins that problem is fixed.</li>
            <li> Color is just what I wanted though size-wise they are a little smaller than I had imagined, but still work.</li>
            <li> Works well and keeps bun in place. BUT I have medium thick hair and these seem really long as they poke out the other side. I tried adjusting them but then my hold is not as tight.</li>
            <li> Super easy way to keep my long hair up, and not even half as damaging as using hair ties. Love them!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that extends several inches below my shoulders. Two spin pins hold all of it quite well and quite comfortably all day long. A truly amazing product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how expensive these are for just TWO hairpins! I mean, it&#x27;s just bent metal! But I&#x27;ve been looking for better ways to keep my hair up in dance classes, and I was curious enough that I thought these were worth a try. If you have long hair that you put up on occasion, you NEED these! They are amazingly effective! I don&#x27;t even use a ponytail holder to put my hair up any more. I twist it into a loose bun or french twist and run two of these through it, and I&#x27;m good to go through dance class or all day! And because I don&#x27;t have to cinch my hair up tightly to get it to stay put, not only do I not get headaches like I used to get from tight or heavy ponytails, but I can take my hair down at the end of the day and it still looks great - no wave across the back of my head where there had been a ponytail holder binding it together! Yes, they&#x27;re more expensive than traditional hairpins, but they&#x27;re absolutely worth it. I&#x27;m going to buy a few more sets to stash in my purse, car, desk, ...wherever I might feel the need to put my hair up.</li>
            <li> These are so handy if you want to put your hair into a bun.  I really think they are a great invention.</li>
            <li> I love these Goody Spin Pins and now have two sets of the larger ones, as well as the smaller three-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The insert comes with instructions for how to use these for three different styles, but they&#x27;re really versatile to use for any kind of bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use them, just be sure that you are catching some of the hair that is on your head, or they won&#x27;t hold in place as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also want to be sure that you don&#x27;t accidentally lock them into each other when you&#x27;re twisting each one into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like using these at night to make a soft, high bun so I can watch TV and rest my head on a pillow, without something digging into my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These hold your bun nice and tight for everyday wear.  They&#x27;re not quite secure enough for me to use during workouts, but for everyday use, they&#x27;re wonderful!</li>
            <li> The Spin Pins works well despite my very thick hair. It is also easy to use and holds all day. However, if your hair has many layers it may not look as neat because of the stray hairs that comes out of the bun. For me, it is easier to use the Spin Pins to make a bun rather than a regular hair tie.</li>
            <li> Great for avoiding kinks in straightened hair that you want to put up.</li>
            <li> These spin pins are too smooth to hold hair. I guess it might depend on your hair texture - mine is medium thickness and wavy - but I still have a hard time imagining them holding anything but the thickest hair. As it is, they slide out after a couple minutes. I think they would work if they were spray-covered with a suede-type finish.</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s the best my friends like it and my mom? I recommended to my friends because it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my DIL.  Helps hole up her long curly hair without the pull of rubber bands.&lt;br /&gt;She really like them.</li>
            <li> This arrived with no goody brand packaging and was black in color. I think the goody ones are dark brown unless they have a secret black pin line I haven&#x27;t seen in stores. Works fine so not a huge issue if it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed. These were so simple to use. You just make a bun and cork screw these in; it couldn&#x27;t be any easier.&lt;br /&gt;Over 12 hours later, my hair is still in a bun! When I use elastics to hold a bun, gravity pulls it down in less than 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing: they&#x27;re seamless! If you&#x27;re anal about preventing damage like I am, you know how important that is. Seams and imperfections on combs, brushes, and accessories damage your hair cuticle, which causes frizz and tangles. No worries about that with these! Even the bulb tip on the ends are seamless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product on Amazon from seller &#x27;Down Home Styles&#x27; and received the real deal, in sealed Goody packaging.</li>
            <li> My sister mentioned this product to me but I was skeptical the first time if it would work with my thick hair.It actually did and I like the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use so many bobby pins.I just got back from the Dollar Tree store and found the same exact product there only for $1.00. What a deal! If you have a Dollar Tree in your area I suggest checking there first. So happy to get bargains like this.</li>
            <li> Sold by - bought from: NotJustWigs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not the real deal they are fake,  knock-offs, counterfeit!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ends are sharp, and raw.  Genuine Goody Spin Pins have a smooth ball at the ends so you will not scratch you head if a pin goes close to the scalp, and so theyt glide through your hair.  You actually hear your hair being broken as you twist one in and will scratch your scalp if you get the pin too close!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do not come in the correct packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are shorter then the genuine Goody Spin Pins by 1 full spiral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are almost black in color not deep brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are being returned ASAP!</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair (about 3 inches below shoulders), wavy and lots and lots of it, two regular size of these pins hold my bun, I do have to use a scrunchy to gather all of it in a pony tail first, but the bun doesn&#x27;t look cute as the pictures at all!  I guess for somebody with less hair it would look much better.  But they do hold my hair, so to be around the house they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m just discovering spin pins! They make putting your hair up so easy and it looks great!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  There are many better products available that can be used to make the hair styles advertised and work much better.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair like me, you are tired of stretching out your bobby pins when you style your hair. These Spin pins hold your style in place and are nearly invisible in your hair. They are easy to use and remove. It is my go to for a no stress bun!</li>
            <li> I have semi thick asian hair 5inches pass my shoulders and this worked.  It makes a soft bun and I didn&#x27;t need to add any pins for it to stay... although some layered hair may need pins to keep stray hairs in check.</li>
            <li> I have very very long hair, and a single pin keeps my hair up neatly all day. In fact, I forgot I had it in and slept with it in last night, and woke up to my hair still in a bun! That is pretty remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;Love these things. They work just as well as my usual scrunchy and are suitable for the office.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very thick hair and these will hold up just about any style. Very easy to use and very easy to hide! Half the time, I only have to use one to hold a simple style.</li>
            <li> I bought these to hold a french twist in place and they worked extremely well. They give a very grippy hold, and since they are spirals, they go through the hair in many places at once. Each one of these is like using five regular hair pins! You can also make many different styles with them. As long as you don&#x27;t try to grip too little hair with them, they will pretty much hold any style together.&lt;br /&gt;My disappointment with them is that they are not as well-made as they could be. When I got mine, one of the plastic beads on the end of a wire had an extra piece of plastic sticking off of it- my husband removed it and smoothed it over, but if he hadn&#x27;t done such a good job, the place would definitely have snagged and broken my hair. Also, they only lasted for a few months- after that, one of them totally spazzed out in my hair (I&#x27;m not sure how else to describe it. The \\&quot;legs\\&quot; splayed apart and twisted in different directions and it was very difficult to get it out.). I re-twisted it, but it wouldn&#x27;t stay in its original shape, and was ineffective for use in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I happily relied on these daily for a few months, and I wish they had been better-quality.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly long and thick hair and these pins were able to keep my hair up in a tight bun for an entire day with no need to readjust! Very easy to use and comfortable too!</li>
            <li> These things are amazing, and SO easy to use!  I was pretty skeptical when I bought them, but now I wear them in my hair almost every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They really do keep your hair in a secure bun all day.  I have trouble doing anything but a bun with them, and I usually find it easier to put up with damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just pull your hair into a twist, roll the hair over into a bun shape, and twist these into the bun in an &amp;#34;X&amp;#34;.  It holds all day with NO falling out!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have shorter hair, I recommend using these in conjunction with the smaller set of 3 (http://www.amazon.com/Goody-Simple-Styles-assorted-colors/dp/B0055Y9AIY/)</li>
            <li> After hurrying to the grocery market to purchase these after watching the enticing commercial, I&#x27;ll admit I was pretty eager to try these on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background information first; I have shoulder length, straight and sleek Asian hair that I never know what to do with besides the basic pony tail and braid. I have attempted to do buns with an arsenal of bobby pins and hair ties, but after a while it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble after my weak buns fell apart almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about several times struggling with my hair after my purchase, my buns fell apart just as quickly as my army of scrunchies. Goody&#x27;s instructions were simple, but might&#x27;ve been TO simple because my hair just wasn&#x27;t staying. After watching countless youtube videos and determined practicing to get this right, my hair finally managed to stay in a messy bun. For an extra measure, I secure a hair tie around the finished bun to keep it in place. Occasionally I don&#x27;t have to do this if I miraculously manage to get it right (which is becoming more often with my practice!), but the extra hair tie makes it feel much more secure to me. I also have slightly layered hair so sometimes my hair sticks out in awkward places that I have to pin down with a bobby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I finally have the hang of it, I&#x27;m more used to how I need to keep my hair together. Its a fantastic product after a little practice, but minus one star for the horrible instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Some caveats/hints to the ladies with hair like mine who are struggling:&lt;br /&gt;- While the bun stays with just the two pins, I like to fasten an extra hair tie around to secure the bun for it to stay in longer. You don&#x27;t always have to do this if you feel its secure enough!&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve noticed (for me) that the higher you place the bun on your head, the easier it is to make without the use of an extra hair tie above! It also stays in longer&lt;br /&gt;- Its a little hard to explain this through text, but when inserting the pinsmake sure you weave them slowly up and down like a sewing needle for it to gather more hair&lt;br /&gt;- Practice makes perfect! If it doesn&#x27;t work out the first time, try again to get the feel of working the pins in your hair. You&#x27;ll definitely get results ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it has its caveats and doesn&#x27;t work perfectly for me, Its wonderfully refreshing to have my hair up out of my way in a neat bun. I&#x27;d definitely buy another pair to replace if I ever lose these!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love these pins. I will admit that I have very thick straight hair that&#x27;s hard to pin sometimes. These pins work far better than bobby pins for me, but even if I end up using three the bun will still start sliding out within an hour or two and requires me re-pinning. Thankfully, they&#x27;re super easy to throw in your hair and it only takes a minute to fix the updo!</li>
            <li> I have long hair and I always tend to break pony elastics.  I saw this product endorsed by a celebrity in a magazine and decided to try them out.  These hold my hair in place but don&#x27;t give me a headache.  I love them!</li>
            <li> These are NOT Goody brand Simple Styles Spin Pins.&lt;br /&gt;They are unfinished on the edges, and came in a cheap bag, not original packaging.  Certainly not a new Goody product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had heeded the other one-star reviews.  A cheap (yet pricey at $7) knock-off of what seems to be a neat invention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will absolutely be returning this for a refund.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you hear about things being to good to be true well this one is actually true. It really does work and well. I have long fine hair but a lot of it, two of these babies easily hold my hair in a nice tight bun all day if I need it to. I have been using these in the evening to create a wavy look for the am. I let my hair dry after a shower in the evening until is about 90% dry then I section off my hair into two sections and make a small bun on each side making sure I twist the hair really well before twisting into a bun. I use one pin per bun and it holds all night long. The next morning BAM instant waves. I think if you have really coarse thick heavy hair you might actually need three. But I would definitely give two a try first. My only complaint was I ordered a quantity of two packages but only got one. But they carry these at my local drug store for $6.99 which I believe ended up being cheaper than amazon with the shipping. But that is a separate issue.</li>
            <li> These are ok. But unfortunately these are not as sturdy and storng as the goody brand ones I usually buy. They don&#x27;t keep my hair up as well.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and thick,..these pins hold my hair in a bun nicely , recommend them better then elastics! Though I wouldn&#x27;t run if I had these on, starts to loosen up.</li>
            <li> After yoga, my hair always looked like a bird&#x27;s nest, and I had to keep redoing my ponytail or buns. With this, my hair stays in place through the office, yoga, and home. I wish I would&#x27;ve found this product a million years ago</li>
