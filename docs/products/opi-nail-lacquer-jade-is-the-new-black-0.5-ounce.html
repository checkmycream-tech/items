            <li>We Love it!</li>
            <li>The color is nice</li>
            <li>But eh, each to their own.</li>
            <li>Really nice color.</li>
            <li>I actually liked that color it changed to more.</li>
            <li>Not disappointed, good application.</li>
            <li>I tend to go for more neutral colors</li>
            <li>I visited the OPI website to look at the colors there just to make sure I was getting what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>i dont normally gravitate to greens but this color is so beautiful .</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this polish at 1st.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments.</li>
            <li>Out of my two favourite brands, Opi comes on top over China Glaze.</li>
            <li>This color is okay.</li>
            <li>Best shade of green I own.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Jade is the New Black&amp;#34; is very opaque and provides smooth excellent coverage.  </li>
            <li>It looks fantastic on.  </li>
            <li>Gorgeous color looks like it should look great against darker skin, but alas it does not work for me.</li>
            <li>i bought this polish because i was looking for a green polish and this one is wonderful and exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>Some of the names were worthy of a sigh and and a roll of the eyes).</li>
            <li>It was also shipped to me really quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly how it looks online and in the bottle!</li>
            <li>this polish is between a jade and an emerald green and is a great color for Christmas and winter.</li>
            <li>OPI makes such cool colors with creative names.</li>
            <li>Exactly the color I needed for my Lady Loki nails.</li>
            <li>will Oder more in the future!</li>
            <li>Loved this color so much I hunted it down!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the cheap fast-drying topcoat I use or the polish itself, but this one tends to chip badly-as in, the entire nail coat will fall off in one sheet within 1-2 days of application.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and wears well.</li>
            <li>it seems to stay on better than other brands.</li>
            <li>It is a nice green!</li>
            <li>This particular item seemed watery</li>
            <li>It was a little more dull of a color than I thought, but I still really enjoyed it!</li>
            <li>Lovely shade of medium green.</li>
            <li>the color is more like a forest green.</li>
            <li>I love green &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>The first two were very Blue</li>
            <li>I love this shade of green!</li>
            <li>It is an amazing medium to dark green!</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about Opi products is that some of the names that are meant to be cleverly humourous aren&#x27;t hitting the target (like their German collection.</li>
            <li>This nail polish is true to the color shown in the picture, solid green with no frost.  </li>
            <li>The jade colour is rich and highly pigmented, and will last quite a while if used correctly and a base and top coat are applied to the nail.</li>
            <li>In particular, my favourites from Opi are Russian Navy and Jade is the New Black.</li>
            <li>but maybe this particular vendor provided a watered down polish.</li>

            <li> I got Jade is the new black and</li>
            <li> I have tried, Lost my Chzechbook, Teal the cows come home, and Jade is the new black.</li>
            <li> the cows come home and Jade is the new black and see if I get the color I am looking for.</li>
            <li> The color is a soft neutral medium green (no yellow tint al all).  </li>
            <li> OPI combines fashion forward colors with long wearability.  </li>
            <li> Jade is the New Black!!</li>
            <li> Little darker than your traditional jade.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a little different.</li>
            <li> But once I applied it on, with 3 coats you get a solid green.  </li>
            <li> Green polish has been my standard nail color for about two years.  </li>
            <li> Darker shade than expected</li>
            <li> and when I went back I took down the name!!</li>
            <li> This has happened each time I&#x27;ve worn this color, and never with any other OPI polish I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It is green but is subtle enough to go with my blue jeans, etc.  </li>
            <li> Well today is St. Patrick&#x27;s Day and, of course, I have on my green nail polish.  </li>
            <li> would recommend if you like green.</li>
            <li> This went on smoothly, no streaks or patches.</li>
            <li> Not as thick &amp; dark as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It has a tint to yellowish,but very very little, comparing with the pic.</li>
            <li> and this is very green.</li>
            <li> Takes at least 3 coats to get the desired color</li>
            <li> Call me crazy, but I feel like the color got darker after a day of wearing it.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this color for my toes!  It is an amazing medium to dark green!</li>
            <li> Not as thick &amp; dark as I thought it would be. Takes at least 3 coats to get the desired color</li>
            <li> Lovely shade of medium green. Not disappointed, good application.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color looks like it should look great against darker skin, but alas it does not work for me. I tend to go for more neutral colors so I could just be overwhelmed by the color. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the cheap fast-drying topcoat I use or the polish itself, but this one tends to chip badly-as in, the entire nail coat will fall off in one sheet within 1-2 days of application. This has happened each time I&#x27;ve worn this color, and never with any other OPI polish I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Jade is the New Black&amp;#34; is very opaque and provides smooth excellent coverage.  The color is a soft neutral medium green (no yellow tint al all).  Seems that it would complement any skin coloring.</li>
            <li> I got Jade is the new black and the color is more like a forest green. I have been looking for a teal colored nail polish with no such luck. I visited the OPI website to look at the colors there just to make sure I was getting what I was looking for. I have tried, Lost my Chzechbook, Teal the cows come home, and Jade is the new black. The first two were very Blue and this is very green. I might try my luck at mixing Teal the cows come home and Jade is the new black and see if I get the color I am looking for.</li>
            <li> I had this same color painted on at the nail salon and I loved it so I ordered it  This particular item seemed watery and so I had to give my nails three coats.  The color is nice but maybe this particular vendor provided a watered down polish.</li>
            <li> Loved this color so much I hunted it down! Got my toes this color when I got my nails done and when I went back I took down the name!! I love green &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Jade is the New Black!!</li>
            <li> Great color. Very good polish!</li>
            <li> Exactly the color I needed for my Lady Loki nails.</li>
            <li> I love it! It looks like in the picture 99%.  It has a tint to yellowish,but very very little, comparing with the pic. It is a nice green! Nicer than in the pic.</li>
            <li> Well today is St. Patrick&#x27;s Day and, of course, I have on my green nail polish.  It looks fantastic on.  This is a gorgeous shade and I was happy to find it.  It is green but is subtle enough to go with my blue jeans, etc.  OPI stays on.</li>
            <li> if your looking for the it color of the year look no furthur. this is the most beautiful color to wear. i dont normally gravitate to greens but this color is so beautiful . i stare at it all the time. its definitally the must have color of the year!</li>
            <li> We Love it! You don&#x27;t have to keep layering it to get coverage which is nice! will Oder more in the future!</li>
            <li> it met my expectations and is a sassy color that goes beautifully with everything.  OPI makes such cool colors with creative names.</li>

            <li> Green polish has been my standard nail color for about two years.  OPI combines fashion forward colors with long wearability.  I swim several times a week and this polish lasts.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is true to the color shown in the picture, solid green with no frost.  It dries fast and wears well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly how it looks online and in the bottle! I I try not to buy nail polish online but I was happy with this.</li>
            <li> i bought this polish because i was looking for a green polish and this one is wonderful and exactly what i was looking for. this is a very beautiful color and one i don&#x27;t regret buying. this polish is between a jade and an emerald green and is a great color for Christmas and winter. would recommend if you like green. this is also a great quality brand. it seems to stay on better than other brands.</li>
            <li> Good formula. Darker shade than expected</li>
            <li> Best shade of green I own. I have received many compliments.</li>
            <li> Out of my two favourite brands, Opi comes on top over China Glaze. In particular, my favourites from Opi are Russian Navy and Jade is the New Black. The jade colour is rich and highly pigmented, and will last quite a while if used correctly and a base and top coat are applied to the nail. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about Opi products is that some of the names that are meant to be cleverly humourous aren&#x27;t hitting the target (like their German collection. Some of the names were worthy of a sigh and and a roll of the eyes). But eh, each to their own.</li>
            <li> Opi nail polish is so great. This went on smoothly, no streaks or patches. Used two coats to cover. Really nice color. Little darker than your traditional jade.</li>
            <li> It was a little more dull of a color than I thought, but I still really enjoyed it! I love this shade of green! It was also shipped to me really quickly.</li>
            <li> This color is okay. I googled the color to see what came up on people&#x27;s nails. I thought it was going to be a little different. Call me crazy, but I feel like the color got darker after a day of wearing it. I actually liked that color it changed to more. I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again, but it&#x27;s only because I think I am actually looking for emerald, not jade.</li>
