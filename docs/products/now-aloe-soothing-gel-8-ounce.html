            <li>Nice minty type of smell but not overpowering which is great.</li>
            <li>Good for me?  </li>
            <li>If you see it in a store, think of it as being as good an option as Lily of the Desert.  </li>
            <li>good luck to you.</li>
            <li>Recommended by doctor and it is a good product to use the a variety of reasons.  </li>

            <li>Love this tube as well as the gel great for diaper rashes.dry skin</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find this one at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Absorbs nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li>Effective, but has a lingering stickiness.</li>
            <li>Really nice.</li>
            <li>Good product but nothing special</li>
            <li>It feels very good, but the smell dose not so good, a littel bit strange.</li>
            <li>It works great and smells great and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>it is like magic.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this for the summer</li>
            <li>I mostly bought this because I bought an epilate</li>
            <li>Love this aloe-</li>
            <li>I love the bottle---</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a \\&quot;more perfect\\&quot; product, a \\&quot;more pure\\&quot; product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but a radical improvement?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more like an after shave lotion...</li>
            <li>It works ok at soothing my sun burn</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible smell and it fades over time</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>But it is really quickly absorbed by the skin, and I fill good with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this gel.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>crisp, pleasant smell, not as jelly-like, probably meaning that the proportion of aloe is greater since aloe by itself is said to be watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe use it not in the original way!</li>
            <li>so I did not deal specifically with the aloe, but it seems fine.</li>
            <li>This gel goes on light and dries quickly, with your skin feeling smooth and not greasy!</li>
            <li>it is so cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine product, but I wouldn&#x27;t make a special effort to order Now Foods Gel by mail again.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this to serve as a styling gel</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t give you a dry feeling on your skin great product</li>
            <li>It is easy and clean to use when miing with essential oils.</li>
            <li>My face instantly feels more refreshed, and it never clogs my pores.</li>
            <li>so I smelled my arms and sure enough that was the source.</li>
            <li>Seemed a bit tacky to the touch when I first put it on, but it went in quickly and left a smooth silky feel within a minute.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to buy at my local health food store, and feels nice on my face after shaving, but it doesn&#x27;t really do much to reduce my eczema dry patches.</li>
            <li>Clear gel with just a hint of mint that goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>This works wonders for my whole body.</li>
            <li>Works really well on skin inflammations.</li>
            <li>I put this on after I wash my face, and before I put on my regular light face lotion.</li>
            <li>its much easier to use than a jug.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t used it much because it smells almost fermented.</li>
            <li>It arrived before I expected,  I love using aloe</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle, and I love this aloe so far.</li>
            <li>It has worked pretty well, especially on irritated skin.</li>
            <li>but next morning you feel your skin is like silk ;)</li>
            <li>Now Foods gel seemed closer to the prize, so I paid a significant shipping fee to get just one tube (the only one left, apparently).  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using this on my face to help clear up acne.</li>
            <li>but so far I can see my face clearing up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much nicer than a gloppy cream that takes too long to sink in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young male</li>

            <li> or if I got a batch that was turning sour or what.</li>
            <li> I also use this for my hair, to lay my edges down.</li>
            <li> it really cools you down when its cold</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel firm and stay moisturized.</li>
            <li> Gel works well and not greasy or messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product always smells this way</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not pleasant either</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my dry skin &amp; my eczema, it helps heal my flare up faster or prevents them from being so bad.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d hate to get pulled over by the cops or walk into my kid&#x27;s teacher parent conference smelling like I&#x27;d just left a bar.</li>
            <li> OTC anti-itch creams and hydrocortizone have all proven to be useless.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this to moisturize my skin and help soothe itches associated with sunburn. It has worked pretty well, especially on irritated skin.</li>
            <li> it is the best thing I have ever had in making my skin look smoother and more shiny. it is like magic. it is so cheap and I love it. the only thing is it can be dry. but next morning you feel your skin is like silk ;)</li>
            <li> I was looking for aloe gel, to use it after being exposed to sun.&lt;br /&gt;I did not want a lotion. I was very happy to find this one at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like that the product contained several other ingredients besides aloe. It worked well otherwise.</li>
            <li> Has alcohol in it and it is a bit sticky compared to other aloe gel I have tried.</li>
            <li> Absorbs nicely into the skin. Nice minty type of smell but not overpowering which is great. Would definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as like a moisturizer for my face after I have applied face wash and acne toner.</li>
            <li> I love this for the summer it really cools you down when its cold and it doesn&#x27;t give you a dry feeling on your skin great product Now is the best I&#x27;v tried yet I give it a 100% great product.</li>
            <li> I mostly bought this because I bought an epilate and I wanted something that I can put on after use to soothe and moisturize my skin. This works wonders for my whole body. It makes my skin feel firm and stay moisturized. Love it!</li>
            <li> The same with other aloe gel. Good product but nothing special</li>
            <li> This gel goes on light and dries quickly, with your skin feeling smooth and not greasy! I mixed with Tea Tree Oil for my specific skin type.</li>
            <li> Works really well on skin inflammations. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have no issues with it yet. I have been using in it for the past month on my legs and face for dryness or when my face gets red.  Seems to sooth the skin and have not had any adverse reactions.  Great product and good alternative to growing your own aloe.</li>
            <li> Effective, but has a lingering stickiness.</li>
            <li> NOW products are great. Gel works well and not greasy or messy.</li>
            <li> I put this on after I wash my face, and before I put on my regular light face lotion. My face instantly feels more refreshed, and it never clogs my pores. I&#x27;ve integrated this into my daily routine, and would not go another day without it.</li>
            <li> Love this aloe- I want skin products that are as natural as possible with as few added ingredients as I can find.  This is one of the best aloe gels that fits that descriptions.  It works great and smells great and lasts a long time.  I even use it as a shave gel sometimes and it works great for that too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle, and I love this aloe so far. I use the aloe for my skin--face and body--after I bathe. It moisturizes my dry skin &amp; my eczema, it helps heal my flare up faster or prevents them from being so bad. I also use this for my hair, to lay my edges down. I love the bottle---its much easier to use than a jug. :) so I have no complaints...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lily of the Desert 99% Aloe Vera Gelly as a skin moisturizer for quite some time.  It&#x27;s easy to buy at my local health food store, and feels nice on my face after shaving, but it doesn&#x27;t really do much to reduce my eczema dry patches. So, I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a \\&quot;more perfect\\&quot; product, a \\&quot;more pure\\&quot; product.  You know, the \\&quot;wonder cure.\\&quot;  There are dozens of additional ingredients in L of the D.  Are they all needed?  Good for me?  What about just plain aloe, with absolutely nothing added?  Is that the ultimate, or is it not available/practical as a gel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Now Foods gel seemed closer to the prize, so I paid a significant shipping fee to get just one tube (the only one left, apparently).  It&#x27;s OK, but a radical improvement?  No.  It&#x27;s a bit more like an after shave lotion...crisp, pleasant smell, not as jelly-like, probably meaning that the proportion of aloe is greater since aloe by itself is said to be watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It&#x27;s a fine product, but I wouldn&#x27;t make a special effort to order Now Foods Gel by mail again.  If you see it in a store, think of it as being as good an option as Lily of the Desert.  And for those of you with the annoying itch of eczema, who seek a \\&quot;wonder moisturizer,\\&quot; the only thing that ever reduced the dry itch significantly for me is a prescription ointment called Betamethasone Dipropionate. OTC anti-itch creams and hydrocortizone have all proven to be useless. Finding the right answer can be frustrating...good luck to you.</li>
            <li> It feels very good, but the smell dose not so good, a littel bit strange. But still it is very effective product.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to serve as a styling gel but I&#x27;ve been using it along with a vegetable glycerin and water mix as a body moisturizer and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> A different type of Alow Vera gel came. The photo makes it seem like it is a more expensive brand than the one that came in the mail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young male and I&#x27;ve been using this on my face to help clear up acne. I use it daily but so far I can see my face clearing up. I wanna use it on my hair but I don&#x27;t know, still a great product.</li>
            <li> Recommended by doctor and it is a good product to use the a variety of reasons.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere. This is the best of its kind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product always smells this way or if I got a batch that was turning sour or what. It works ok at soothing my sun burn but I haven&#x27;t used it much because it smells almost fermented. I bought it for use on a long road trip and shortly after I applied some everyone in the car started to smell an odd odor, similar to old spilled beer. We looked all over, thinking we must have tracked spilled beer into the car from the gas station we&#x27;d stopped at but couldn&#x27;t find the source. The second time I applied some the beer smell suddenly got stronger and it occurred to me that it might be the gel so I smelled my arms and sure enough that was the source. It&#x27;s not a terrible smell and it fades over time but it&#x27;s not pleasant either and I&#x27;d hate to get pulled over by the cops or walk into my kid&#x27;s teacher parent conference smelling like I&#x27;d just left a bar.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting the peppermint smell in this.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Its perfectly as expected. I was mixing it into a lotion so I did not deal specifically with the aloe, but it seems fine.</li>
            <li> I am a man and using this as a regular face care everyday. Maybe use it not in the original way! :) But it is really quickly absorbed by the skin, and I fill good with it!&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I don&#x27;t use any other makeups.</li>
            <li> I love this gel. It is easy and clean to use when miing with essential oils.</li>
            <li> It arrived before I expected,  I love using aloe and I use it on my pets to.  Good product and good price.</li>
            <li> Really nice. Clear gel with just a hint of mint that goes away quickly. I don&#x27;t detect any smell after a minute or so. Seemed a bit tacky to the touch when I first put it on, but it went in quickly and left a smooth silky feel within a minute. I have done a lot of research and found that aloe is one of the best things you can use on your skin. My face feels a little tight as if some of that loose, over 60 skin is being tightened up. That would be nice! I know cucumber is good to reduce puffiness under the eyes, so altogether, this gel is a winner!  It&#x27;s much nicer than a gloppy cream that takes too long to sink in. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
