            <li>Good  product for a good price.</li>
            <li>No taste, holds about as good as any of them</li>
            <li>Fixodent Free is the best.</li>
            <li>alll came in good shape.</li>
            <li>GOOD DEAL AND WILL BUY AGAIN ....</li>
            <li>So far so good still get great hold good price.</li>
            <li>A great deal, and I really like the idea of buying more than one and getting a good price.    </li>
            <li>This is by far the best denture adhesive.</li>
            <li>I have been using Fixodent for over 20 years and it has never failed to keep my dentures in place, great product.</li>
            <li>but the price was SUPER !!</li>
            <li>Fixodent  gives more adhesion for dentures.</li>
            <li>It takes more of this product to get the job done</li>
            <li>I see that a great majority of users of this product have awarded either 4 or 5 stars, which means that for them, this product really works well.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li>and better to buy a multi-pack here on Amazon, to save trips to the drugstore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all and now I have conluded that poligrip is the better of the choices out there.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife, she love&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>I guess it holds his teeth in better</li>
            <li>I like Fixodent always have thought I would give the FREE a try better for you I heard.</li>
            <li>Strong but taste is not like is Poligrip</li>
            <li>I am awarding 2 stars, because in my experience, this product is way inferior to SeaBond Denture Adhesive Wafers, in two important respects.  </li>
            <li>stay secure as long&lt;</li>
            <li>Only brand I use, hold great</li>
            <li>Excellent product but &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; material has gotten thicker, more difficult to squeeze and get cream.</li>
            <li>I always use the FREE version of this product, but do wish it was a little thicker, but all in all it is the best one I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>which then allows him to eat more normally.</li>
            <li>I like how the neutral color does not make my gums bright unnatural pink.</li>
            <li>It cost me plenty to have it sent to the Philippines, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised ....</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since it first came out and have found it to work well for me.</li>
            <li>Is that a real money-back guarantee?!</li>
            <li>Yes, as soon as this runs out most definitely!!!</li>
            <li>First, this product does not hold my teeth in place half as effectively as the SeaBond wafers.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Its ok, thought it might have a stronger hold than other brands &amp; it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has no garish pink color, has great holing power, especially for hard to chew foods.</li>
            <li>You may indeed fall in this category, and certainly this product is well worth trying, because it is relatively inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>a battle of good and bad, the good wins hands down.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold as long or as well as the original version of this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>He highly recommends it to anyone seeking a reliable adhesive for their denture.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite, with little or no smell or taste.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item for $5.99 from my local Walgreens, which is quite a bit higher than the $4.28 per tube from this vendor.</li>
            <li>He has tried the Zinc-free, but says it does not adhere nearly as well.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly as advertised .... this is a great product. Having used this brand of adhesive before I knew what I was getting but the price was SUPER !!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses fixodent and it&#x27;s so expensive at Walmart. I get this a dollar cheaper per tube plus shipped to my house.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since it first came out and have found it to work well for me. Delivery was fast and with the subscription pricing it comes at a price that is hard to beat even with a coupon. If you have to use an adhesive, this is the one to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product but &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; material has gotten thicker, more difficult to squeeze and get cream.</li>
            <li> A great deal, and I really like the idea of buying more than one and getting a good price.    Happy with this.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has no garish pink color, has great holing power, especially for hard to chew foods.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fixodent for years. I became concerned about the zinc contained in the product. They say you won&#x27;t get poisoned if you follow the directions and use only the recommended amount. Is that a real money-back guarantee?!</li>
            <li> I have this on a reoccurring order.... always delivered always works.</li>
            <li> Good  product for a good price. I bougth this product for my patient , and hes very happy and confortable using his protesis. Fixodent  gives more adhesion for dentures.</li>
            <li> No taste, holds about as good as any of them</li>
            <li> Best product on the market for hold, consistency and feel. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This purchase was for my Mother in law and she uses nothing but this product.  Will make this same purchase for her in the future.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold as long or as well as the original version of this product. It takes more of this product to get the job done</li>
            <li> This is by far the best denture adhesive. It works. Have tried others but always come back to this. Amazons price for 6 is also a big savings.</li>
            <li> Always a great product if you need to use the stuff. blows the comptetion out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;The shipper was a little slow however</li>
            <li> i bought these for my father, who pays 6 to 8 dollars for them at the store. With the subsribe and save option, they came out to almost have the price! Saves him a trip to the store as well.</li>
            <li> I see that a great majority of users of this product have awarded either 4 or 5 stars, which means that for them, this product really works well.  You may indeed fall in this category, and certainly this product is well worth trying, because it is relatively inexpensive.  I am awarding 2 stars, because in my experience, this product is way inferior to SeaBond Denture Adhesive Wafers, in two important respects.  First, this product does not hold my teeth in place half as effectively as the SeaBond wafers. Second, this product leaves a nasty goop on the roof of my mouth.  I purchased this item for $5.99 from my local Walgreens, which is quite a bit higher than the $4.28 per tube from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Dad says this is the best adhesive cream he&#x27;s ever used. Dads know best! He highly recommends it to anyone seeking a reliable adhesive for their denture.</li>
            <li> this is a great product at a great price.  So glad I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> Strong but taste is not like is Poligrip</li>
            <li> I have been using Fixodent for over 20 years and it has never failed to keep my dentures in place, great product.</li>
            <li> Its ok, thought it might have a stronger hold than other brands &amp; it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This product works great for me.</li>
            <li> When I went to Costco and Sam&#x27;s, I was unable to find this product in bulk. I can always find what I need on Amazon.com! Always!!</li>
            <li> its fine, however, in the cold months it is Very hard squeezing any out.  It takes a lot of time to get any out.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite, with little or no smell or taste.  He has tried the Zinc-free, but says it does not adhere nearly as well. Will buy again when needed. and better to buy a multi-pack here on Amazon, to save trips to the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and now I have conluded that poligrip is the better of the choices out there. definitely.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Infact this is my 2nd time ordering this. would I order this again? Yes, as soon as this runs out most definitely!!!</li>
            <li> The Fixodent \\&quot;Free\\&quot; is getting hard to find in stores. Sometimes they have it &amp; a lot of times they don&#x27;t. I was happy to find this on amazon.com. The price is reasonable. I usually paid anywhere from $4.29-$4.99  a tube. I prefer this over the poligrip. I also like the unflavored. Did not care for the mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/9/14  The price increased quite a bit. Not a good value anymore. Can get this cheaper in any store.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, she love&#x27;s it. Thank You!!</li>
            <li> I always use the FREE version of this product, but do wish it was a little thicker, but all in all it is the best one I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fixodent for 34 years. Fixodent Free is the best. It&#x27;s the only denture cream that holds my dentures in. All this crap going on with the lawyers is just that, BS. 34 years &amp; I&#x27;m still here. I&#x27;m also a Diabetic. It cost me plenty to have it sent to the Philippines, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> alll came in good shape.</li>
            <li> the good&lt;br /&gt;An improvement over pink denture glue and its awful taste the pink has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bad&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t stay secure as long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the conclusion&lt;br /&gt;in a battle of good and bad, the good wins hands down. anything to get away from that awful taste of the pink.</li>
            <li> I like Fixodent always have thought I would give the FREE a try better for you I heard.So far so good still get great hold good price. I would recommend</li>
            <li> My husband likes this over other brands.  I guess it holds his teeth in better which then allows him to eat more normally.</li>
            <li> GOOD DEAL AND WILL BUY AGAIN ....THANKS</li>
            <li> No dyes or flavorings and the best adhesive I have found in many brands and or types of dental adhesives.</li>
            <li> Only brand I use, hold great</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND USES THIS AND HAS FOR SEVERAL YEARS SO IT MUST BE JUST WHAT HE NEEDS.  IN THE PAST HE HAS USED OTHER BRANDS BUT HE LIKES THIS ONE BEST.</li>
            <li> Long time user of Fixodent. Still satisfactory. Reduced zinc comforting.</li>
            <li> I like how the neutral color does not make my gums bright unnatural pink. I have switched over to this.</li>
