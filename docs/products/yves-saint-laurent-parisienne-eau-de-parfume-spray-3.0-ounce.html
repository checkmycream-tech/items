            <li>Really lovely.</li>
            <li>I used to purchase at a dept store for $30 more.  </li>
            <li>I felt confident.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it is a perfume meant to be experienced up close and intimate.</li>
            <li>:)</li>

            <li>One of my favorite scents, I always get compliments when I wear this.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this scent..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been my favorite for a while.</li>

            <li>I love it and wear it all the time.</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY love this scent.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s sexy</li>
            <li>need I say more?</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Parisienne.</li>
            <li>I ordered two more bottles because it is genuine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>Fades quite easily, though.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and it arrived fast to my home :)</li>
            <li>when I first sprayed it on myself, you notice the rose smell immediately.  </li>
            <li>their scent rejuvenates me and brings me cute sweet thoughts softness and cleaning with chic style.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, classic fragrance for women who&#x27;ve outgrown the scent of their 20s but aren&#x27;t ready for the heavier classics.</li>
            <li>Light scent that goes with everything.</li>
            <li>It is light, and</li>
            <li>always light.</li>
            <li>Its smells super clean and smooth!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this perfume while in France.  </li>
            <li>Unique scent that lingers but is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, fresh but feminine.  </li>
            <li>No other fragrance compares, it&#x27;s my favorite !</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells clean and crisp!</li>
            <li>So many compliments over the years and never a complaint.  </li>
            <li>Light but pretty.</li>
            <li>I luv this scent and was super happy when I found on amazon for a lot less.  </li>
            <li>Never fails to impress!</li>
            <li>This perfume smells like no other, words cant describe how rich and exotic this fragrance is.</li>
            <li>I was a little suspicious of the price versus quantity, but I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>I had very prompt delivery from the third party vendor with good email communication.</li>
            <li>Very pretty when you first spray it.</li>
            <li>Product was new, in box, and genuine.</li>
            <li>Its very fresh and lively and smellls like a $200 bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>The first time I applied this scent I was transformed.  </li>
            <li>I felt pretty.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as offered...perfect.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced as well!....</li>
            <li>I would like this scent much more if it were more heavy on the sandalwood and blackberry notes rather than heavy on the rose which it is.</li>
            <li>All you need is one quick spray behind all the pulse points and the smell is good to go all day.</li>
            <li>I really like this flirty, floral, fruity scent.</li>
            <li>I never have to worry that I&#x27;ve put to much on...</li>
            <li>highly recommend for a gift for ladies !</li>
            <li>I think the perfume is not the real thing.  </li>
            <li>it is soft and fresh ....</li>
            <li>unlike many other too flowery fragrances.</li>
            <li>The perfume I received from DBA Fragrance has the same smell but not as potent and doesn&#x27;t have the same body to the scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not smell musky, or like any particular flower.</li>
            <li>In the shipping contents I recieved a complimentary folding cosmetic mirror, a discount coupon for a future purchase, and a sample vial of the company&#x27;s exclusive fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is not a negative to me.  </li>
            <li>as it dried and balanced out, it smelled even better.  </li>
            <li>it is normal that after putting smell gets used to the smell and think it does not smell, but when people come asking to put perfume?</li>
            <li>Very sweet and slightly fruity.</li>
            <li>so I figured I&#x27;d try ordering it online instead of trying to hunt it back down, since most store I called said it wasn&#x27;t in stock.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you are looking for a unique smell that is a little mature.</li>
            <li>You really can very clearly smell all three individual scents.</li>
            <li>People have a hard time guessing what it is I&#x27;m wearing, but they say they love it.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for it, they no longer sell in in the dept. stores.</li>
            <li>It has a fruity smell, strong at first, but after half an hour it goes down and becomes just a hint of freshness that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>My husband gave me my first bottle of this a few years back, and although I have other great-smelling perfumes, this one is the 1 we both really like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very feminine and has just a hint of blackberry, which is a subtle touch that doesn&#x27;t overpower the fragrance (that&#x27;s very important to me, as I hate most perfumes that smell like food).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overwhelmingly strong and stays on pretty well all day.  </li>

            <li> I usually find that the prices on Amazon are much lower than the department stores.</li>
            <li> It is fairly long lasting.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long though!</li>
            <li> It is soft, evocative and ever so feminine - without being little girlish.  </li>
            <li> It brings to mind lush bouquets of pale blush roses and ruffly peonies.  </li>
            <li> Also lasts for quite a long time when wearing it!  </li>
            <li> even at the price it is, I&#x27;ll continue to buy it and wear it just about every single day!  </li>
            <li> This has got to be watered down or something like that.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does fade after a few hours, although the scent does linger a bit longer than some other fragrances I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The minute I receive this, I compare to the one I receive from the mall, this was a fake didn&#x27;t last long, labeling on the bottle was upside down</li>
            <li> definitely recommend if you want something delicate, not over powering at all, and smells like roses!</li>
            <li> I wear it almost everyday now</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Purchased a small bottle in Paris for wife who also loves it.  </li>
            <li> The package was a day late.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for several months, but it is very expensive if you buy it at department stores.  </li>
            <li> I wish it were less expensive but</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spend that much money for a FAKE !!!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m disappointed that I spent the money.</li>
            <li> It leaves an air wafting behind you even in the supermarket!</li>
            <li> So sad it&#x27;s not sold in stores anymore!</li>

            <li> I love my YSL.  So many compliments over the years and never a complaint.  Light scent that goes with everything.</li>
            <li> Very pretty when you first spray it. Very sweet and slightly fruity. then when it dries it becomes very sexy and deep..very warm. I havent gotten a compliment yet, but I like it. Great for a date night, clubbing, or formal evening. Great winter fragrance!</li>
            <li> The package was a day late. But it was at a great price and I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better! Thank you so much! She loved the perfume!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for several months, but it is very expensive if you buy it at department stores.  It is an excellent price for designer fragrance and I love it.</li>
            <li> I would like this scent much more if it were more heavy on the sandalwood and blackberry notes rather than heavy on the rose which it is. Over all it is a very nice combination and unlike many other too flowery fragrances. You really can very clearly smell all three individual scents. I had very prompt delivery from the third party vendor with good email communication. In the shipping contents I recieved a complimentary folding cosmetic mirror, a discount coupon for a future purchase, and a sample vial of the company&#x27;s exclusive fragrance.</li>
            <li> Perfect price for the size of bottle</li>
            <li> I bought this scent on a whim after I couldn&#x27;t find the Gucci one I was after, and I&#x27;m glad it worked out that way.  It&#x27;s not overwhelmingly strong and stays on pretty well all day.  People have a hard time guessing what it is I&#x27;m wearing, but they say they love it.</li>
            <li> Buenisimooooo...... se los recomiendo a todos los compradores, super puntual y el producto es excelente, tal cual como se describe en la pagina es como te llegara a tu casa,!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, classic fragrance for women who&#x27;ve outgrown the scent of their 20s but aren&#x27;t ready for the heavier classics. Really lovely. Fades quite easily, though.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance! Tried it on in an upscale department store, then came home to Amazon! Great delivery and price too! I literally ordered one day, and it was on my doorstep the next day! Thank you Amazon and Discount Perfume!</li>
            <li> My wife asked for the perfume. I was a little suspicious of the price versus quantity, but I&#x27;m happy with it. It smells reasonably good and is long-lasting. She&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Its my after bath purfume.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I luv this scent and was super happy when I found on amazon for a lot less.  I used to purchase at a dept store for $30 more.  I will be ordering on amazon from now on!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this perfume while in France.  This perfume is amazing.  I was really happy with this seller, and the price was great!</li>
            <li> The first time I applied this scent I was transformed.  I felt pretty.  I felt confident.  It is soft, evocative and ever so feminine - without being little girlish.  It brings to mind lush bouquets of pale blush roses and ruffly peonies.  Throughout the day, the notes do fade to a quiet whisper.  This is not a negative to me.  Perhaps it is a perfume meant to be experienced up close and intimate. Afterall, no one ever said a perfume had to shout for hours on end to have the impact we desire.  :)</li>
            <li> love this perfume. an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this before from Saks so I figured I&#x27;d try ordering it online instead of trying to hunt it back down, since most store I called said it wasn&#x27;t in stock. The perfume I received from DBA Fragrance has the same smell but not as potent and doesn&#x27;t have the same body to the scent. This has got to be watered down or something like that. The scent never lasts on my hair, body or clothes and I&#x27;m disappointed that I spent the money.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells clean and crisp! i feel fancy when i wear it :) by the end of the day i can still smell it and its very nice :)&lt;br /&gt;its good with my fair skin to, not over bearing!</li>
            <li> Exactly as offered...perfect.</li>
            <li> I adore this scent!  It&#x27;s light, fresh but feminine.  I just can&#x27;t get enough of it!  I wish it were less expensive but even at the price it is, I&#x27;ll continue to buy it and wear it just about every single day!  Love, love, love!!</li>
            <li> I really like this flirty, floral, fruity scent. It&#x27;s very feminine and has just a hint of blackberry, which is a subtle touch that doesn&#x27;t overpower the fragrance (that&#x27;s very important to me, as I hate most perfumes that smell like food). My only complaint is that it does fade after a few hours, although the scent does linger a bit longer than some other fragrances I&#x27;ve tried. Not sure if I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Parisienne can only be described as \\&quot;Pretty\\&quot;.  It is light, and yes, oh so pretty.&lt;br /&gt;It does not smell musky, or like any particular flower.It is fairly long lasting. I never have to worry that I&#x27;ve put to much on...always light.</li>
            <li> Me encanto la comunicaci&amp;oacute;n que hubo siempre entre el vendedor y Yo. Gracias, espero en un futuro volver a comprar atravez de usted.</li>
            <li> I took an online quiz to find my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; fragrance and the results indicated that this perfume, along with j&#x27;adore by dior would be best for me.  so, given that I LOVE j&#x27;adore, its one of my favorites, I took the risk and tried this.  when I first sprayed it on myself, you notice the rose smell immediately.  perfect.  as it dried and balanced out, it smelled even better.  I wear it almost everyday now and my husband loves it.  definitely recommend if you want something delicate, not over powering at all, and smells like roses!</li>
            <li> Never fails to impress! It leaves an air wafting behind you even in the supermarket! I&#x27;ve used it for years!</li>
            <li> brought this for my girl friend! Its smells super clean and smooth! highly recommend for a gift for ladies !</li>
            <li> When I received the perfume it had leaked inside the box, about 1/8 of the perfume was gone.  I think the perfume is not the real thing.  NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> Good perfume, good buy. Price was great. I recommend this product to everyone. Looking forward to buying more of it.</li>
            <li> Product was new, in box, and genuine. Love the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a gift, and I am very happy.</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this, I get complimented and asked what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing. It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> The minute I receive this, I compare to the one I receive from the mall, this was a fake didn&#x27;t last long, labeling on the bottle was upside down I can&#x27;t believe I spend that much money for a FAKE !!!!</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite perfume. I can&#x27;t find it at any store anymore. I will definitely be purchasing from here again!!! My husband gave me my first bottle of this a few years back, and although I have other great-smelling perfumes, this one is the 1 we both really like.</li>
            <li> I have bought this before and I am in love with this scent. It came to me in great condition and again I LOVE THIS SCENT!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my girlfriend - she loves it, and I do too. It has a fruity smell, strong at first, but after half an hour it goes down and becomes just a hint of freshness that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts all day! it is normal that after putting smell gets used to the smell and think it does not smell, but when people come asking to put perfume? it is soft and fresh .... their scent rejuvenates me and brings me cute sweet thoughts softness and cleaning with chic style. I ordered two more bottles because it is genuine.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells like no other, words cant describe how rich and exotic this fragrance is. All you need is one quick spray behind all the pulse points and the smell is good to go all day. Its very fresh and lively and smellls like a $200 bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> I dont not like this scent, it is too florally. I was satisfied with the order process and item shipped on time.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents, I always get compliments when I wear this.  Also lasts for quite a long time when wearing it!  I usually find that the prices on Amazon are much lower than the department stores.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent.. it&#x27;s been my favorite for a while. So sad it&#x27;s not sold in stores anymore!</li>
            <li> Unique scent that lingers but is not overpowering. Purchased a small bottle in Paris for wife who also loves it.  Prices are better in US.</li>
            <li> I love it and wear it all the time. The smell is amazing and it arrived fast to my home :)</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY love this scent. It&#x27;s unique and sophisticated. This is my favourite perfume... I highly recommend it if you are looking for a unique smell that is a little mature.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s sexy I&#x27;ve been told. Light but pretty. I received its as a gift and have purchased it for myself 4 times in 2 years. And I&#x27;m purchasing again. I searched high and low for it, they no longer sell in in the dept. stores. No other fragrance compares, it&#x27;s my favorite ! Reasonably priced as well!....need I say more?</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Parisienne. It doesn&#x27;t last long though!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, smells wonderful.</li>
