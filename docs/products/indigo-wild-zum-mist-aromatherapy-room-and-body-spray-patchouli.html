            <li>This is a wonderful spray as a body mist or room scenter.  </li>

            <li>Nice to find a patchouli room spray.  </li>
            <li>BUT...it is nice smelling, nice feeling,...</li>

            <li>Indigo wild is so awesome, I love love love their mists, &amp; soap!</li>
            <li>Zum Mist is a great product, with the right fragrance.   </li>
            <li>However, this is not my favorite scent like the Frankincense and Myrrh ...</li>
            <li>I seek refreshing lighter scents-</li>
            <li>I love the scent of Patchouli.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s lovely for freshening bed linens.</li>
            <li>Best pachouli spray -- I get compliments on it constantly.</li>
            <li>I got this today and love the smell</li>
            <li>All of the ingredients settled and WERENT able tocombine.</li>
            <li>I found that it works better as a car spray.</li>
            <li>I really love this spray.</li>
            <li>this is because i&#x27;m simply not that impressed.  </li>
            <li>I will use it more often now.</li>
            <li>I am a lover of patchouli and most of the time</li>
            <li>and it would smell better.</li>
            <li>i love zum products and this spray matches the quality i&#x27;ve come to expect.</li>
            <li>, I love this spray</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>So many scents to choose from.</li>
            <li>It is a very warm and very earthy scent.</li>
            <li>Now after a good chunk of time passes you actually start to smell the good aspect of the spray.</li>
            <li>Great and old time fragrance from the 60s.  </li>
            <li>but I loved this one so much I bought another.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too strong.  </li>
            <li>I thought it seemed slightly strong, so I went with something else.</li>
            <li>am a huge fan of patchouli.</li>
            <li>I primarily use it as a room spray and sometimes as a body spray to help keep me grounded.</li>
            <li>This is the genuine article.  </li>
            <li>I really like it thank you !!!</li>
            <li>it is exactly what you expect when you think patchouli!!</li>
            <li>This new bottle is just as nice smelling.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an authentic patchouli aroma - not so much.</li>
            <li>I just bought some Zum brand soap from whole foods and I am in love with it as well as the lip balm(their holiday collection of scents-frosty zum soap in minty pine&amp;zum</li>
            <li>(Full disclosure: I am asked by men and women, although the majority are women).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the flip side the company sent a little sample of one of their soaps and I loved it!</li>
            <li>fragrance is a bit stinky and does vanish rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I purchased some a few years ago and it was great.</li>
            <li>I love Indigo Wild products.</li>
            <li>thus for my own personal taste I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>If you would like to smell like a freshly washed antique wood floor - this is for you.</li>
            <li>To me it is a great natural, basic cologne that can be worn by a man or a woman.  </li>
            <li>Received a bottle with oil floating on top, myself and others thought it looked old.  </li>
            <li>They are strong enough for room scenting, yet not too strong for the body.  </li>
            <li>For my nose anyway, this is NOT the right fragrance.</li>
            <li>Some room sprays do not smell quite right</li>
            <li>Some Patchouli has a strange smell after it is applied to your skin, but this is a nice quality product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little strong at first, but then it leaves a nice smell.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s nice, just not a great value since I could make it myself with all the ingredients I already own.</li>
            <li>Works best as a body fragrance or for scenting fabrics, not strong enough for a room freshener.  </li>
            <li>I love this, I am on my second bottle now.</li>
            <li>I love Zum Mist essential oil sprays.  </li>
            <li>asked my husband for patchouli essential oil for Christmas, and this is what I got :)</li>
            <li>I was a fan of this product the first time I ordered a year ago.</li>
            <li>This air freshener does not smell like chemicals, like a lot of the more commercial brands do.  </li>
            <li>I love patchouli but this one is a little too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this, and it was hard to make an honest decision with the mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It really is an odor rather than a scent.  </li>
            <li>As a patchouli enthusiast, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>If you are, too, I would highly recommend buying this!</li>
            <li>This Patchouli spray is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I understand the attempt, but the delivery really does not impress me.</li>
            <li>product came in a plastic bottle (like many of all the other Zum Mist varieties) and not in a metallic bottle as pictured in the product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny because I saw this at Whole Foods earlier this week</li>
            <li>Not really Patchouli, like the original</li>
            <li>I suspect there&#x27;s very little Patchouli in this bottle and that it&#x27;s mostly Cedar Oil.</li>
            <li>actually a clear plastic bottle.</li>
            <li>Is in a clear plastic bottle instead of the shown metal one.  </li>
            <li>It smells so natural.</li>
            <li>Pure and simple: water, glycerin and essential oil of patchouli.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as expected, but just patchouli can be a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li>its separated from the water on top, but I found it to be a bit weak,  and then a chemical and minty smell lingered.  </li>
            <li>I recommend Indigo Wild Zum Mist and other products if you want to have a lovely personal scent or to use as a room freshener without the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>One most unappealing fragrances Zum mist has in their product line.</li>
            <li>The past 2 deliveries smell stale and mostly like an antiseptic w a 1 second whiff of patch lol but overall leaves a weird clinical smell.</li>

            <li> The past 2 deliveries smell stale and mostly like an antiseptic w a 1 second whiff of patch lol but overall leaves a weird clinical smell.</li>
            <li> This is a long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to last me too long</li>
            <li> A good patchouli scent is hard to find, but this unfortunately does not take the cake.</li>
            <li> For a room deodorizer..it works but scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Toilet bowl deodorizer.</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste of money</li>
            <li> so one does not have to worry about the strange &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> helps disperse it, not matter how long or often I shake it.</li>
            <li> i dont care for,  and its clear its got a small amount of patchouli oil,  </li>
            <li> too watered down and too funky with that combination of what ever its mixed with</li>
            <li> Once you spray it on your skin you get a very strong &amp;#34;pinesol&amp;#34;-like aroma that is a little unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Not really the patchouli I use,  </li>
            <li> Others have recommended the other scents in this mist and to avoid the patchouli.</li>
            <li> Something is different and the past 2 I received are unsatisfactory, they oil stays separated from whatever solution (alcohol?)</li>
            <li> I would like to try some of Zum Mist&#x27;s other scents after trying Patchouli.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried the other scents, and am new to this line, although I am a casual sniffer of their soaps whenever I do see them in stores.</li>
            <li> I think I could make this@home for half the price</li>
            <li> While I love Zum Mist&#x27;s frankincense &amp; myrrh and the lavender fragrances, I find this patchouli very unpleasant.   </li>
            <li> The product was shown to be an aerosol can and came in a plastic spray bottle,the mixture was poor and I didn&#x27;t care for it,not the same.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I will return it or not..thinking about using it as bathroom spray for a few days to see if that works or not.</li>
            <li> so I could use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I wear this as a body spray (a little dab will do you!)</li>
            <li> It may have been out of date, but I&#x27;m really not sure.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that matters to anyone,</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is about it but won&#x27;t be getting it again.</li>
            <li> They even added a little surprise, a slice of homemade soap!!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to the fragrance.</li>
            <li> after you use it once the smell gets worse?!?</li>
            <li> I shake it and try different things and its horrible!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, though.</li>
            <li> I was sad that mine came in a plastic bottle, not the metal/stainless steel option shown in the image.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I seldom fail to be asked by strangers what I am wearing.  </li>
            <li> It is not the fault of the vendor,in my opinion, so I will not speak bad about them.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a crap shoot when choosing this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This was horrible!</li>
            <li> Terrible,  smelled rancid.  </li>

            <li> If you like the scent of patchouli, you will love this!  This is a wonderful spray as a body mist or room scenter.  You do need to shake it before using, as the oils separate.  But, this tells me they use the actual essential oils as opposed to a manufactured scent.  I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> the thing about this,  I smell a lot of a minty undertone,  i dont care for,  and its clear its got a small amount of patchouli oil,  its separated from the water on top, but I found it to be a bit weak,  and then a chemical and minty smell lingered.  Not really the patchouli I use,  too watered down and too funky with that combination of what ever its mixed with</li>
            <li> Love this room spray !</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a scent that smell like the patchouli from the 60s, this is it.  I primarily use it as a room spray and sometimes as a body spray to help keep me grounded.</li>
            <li> I love Indigo Wild products. This is a long lasting scent. It is a very warm and very earthy scent. However, this is not my favorite scent like the Frankincense and Myrrh ... I seek refreshing lighter scents- thus for my own personal taste I give it 4 stars. Everything else about this product- quality-strength- delivery-price was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;So I like Patchouli for adding a relaxing mood to a room. Shake it up and a pump or 2 is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;The product came in a plastic bottle (like many of all the other Zum Mist varieties) and not in a metallic bottle as pictured in the product listing.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell very nice for Patchouli and it arrived in good condition. I recommend Indigo Wild Zum Mist and other products if you want to have a lovely personal scent or to use as a room freshener without the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> this did not come as pictured- actually a clear plastic bottle. Not the best patchouli.  Would not purchase this one again.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Patchouli.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. It smells so natural. I use as a body spritz and it&#x27;s lovely for freshening bed linens.</li>
            <li> While I love Zum Mist&#x27;s frankincense &amp; myrrh and the lavender fragrances, I find this patchouli very unpleasant.   It&#x27;s way too strong.  Zum Mist is a great product, with the right fragrance.   For my nose anyway, this is NOT the right fragrance.</li>
            <li> I really like it thank you !!!</li>
            <li> Nice to find a patchouli room spray.  Gave as a gift.</li>
            <li> Best pachouli spray -- I get compliments on it constantly.</li>
            <li> Arrived as stated in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I suspect there&#x27;s very little Patchouli in this bottle and that it&#x27;s mostly Cedar Oil.</li>
            <li> I love this, I am on my second bottle now.</li>
            <li> I got this today and love the smell it is exactly what you expect when you think patchouli!!</li>
            <li> Smells just like patchouli! This is great not just to spray on myself but to freshen sheets with and things like that.</li>
            <li> It came in a completely different spray bottle and even when shaken up the oil just clumped up. Smells nothing like the bottle pictured (I tried that bottle in a store) I tried to make use of it any ways so it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste of money but it clogged up and I ended up having to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Husband smells wonderful</li>
            <li> Great product... have purchased many.</li>
            <li> This was horrible! It didn&#x27;t even smell anything like patchouli and the bottle was see-thru. All of the ingredients settled and WERENT able tocombine. It may have been out of date, but I&#x27;m really not sure. I just threw it away!</li>
            <li> I love this hippie stuff! Ordered for a body spray. It last well. Good customer service, would use product and customer again. The wash is also good. Thanks</li>
            <li> For a room deodorizer..it works but scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I found that it works better as a car spray.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it reminded me of back in the day. The product was shown to be an aerosol can and came in a plastic spray bottle,the mixture was poor and I didn&#x27;t care for it,not the same. It is not the fault of the vendor,in my opinion, so I will not speak bad about them. Would not order again.</li>
            <li> Just a good patchouli spray.  Is in a clear plastic bottle instead of the shown metal one.  Because of this reason I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> We use this spray for everything.  We even spray the dogs because they are kinda funk smelling sometimes.  A friend of ours smelled our dogs and ordered it as well.  It&#x27;s a little strong at first, but then it leaves a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.  The scent is not what Patchouli should be but thankfully it dissipates within seconds so one does not have to worry about the strange &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; odor hanging on and offending.  It really is an odor rather than a scent.  I sprayed some on my neck, and it was totally &amp;#34;not there&amp;#34; almost as soon as I sprayed it.  I sprayed a room but it was gone immediately.  I could smell it as I was spraying it but once finished, GONZO!  I will try again with another Patchouli from a different source</li>
            <li> I like patchouli but I don&#x27;t like this. After a while it starts to smell like dirt. It&#x27;s just not patchouli as I know it.</li>
            <li> The room deodorizer, body mist, and one use maybe not used which works flawlessly. Toilet bowl deodorizer. 3 spritzes after a drop off and the entire bathroom smells of the Zum Mist... PERFECT!</li>
            <li> I really love this spray. It does take a good dosing of the room or yourself to experience the scent. It&#x27;s not going to last me too long and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> great fragrance, not to strong, pleasent</li>
            <li> Great patchouli scent.  Works best as a body fragrance or for scenting fabrics, not strong enough for a room freshener.  Good for in the car or covering odors on coats, caps, etc. that you don&#x27;t wash often.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected, but just patchouli can be a little overwhelming. thinking of adding some orange blossom to it.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;occasionally&amp;#34; use mine since its arrival.  this is because i&#x27;m simply not that impressed.  BUT...it is nice smelling, nice feeling,...for several seconds then ...?</li>
            <li> As a patchouli enthusiast, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> If you would like to smell like a freshly washed antique wood floor - this is for you. If you are looking for an authentic patchouli aroma - not so much. It just does not smell pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> This fragrance/product is still wonderful. I purchased some a few years ago and it was great. This new bottle is just as nice smelling. I will use it more often now.</li>
            <li> Where do I begin...?The fragrance is a bit stinky and does vanish rather quickly. This could be a blessing in disguise. I really wanted to love this, and it was hard to make an honest decision with the mixed reviews. I am a lover of patchouli and most of the time it&#x27;s a crap shoot when choosing this fragrance. This happens to be one of those occasions. It doesn&#x27;t come in an aluminum bottle. The packaging changed to plastic. Not sure if that matters to anyone, but I thought I would mention it. You can see the oil floating in a mixture of water. I think I could make this@home for half the price and it would smell better. I don&#x27;t know if I will return it or not..thinking about using it as bathroom spray for a few days to see if that works or not. I just bought some Zum brand soap from whole foods and I am in love with it as well as the lip balm(their holiday collection of scents-frosty zum soap in minty pine&amp;zum jolly holiday almond shea butter lip balm.Others have recommended the other scents in this mist and to avoid the patchouli.I have not tried the other scents, and am new to this line, although I am a casual sniffer of their soaps whenever I do see them in stores.</li>
            <li> Not really Patchouli, like the original</li>
            <li> i love zum products and this spray matches the quality i&#x27;ve come to expect. it smells great. it&#x27;s not overpowering or obnoxious, but it still has that great patchouli scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny because I saw this at Whole Foods earlier this week and they had a sampler bottle. I shook it up and sprayed it on my arm. I thought it seemed slightly strong, so I went with something else. Well, as I was driving home and the scent began to warm on my skin, I fell in LOVE with it. I regretted not buying it at the store...so I am ordering some now.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge fan of patchouli. If you are, too, I would highly recommend buying this!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell good at all!! after you use it once the smell gets worse?!?! I shake it and try different things and its horrible!</li>
            <li> I love Zum Mist essential oil sprays.  They are strong enough for room scenting, yet not too strong for the body.  I get patchouli for my husband and frankincense and myrrh for me.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to the fragrance. It&#x27;s expensive, though. Wish they would lower the price so I could use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Bought this along with the body wash and lotion.  This is the best of the 3.  Has the most robust scent, but still not the best patchouli that I&#x27;ve ever had.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I was sad that mine came in a plastic bottle, not the metal/stainless steel option shown in the image.&lt;br /&gt;I asked my husband for patchouli essential oil for Christmas, and this is what I got :) But it&#x27;s nice, just not a great value since I could make it myself with all the ingredients I already own.</li>
            <li> Not recommended. I was a fan of this product the first time I ordered a year ago. Something is different and the past 2 I received are unsatisfactory, they oil stays separated from whatever solution (alcohol?) helps disperse it, not matter how long or often I shake it. The past 2 deliveries smell stale and mostly like an antiseptic w a 1 second whiff of patch lol but overall leaves a weird clinical smell.</li>
            <li> Terrible,  smelled rancid.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> Excellent service, I love this spray</li>
            <li> One most unappealing fragrances Zum mist has in their product line. Thought it arrived spoiled, then realized that&#x27;s the way it was supposed to smell. Seller was very kind to refund purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon very supportive as well.</li>
            <li> I just received my Patchouli room spray/body spray! I absolutely love it. Some Patchouli has a strange smell after it is applied to your skin, but this is a nice quality product. They even added a little surprise, a slice of homemade soap!! Very happy with this product and I recommend it to anyone who loves Patchouli!!</li>
            <li> I have always liked the scent of patchouli.  To me it is a great natural, basic cologne that can be worn by a man or a woman.  The thing I have noticed is the variety of scents that are called patchouli.  This is not like some imitations that you may find at Pier One or a bath and body shop.  This is the genuine article.  I wear this as a body spray (a little dab will do you!) and I seldom fail to be asked by strangers what I am wearing.  (Full disclosure: I am asked by men and women, although the majority are women).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the brand I use and recommend to anyone who asks.  Pure and simple: water, glycerin and essential oil of patchouli.  Accept no substitute.</li>
            <li> I love patchouli but this one is a little too strong for me. Not sure what it is about it but won&#x27;t be getting it again. On the flip side the company sent a little sample of one of their soaps and I loved it! I might be getting that.</li>
            <li> This air freshener does not smell like chemicals, like a lot of the more commercial brands do.  Two pumps of the spray and the rooms unfavorable odors are eradicated! I would like to try some of Zum Mist&#x27;s other scents after trying Patchouli.  :)</li>
            <li> Great and old time fragrance from the 60s.  Best ever don&#x27;t know why I never got away from this fragrance.  Makes the house spell so good and my husband loves it.  Brings back a lot of memories.</li>
            <li> Love this! Best scent for spraying on pillows and body.</li>
            <li> Indigo wild is so awesome, I love love love their mists, &amp; soap! And every time you purchase the YUM Dog wash the company donates a dollar to an animal shelter rescue in Kansas!! Good vibes and great products</li>
            <li> Love the uplifting, mellowing scent! My favorite brand of room sprays!</li>
            <li> We use Zum soap daily. So many scents to choose from. The mist are great since they can be used on body and fabric!</li>
            <li> This Patchouli spray is the real deal.  It smells like patchouli.  Some room sprays do not smell quite right but I loved this one so much I bought another.</li>
            <li> Received a bottle with oil floating on top, myself and others thought it looked old.  I requested to return it and never heard back.  Don&#x27;t order this subpar product!</li>
            <li> I understand the attempt, but the delivery really does not impress me. Once you spray it on your skin you get a very strong &amp;#34;pinesol&amp;#34;-like aroma that is a little unpleasant. Now after a good chunk of time passes you actually start to smell the good aspect of the spray. A good patchouli scent is hard to find, but this unfortunately does not take the cake.</li>
