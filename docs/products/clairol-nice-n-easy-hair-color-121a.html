            <li>I have used Nice &amp; Easy for years - even before the gray and seriously, my hair is better for it.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>This color was exactly as it appears on the box.</li>
            <li>The caramel brown color is actually distinctively more reddish than is shown.  </li>
            <li>Stay with the correct color if you are gray, but just dye the gray part first and longer.  </li>
            <li>Still think, full, soft and glossy....especially right after dying.  </li>
            <li>It is simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This turns out redder than it appears on the box, but it is a very natural-looking medium reddish brown.  </li>
            <li>It is a lovely brown with a slight hint of auburn when the sun hints.</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money for this chemical product!!</li>
            <li>Also tried the 116 natural caramel brown but much lighter.</li>
            <li>I purchased online (normally purchase at drugstore or Walmart).  </li>
            <li>I can live with it for now but won&#x27;t purchase this one again.</li>
            <li>You live and you learn.</li>
            <li>People are surprised to hear I color my hair!  </li>
            <li>It looks so natural.</li>
            <li>if red is not a color you want in your hair then try another color, but for me this is very close, and it matches the picture on the box with my hair...</li>
            <li>anyway I was waiting for the result and its came out completely</li>
            <li>Natural auburn hair.  </li>
            <li>It is really close to my natural hair color, which yes is a medium brown with red tones in it especially when I am out in the sun...</li>
            <li>I usually use 116 which is a light brown, but I thought I would try something different for a change.</li>
            <li>The color is a soft brown with some red highlights.</li>
            <li>I could barely breathe.</li>
            <li>This is nice because it doesnt look fake.  </li>

            <li> I should have read through the other reviews before I purchased. As already noted, color IN the box does not match the color ON the box. This is actually an auburn, so if you&#x27;re not interested in a lot of red in your hair this isn&#x27;t for you. I can live with it for now but won&#x27;t purchase this one again.</li>
            <li> Good color coverage! Nice color!</li>
            <li> Everyone loved this color on me last time. It is a lovely brown with a slight hint of auburn when the sun hints. Takes the brown to another level. I wasn&#x27;t sure about it, but everyone loved it and still talk about it, even my best friend who is bitterly honest. LOL! Sometimes its pains me, but if she were not so honest, I wouldn&#x27;t trust her opinion so much. She loves this color, so I know I have found the perfect brunette color with a little pizazz.</li>
            <li> My Name is Joyce not Charles. I love this color and can not find it in the stores that is why I brought it online.</li>
            <li> This product is VERY warm ie red.  Good product just not my color.</li>
            <li> For soem reason, stores have stopped carrying this color of this fabulous product!  I found it on Amazon and it was delived within three days - great stuff!</li>
            <li> My favorite color. it is easy to use. It never disapoints me. It does fade but they all do. right?</li>
            <li> This is my go-to color.  It looks so natural. People are surprised to hear I color my hair!  My hair actually looks healthier after using Nice and Easy.  This turns out redder than it appears on the box, but it is a very natural-looking medium reddish brown.  It is not harsh or dark or brassy or purply.  I love it.</li>
            <li> found my perfect color</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments on this color. Was bummed when i couldn&#x27;t find it at the store. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of hair color for many years and have never had any problems.</li>
            <li> package was delivered promptly.  Hair color I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This color was exactly as it appears on the box. I would definitely buy this again. The color is a soft brown with some red highlights.</li>
            <li> I purchased online (normally purchase at drugstore or Walmart).  Product arrived in good shape and worked as expected. Price was good too.</li>
            <li> I love this color, and cannot find it locally, so of course it is occasionally available on Amazon. Maybe not as good a price as Walmart with a coupon, but if you want this color, you can set up a subscription for delivery every month or so. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> turned my hair bright red!  ugh</li>
            <li> Glad I found this product here. It is really close to my natural hair color, which yes is a medium brown with red tones in it especially when I am out in the sun... if red is not a color you want in your hair then try another color, but for me this is very close, and it matches the picture on the box with my hair... each person is different though so with hair color you take a chance.</li>
            <li> We were not happy with the hair color which resulted from the use of this product because we relied on the color of the hair on the model on the box.  The caramel brown color is actually distinctively more reddish than is shown.  That is not what we had wanted.</li>
            <li> Terrible product!! I just used the medium brown today, its smell was awful and my husband left the house because of the strong and bad smell, still after 3 hours I feel vomiting and having bad headache  ..anyway I was waiting for the result and its came out completely REDDISH!!!which was supposed to be medium brown!! DO NOT waste your money for this chemical product!!</li>
            <li> Love this color.  Natural auburn hair.  This is nice because it doesnt look fake.  Also tried the 116 natural caramel brown but much lighter.</li>
            <li> The worst hair coloring experience of my life. This is off the shelves with good reason....the smell almost made me faint..I could barely breathe. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! Horrible fumes!! These days they dont put all that stuff in hair products anymore...buy your hair products in a store..not online!!</li>
            <li> I love nice n easy,have used it for years</li>
            <li> Horrible! the chemical smell&#x27;s horrible and the color&#x27;s horrible. The color&#x27;s too red. And I got headache about one hour after using it.</li>
            <li> I receive many compliments about this hair color.  I am in my later 60&#x27;s and it does a great job of covering my gray.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I could buy this here.  I have looked everywhere for it in stores with no luck.  I have tried three or four different \\&quot;close\\&quot; shades which made my hair too dark or too orange. I will order again.</li>
            <li> I usually use 116 which is a light brown, but I thought I would try something different for a change. This color is very, very, RED. Something I did not plan on and do not like at all. You live and you learn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the color I want, and I can no longer find it in stores.</li>
            <li> I use nice n easy all the time, Thanks for the quick delivery</li>
            <li> I love the ease of good coverage and highlights all in one.&lt;br /&gt;If this exact combo could be put in a foam for less messy application it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite even for my now gray hair.  I have used Nice &amp; Easy for years - even before the gray and seriously, my hair is better for it.  Still think, full, soft and glossy....especially right after dying.  It is simple and easy to use.  Get a shade lighter than desired if you have no gray.  Stay with the correct color if you are gray, but just dye the gray part first and longer.  You will be happy with the evenness as well as the blend of colors that makes it natural looking.  People still do not guess that I am actually gray!</li>
