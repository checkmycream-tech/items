            <li>I was looking for some nice oil to use in a diffuser around the holidays.  </li>

            <li>If you enjoy the smell of a fresh Christmas tree, or wreath, and relate this smell to all the happy memories, you will be very glad you purchased this.</li>

            <li>lovely</li>
            <li>This scent is one of my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love Paine&#x27;s Balsam Fir Fragrance Oil.  </li>
            <li>If you order this, have the aspirin standing by... :)</li>
            <li>We use the burners you put a tea candle under and it smells like Christmas all the time  :)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love Paine&#x27;s Balsam Fir Fragrance Oil</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this oil</li>
            <li>Works great to keep the mice out of my classic cars over the winter</li>
            <li>Strongly suggest you order that instead.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is strong.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of strong, but doesn&#x27;t smell all that much like a real fir tree.</li>
            <li>Great price for size when considered against other sizes.</li>
            <li>It smells of fresh christmas trees.  </li>
            <li>So after paying a decent amount for \\&quot;fragrance oil\\&quot; that I don&#x27;t even know how much real Balsam oil it contains, I also don&#x27;t have an easy way to dispense it so must go out and buy a dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>most essential oils have them</li>
            <li>showed up on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this balsam oil is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised ....</li>
            <li>but I am wasting more than I am using as long as I keep it in this bottle ..I need to find a bottle to transfer it to..</li>
            <li>and it is labeled \\&quot;100% pure balsam fir needle</li>
            <li>Almost makes me think I bought a real tree</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased Paines Balsam Fir oil from Sensia.com, but their shipping charges are outrageous, so I&#x27;m happy to have been able to purchase and have delivered FREE on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and realize instantly that I hadn&#x27;t received the &#x27;real&#x27; stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>oil doesn&#x27;t have bad smell, but is fairly similar to the natural odor, so you may be quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not terribly long lasting.</li>

            <li> I normally buy from bath and body works but thought I would try this out as it is much less</li>
            <li> but the top is wide open instead of having something stuck in to slow the pour so every time I use it I loose a few drops it need a pour control feature please ????</li>
            <li> I use it all year long.  </li>
            <li> and I mean no one is going to walk in and think the smell is a real Christmas tree.  </li>
            <li> I purchased some other fragrances because I didn&#x27;t realize I could buy Paine&#x27;s on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> When I apply it to my sachets, the scent will last at least one month.  </li>
            <li> the fragrance is spot on the bottle is a mess</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s feed store carried an item like this, little cloth bags with balsam oil.  </li>
            <li> I believe the way most fragrant oils are made is they mix a fragrance (artificial) or a natural essence into an inexpensive oil base.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have them dead, but we have pets and already lost a puppy to mouse/rat poison.  </li>
            <li> Ordering it was my mistake, not Amazon&#x27;s or Paine&#x27;s, but it was still irritating to open seal and cap, take a sniff . . .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to pour just a few drops on your diffuser or burner.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a subtle difference between that and \\&quot;Balsam Fir Oil.\\</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pine or fir scent over the holidays which seems hard to find these days.</li>
            <li> I looked on the label and on the website for ingredients or at least a \\&quot;100%</li>
            <li> This is an artificial &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; oil, not a natural &amp;#34;essential&amp;#34; oil.</li>
            <li> The other fragrances were disappointing and I&#x27;ll probably never use them.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for a Christmas tree ornament that was to hang on artificial tree.  </li>
            <li> But I was disappointed with the results of my error.</li>
            <li> They hate the smell.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product to mix with ground corn cobs (pet litter) to make rodent repellent packets to put in RV .</li>

            <li> Great Balsam Fragrance Oil at an amazing price! We are enjoying it during the holidays!  I love that smell and it reminds me of being in the mountains. Our house smells like Christmas!</li>
            <li> This is the oil you want.  Almost makes me think I bought a real tree</li>
            <li> lovely but the top is wide open instead of having something stuck in to slow the pour so every time I use it I loose a few drops it need a pour control feature please ???? most essential oils have them so I have never had this problem but I am wasting more than I am using as long as I keep it in this bottle ..I need to find a bottle to transfer it to..the fragrance is spot on the bottle is a mess</li>
            <li> showed up on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this balsam oil is exactly as described.  When I apply it to my sachets, the scent will last at least one month.  This scent is one of my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love Paine&#x27;s Balsam Fir Fragrance Oil.  I have used it in diffusers, but plan to use it for making my own candles.  I purchased some other fragrances because I didn&#x27;t realize I could buy Paine&#x27;s on Amazon.  The other fragrances were disappointing and I&#x27;ll probably never use them. I&#x27;ve purchased Paines Balsam Fir oil from Sensia.com, but their shipping charges are outrageous, so I&#x27;m happy to have been able to purchase and have delivered FREE on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was looking for some nice oil to use in a diffuser around the holidays.  I&#x27;ve never heard of this company but took a chance.  The oil has a pleasant smell but no one and I mean no one is going to walk in and think the smell is a real Christmas tree.  I looked on the label and on the website for ingredients or at least a \\&quot;100% all natural\\&quot; but couldn&#x27;t find that anywhere and the label says \\&quot;Balsam Fir Fragrance Oil\\&quot; so I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a subtle difference between that and \\&quot;Balsam Fir Oil.\\&quot;  I believe the way most fragrant oils are made is they mix a fragrance (artificial) or a natural essence into an inexpensive oil base.  Again, no details on the label or the website as to how this oil was made or what it contains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there&#x27;s no dropper on the bottle, so it&#x27;s hard to pour just a few drops on your diffuser or burner.  So after paying a decent amount for \\&quot;fragrance oil\\&quot; that I don&#x27;t even know how much real Balsam oil it contains, I also don&#x27;t have an easy way to dispense it so must go out and buy a dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My quest for the perfect Christmas fragrance oil continues.... this is definitely not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/28: After writing the above review and clicking \\&quot;submit\\&quot; my partner walked into the room and said \\&quot;What is THAT SMELL?\\&quot;  When told it was supposed to be balsam oil he laughed and said it was giving him a headache.  I then ordered [[ASIN:B0014UEG50 Now Foods Balsam Fir Oil, 1-Ounce]] and it is labeled \\&quot;100% pure balsam fir needle oil\\&quot; and smells great.  Strongly suggest you order that instead.  If you order this, have the aspirin standing by... :)</li>
            <li> Bought this product for a Christmas tree ornament that was to hang on artificial tree.  Used the incense that burned instead this ... will use the Oil next year.</li>
            <li> Good quality, delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome. If you enjoy the smell of a fresh Christmas tree, or wreath, and relate this smell to all the happy memories, you will be very glad you purchased this. We use the burners you put a tea candle under and it smells like Christmas all the time  :)</li>
            <li> Smells awesome.  Great price for size when considered against other sizes. Made in USA</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells of fresh christmas trees.  I use it all year long.  I have an ulta sonic aroma humidifier that i put 5 drops in. Wonderful</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the woods in Maine!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to mix with ground corn cobs (pet litter) to make rodent repellent packets to put in RV . It has been reported to be a smell that deters mice invasion during off season when camper is not used. It works great and the RV smells great as well.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s feed store carried an item like this, little cloth bags with balsam oil.  It does a great job keeping mice out of campers &amp; RVs.  Ours is parked in a horse field and we had no sign of them at all last summer.  They hate the smell.  I&#x27;d rather have them dead, but we have pets and already lost a puppy to mouse/rat poison.  Now we just refresh the oil on the cedar bags every 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love Paine&#x27;s Balsam Fir Fragrance Oil</li>
            <li> Works great to keep the mice out of my classic cars over the winter</li>
            <li> Caution! This is an artificial &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; oil, not a natural &amp;#34;essential&amp;#34; oil. Ordering it was my mistake, not Amazon&#x27;s or Paine&#x27;s, but it was still irritating to open seal and cap, take a sniff . . . and realize instantly that I hadn&#x27;t received the &#x27;real&#x27; stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil doesn&#x27;t have bad smell, but is fairly similar to the natural odor, so you may be quite happy with it. But I was disappointed with the results of my error.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this oil but it&#x27;s not terribly long lasting.</li>
            <li> I normally buy from bath and body works but thought I would try this out as it is much less and you get a lot.  It paid off because it is great and I will buy again</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and condition as described by seller.  Exactly as advertised .... a must at Christmas time .... great the rest of the year if you like the smell of pines.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pine or fir scent over the holidays which seems hard to find these days. Don&#x27;t want to burn incense but wanted to use the atomizer. It&#x27;s kind of strong, but doesn&#x27;t smell all that much like a real fir tree. I&#x27;ll keep looking I suppose come next winter.</li>
            <li> Great purchase!  The fragrance is strong.  The bottle is nice too.</li>
