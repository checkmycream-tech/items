            <li>Has a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Even though I like the way this body wash lathers and leaves my skin feeling great</li>
            <li>Great lather.</li>
            <li>Great smell.</li>
            <li>This body wash is a very nice fragrance  </li>
            <li>and you get the good one that is goof for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Leathers up good.</li>
            <li>I love that it smells great</li>
            <li>This has a refreshing salty-sweet scent that&#x27;s great for shaving.</li>
            <li>Vitabath eliminates the obnoxious sulfates and delivers a very nice body wash with a lovely fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overpower the user.</li>
            <li>But&lt;br /&gt;overall, I still love my Vitabath!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m eager to try more scents!</li>
            <li>Nice refreshing scent without being overwhelming, this product is great for anyone.</li>
            <li>It smells nice</li>
            <li>However, it can also be layered nicely with Vitabath&#x27;s Beach Blossom fragrance mist and hydrating body lotion.</li>
            <li>It smelled kind of generically flowery-oceany.</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>This might be ok for others.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not terrible.</li>
            <li>Non toxic like so many things are now.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this body wash</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t just wash off your skin.  </li>
            <li>We love the Vitabath line, though.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice when you apply it, but the scent dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the original \\&quot;Spring</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t rate as a user, just a giver and that seemed fine.</li>
            <li>Paraben free too</li>
            <li>I am sure the product is fine for most people, but it is clear I need to use cream oil bodywashes.</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s WORTH it!</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product is it does not have parabens in it.</li>
            <li>BUT it is CONCENTRATED so much that I think this is a better deal than the cheaper brands</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Paraben-Free&lt;br /&gt;Scent fades quickly</li>
            <li>Exactly like the beach!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!This just isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Scent is too floral for me, I prefer fresh scents like linen/breeze/ocean&lt;br /&gt;Dried</li>
            <li>The formula contains quality ingredients and is free of harsh chemicals, great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is paraben free which sold me initially, AND it&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
            <li>and my skin is so soft and smells good for long time after shower.</li>
            <li>I like the original green better.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brand, its great on the skin and far less drying than many other brands...</li>
            <li>I still give 4 stars, as it&#x27;s hard to find good bubble bath these days.</li>
            <li>This is great shower gel, it has a fresh, clean scent and you only need a little bit because it really goes a long way!</li>
            <li>very well&lt;br /&gt;Concentrated</li>
            <li>If you are under 40 and/or very oily, this should do the trick for you.</li>
            <li>FAST shipping</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all of Vitabath&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li>I love this body wash and will continue to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a big bottle of the \\&quot;Lime Citron Basil\\&quot; and I don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way while lightly moisturizing in the shower and makes a luxurious bubble bath.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> If u want to buy vitabath, I suggest the bubble bath.It&#x27;s amazing!This just isn&#x27;t worth the money.It smells nice I guess. cat in PA.</li>
            <li> Nice refreshing scent without being overwhelming, this product is great for anyone. Has a very pleasant smell. I personally would describe it as a Caribbean Ocean vibe. A little goes a long way while lightly moisturizing in the shower and makes a luxurious bubble bath. The formula contains quality ingredients and is free of harsh chemicals, great for sensitive skin. Simply used alone, this is perfection. However, it can also be layered nicely with Vitabath&#x27;s Beach Blossom fragrance mist and hydrating body lotion.</li>
            <li> Even though I like the way this body wash lathers and leaves my skin feeling great I can&#x27;t stand the smell. It does have a &amp;#34;beachy-sunscreeny&amp;#34; sort of smell but there is some underlying odor that ruins it for me. This might be ok for others. It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> This is an affordable sulfate and paraben-free bodywash. It is usually difficult to find inexpensive items of this type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate-Free&lt;br /&gt;Paraben-Free&lt;br /&gt;Scent fades quickly&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well&lt;br /&gt;Lathers very well&lt;br /&gt;Concentrated - a little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Scent is too floral for me, I prefer fresh scents like linen/breeze/ocean&lt;br /&gt;Dried out my delicate, dry skin even though I wash in cool water&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a VERY slight film&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not terrible. I am sure the product is fine for most people, but it is clear I need to use cream oil bodywashes. If you are under 40 and/or very oily, this should do the trick for you. I&#x27;d recommend it for others.</li>
            <li> I love that it smells great and my skin is so soft and smells good for long time after shower.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the original \\&quot;Spring Green\\&quot;, I purchased it at a yard sale about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;And the reviews are correct:it&#x27;s AWESOME for those of us with \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; skin/a little goes a LONG way! Although, I feel it&#x27;s not made the same. I recently purchased a big bottle of the \\&quot;Lime Citron Basil\\&quot; and I don&#x27;t like it as much. But&lt;br /&gt;overall, I still love my Vitabath! To me, it&#x27;s WORTH it!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t extremely impressed with this product.  It smells nice when you apply it, but the scent dissipates quickly.  Not very moisturizing.  Not something I&#x27;d order again.</li>
            <li> I like the original green better.  The only good thing about this product is it does not have parabens in it.</li>
            <li> The best shower wash. Paraben free too</li>
            <li> I really like this brand, its great on the skin and far less drying than many other brands... I just didn&#x27;t quite like the smell of this one. It smelled kind of generically flowery-oceany.</li>
            <li> Vitabath eliminates the obnoxious sulfates and delivers a very nice body wash with a lovely fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overpower the user.</li>
            <li> FAST shipping (of course...this IS sent from Amazon)...My husband loves this in his bath....I have used Vitabath since I was a teenager and NOW.....it is a little more expensive BUT it is CONCENTRATED so much that I think this is a better deal than the cheaper brands and you get the good one that is goof for your skin.  Non toxic like so many things are now.  I would always recommend....</li>
            <li> Nice smell. Leathers up good. Refreshing.</li>
            <li> I bought several different &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of Vitabath for a gift. I can&#x27;t rate as a user, just a giver and that seemed fine. But I recall not being overwhelmed by the fragrances I chose (which were maybe 5 total). I still give 4 stars, as it&#x27;s hard to find good bubble bath these days.</li>
            <li> This has a refreshing salty-sweet scent that&#x27;s great for shaving.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this body wash and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t just wash off your skin.  I definitely plan to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is great shower gel, it has a fresh, clean scent and you only need a little bit because it really goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Vitabath is a great product!  This body wash is a very nice fragrance  I highly recommend all of Vitabath&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> Great lather. Great smell. Doesn&#x27;t leave skin my dry or with a filmy soap residue. I love this body wash and will continue to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby because I would like for him to use shower gels with built in moisturizers. This was a little to feminine for him and it was a little over powering for me.  We ended up with the Basil scent, which works for both of us.  We love the Vitabath line, though.  Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Have been using Vitabath  in one &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; or another for decades. Do not use any soaps on my skin; this product has always been favorable.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect showel gel. It is paraben free which sold me initially, AND it&#x27;s sulfate free so our skin won&#x27;t be stripped and dried out--ever get out of the shower and feel itchy and dry, that&#x27;s why! Vitabath really does moisturize the skin and a little goes a VERY long way. I added a little drop to my loofah and I had extra at the end of my bath. The smell is great! Exactly like the beach! I&#x27;m eager to try more scents!</li>
