    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>For those with oily skin this may be a perfect moisturizer alone</li>
            <li>Its an excellent way to care for your skin without all of the toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with the brightening effect these products have on my skin.</li>
            <li>but this is a very pleasant lemon smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is very pleasant and relaxing--not overbearing.</li>
            <li>I use this as my night time cream, and I&#x27;m very happy that my skin is happy.</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;ll be repurchasing this because it smells wonderful and makes my skin look nice.</li>

            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I will keep buying it for sure!</li>
            <li>I love Acure products: clean ingredients, gluten-free, nice smell, quality, results and great price!</li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have used a good amount of the bottle now, making sure to apply every day.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells really nice-</li>
            <li>Both on its own as well as with another moisturizer and toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the two pair great together).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients &#x3D; Organic High-oleic Safflower Oil, Organic Sesame Seed Oil, Organic Pumpkin Seed Oil, Organic Borage Oil, Organic Argan Oil,  Organic Sweet Orange oil, Organic Cranberry Seed Oil, Organic Bulgarian Lavender Oil, Organic Olive Oil, Organic Rosemary Oil</li>
            <li>A good product, but I didn&#x27;t notice any significant reduction of my brown spots.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for everyday use, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love Acure products in general, but I especially love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this moisturiser.&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li>Anyhow, like with many of us, I am now trying to undo the sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I THINK that the spots look even more faded after a couple of weeks of using this moisturiser</li>
            <li>and I THINK that the spots look even more faded after a couple of weeks of using this moisturiser</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Normally, I love their products.  </li>
            <li>My skin tone did get better but it did make me break out-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and it&#x27;s light which is always good for the skin</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels better and smoother with fewer irregularities.</li>
            <li>love this cream.</li>
            <li>I am still waiting to be sure if it is making a noticeable difference, but I think it is.  </li>
            <li>top of this, I found the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; unpleasing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite, and I will not purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>This tends to make for a nice and smooth surface for your make up application.</li>
            <li>-- I saw an actual difference in my skin and have continued to be really impressed with it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My face just looks so much more balanced and even toned.</li>
            <li>But what I do notice is that it has worked well to tone and soften up the skin right after a good cleanse and also seems to help soothe any redness.</li>
            <li>I think the price point is great for an organic product and the size is decent.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very light, it feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>Even better, this product is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>, so I am excited and hopeful and will add to this review in a couple of months of combining these treatments :)</li>
            <li>, so I am excited and hopeful and will add to this review in a couple of months of combining these treatments :)</li>
            <li>Not bad at all!  </li>
            <li>too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li>Felt nice to apply the first time.</li>
            <li>This is a Serum Treatment product that is recommended for any skin type that is in need of diminishing imperfections of either fine lines or scars.</li>
            <li>Fine lines softened.</li>
            <li>I am going to be 29 in September, have fine lines on my face from smiling (not mad about that!)</li>
            <li>Despite the look of just another lotion in a bottle it did go on smoothly and soaked in rapidly.</li>
            <li>Or if used at night, apply just under a night cream or light weight moisture mask or treatment oil.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh lemon scent.</li>
            <li>I have loved everything that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>It works great at night under the ACURE Seriously Firming Serum (which is actually a good treatment oil as opposed to a serum</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to apply it in the morning with no makeup and have consistent, oil free complexion all day.</li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s natural, and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li>I am very fair and never spent a huge amount of time in the sun and always looked after my skin except for the most important thing - religious use of sunscreen!!!</li>
            <li>I received this lotion to review and was really excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive/fair skin and first purchased to help fade the line between my healthy skin &amp; Vitiligo affected skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Acure radical resurfacing lotion for about two weeks now and there is a significant difference in the texture and appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I saw that it was actually more like a lotion I was wondering if they really should have called it a serum.</li>
            <li>but it feels good and has a terrific scent.  </li>
            <li>Really wish I could love this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone trying to brighten up! :)</li>
            <li>Mainly because I reacted to many sunscreens.</li>
            <li>The texture is great--not greasy and it is super absorbent.</li>
            <li>And, the price is extremely reasonable for such an effective, safe product.</li>
            <li>when I saw that this moisturiser from a brand I love, is based on lemon too, and designed specifically to remove sun spots, I decided to use this OVER the straight (organic) lemon juice I am putting on my face each night to compound the lemony action :)</li>
            <li>After I use this lotion my skin feels super soft and my scarring from acne is getting better.</li>
            <li>Soaks RIGHT IN, and QUICK.</li>
            <li>but it is very lightweight so most will need to apply some sort of day moisturizer in the morning still as it is not designed for intense hydration.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that has caused me any kind of reaction.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed into my skin pretty quickly after I apply it</li>
            <li>Originally picked this lotion up at Whole Foods and then found it to be better-priced on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great gentle resurfacing without harsh chemicals or side effects.</li>
            <li>While I cannot say I noticed a difference in sun-spots, I do find that my skin is very soft after applying, AND, breakout free.</li>
            <li>(VERY unusual for me).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased to have finally found a product that actually makes a difference and is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I even use in the morning and night but only if I am not going anywhere highly social as the orange, lavender and rosemary oils (although a pleasant scent to me) have evoked comments from my friends that I smelled \\&quot;herbal\\&quot; or \\&quot;like</li>
            <li>does exactly what it promises without all the chemicals</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is hard to say if it has been a strong effective treatment for scar tissue, etc.</li>
            <li>, b/c I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dark spot lighteners on the market and none of them did a thing, so I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this, but I love their moisturizers and thought,  if anything it will be a good facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Within 3 months I was able to see a 70% reduction in my life long acne scars.</li>
            <li>I have been using straight lemon juice on my face every night for perhaps 6 months now</li>
            <li>And my skin is so soft and fresh feeling afterward.  </li>
            <li>It does moisturize very well too</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 6+ months now and really like it.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit worried about reacting to this product but have used other products from this company with no problems and love them all</li>
            <li>was also able to see more small improvements when I added the Brightening facial scrub:</li>
            <li>I havn&#x27;t been using this product long enough to know just how effective it is</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend everything from the Acure product line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this product from natural whole food market</li>
            <li>dermatologist told me that the best product for removing spots caused by sun damage was lemon juice (previously I had used a quinine cream that another dermatologist prescribed except that it burned my skin which then scabbed over and left a couple of small indented scars on my jawline)</li>
            <li>My new dermatologist told me that the quinine cream wasn&#x27;t even for sunspots from sun damage and that dermatologists prescribe the quinine cream all the time and her patients always say that it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I anticipate I will use this product in the warmer summer months (as it is fairly light) and the day cream in the cooler winter months when my skin becomes more dry, dull and flaky.</li>
            <li>I began using this moisturizing lotion as the season began warming up and felt that my skin was becoming a little oily for my liking.</li>
            <li>My skin is VERY sensitive.</li>
            <li>Serums are very lightweight treatment products with a small molecular structure that allows them to penetrate the skin barriers quickly and effectively - because of the lightweight and ease of absorbtion they often work faster then a regular face cream and are designed to be worn under other moisturizers and makup.</li>
            <li>I am excited to try other products put out by Acure.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised by almost immediate sifting and brightening of my skin, esp on discolored spots!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a cheaper alternative to natural, organic skin care, then ACURE is the way to go!</li>
            <li>the lemon juice removes all traces of makeup)  and it HAS faded the spots a lot (and also my freckles which I am very ok with) but when I use the lemon juice by itself it tightens and dries my skin out a bit, so I have been carefully putting a moisuriser over the lemon juice (after it dried) hoping that it sealed in the lemon rather than diluting it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Even scars that were over a year old were smoothed out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also purchased this for my mother who has considerable sun/dark sports.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin a bit sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have super pale skin</li>
            <li>But, because it is so gentle, you have to give it some time to work, and combine it with other therapies.</li>
            <li>It is designed to apply the antioxidant rich cream to any trouble spots of wrinkles, scars and red or dry patches on the face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this moisturizer, especially for being natural (and expensive), but I have oily skin</li>
            <li>Too bad, as I love much of the rest of the Acure line, especially their shampoos and their body lotions.</li>

            <li> Sometimes I even use in the morning and night but only if I am not going anywhere highly social as the orange, lavender and rosemary oils (although a pleasant scent to me) have evoked comments from my friends that I smelled \\&quot;herbal\\&quot; or \\&quot;like</li>
            <li> does exactly what it promises without all the chemicals</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is hard to say if it has been a strong effective treatment for scar tissue, etc.</li>
            <li> , b/c I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dark spot lighteners on the market and none of them did a thing, so I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this, but I love their moisturizers and thought,  if anything it will be a good facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Within 3 months I was able to see a 70% reduction in my life long acne scars.</li>
            <li> I have been using straight lemon juice on my face every night for perhaps 6 months now</li>
            <li> And my skin is so soft and fresh feeling afterward.  </li>
            <li> It does moisturize very well too</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 6+ months now and really like it.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit worried about reacting to this product but have used other products from this company with no problems and love them all</li>
            <li> was also able to see more small improvements when I added the Brightening facial scrub:</li>
            <li> I havn&#x27;t been using this product long enough to know just how effective it is</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend everything from the Acure product line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product from natural whole food market</li>
            <li> dermatologist told me that the best product for removing spots caused by sun damage was lemon juice (previously I had used a quinine cream that another dermatologist prescribed except that it burned my skin which then scabbed over and left a couple of small indented scars on my jawline)</li>
            <li> My new dermatologist told me that the quinine cream wasn&#x27;t even for sunspots from sun damage and that dermatologists prescribe the quinine cream all the time and her patients always say that it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I anticipate I will use this product in the warmer summer months (as it is fairly light) and the day cream in the cooler winter months when my skin becomes more dry, dull and flaky.</li>
            <li> I began using this moisturizing lotion as the season began warming up and felt that my skin was becoming a little oily for my liking.</li>
            <li> My skin is VERY sensitive.</li>
            <li> Serums are very lightweight treatment products with a small molecular structure that allows them to penetrate the skin barriers quickly and effectively - because of the lightweight and ease of absorbtion they often work faster then a regular face cream and are designed to be worn under other moisturizers and makup.</li>
            <li> I am excited to try other products put out by Acure.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised by almost immediate sifting and brightening of my skin, esp on discolored spots!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cheaper alternative to natural, organic skin care, then ACURE is the way to go!</li>
            <li> the lemon juice removes all traces of makeup)  and it HAS faded the spots a lot (and also my freckles which I am very ok with) but when I use the lemon juice by itself it tightens and dries my skin out a bit, so I have been carefully putting a moisuriser over the lemon juice (after it dried) hoping that it sealed in the lemon rather than diluting it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Even scars that were over a year old were smoothed out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also purchased this for my mother who has considerable sun/dark sports.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin a bit sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I have super pale skin</li>
            <li> But, because it is so gentle, you have to give it some time to work, and combine it with other therapies.</li>
            <li> It is designed to apply the antioxidant rich cream to any trouble spots of wrinkles, scars and red or dry patches on the face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this moisturizer, especially for being natural (and expensive), but I have oily skin</li>
            <li> Too bad, as I love much of the rest of the Acure line, especially their shampoos and their body lotions.</li>
            <li> For those that might find it too greasy - I would recommend using just a small amount and really allowing it to soak in thoroughly before applying moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> spots are fading fast now after about 6 months of diligent lemon juice treatment, my face is now feeling less tight and dry with this moisuriser</li>
            <li> so I do not have to wait a very long time to put my makeup on.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a clean alternative to my Olay Regenerist Night Resurfacing Elixir, but sadly this is not it.</li>
            <li> , I have dry skin</li>
            <li> This had been the only change in my typical routine.</li>
            <li> I still get the occasional blemish and the hyperpigmentation spots fade MAYBE a little faster than they used to.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it smells a little funky but</li>
            <li> I was not able to use it long enough to see if it would help my discoloration/acne scarring.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it performs as expected.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would get rid of some blotchy spots ( probably sun spots ) on my face, as well as the occasional acne and uneven blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I think it has helped and it seems that my acne has decreased with the use of this and Acure Sensitive Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> A flat green- gray.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It wears well under makeup and other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> and this makes my face extremely oily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well its does as an actual resurfacing cream, but I&#x27;ve been using it for months</li>
            <li> I used all other Acure products.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps someone!my face is now feeling less tight and dry with this moisuriser</li>
            <li> I previously have been using the Acure Day Cream to moisturize my dry skin (I live in a cold weather region) and had recently been experiencing drier-than-normal skin.</li>
            <li> and I have never repurchased a product for dark spots because nothing has ever worked.  </li>
            <li> Just a small dollop on discoloration goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Dark spots lightened.</li>
            <li> Masks, exfoliating, toning, maybe even a little dermaplaning.</li>
            <li> Normally I am NOT a lemon scent person at all, but this is not overwhelming and leaves just a hint of smelly-good freshness on your face!</li>
            <li> I recently had to go on a medication that caused acne and resulting scarring, something I was desperate to get rid of (especially as someone who never had this problem before).  </li>
            <li> I was embarassed to even go to the gym without make up just a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s making any difference for my hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> This product made my face get small lumps under the skin on my cheeks that almost look like whiteheads.</li>
            <li> just like lemons (which I don&#x27;t usually like)</li>
            <li> I would say after about 3-4 applications that I can tell my freckles on my cheeks from age and sun exposure are reduced by at least 75%.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 2-3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> it ended up in my nail polish box, I just use it for my cuticles since I can&#x27;t find another use for it... :(</li>
            <li> I will try to return it:(</li>
            <li> and from smoking (unhappy about those, but I&#x27;ve quit!).</li>
            <li> and it is especially bad in colder weather, I literally need an oil coating to keep my skin from flaking off from cold winter weather.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s impossible for me to use it, just gets disgusting....</li>
            <li> so I was so frustrated!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t harm anything - eg, I didn&#x27;t break out or get a rash, but it just didn&#x27;t do anything either. I was looking for a clean alternative to my Olay Regenerist Night Resurfacing Elixir, but sadly this is not it. Too bad, as I love much of the rest of the Acure line, especially their shampoos and their body lotions.</li>
            <li> This is a Serum Treatment product that is recommended for any skin type that is in need of diminishing imperfections of either fine lines or scars. It is designed to apply the antioxidant rich cream to any trouble spots of wrinkles, scars and red or dry patches on the face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw that it was actually more like a lotion I was wondering if they really should have called it a serum. Serums are very lightweight treatment products with a small molecular structure that allows them to penetrate the skin barriers quickly and effectively - because of the lightweight and ease of absorbtion they often work faster then a regular face cream and are designed to be worn under other moisturizers and makup. Despite the look of just another lotion in a bottle it did go on smoothly and soaked in rapidly. It wears well under makeup and other moisturizers. I have used a good amount of the bottle now, making sure to apply every day. Sometimes I even use in the morning and night but only if I am not going anywhere highly social as the orange, lavender and rosemary oils (although a pleasant scent to me) have evoked comments from my friends that I smelled \\&quot;herbal\\&quot; or \\&quot;like lemongrass\\&quot; after I hugged them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to say if it has been a strong effective treatment for scar tissue, etc. But what I do notice is that it has worked well to tone and soften up the skin right after a good cleanse and also seems to help soothe any redness. Once I have cleansed and/or exfoliated and then followed up with a spray toner, I will apply a pump or two all over the face (not spot treated like suggested) and allow about 30 seconds to soak in. For those with oily skin this may be a perfect moisturizer alone but it is very lightweight so most will need to apply some sort of day moisturizer in the morning still as it is not designed for intense hydration. Or if used at night, apply just under a night cream or light weight moisture mask or treatment oil. It works great at night under the ACURE Seriously Firming Serum (which is actually a good treatment oil as opposed to a serum but the two pair great together).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients &#x3D; Organic High-oleic Safflower Oil, Organic Sesame Seed Oil, Organic Pumpkin Seed Oil, Organic Borage Oil, Organic Argan Oil,  Organic Sweet Orange oil, Organic Cranberry Seed Oil, Organic Bulgarian Lavender Oil, Organic Olive Oil, Organic Rosemary Oil</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this moisturizer, especially for being natural (and expensive), but I have oily skin and this makes my face extremely oily, it&#x27;s impossible for me to use it, just gets disgusting....it ended up in my nail polish box, I just use it for my cuticles since I can&#x27;t find another use for it... :(</li>
            <li> My skin is VERY sensitive. I react to so many products! I was a bit worried about reacting to this product but have used other products from this company with no problems and love them all so I thought I would risk it. I LOVE this moisturiser.&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell whether it fades the spots I have from sun damage. I am very fair and never spent a huge amount of time in the sun and always looked after my skin except for the most important thing - religious use of sunscreen!!! Mainly because I reacted to many sunscreens. Anyhow, like with many of us, I am now trying to undo the sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist told me that the best product for removing spots caused by sun damage was lemon juice (previously I had used a quinine cream that another dermatologist prescribed except that it burned my skin which then scabbed over and left a couple of small indented scars on my jawline) My new dermatologist told me that the quinine cream wasn&#x27;t even for sunspots from sun damage and that dermatologists prescribe the quinine cream all the time and her patients always say that it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using straight lemon juice on my face every night for perhaps 6 months now (I keep a bottle of organic lemon juice in the fridge and some cotton swabs in my pantry and do it each night before bed - plus the lemon juice removes all traces of makeup)  and it HAS faded the spots a lot (and also my freckles which I am very ok with) but when I use the lemon juice by itself it tightens and dries my skin out a bit, so I have been carefully putting a moisuriser over the lemon juice (after it dried) hoping that it sealed in the lemon rather than diluting it.&lt;br /&gt;So when I saw that this moisturiser from a brand I love, is based on lemon too, and designed specifically to remove sun spots, I decided to use this OVER the straight (organic) lemon juice I am putting on my face each night to compound the lemony action :)&lt;br /&gt;My spots are fading fast now after about 6 months of diligent lemon juice treatment, my face is now feeling less tight and dry with this moisuriser and I THINK that the spots look even more faded after a couple of weeks of using this moisturiser, so I am excited and hopeful and will add to this review in a couple of months of combining these treatments :) Hope this helps someone!my face is now feeling less tight and dry with this moisuriser and I THINK that the spots look even more faded after a couple of weeks of using this moisturiser, so I am excited and hopeful and will add to this review in a couple of months of combining these treatments :) Hope this helps someone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well its does as an actual resurfacing cream, but I&#x27;ve been using it for months and y skin has been softer and smoother than it used to be. I still get the occasional blemish and the hyperpigmentation spots fade MAYBE a little faster than they used to. But it&#x27;s not a drastic difference. Still, I&#x27;ll be repurchasing this because it smells wonderful and makes my skin look nice.</li>
            <li> I love Acure products: clean ingredients, gluten-free, nice smell, quality, results and great price!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It is amazing.  I have noticed a decrease in pigment of the brown spots of my face!!  And my skin is so soft and fresh feeling afterward.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My freckles are noticeably lighter with one use.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to make a remarkable difference, b/c I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dark spot lighteners on the market and none of them did a thing, so I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this, but I love their moisturizers and thought,  if anything it will be a good facial moisturizer.  I would say after about 3-4 applications that I can tell my freckles on my cheeks from age and sun exposure are reduced by at least 75%.  Not bad at all!  It does moisturize very well too, I have dry skin and it is especially bad in colder weather, I literally need an oil coating to keep my skin from flaking off from cold winter weather.</li>
            <li> I love this. It&#x27;s great gentle resurfacing without harsh chemicals or side effects. But, because it is so gentle, you have to give it some time to work, and combine it with other therapies. Masks, exfoliating, toning, maybe even a little dermaplaning.</li>
            <li> Normally, I love their products.  My skin tone did get better but it did make me break out- I will try to return it:(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s making any difference for my hyperpigmentation. I was initially using it only in the PM, but as of the last 3 days I&#x27;m using it both AM and PM.  I think the price point is great for an organic product and the size is decent.  I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering it again if I don&#x27;t see any improvement or change to my skin tone!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and it&#x27;s light which is always good for the skin so it won&#x27;t clog the pores. The only thing is that it smells a little funky but it&#x27;s bearable which is acceptable.</li>
            <li> It works!  does exactly what it promises without all the chemicals</li>
            <li> Felt nice to apply the first time. It made my skin feel smooth and soft. However, after using it repeatedly for about a week or so, I noticed an increase in blackheads/clogged pores around my jawline. This had been the only change in my typical routine. I was not able to use it long enough to see if it would help my discoloration/acne scarring.</li>
            <li> Hydrating, moisturizing, and no greasy/shiny left over on skin.  I use this as my night time cream, and I&#x27;m very happy that my skin is happy.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. This product made my face get small lumps under the skin on my cheeks that almost look like whiteheads. I used all other Acure products. I have had no issue. This is the only product that has caused me any kind of reaction. I was hoping for a home run. Nope. 😫</li>
            <li> I received this lotion to review and was really excited to try it out. I previously have been using the Acure Day Cream to moisturize my dry skin (I live in a cold weather region) and had recently been experiencing drier-than-normal skin. I began using this moisturizing lotion as the season began warming up and felt that my skin was becoming a little oily for my liking. This lotion smells really nice- just like lemons (which I don&#x27;t usually like) but this is a very pleasant lemon smell. It soaks into my skin very nicely- it does not leave a greasy film on my skin but instead leaves me feeling moisturized and glowing. It is absorbed into my skin pretty quickly after I apply it so I do not have to wait a very long time to put my makeup on. I anticipate I will use this product in the warmer summer months (as it is fairly light) and the day cream in the cooler winter months when my skin becomes more dry, dull and flaky. If you are looking for a great lightweight moisturizer that is both healthy for your skin and the environment, this should be your go-to product. And, the price is extremely reasonable for such an effective, safe product. I am excited to try other products put out by Acure. I have loved everything that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Great health promoting product that does good things for your skin. I have used this product for several years now and it works. My skin looks and feels better and smoother with fewer irregularities. Its an excellent way to care for your skin without all of the toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love this product, after using a month I&#x27;ve already noticed an improvement in my skin!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great on freckles/sun spots.  I have now purchased 2 bottles of this and I have never repurchased a product for dark spots because nothing has ever worked.  Even better, this product is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Within 3 months I was able to see a 70% reduction in my life long acne scars. Even scars that were over a year old were smoothed out.&lt;br /&gt;I did not see improvement in my 5+ yr scars, or very deep pock marks, but there was an overall improvement in my face tone and coloring.&lt;br /&gt;This product feels rejuvenating and nourishing. A little goes a long way. Not too shiny or oily looking. I&#x27;m able to apply it in the morning with no makeup and have consistent, oil free complexion all day. (VERY unusual for me).&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend everything from the Acure product line.&lt;br /&gt;I was also able to see more small improvements when I added the Brightening facial scrub: [[ASIN:B003Z4OD24 B003Z4OD24]]</li>
            <li> I havn&#x27;t been using this product long enough to know just how effective it is but it feels good and has a terrific scent.  Time will tell if it performs as expected.</li>
            <li> love this cream. have purchased multiple times. does not cause breakouts, evens skintone, and does not feel oily. will continue using/buying!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 6+ months now and really like it.  I have sensitive/fair skin and first purchased to help fade the line between my healthy skin &amp; Vitiligo affected skin.  I think it has helped and it seems that my acne has decreased with the use of this and Acure Sensitive Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product makes my face break out.</li>
            <li> I think I like this.  I am still waiting to be sure if it is making a noticeable difference, but I think it is.  It feels and smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 2-3 weeks now. While I cannot say I noticed a difference in sun-spots, I do find that my skin is very soft after applying, AND, breakout free. The texture is great--not greasy and it is super absorbent. Soaks RIGHT IN, and QUICK. I also purchased this for my mother who has considerable sun/dark sports. I will post a revised review if she ends up noticing a color difference. I use this at night as a moisturizer. The smell is very pleasant and relaxing--not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Really wish I could love this. But I found no difference in using this product. Was hoping it would get rid of some blotchy spots ( probably sun spots ) on my face, as well as the occasional acne and uneven blemishes.  Nope nope and nope. It wouldn&#x27;t even moisturize.. Both on its own as well as with another moisturizer and toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of this, I found the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; unpleasing. Almost petroleum-like. It would linger into the morning ( would use at night ). The colors itself does not look &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.. A flat green- gray.</li>
            <li> too strong for my skin. I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I struggled with sun spots problem from years of exposure to sun without applying sunscreen. Hydroquinone didn&#x27;t work so I was so frustrated! I got a sample of this product from natural whole food market and I was surprised by almost immediate sifting and brightening of my skin, esp on discolored spots! I pair it with  MyChelle sunblock and Andalou Renewal cream and I&#x27;m very happy with the brightening effect these products have on my skin. I have combination skin and don&#x27;t find that this product makes my skin break out. I also find lemony herbal scent quite pleading. I don&#x27;t even need a lot to apply to my face. Just a small dollop on discoloration goes a long way. Highly recommended for anyone trying to brighten up! :)</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin a bit sensitive.  It&#x27;s not my favorite, and I will not purchase it again.  I don&#x27;t think it has improved my skin in the slightest.</li>
            <li> I recently had to go on a medication that caused acne and resulting scarring, something I was desperate to get rid of (especially as someone who never had this problem before).  I was embarassed to even go to the gym without make up just a few weeks ago.  I have been using the Acure radical resurfacing lotion for about two weeks now and there is a significant difference in the texture and appearance of my skin.  I use this twice a day and let it soak in for 5-10 minutes before applying my daily moisturizer.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased to have finally found a product that actually makes a difference and is well worth the money.  I will definitely continue to use this lotion.  For those that might find it too greasy - I would recommend using just a small amount and really allowing it to soak in thoroughly before applying moisturizer.  This tends to make for a nice and smooth surface for your make up application.</li>
            <li> Good results. Dark spots lightened. Skin lighter and softer. Fine lines softened.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Has worked great.</li>
            <li> A good product, but I didn&#x27;t notice any significant reduction of my brown spots.</li>
            <li> Originally picked this lotion up at Whole Foods and then found it to be better-priced on Amazon. Great lotion -- I saw an actual difference in my skin and have continued to be really impressed with it. I like the oil-control lotion as well!</li>
            <li> Rad product, defiantly notice a difference and it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> I am going to be 29 in September, have fine lines on my face from smiling (not mad about that!) and from smoking (unhappy about those, but I&#x27;ve quit!). After I use this lotion my skin feels super soft and my scarring from acne is getting better. I have super pale skin so EVERYTHING shows. I love the fresh lemon scent. Normally I am NOT a lemon scent person at all, but this is not overwhelming and leaves just a hint of smelly-good freshness on your face!</li>
            <li> I love Acure products in general, but I especially love this lotion. It&#x27;s great for everyday use, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this product. First of all, it&#x27;s natural, and it&#x27;s a great price. Does that even belong in the same sentence? My face just looks so much more balanced and even toned. It&#x27;s not one of those miracle products though. You see gradual changes. The scent is very light, it feels fantastic. It&#x27;s not drying, or oily. I actually ran out of the product for a few weeks, and really missed it. I will keep buying it for sure! If you are looking for a cheaper alternative to natural, organic skin care, then ACURE is the way to go! I use ACURE facial products, and Miessence cosmetics.</li>
