    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on a mission to save money and the price is excellent compared to the \\&quot;Clinical Strength Secret\\&quot; that I have been using.</li>
            <li>I found Suave Clinical Strength Deoderant to be a wonderful surprise.  </li>
            <li>It worked perfectly and I am a person who has always had a persperation issue.  </li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>The price is great, too!</li>
            <li>This is probably one of the best Deodorants that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>stuff works wonderfully well.</li>
            <li>so if you need something stronger, it&#x27;s best to look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy that I was sent Suave Clinical Protection Antiperspirant along with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>what works best for you</li>
            <li>but this has been the best for me and I am not embarrassed since using it.</li>
            <li>The smell is awesome and it goes on moist...</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the senses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, it is cheaper than others and smells very good  </li>
            <li>I was VERY happy to find that it works just as good as my Dove product...</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is great...</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>On the bright side it is a bit cheaper</li>
            <li>This seems to be a really good product</li>
            <li>and It does a really good job of protecting.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve had some good chances to try out this \\&quot;clinical</li>
            <li>and Does it smell good?</li>
            <li>And the protection against sweat and smell is good.</li>
            <li>It smells good and it works.</li>
            <li>It surprisingly lasted about 20 hours for me.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This is perfect for those hot summer days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That makes me very happy. ;)</li>
            <li>I love the powder smell of this deodorant!</li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice powder smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower and lasts all day and beyond.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice deodorant.  </li>
            <li>and I liked the Baby Powder scent.  </li>
            <li>The most positive thing I can say is that it smelled great.</li>
            <li>Wish it came in a larger size, but it&#x27;s a great product!  </li>
            <li>I like it better than Dove&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I felt confident I had no issues.  </li>
            <li>The Suave brand is much cheaper than its competitor&#x27;s, and it still works great.</li>
            <li>is the one most should consider, and for that, I have to say it does.</li>
            <li>Maybe they have a keen sense of smell but it smelled lovely to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the solid worked perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>but then I find that I have to use more and that it stains my clothing.</li>
            <li>I loved both, but the Suave wins out.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find it in any stores, love knowing its coming each month.</li>
            <li>became more pungent.  </li>
            <li>Pleased to see the price here on Amazon comparable to WalMart&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love  it,  </li>
            <li>(That&#x27;s okay, the box says I can do it in the morning, just not for \\&quot;maximum protection.\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>I got used to it quickly, though, and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>I liked the Powder Fresh smell, and prefer it to the Everlasting Sunshine scent.</li>
            <li>The powder fresh scent is nice and stays on during the day.</li>
            <li>Whenever I&#x27;m able to buy it cheap or free with coupons, I give it away.</li>
            <li>I like how easily it glided on and that even after using this for a couple of weeks I never had to deal with it caking on when applied.  </li>
            <li>However I can easily make it through 12 hours</li>
            <li>And by the way, I don&#x27;t get the people complaining about the strong scent it has.</li>
            <li>The question is, do you need something this strong?</li>
            <li>and I like that this deodorant is strong but not too strong so that it would cause irritation under your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think it would be fine when I&#x27;m not playing volleyball or working up a sweat.</li>
            <li>I love that the deodorant was quickly dissolved under my arm</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty impressive and honestly a little surprising since it is a Suave brand and therefore priced very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product that I would recommend.</li>
            <li>At present, this combination is working for me as underarm wetness and odor has greatly dimished.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Suave for having such great value!</li>
            <li>Very powerful, does the trick.</li>
            <li>The true test will come a few months from now during the 120 degree heat, but as for my trial in mid-90s, I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li>Smells VERY fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been so happy with a deodorant for so long.  </li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li>This new generation of deodorant are cream based, clean and nice to our skin.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this because it&#x27;s much more reasonably priced than comparable products in stores...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and yet not so intense that it haunts you like a shadow.</li>
            <li>The Powder fresh scent smells like baby powder and glides on smooth without leaving marks on your clothes.</li>
            <li>Overall, I have had good results with the Suave brand and their \\&quot;Clinical Protection\\&quot; line of deodorants.</li>
            <li>the humidity is so overwhelming that you will perspire under your arm even if you don&#x27;t sweat much.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that it is strong enough for a man!</li>
            <li>This is a 24 hour, once a day deodorant that offers pretty good protection against wetness and odor, although you may want to apply 2x a day on high-activity days to keep smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for women who live active lifestyles or if you just need a stronger anti-persperant.</li>
            <li>Its not overpowering, but it lingers on in your armpit giving you that fresh clean smell if you&#x27;re sweat is prone to \\&quot;stink\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is also mild and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>However, if one needs more than the typical deodorant without needing serious protection, this is a great happy medium that works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used the Sure Clinical, and it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Suave Clinical Protection Powder Fresh 24 Hour Pro-solid Anti-perspirant/Deodorant is the deodorant we have all been waiting for.</li>
            <li>I received Suave Clinical Protection Powder Fresh 24 Hour</li>
            <li>I am not talking about doing any kind of taxing activities either, just regular day to day stuff, and it was like I wasn&#x27;t wearing any deodorant.</li>
            <li>I do like a powder fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Instructions state that you put it on at night and it is absorbed into your skin and you do not have to reapply it for 24 hours, even after bathing.  </li>
            <li>The powder smell is really overpowering, it&#x27;s a clean smell</li>
            <li>I expected some pretty good protection from a clinical strength product, but this product didn&#x27;t really perform to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scentwise it is nice, and the texture is fine, but the product just did not stop the sweat, not for 8 hours, certainly not 24.</li>
            <li>I like the click top which allows you to put on more or less depending on your needs.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using Suave Clinical Protection Antiperspirant Deodorant Powder Fresh</li>
            <li>It was fine for those who don&#x27;t sweat much when working out, really working out.</li>
            <li>Seems to be much more powerful than a regular stick.</li>
            <li>Suave Clinical Protection is an antiperspirant/deodorant that I&#x27;m happy to continue using, especially if I need an extra boost to fight wetness.</li>
            <li>I actually suspect that since the container and origin are the same that they are the same product, but now with my favorite smell I am as happy as a peach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great value, hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite  form several that I tried with clinical protection.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t love was the scent.  </li>
            <li>When I first put this deodorant on, I wasn&#x27;t too fond of it.</li>
            <li>I was able to use two of their deodorants and they are exactly the same (which is why my reviews are</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve come to like being able to shower the next day and not having to apply deodorant after.</li>
            <li>Throughout the day, I did an underarm check and sure enough, no sweat and no perspiration or odor.</li>
            <li>Even after wearing all of the brands multiple times, she cannot tell you why she thinks one brand works better than the others.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just strong enough for you to know you&#x27;re wearing it, but it&#x27;s not too powerful.</li>
            <li>or Sure&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a little easier to spread and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>With the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; label added in, it&#x27;s not as nice as other clinical strength deodorants--</li>
            <li>No burn, light powder smell (clean but not overpowering), and I stayed dry all day in Carolina humidity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two major requirements I have for being a good antiperspirant: Does it keep me dry?</li>
            <li>SO as I have gotten older I have noticed I don&#x27;t smell very good;[ I used degree or secret and they just were not covering the odor.</li>
            <li>This was pretty much something you want to put on at night.</li>
            <li>It also absorbs into my skin relatively quickly which is a plus since I am nearly always time-starved in the morning but dislike getting deodorant stains on my shirt.  </li>
            <li>Not only did the strong powder scent fade, but I did smell me.  </li>
            <li>I am planning on using this one primarily while every half year taking a break (it&#x27;s good to do once in a while with deodorant because each one tackles different bacteria); then I am right back to it.</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to all my girlfriends!</li>
            <li>when it&#x27;s really a cream.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant goes on smooth with no clumps, lumps or white residue like some deodorants do.</li>
            <li>They have so much energy and in this case, in addition to chasing after them, I put it to the test with yard work, gardening, housekeeping, cooking, walking and doing this in 80-90 degree weather.</li>
            <li>I know sometimes words like \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; are nothing but marketing ploys, but in my experience there really is a difference between the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; deodorants and the clinical strength ones.</li>
            <li>Suave has always been known for creating products comparable in quality to name brand manufacturers, but at much lower price points.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>so I gave this one a try and have been using it for over 6 months and really like it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The real test is summer</li>
            <li>During the colder months, it&#x27;s not a big deal, but with the warm weather suddenly back, it does matter what I use.</li>
            <li>I live in the South, so summers are HOT.</li>
            <li>When I tried it the last time (over a year ago) it was very chalky and clumped up under my arm - even when it was clean shaven.</li>
            <li>If you truly don&#x27;t want wetness for a couple days I highly recommend Certain Dri.</li>
            <li>This particular one has a powder smell and works as effectively as other deodorants except it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>different times during physical activity, I could smell the baby powder scent and that was ok .. obviously better than smelling sweat, but I do not like having wet armpits at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The actual product is soft and moist and applies easily.</li>
            <li>As a regular deodorant, this really packs a worthy punch.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like this Suave antiperspirant is as strong as that one was, but it works much better than the Secret, Degree and Mitchell antiperspirants I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This product performs even better than more expensive brands at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample of the powder fresh clinical protection from BzzzAgent and overall, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Powder Fresh\\&quot; smell is a classic fragrance that doesn&#x27;t try to go too fem or be overbearing.</li>
            <li>It forms some sort of barrier and will stay on the next day even through a shower.&lt;br /&gt;After many nights of forgetting to put it on at bedtime, I finally remembered.  </li>
            <li>if you juice celery during high heat summer/</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s highly fragrant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always found Suave&#x27;s deodorants satisfactory, and this provides smooth, dry, and fresh protection that does indeed last quite awhile without any scents or wetness sneaking in.  </li>
            <li>normally I use Clinical Protection by another company but the cost is extremely high.</li>
            <li>It has a great scent that is not too faint or Overpowering.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer the scent of Everlasting Sunshine over this Powder Fresh, though.</li>
            <li>The powder fresh scent is so light that it is not overwhelming</li>
            <li>Glad I found it on Amazon, now I can get it for even less $$!</li>
            <li>About the same price in stores, maybe a little more but so convenient to order on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I ended up going right back to Dove.&lt;br</li>
            <li>well now there is clinical strength/i&#x27;m all for new technology and stuff</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: I&#x27;m new to \\&quot;clinical</li>
            <li>live in South Florida and</li>
            <li>I use this product all of the time and it works just as good as other Clinical strength deodorants for less money.  </li>
            <li>used this Suave Clinical Protection on several different days when I knew I was going to be more active and expected to sweat more.</li>
            <li>With 24 hour protection it guarantees you will feel and smell fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Until recently I had some shirts that caused me to sweat and showed it, so I would avoid wearing them except for short events in cool weather.</li>
            <li>they can tone down the fragrance a bit, I would probably go for this one over Dove since there&#x27;s a significant difference in price.</li>
            <li>but on certain days, depending on my activities, I do like to use a Clinical Strength just for extra protection and reassurance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t clear after applying, so you might want to try another deodorant if you&#x27;re going sleeveless.  </li>
            <li>I really could not tell a difference between the two, especially considering the price difference.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really like the fact that there is no white powdery residue.</li>
            <li>TEST 1 - Being around a seven and 5 year old</li>
            <li>One thing I was concerned about was an allergic reaction because I tend to be sensitive.</li>
            <li>I am entering my early 50&#x27;s and going through perimenopause and began to notice my body odor changing.  </li>
            <li>After having used Dove Clinical Protection - Cool Essentials for years, I tried out this one simply because I have always had a strange addiction to the smell of baby powder.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you let the product dry on your armpits or apply just enough needed, because it will leave white marks on your clothing if not allowed enough time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I checked out the ingredients, since they are both made by the same company, EXACT SAME INGREDIENTS as the Dove, even the exact same packaging, just a different label.</li>
            <li>it is a cream with 2 clicks and not a hard solid  </li>
            <li>If there is a slight difference, it is worth the affordability of the Suave, for me.  </li>
            <li>product works by moving the dial and the product slowly comes up through tiny holes on top as you turn the knob on the bottom.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and will definitely be using this again because a little goes a long way and works even longer than the 24 hours.</li>
            <li>others mention, this is not a solid, but rather a cream, but if you love baby powder smells, this deodorant will do the job for you as long as you properly let it dry before putting on your favorite shirt (apply a thin layer and it will dry up in about 2-3 minutes).</li>
            <li>It goes on white but dries clear.</li>
            <li>i do apply it now  after a shower during the day/and find i am not wet anymore...</li>
            <li>Back to trusty old Degree</li>
            <li>MUCH better than any Secret products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Either way I like them both, however, I like Secret&#x27;s just a tad bit better.  </li>
            <li>As I stated, I like Secret better</li>
            <li>MUCH better than Secret, Dove or Certain-Dry.</li>
            <li>Usually by morning, especially if the room is warm, I&#x27;m sweating again with a little bit of odor.  </li>
            <li>no dry flaky deodorant.</li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t have to use very much, just a few clicks.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on a mission to save money and the price is excellent compared to the \\&quot;Clinical Strength Secret\\&quot; that I have been using.</li>
            <li> I found Suave Clinical Strength Deoderant to be a wonderful surprise.  </li>
            <li> It worked perfectly and I am a person who has always had a persperation issue.  </li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> The price is great, too!</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best Deodorants that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> stuff works wonderfully well.</li>
            <li> so if you need something stronger, it&#x27;s best to look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy that I was sent Suave Clinical Protection Antiperspirant along with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> what works best for you</li>
            <li> but this has been the best for me and I am not embarrassed since using it.</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome and it goes on moist...</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the senses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , it is cheaper than others and smells very good  </li>
            <li> I was VERY happy to find that it works just as good as my Dove product...</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is great...</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> On the bright side it is a bit cheaper</li>
            <li> This seems to be a really good product</li>
            <li> and It does a really good job of protecting.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve had some good chances to try out this \\&quot;clinical</li>
            <li> and Does it smell good?</li>
            <li> And the protection against sweat and smell is good.</li>
            <li> It smells good and it works.</li>
            <li> It surprisingly lasted about 20 hours for me.  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for those hot summer days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That makes me very happy. ;)</li>
            <li> I love the powder smell of this deodorant!</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice powder smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower and lasts all day and beyond.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice deodorant.  </li>
            <li> and I liked the Baby Powder scent.  </li>
            <li> The most positive thing I can say is that it smelled great.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in a larger size, but it&#x27;s a great product!  </li>
            <li> I like it better than Dove&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I felt confident I had no issues.  </li>
            <li> The Suave brand is much cheaper than its competitor&#x27;s, and it still works great.</li>
            <li> is the one most should consider, and for that, I have to say it does.</li>
            <li> Maybe they have a keen sense of smell but it smelled lovely to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the solid worked perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> but then I find that I have to use more and that it stains my clothing.</li>
            <li> I loved both, but the Suave wins out.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it in any stores, love knowing its coming each month.</li>
            <li> became more pungent.  </li>
            <li> Pleased to see the price here on Amazon comparable to WalMart&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love  it,  </li>
            <li> (That&#x27;s okay, the box says I can do it in the morning, just not for \\&quot;maximum protection.\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> I got used to it quickly, though, and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> I liked the Powder Fresh smell, and prefer it to the Everlasting Sunshine scent.</li>
            <li> The powder fresh scent is nice and stays on during the day.</li>
            <li> Whenever I&#x27;m able to buy it cheap or free with coupons, I give it away.</li>
            <li> I like how easily it glided on and that even after using this for a couple of weeks I never had to deal with it caking on when applied.  </li>
            <li> However I can easily make it through 12 hours</li>
            <li> And by the way, I don&#x27;t get the people complaining about the strong scent it has.</li>
            <li> The question is, do you need something this strong?</li>
            <li> and I like that this deodorant is strong but not too strong so that it would cause irritation under your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think it would be fine when I&#x27;m not playing volleyball or working up a sweat.</li>
            <li> I love that the deodorant was quickly dissolved under my arm</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty impressive and honestly a little surprising since it is a Suave brand and therefore priced very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> At present, this combination is working for me as underarm wetness and odor has greatly dimished.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Suave for having such great value!</li>
            <li> Very powerful, does the trick.</li>
            <li> The true test will come a few months from now during the 120 degree heat, but as for my trial in mid-90s, I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> Smells VERY fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so happy with a deodorant for so long.  </li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> This new generation of deodorant are cream based, clean and nice to our skin.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this because it&#x27;s much more reasonably priced than comparable products in stores...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing and yet not so intense that it haunts you like a shadow.</li>
            <li> The Powder fresh scent smells like baby powder and glides on smooth without leaving marks on your clothes.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have had good results with the Suave brand and their \\&quot;Clinical Protection\\&quot; line of deodorants.</li>
            <li> the humidity is so overwhelming that you will perspire under your arm even if you don&#x27;t sweat much.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that it is strong enough for a man!</li>
            <li> This is a 24 hour, once a day deodorant that offers pretty good protection against wetness and odor, although you may want to apply 2x a day on high-activity days to keep smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for women who live active lifestyles or if you just need a stronger anti-persperant.</li>
            <li> Its not overpowering, but it lingers on in your armpit giving you that fresh clean smell if you&#x27;re sweat is prone to \\&quot;stink\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is also mild and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> However, if one needs more than the typical deodorant without needing serious protection, this is a great happy medium that works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used the Sure Clinical, and it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Suave Clinical Protection Powder Fresh 24 Hour Pro-solid Anti-perspirant/Deodorant is the deodorant we have all been waiting for.</li>
            <li> I received Suave Clinical Protection Powder Fresh 24 Hour</li>
            <li> I am not talking about doing any kind of taxing activities either, just regular day to day stuff, and it was like I wasn&#x27;t wearing any deodorant.</li>
            <li> I do like a powder fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Instructions state that you put it on at night and it is absorbed into your skin and you do not have to reapply it for 24 hours, even after bathing.  </li>
            <li> The powder smell is really overpowering, it&#x27;s a clean smell</li>
            <li> I expected some pretty good protection from a clinical strength product, but this product didn&#x27;t really perform to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scentwise it is nice, and the texture is fine, but the product just did not stop the sweat, not for 8 hours, certainly not 24.</li>
            <li> I like the click top which allows you to put on more or less depending on your needs.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using Suave Clinical Protection Antiperspirant Deodorant Powder Fresh</li>
            <li> It was fine for those who don&#x27;t sweat much when working out, really working out.</li>
            <li> Seems to be much more powerful than a regular stick.</li>
            <li> Suave Clinical Protection is an antiperspirant/deodorant that I&#x27;m happy to continue using, especially if I need an extra boost to fight wetness.</li>
            <li> I actually suspect that since the container and origin are the same that they are the same product, but now with my favorite smell I am as happy as a peach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great value, hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite  form several that I tried with clinical protection.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t love was the scent.  </li>
            <li> When I first put this deodorant on, I wasn&#x27;t too fond of it.</li>
            <li> I was able to use two of their deodorants and they are exactly the same (which is why my reviews are</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve come to like being able to shower the next day and not having to apply deodorant after.</li>
            <li> Throughout the day, I did an underarm check and sure enough, no sweat and no perspiration or odor.</li>
            <li> Even after wearing all of the brands multiple times, she cannot tell you why she thinks one brand works better than the others.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just strong enough for you to know you&#x27;re wearing it, but it&#x27;s not too powerful.</li>
            <li> or Sure&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a little easier to spread and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> With the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; label added in, it&#x27;s not as nice as other clinical strength deodorants--</li>
            <li> No burn, light powder smell (clean but not overpowering), and I stayed dry all day in Carolina humidity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two major requirements I have for being a good antiperspirant: Does it keep me dry?</li>
            <li> SO as I have gotten older I have noticed I don&#x27;t smell very good;[ I used degree or secret and they just were not covering the odor.</li>
            <li> This was pretty much something you want to put on at night.</li>
            <li> It also absorbs into my skin relatively quickly which is a plus since I am nearly always time-starved in the morning but dislike getting deodorant stains on my shirt.  </li>
            <li> Not only did the strong powder scent fade, but I did smell me.  </li>
            <li> I am planning on using this one primarily while every half year taking a break (it&#x27;s good to do once in a while with deodorant because each one tackles different bacteria); then I am right back to it.</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to all my girlfriends!</li>
            <li> when it&#x27;s really a cream.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant goes on smooth with no clumps, lumps or white residue like some deodorants do.</li>
            <li> They have so much energy and in this case, in addition to chasing after them, I put it to the test with yard work, gardening, housekeeping, cooking, walking and doing this in 80-90 degree weather.</li>
            <li> I know sometimes words like \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; are nothing but marketing ploys, but in my experience there really is a difference between the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; deodorants and the clinical strength ones.</li>
            <li> Suave has always been known for creating products comparable in quality to name brand manufacturers, but at much lower price points.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> so I gave this one a try and have been using it for over 6 months and really like it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The real test is summer</li>
            <li> During the colder months, it&#x27;s not a big deal, but with the warm weather suddenly back, it does matter what I use.</li>
            <li> I live in the South, so summers are HOT.</li>
            <li> When I tried it the last time (over a year ago) it was very chalky and clumped up under my arm - even when it was clean shaven.</li>
            <li> If you truly don&#x27;t want wetness for a couple days I highly recommend Certain Dri.</li>
            <li> This particular one has a powder smell and works as effectively as other deodorants except it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> different times during physical activity, I could smell the baby powder scent and that was ok .. obviously better than smelling sweat, but I do not like having wet armpits at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The actual product is soft and moist and applies easily.</li>
            <li> As a regular deodorant, this really packs a worthy punch.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this Suave antiperspirant is as strong as that one was, but it works much better than the Secret, Degree and Mitchell antiperspirants I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This product performs even better than more expensive brands at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of the powder fresh clinical protection from BzzzAgent and overall, I really like it.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Powder Fresh\\&quot; smell is a classic fragrance that doesn&#x27;t try to go too fem or be overbearing.</li>
            <li> It forms some sort of barrier and will stay on the next day even through a shower.&lt;br /&gt;After many nights of forgetting to put it on at bedtime, I finally remembered.  </li>
            <li> if you juice celery during high heat summer/</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s highly fragrant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always found Suave&#x27;s deodorants satisfactory, and this provides smooth, dry, and fresh protection that does indeed last quite awhile without any scents or wetness sneaking in.  </li>
            <li> normally I use Clinical Protection by another company but the cost is extremely high.</li>
            <li> It has a great scent that is not too faint or Overpowering.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the scent of Everlasting Sunshine over this Powder Fresh, though.</li>
            <li> The powder fresh scent is so light that it is not overwhelming</li>
            <li> Glad I found it on Amazon, now I can get it for even less $$!</li>
            <li> About the same price in stores, maybe a little more but so convenient to order on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I ended up going right back to Dove.&lt;br</li>
            <li> well now there is clinical strength/i&#x27;m all for new technology and stuff</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: I&#x27;m new to \\&quot;clinical</li>
            <li> live in South Florida and</li>
            <li> I use this product all of the time and it works just as good as other Clinical strength deodorants for less money.  </li>
            <li> used this Suave Clinical Protection on several different days when I knew I was going to be more active and expected to sweat more.</li>
            <li> With 24 hour protection it guarantees you will feel and smell fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Until recently I had some shirts that caused me to sweat and showed it, so I would avoid wearing them except for short events in cool weather.</li>
            <li> they can tone down the fragrance a bit, I would probably go for this one over Dove since there&#x27;s a significant difference in price.</li>
            <li> but on certain days, depending on my activities, I do like to use a Clinical Strength just for extra protection and reassurance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t clear after applying, so you might want to try another deodorant if you&#x27;re going sleeveless.  </li>
            <li> I really could not tell a difference between the two, especially considering the price difference.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really like the fact that there is no white powdery residue.</li>
            <li> TEST 1 - Being around a seven and 5 year old</li>
            <li> One thing I was concerned about was an allergic reaction because I tend to be sensitive.</li>
            <li> I am entering my early 50&#x27;s and going through perimenopause and began to notice my body odor changing.  </li>
            <li> After having used Dove Clinical Protection - Cool Essentials for years, I tried out this one simply because I have always had a strange addiction to the smell of baby powder.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you let the product dry on your armpits or apply just enough needed, because it will leave white marks on your clothing if not allowed enough time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I checked out the ingredients, since they are both made by the same company, EXACT SAME INGREDIENTS as the Dove, even the exact same packaging, just a different label.</li>
            <li> it is a cream with 2 clicks and not a hard solid  </li>
            <li> If there is a slight difference, it is worth the affordability of the Suave, for me.  </li>
            <li> product works by moving the dial and the product slowly comes up through tiny holes on top as you turn the knob on the bottom.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and will definitely be using this again because a little goes a long way and works even longer than the 24 hours.</li>
            <li> others mention, this is not a solid, but rather a cream, but if you love baby powder smells, this deodorant will do the job for you as long as you properly let it dry before putting on your favorite shirt (apply a thin layer and it will dry up in about 2-3 minutes).</li>
            <li> It goes on white but dries clear.</li>
            <li> i do apply it now  after a shower during the day/and find i am not wet anymore...</li>
            <li> Back to trusty old Degree</li>
            <li> MUCH better than any Secret products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Either way I like them both, however, I like Secret&#x27;s just a tad bit better.  </li>
            <li> As I stated, I like Secret better</li>
            <li> MUCH better than Secret, Dove or Certain-Dry.</li>
            <li> Usually by morning, especially if the room is warm, I&#x27;m sweating again with a little bit of odor.  </li>
            <li> no dry flaky deodorant.</li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t have to use very much, just a few clicks.</li>
            <li> This is the only clinical strength product I&#x27;ve used that has provided the protection I need to stay dry.</li>
            <li> Only thing that keeps me totally dry.</li>
            <li> the 2 different Suave Clinical deodorants tried, she preferred the powder fresh scent over the everlasting sunshine scent (which was deemed, \\&quot;yuck\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:  if you need a clinical deodorant, go with Degree or Secret.</li>
            <li> Even if you go sleeveless, I don&#x27;t expect too many people are going to catch a whiff of anything other than the faint illusion of freshness.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out why \\&quot;Suave\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t work as well when the two have the same amount of the same active ingredient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She has now tried 4 different clinical deodorants and, despite the fact that they all contain the same active ingredient - Aluminum Zicronium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY 20% , she has declared that 2 brands are heroes &amp; 2 brands are</li>
            <li> but i did it  as they said and by the 3rd day of using the product  i noticed that i was no longer getting wet underarms....</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried Suave clinical in the past, hoping to save money over the Dove brand that I normally buy.</li>
            <li> I tried Secret Clinical which was on sale, and it burned upon application on freshly shaved pits.</li>
            <li> The Suave brand is significantly less expensive than the other brands that I have used and actually works even better.</li>
            <li> A little over a year ago, my teenage daughter insisted that she had to use a clinical deodorant because the \\&quot;other\\&quot; deodorants did not work sufficiently &amp; allowed her to perspire even when just doing basic school stuff</li>
            <li> Gone are those semi-solid deodorant that breaks off all over the place or the liquid that we apply on our skin and have to wait for it to dry.  </li>
            <li> I really like Secret&#x27;s asian pear one if that comes in clinical strength, I am sold.</li>
            <li> I have always been a Secret anti-perspirant user and for my first time in a long time trying another brand</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Now I stay dry all day!</li>
            <li> The latter is of a less importance, but even if it was #1</li>
            <li> typically just use a regular deodorant (Ban)</li>
            <li> If you prefer that, this is the one for you, I personally since I don&#x27;t wear a lot of perfume, like a little scent.</li>
            <li> Buying with Amazon subscribe and save will save me a little bit in comparison to my local grocery store as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have spent a lifetime not buying non-natural fabric clothing because I knew I would ruin them after one wearing.  </li>
            <li> because since this clinical strength stuff came on market i have been wet..  </li>
            <li> I used to perspire until my shirt&#x27;s armpits were wet.</li>
            <li> It feels a bit wet when it goes on.</li>
            <li> I only used it for a few weeks and it was a permanent fix.</li>
            <li> I can compare it to every other &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength antiperspirant that&#x27;s in the grocery stores...same result.</li>
            <li> The other scent was everlasting sunshine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the kiddies go home, I go to the gym every other day.</li>
            <li> This works as well if not better than the bigger name clinical strength deodorants.</li>
            <li> a try  and chose Suave because I have used other Sauve products</li>
            <li> It goes on very wet, and takes a few minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> The summers are brutal where I live, so this deodorant really does the trick especially for working out.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the applicator; the holes are large and somewhat scratchy to my underarms, and it&#x27;s somewhat difficult to apply evenly.  </li>
            <li> but on an average spring day in Texas, I can almost make it 24 hours with one nightly application.  </li>
            <li> Something about lying down sleeping prevents you from sweating out of your underarms giving this product the ability to get into your sweat pores.</li>
            <li> but     does that mean they changed the formula for the regular cheaper stuff?  </li>
            <li> I had been using the Dove Clinical Strength, and noticed this on the shelf for much less</li>
            <li> And just so you know, I typically don&#x27;t like Suave deodorant...</li>
            <li> It works just as well and costs less.</li>
            <li> Although it seems to have the same active ingredients (Aluminum Zicronium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY 20%) as the Secret Clinical strength antiperspirant it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well for me.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> I rarely ever perspire and after using this product I was shocked and embarrassed.</li>
            <li> never buying this again, gonna go back to secret or degree.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The losers:  </li>
            <li> I wore a black shirt with this deodorant, and no streaks!</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Clinical USUALLY works.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work as well as what I usually use.</li>
            <li> It works just as well that way, if not better.  </li>
            <li> and I tried Secret and one other that I can&#x27;t remember</li>
            <li> I hate this deodorant,  after only a short time out you have underarm smell.....</li>
            <li> Works as well as secret or dove but for half the price.</li>
            <li> your body hardly feels the heat  at all</li>
            <li> Also for us girls that shave our underarms, it does not leave a film where it is hard to shave over either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and not in the least embarrassed to use it.</li>
            <li> At least I won&#x27;t have to change up my routine.  </li>
            <li> with the worst, tightest-in-the-underarm shirt and on hot days, I don&#x27;t smell in the slightest!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that Secret does this too:  they call their clinical strength deodorant \\&quot;solid\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The deodorant I was using (Secret Outlast) was not working well for me anymore.</li>
            <li> winners: Degree Clinical &amp; Secret Clinical&lt;</li>
            <li> She continued to feel that Degree &amp; Secret kept her drier.  </li>
            <li> I am sad....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I bought 4 of these</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that is still the case.</li>
            <li> I am not happy that it has changed packaging, pricing and availability!!!!</li>
            <li> It is a weird feeling to get out of the shower and not apply deodorant though.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s outrageous they can charge almost $10 for less than 2 ounces of a product.</li>
            <li> So sad, I don&#x27;t want to stink!</li>
            <li> I HATE spending the money that I have been spending on \\&quot;Secret\\&quot;</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Purchased this because it&#x27;s much more reasonably priced than comparable products in stores... normally I use Clinical Protection by another company but the cost is extremely high. Wish it came in a larger size, but it&#x27;s a great product!  Gladys</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on a mission to save money and the price is excellent compared to the \\&quot;Clinical Strength Secret\\&quot; that I have been using. I can&#x27;t figure out why \\&quot;Suave\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t work as well when the two have the same amount of the same active ingredient. On two seperate occasions I smelled and was sweaty and gross after using the \\&quot;Sauve\\&quot;. It was embarrassing! I think it would be fine when I&#x27;m not playing volleyball or working up a sweat. Until then I will stick to \\&quot;Secret\\&quot;. I am sad....I HATE spending the money that I have been spending on \\&quot;Secret\\&quot; but it works. DARN!</li>
            <li> I found Suave Clinical Strength Deoderant to be a wonderful surprise.  It worked perfectly and I am a person who has always had a persperation issue.  I have spent a lifetime not buying non-natural fabric clothing because I knew I would ruin them after one wearing.  This prodsuaveuct ended that problem AND it&#x27;s inexpensive!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of Secret Clinical, and was amazed at how well it worked.  My life had improved.  But then I saw the price for it in the store, and thought I&#x27;d give Suave a try.  I really could not tell a difference between the two, especially considering the price difference.  If there is a slight difference, it is worth the affordability of the Suave, for me.  I&#x27;ve also used the Sure Clinical, and it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> well now there is clinical strength/i&#x27;m all for new technology and stuff but     does that mean they changed the formula for the regular cheaper stuff?  because since this clinical strength stuff came on market i have been wet..  it says apply at night/which was not what i wanted to do ...but i did it  as they said and by the 3rd day of using the product  i noticed that i was no longer getting wet underarms....i do apply it now  after a shower during the day/and find i am not wet anymore...so maybe you have  to get it into your system/hope to god there are no after effects...  so i like it, it is cheaper than others and smells very good  it is a cream with 2 clicks and not a hard solid  it cost me about 5.00+ at walmart for 1  so this is agood deal subscribe and save  just for note here:  if you juice celery during high heat summer/your body hardly feels the heat  at all..thought i would post this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite  form several that I tried with clinical protection.  The summers are brutal where I live, so this deodorant really does the trick especially for working out.  I like it better than Dove&#x27;s or Sure&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a little easier to spread and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> As described! Love this product!</li>
            <li> This is the only clinical strength product I&#x27;ve used that has provided the protection I need to stay dry.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. I had been using the Dove Clinical Strength, and noticed this on the shelf for much less&gt; I checked out the ingredients, since they are both made by the same company, EXACT SAME INGREDIENTS as the Dove, even the exact same packaging, just a different label. It works well, I don&#x27;t use it at night, I use it every morning. Glad I found it on Amazon, now I can get it for even less $$!</li>
            <li> I use this product all of the time and it works just as good as other Clinical strength deodorants for less money.  The price on Amazon is great...the cost of this deal is the price I pay for 2 in the store</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Has a nice powder smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower and lasts all day and beyond.  MUCH better than any Secret products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dove Clinical Strength for about 2 years and was looking for a cheaper alternative. I tried Secret Clinical which was on sale, and it burned upon application on freshly shaved pits. I looked at ingredients and it has alcohol which caused the burn. Suave does not have alcohol and was $3 cheaper than Dove so I picked up a stick. I love it. No burn, light powder smell (clean but not overpowering), and I stayed dry all day in Carolina humidity. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product performs even better than more expensive brands at a fraction of the cost. Great value, hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this cause it was on sale at my local store.... I hate this deodorant,  after only a short time out you have underarm smell..... never buying this again, gonna go back to secret or degree.</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to my expectations.  I thought it would help me with my perspiration issue but it didn&#x27;t reduce the amount I was perspiring.  I did not expect to have to wear it at night in order for the product to work.  I can compare it to every other &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength antiperspirant that&#x27;s in the grocery stores...same result.</li>
            <li> Every time I go to WalMart for this it is sold out. Never need to run out again when buying in bulk! The price is great, too!</li>
            <li> It was fine for those who don&#x27;t sweat much when working out, really working out.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever perspire and after using this product I was shocked and embarrassed. It was only 90 degrees outside and after 15 minutes I was perspiring under my arms. Unfortunately I bought 4 of these so now I am stuck with them. I am going to go back to using Dove Clinical protection since that has always worked for me. I will have to save the Suave for just winter time when the weather is cooler.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of the powder fresh clinical protection from BzzzAgent and overall, I really like it.  Since having kids, it seemed all my deodorants stopped working (hormones?) and I had to start trying different brands.  This one works well, held up thru a workout (and all day at a swim meet!) and I felt confident I had no issues.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t love was the scent.  It was basically, NO SCENT. If you prefer that, this is the one for you, I personally since I don&#x27;t wear a lot of perfume, like a little scent. I really like Secret&#x27;s asian pear one if that comes in clinical strength, I am sold.</li>
            <li> Works really well I used to perspire until my shirt&#x27;s armpits were wet. Now I stay dry all day!</li>
            <li> This seems to be a really good product and It does a really good job of protecting. This is probably one of the best Deodorants that I&#x27;ve ever used. I would definitely recommend getting this I know it&#x27;s a little pricey but it is definitely worth it. It has a great scent that is not too faint or Overpowering. Overall a great product that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> When I first put this deodorant on, I wasn&#x27;t too fond of it. It goes on very wet, and takes a few minutes to dry. I got used to it quickly, though, and fell in love with it! It smells wonderful! It&#x27;s just strong enough for you to know you&#x27;re wearing it, but it&#x27;s not too powerful. I actually prefer the scent of Everlasting Sunshine over this Powder Fresh, though. I live in the South, so summers are HOT. This is perfect for those hot summer days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any issues with white streaks or staining yet. I wore a black shirt with this deodorant, and no streaks! That makes me very happy. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus is the price! The Suave brand is much cheaper than its competitor&#x27;s, and it still works great. And just so you know, I typically don&#x27;t like Suave deodorant...at all! Whenever I&#x27;m able to buy it cheap or free with coupons, I give it away. I DO like this Suave deodorant, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like where the development of deodorants are heading.  Gone are those semi-solid deodorant that breaks off all over the place or the liquid that we apply on our skin and have to wait for it to dry.  This new generation of deodorant are cream based, clean and nice to our skin.  This particular one has a powder smell and works as effectively as other deodorants except it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> Phoenix has already been heating up to near-record highs so I&#x27;ve had some good chances to try out this \\&quot;clinical protection\\&quot; antiperspirant from Suave. So far, I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two major requirements I have for being a good antiperspirant: Does it keep me dry? and Does it smell good? The latter is of a less importance, but even if it was #1 I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d complain about the scent. The \\&quot;Powder Fresh\\&quot; smell is a classic fragrance that doesn&#x27;t try to go too fem or be overbearing. I&#x27;m a guy and not in the least embarrassed to use it. It&#x27;s refreshing and yet not so intense that it haunts you like a shadow. Even if you go sleeveless, I don&#x27;t expect too many people are going to catch a whiff of anything other than the faint illusion of freshness. That&#x27;s what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the big question of Does it Work? is the one most should consider, and for that, I have to say it does. The true test will come a few months from now during the 120 degree heat, but as for my trial in mid-90s, I&#x27;m very impressed. Very powerful, does the trick. Lasts a long time. No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I&#x27;m new to \\&quot;clinical protection\\&quot; antiperspirants but I have to say I like it. Seems to be much more powerful than a regular stick. You also don&#x27;t have to use very much, just a few clicks. I know this product is probably \\&quot;made for a woman\\&quot; but as a guy, I hope my trial also holds some merit in the review. I can honestly say that it is strong enough for a man!</li>
            <li> Suave Clinical Protection Powder Fresh 24 Hour Pro-solid Anti-perspirant/Deodorant is the deodorant we have all been waiting for. With 24 hour protection it guarantees you will feel and smell fresh all day long. It&#x27;s perfect for women who live active lifestyles or if you just need a stronger anti-persperant. The Powder fresh scent smells like baby powder and glides on smooth without leaving marks on your clothes. I would highly recommend this to all my girlfriends!</li>
            <li> I tried Suave clinical in the past, hoping to save money over the Dove brand that I normally buy. I ended up going right back to Dove.&lt;br /&gt;The stuff works wonderfully well. Even if you forget to put it on one day, you won&#x27;t start decorating the air waves immediately.&lt;br /&gt;My former gripe was that the perfume was overpowering. Unfortunately, that is still the case. I felt my allergies kick up as soon as I applied it to my underarm.&lt;br /&gt;The improvement was in the texture. When I tried it the last time (over a year ago) it was very chalky and clumped up under my arm - even when it was clean shaven. It eliminated this as a possibility for me during summer months. Did NOT want visible clumps of deodorant there.&lt;br /&gt;It also used to leave white marks on my clothes. It still does that if you accidentally swipe your underarm while pulling your shirt over your head.&lt;br /&gt;If they can tone down the fragrance a bit, I would probably go for this one over Dove since there&#x27;s a significant difference in price. For now, Dove rules.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with this deodorant. While it did have odor control, it still allowed wetness and I do not even sweat heavily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically just use a regular deodorant (Ban) but on certain days, depending on my activities, I do like to use a Clinical Strength just for extra protection and reassurance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this Suave Clinical Protection on several different days when I knew I was going to be more active and expected to sweat more. Each time I used it, I had the same experience. I did not have body odor, but I did have wetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At different times during physical activity, I could smell the baby powder scent and that was ok .. obviously better than smelling sweat, but I do not like having wet armpits at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, there was no irritation after shaving. It doesn&#x27;t burn like some do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this and I would not recommend it, especially since it is marketed as Clinical and does not even protect against \\&quot;regular\\&quot; sweating.</li>
            <li> I love the powder smell of this deodorant! Its not overpowering, but it lingers on in your armpit giving you that fresh clean smell if you&#x27;re sweat is prone to \\&quot;stink\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works by moving the dial and the product slowly comes up through tiny holes on top as you turn the knob on the bottom. The actual product is soft and moist and applies easily. Make sure you let the product dry on your armpits or apply just enough needed, because it will leave white marks on your clothing if not allowed enough time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others mention, this is not a solid, but rather a cream, but if you love baby powder smells, this deodorant will do the job for you as long as you properly let it dry before putting on your favorite shirt (apply a thin layer and it will dry up in about 2-3 minutes).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that Secret does this too:  they call their clinical strength deodorant \\&quot;solid\\&quot; when it&#x27;s really a cream.  Either way I like them both, however, I like Secret&#x27;s just a tad bit better.  I was able to use two of their deodorants and they are exactly the same (which is why my reviews are the same).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use deodorant in areas of my body where chafing occurs.  Regular deodorant doesn&#x27;t cut it sometimes.  Clinical USUALLY works.  As I stated, I like Secret better but this comes in at a close second.</li>
            <li> This is a nice deodorant.  I like the click top which allows you to put on more or less depending on your needs.  The smell is pleasant, not overpowering.  And the protection against sweat and smell is good.</li>
            <li> I have always been a Secret anti-perspirant user and for my first time in a long time trying another brand I was pretty impressed.  I like how easily it glided on and that even after using this for a couple of weeks I never had to deal with it caking on when applied.  It also absorbs into my skin relatively quickly which is a plus since I am nearly always time-starved in the morning but dislike getting deodorant stains on my shirt.  The scent is also mild and not overpowering.  The only thing I disagree with is that this lasts 24-hours.  Not for me.  Usually by morning, especially if the room is warm, I&#x27;m sweating again with a little bit of odor.  However I can easily make it through 12 hours just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a solid anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> Works as well as secret or dove but for half the price. I think it&#x27;s outrageous they can charge almost $10 for less than 2 ounces of a product. Thanks Suave for having such great value!</li>
            <li> This deodorant goes on smooth with no clumps, lumps or white residue like some deodorants do. It has a very pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the senses.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased that its protection lasted all day and didn&#x27;t leave me that uncomfortable sticky feeling either.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way this deodorant feels on me and I really like the fact that there is no white powdery residue.</li>
            <li> This is the second Suave clinical deodorant I&#x27;ve tried. The other scent was everlasting sunshine. I like both scents. This scent is the milder of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s applied at bedtime instead of in the morning. It&#x27;s taken me a while to get used to using deodorant this way. You turn the dial for 2 to 3 clicks and a white cream rises out of holes in the dispenser. It goes on white but dries clear. It feels a bit wet when it goes on. But I&#x27;ve come to like being able to shower the next day and not having to apply deodorant after. I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting white residue on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 STARS: It smells good and it works.</li>
            <li> I received Suave Clinical Protection Powder Fresh 24 Hour Prosolid Anti-perspirant/Deodorant from the Vine program and couldn&#x27;t wait to test it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. TEST 1 - Being around a seven and 5 year old all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have my grandson and daughter every day while their parents work and they tire me out! They have so much energy and in this case, in addition to chasing after them, I put it to the test with yard work, gardening, housekeeping, cooking, walking and doing this in 80-90 degree weather. Throughout the day, I did an underarm check and sure enough, no sweat and no perspiration or odor. And by the way, I don&#x27;t get the people complaining about the strong scent it has. Maybe they have a keen sense of smell but it smelled lovely to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B. TEST 2 - The Gym&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the kiddies go home, I go to the gym every other day. After a rigorous workot, no sweat, no perspiration, no odor under the arms. Everywhere else however, soaked! I wonder if they could make this in a body spray. Hmmmmm...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL RESULT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the solid worked perfectly for me. One thing I was concerned about was an allergic reaction because I tend to be sensitive. Thankfully though I didn&#x27;t have any problem with this anti-perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would deffinitely buy this product again because it worked so well. So, there you have it. Tested and approved!</li>
            <li> As a regular deodorant, this really packs a worthy punch.  I&#x27;ve always found Suave&#x27;s deodorants satisfactory, and this provides smooth, dry, and fresh protection that does indeed last quite awhile without any scents or wetness sneaking in.  With the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; label added in, it&#x27;s not as nice as other clinical strength deodorants--so if you need something stronger, it&#x27;s best to look elsewhere.  However, if one needs more than the typical deodorant without needing serious protection, this is a great happy medium that works.</li>
            <li> I know sometimes words like \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; are nothing but marketing ploys, but in my experience there really is a difference between the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; deodorants and the clinical strength ones. During the colder months, it&#x27;s not a big deal, but with the warm weather suddenly back, it does matter what I use. Suave has always been known for creating products comparable in quality to name brand manufacturers, but at much lower price points. This is no exception. If there is any difference in the effectiveness of this vs pricier versions, I didn&#x27;t notice, and the price is definitely sweeter.</li>
            <li> I expected some pretty good protection from a clinical strength product, but this product didn&#x27;t really perform to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scentwise it is nice, and the texture is fine, but the product just did not stop the sweat, not for 8 hours, certainly not 24. I am not talking about doing any kind of taxing activities either, just regular day to day stuff, and it was like I wasn&#x27;t wearing any deodorant. Back to trusty old Degree I go.</li>
            <li> Well I had to give this one a shot. The most positive thing I can say is that it smelled great. I do like a powder fresh scent. This was pretty much something you want to put on at night. Something about lying down sleeping prevents you from sweating out of your underarms giving this product the ability to get into your sweat pores. This didn&#x27;t work as well as what I usually use. If you truly don&#x27;t want wetness for a couple days I highly recommend Certain Dri. Works like a champ.</li>
            <li> Although it seems to have the same active ingredients (Aluminum Zicronium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY 20%) as the Secret Clinical strength antiperspirant it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well for me. On the bright side it is a bit cheaper but then I find that I have to use more and that it stains my clothing.</li>
            <li> I am very happy that I was sent Suave Clinical Protection Antiperspirant along with [[ASIN:B008VT05JS Dove Clinical Protection Antiperspirant/Deodorant]] to try. I loved both, but the Suave wins out. It works just as well and costs less. Suave Clinical Protection has now become my antiperspirant of choice. Buying with Amazon subscribe and save will save me a little bit in comparison to my local grocery store as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until recently I had some shirts that caused me to sweat and showed it, so I would avoid wearing them except for short events in cool weather. With the Clinical Protection antiperspirant I do not sweat at all. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with skin irritation or deodorant marks showing up on my shirts.</li>
            <li> This is the Only deodorant that works for me! Can&#x27;t find it in any stores, love knowing its coming each month.</li>
            <li> Only thing that keeps me totally dry. Works wonders!!! MUCH better than Secret, Dove or Certain-Dry. Smells VERY fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This works as well if not better than the bigger name clinical strength deodorants. About the same price in stores, maybe a little more but so convenient to order on Amazon! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am entering my early 50&#x27;s and going through perimenopause and began to notice my body odor changing.  The deodorant I was using (Secret Outlast) was not working well for me anymore. I had a lot of wetness and it seemed like as the day wore on the scent became more pungent.  I decided to give the clincial strength deodorants a try  and chose Suave because I have used other Sauve products and I liked the Baby Powder scent.  I used it as directed, applying at night, and following up with regular Sauve anti-prespirant in the morning.  At present, this combination is working for me as underarm wetness and odor has greatly dimished.  Pleased to see the price here on Amazon comparable to WalMart&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> SO as I have gotten older I have noticed I don&#x27;t smell very good;[ I used degree or secret and they just were not covering the odor. So sad, I don&#x27;t want to stink! So they started coming out with these clinical Protection deodorants and I tried Secret and one other that I can&#x27;t remember and they were just like regular deodorants so I gave this one a try and have been using it for over 6 months and really like it. It&#x27;s almost always about your body type and what works best for you but this has been the best for me and I am not embarrassed since using it.</li>
            <li> I love  it,  I have been using it for over 50years and nothing compares. I am not happy that it has changed packaging, pricing and availability!!!!</li>
            <li> This deodorant works. The question is, do you need something this strong? The powder smell is really overpowering, it&#x27;s a clean smell but it&#x27;s highly fragrant.</li>
            <li> After having used Dove Clinical Protection - Cool Essentials for years, I tried out this one simply because I have always had a strange addiction to the smell of baby powder.  I was VERY happy to find that it works just as good as my Dove product... I actually suspect that since the container and origin are the same that they are the same product, but now with my favorite smell I am as happy as a peach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the worst, tightest-in-the-underarm shirt and on hot days, I don&#x27;t smell in the slightest! The smell is awesome and it goes on moist... no dry flaky deodorant. I am planning on using this one primarily while every half year taking a break (it&#x27;s good to do once in a while with deodorant because each one tackles different bacteria); then I am right back to it. I&#x27;ve never been so happy with a deodorant for so long.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> A little over a year ago, my teenage daughter insisted that she had to use a clinical deodorant because the \\&quot;other\\&quot; deodorants did not work sufficiently &amp; allowed her to perspire even when just doing basic school stuff (class change, lunch chat, etc).  She had been using Ban [[ASIN:B000GCE99U Unscented Invisible Solid Antiperspirant Deodorant by Ban, 2.6 Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has now tried 4 different clinical deodorants and, despite the fact that they all contain the same active ingredient - Aluminum Zicronium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY 20% , she has declared that 2 brands are heroes &amp; 2 brands are zeros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The losers:  Suave Clinical &amp; Dove Clinical&lt;br /&gt;The winners: Degree Clinical &amp; Secret Clinical&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?  Even after wearing all of the brands multiple times, she cannot tell you why she thinks one brand works better than the others.  We looked at ingredients, application, and activity level.  There was no rhyme or reason.  She continued to feel that Degree &amp; Secret kept her drier.  Her verdict was that her results with the Suave &amp; Dove brand were the same as her results with Ban (Aluminum Zicronium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY 19%).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the 2 different Suave Clinical deodorants tried, she preferred the powder fresh scent over the everlasting sunshine scent (which was deemed, \\&quot;yuck\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:  if you need a clinical deodorant, go with Degree or Secret.</li>
            <li> The labeling on the package states that I need to apply Suave Clinical Protection at bedtime for maximum protection.  It forms some sort of barrier and will stay on the next day even through a shower.&lt;br /&gt;After many nights of forgetting to put it on at bedtime, I finally remembered.  (That&#x27;s okay, the box says I can do it in the morning, just not for \\&quot;maximum protection.\\&quot;) I kept my fingers crossed that it would work well after my shower, as promised.  That was faith, because I was going to work that morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it work?  Let&#x27;s just say if this is maximum protection, let me go back to using it in the morning.  It works just as well that way, if not better.  At least I won&#x27;t have to change up my routine.  Not only did the strong powder scent fade, but I did smell me.  Just hoping not everyone else could also smell me.</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant deodorant worked well. It has the scent of baby powder. Overall, I have had good results with the Suave brand and their \\&quot;Clinical Protection\\&quot; line of deodorants. I would recommend them all.</li>
            <li> Instructions state that you put it on at night and it is absorbed into your skin and you do not have to reapply it for 24 hours, even after bathing.  It surprisingly lasted about 20 hours for me.  It is a weird feeling to get out of the shower and not apply deodorant though.  Also for us girls that shave our underarms, it does not leave a film where it is hard to shave over either.  The real test is summer and I will update my review when I get to that point, but on an average spring day in Texas, I can almost make it 24 hours with one nightly application.  That&#x27;s pretty impressive and honestly a little surprising since it is a Suave brand and therefore priced very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Suave Clinical Protection Antiperspirant Deodorant Powder Fresh and I was not disappointed with the results. The Suave brand is significantly less expensive than the other brands that I have used and actually works even better. I love that the deodorant was quickly dissolved under my arm and I didn&#x27;t have any white marks or white streaks under my arm or on my clothing. The Suave Antiperspirant lasted all day and if you happened to miss a day you will still be covered and I like that this deodorant is strong but not too strong so that it would cause irritation under your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in South Florida and the humidity is so overwhelming that you will perspire under your arm even if you don&#x27;t sweat much. The powder fresh scent is so light that it is not overwhelming but just enough so that you know it&#x27;s there protecting you. I love this brand and will definitely be using this again because a little goes a long way and works even longer than the 24 hours.</li>
            <li> This is a 24 hour, once a day deodorant that offers pretty good protection against wetness and odor, although you may want to apply 2x a day on high-activity days to keep smelling fresh.  I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the applicator; the holes are large and somewhat scratchy to my underarms, and it&#x27;s somewhat difficult to apply evenly.  It isn&#x27;t clear after applying, so you might want to try another deodorant if you&#x27;re going sleeveless.  I liked the Powder Fresh smell, and prefer it to the Everlasting Sunshine scent.</li>
            <li> At one time I used a prescription strength antiperspirant called Maxim. I only used it for a few weeks and it was a permanent fix. I don&#x27;t feel like this Suave antiperspirant is as strong as that one was, but it works much better than the Secret, Degree and Mitchell antiperspirants I&#x27;ve tried. The bonus it has over Maxim, is that it is also a deodorant. The powder fresh scent is nice and stays on during the day. Suave Clinical Protection is an antiperspirant/deodorant that I&#x27;m happy to continue using, especially if I need an extra boost to fight wetness.</li>
