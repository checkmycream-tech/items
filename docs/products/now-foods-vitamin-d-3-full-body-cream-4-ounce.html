            <li>Completely satisfied and price is great!</li>
            <li>Pleasant citrus scent.</li>
            <li>It is more evenly colored (I am very fair, a red-head complexion) and creamy looking.  </li>
            <li>This is a good concentration too (1000IU per pump) because the 5000-10000 IU creams can make some people break out.  </li>
            <li>Good product I recommend.</li>
            <li>Am pleased!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just how psoriasis is, but I am SO glad to have relief for now!</li>
            <li>It also smells nice (citrus-y).</li>
            <li>This cream is wonderful, great for eczema, especially!  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find this.</li>
            <li>It is easy on sensitive skin and wonderfully emollient and the scent is subtly refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it helps my psoriasis a lot.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>He enjoys being able to use a lotion that he knows will not cause more break-outs.  </li>
            <li>but I have noticed my skin looks better since I started using this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love it, no smell, non greasy, asorbs</li>
            <li>I love the citrus aroma.</li>
            <li>its so lightly scented :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Smells good but didn&#x27;t see much of a difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is surprising from a NOW product, as they are usually very comprehensive.</li>
            <li>This Vitamin D-3 cream worked great for my daughter&#x27;s very dry skin and it smells nice too.</li>
            <li>I find the orange scent too strong for my purpose, and as a guy, don&#x27;t appreciate the fruity smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non scented and would be a great moisturizer in general.  </li>
            <li>but I think it is helping her get rid of some fine lines.</li>
            <li>The cream also has a consistency that is smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>It smells good and is absorbed by my skin really fast.</li>
            <li>Its a very moisturizing cream with a very light orange scent.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>try many cream before but this one is real eczema cream.</li>
            <li>I may change this rating to 5 stars when I get my blood tests back, but for now I give it 4 stars because it smells delicious, mixes well with my lotions, and helped my back pain within 2 days.  </li>
            <li>I just read that squalene, which is in this product, is super for reversing skin damage also.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Health fit labs of IL did a great job fast service with regular shipping and sent samples of other creams too :)</li>
            <li>Excellent moisturizing cream for anyone who has dry,cracked bleeding cuts that just don&#x27;t seem to respond to other dry skin creams.</li>
            <li>I really hope that giving this product 5 stars isn&#x27;t going to jinx the amazing improvement I&#x27;ve seen with my psoriasis since I started using it last week.</li>
            <li>Some other reviewers have remarked on the strong scent, but it disappears quickly and honestly, at first I was concerned with the strong citrus-smell</li>
            <li>It arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m using it as a supplement to treat a skin condition that affects a fairly large area of my body.</li>
            <li>This cream is very soothing and healing.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>not greasy and fast absorb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the Vit D3 creams really do elevate blood levels of Vit D3 over time.  </li>
            <li>Nothing&#x27;s really worked, and</li>
            <li>After 7 months of use- Still- no more more flakes between my eyebrows!</li>
            <li>When I read the ingredients, I thought this cream would smell bad, but I&#x27;m happy to find that it has a light, citrus smell.</li>
            <li>I mix my own moisturizer and it was hard to find a Vit. D cream that did not also have Vit.</li>
            <li>and I have spent a lifetime searching for a facial moisturizer that is completely non-irritating, non-greasy, effective and not-too-expensive.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t itch, they aren&#x27;t bleeding, and I&#x27;m actually getting decent sleep for the first time in ages.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well it helps me as far as my vitamin D levels, but this is a bargain-priced product that I truly like.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh citrus smell, and it&#x27;s the ONLY THING we&#x27;ve tried that actually keeps our skin feeling like lovely skin thru the cold dry weather.</li>
            <li>After my standard bath in Epsom Salts, during which I scrub the scales with a loofah to loosen them, I got out and rubbed this stuff on, then followed it with my normal moisturizing</li>
            <li>That means normal, non-red, regular looking skin.</li>
            <li>I have such sensitive skin</li>
            <li>, hey, when you wake up several times a night itching -- and have to peel your body parts from the bed because they&#x27;re stuck there by dried blood -- you&#x27;re willing to try anything.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It arrived very fast. I love this stuff, it helps my psoriasis a lot.</li>
            <li> Smells good but didn&#x27;t see much of a difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this for keratosis pilaris.  A type of eczema that causes bumps all over my arms and is also called chicken skin.  This is the only thing I have found that actually works.  I use it in conjunction with Emu Oil and it&#x27;s working wonders.  It&#x27;s non scented and would be a great moisturizer in general.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This cream is very soothing and healing. It also smells nice (citrus-y).</li>
            <li> It is easy on sensitive skin and wonderfully emollient and the scent is subtly refreshing.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin D-3 cream worked great for my daughter&#x27;s very dry skin and it smells nice too. I would definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful, great for eczema, especially!  Arrived on time and great condition!  Am pleased!</li>
            <li> I have a problem trying to locate this product at the local health food stores . I have found it on Amazon. ( GO SEAHAWKS )</li>
            <li> It helps to soothe, but it is not the end all to prevent.  One cream cannot handle the varieties of eczema out there.</li>
            <li> After 7 months of use- Still- no more more flakes between my eyebrows! BEST lotion EVER for us! It is THICK. almost pasty. you don&#x27;t need much. I actually added a little more vitamin E to ours, just to thin it out a bit. Love the fresh citrus smell, and it&#x27;s the ONLY THING we&#x27;ve tried that actually keeps our skin feeling like lovely skin thru the cold dry weather. NO FLAKES. yay! Might just put one of these in everyone&#x27;s stocking this yr!</li>
            <li> This is the third tube of this lotion I have purchased now.  I have such sensitive skin and I have spent a lifetime searching for a facial moisturizer that is completely non-irritating, non-greasy, effective and not-too-expensive.  This is it!  My son also uses it on his acne-prone skin.  He enjoys being able to use a lotion that he knows will not cause more break-outs.  Some other reviewers have remarked on the strong scent, but it disappears quickly and honestly, at first I was concerned with the strong citrus-smell but since I now know it goes away it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  I have not heard others expound upon the virtues of Vitamin D for your skin but I have noticed my skin looks better since I started using this lotion.  It is more evenly colored (I am very fair, a red-head complexion) and creamy looking.  I do not use face makeup and sometimes my daughter will ask if I&#x27;ve recently done a facial when I have not. I credit this lotion.</li>
            <li> my eczema was gone in three days. try many cream before but this one is real eczema cream. my skin texture get improved too. not greasy and fast absorb.</li>
            <li> I may change this rating to 5 stars when I get my blood tests back, but for now I give it 4 stars because it smells delicious, mixes well with my lotions, and helped my back pain within 2 days.  I&#x27;m now using it in place of Vit D3 pill or gummy supplements which just seem to do a job on my digestive tract. WIll check back in a month with an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to update this back in 2015. I&#x27;m buying this again in 2016.  I&#x27;ve found the Vit D3 creams really do elevate blood levels of Vit D3 over time.  This is a good concentration too (1000IU per pump) because the 5000-10000 IU creams can make some people break out.  Definitely give it a try. I just read that squalene, which is in this product, is super for reversing skin damage also.</li>
            <li> Love it, no smell, non greasy, asorbs well and then skin feels like velvet.</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion! Goes on thick but does not take long to dry and isn&#x27;t tacky like other lotions. It&#x27;s my go to lotion for extremely dry skin!</li>
            <li> The ingredients in the product are great. However, I&#x27;m using it as a supplement to treat a skin condition that affects a fairly large area of my body. I find the orange scent too strong for my purpose, and as a guy, don&#x27;t appreciate the fruity smell. Neither the online description or label of the product indicate that it is scented. This is surprising from a NOW product, as they are usually very comprehensive.</li>
            <li> When I read the ingredients, I thought this cream would smell bad, but I&#x27;m happy to find that it has a light, citrus smell. The cream also has a consistency that is smooth and creamy. I don&#x27;t know how well it helps me as far as my vitamin D levels, but this is a bargain-priced product that I truly like.</li>
            <li> I mix my own moisturizer and it was hard to find a Vit. D cream that did not also have Vit. A &amp; Vit. E.  I keep the Vit. A out of my basic cream and add it separately for nighttime.  I was thrilled to find this.</li>
            <li> I really hope that giving this product 5 stars isn&#x27;t going to jinx the amazing improvement I&#x27;ve seen with my psoriasis since I started using it last week. I&#x27;d read that Vitamin D creams could provide some relief, since they slow the rapid cellular turnover that&#x27;s associated with psoriasis. Prior to this, I&#x27;d tried everything: Hydrocortisone 1% and 2% creams, a Betamethasone cream prescribed by my doctor, and [[ASIN:B000NRWTZE MG217 Medicated Tar Ointment, Psoriasis Treatment, Intensive Strength, 3.8 oz.]]. Nothing&#x27;s really worked, and I&#x27;d just assumed that I&#x27;d have to live with red, painful, scaly patches on my elbows, knees, ears and in two spots on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, hey, when you wake up several times a night itching -- and have to peel your body parts from the bed because they&#x27;re stuck there by dried blood -- you&#x27;re willing to try anything. So I decided to try this. After my standard bath in Epsom Salts, during which I scrub the scales with a loofah to loosen them, I got out and rubbed this stuff on, then followed it with my normal moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day (well, Night) 1: No itching. None whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day: my patches weren&#x27;t nearly as angry red, and I didn&#x27;t have those telltale silvery flakes of dried skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 4: I started to see clearing in the midst of my psoriasis patches. CLEARING! That means normal, non-red, regular looking skin. I never thought I&#x27;d see that again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on Day 7, and my patches are less than 1/2 the size they were previously. They don&#x27;t itch, they aren&#x27;t bleeding, and I&#x27;m actually getting decent sleep for the first time in ages. (And, man, I have a LOT of sleep to catch up on!) My ears? They&#x27;re perfect again. I can wear my hair back! Even the spots on my scalp where I rub this stuff in before bedtime -- and wash it away the next day -- are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, I may have to switch protocols again at some point. That&#x27;s just how psoriasis is, but I am SO glad to have relief for now!</li>
            <li> I have had itchy, bumpy skin on my arms for quite awhile. This cream has cured the problem! Plus it smells great.</li>
            <li> Good product I recommend. My wife has psoriasis and this product is recommend to help dry up the flaky sores.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend with psoriasis and it has made it almost unnoticeable. Completely satisfied and price is great!</li>
            <li> Love it smells great, I can even see some results  on my face it feels flawless no makeup.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to hopefully supplement my vita d3 since supplements irritate my stomach.  Its a very moisturizing cream with a very light orange scent.  I have allergies so its great its so lightly scented :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish Id of gotten the two pack now! Next time I will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Health fit labs of IL did a great job fast service with regular shipping and sent samples of other creams too :)</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizing cream for anyone who has dry,cracked bleeding cuts that just don&#x27;t seem to respond to other dry skin creams. I would def. recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I am using it daily. I love the citrus aroma.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend. She said it is too soon to post results but I think it is helping her get rid of some fine lines.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Pleasant citrus scent.</li>
            <li> The citrus fragrance isn&#x27;t bad, but it can be sort of annoying when used daily.  Otherwise, I have not complaints.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cream  full of Vitamin D - 3 which is very good for you.  It smells good and is absorbed by my skin really fast.</li>
            <li> A bit to thick of a cream for my liking, but when I use, it keeps my soft &amp; not dry</li>
    </ol>
