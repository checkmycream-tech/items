            <li>/&gt;It cleans teeth surprisingly well (better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>but it was not a bad taste at all.</li>
            <li>Taste is ok very natural like baking soda really wholesome, most importantly free of noxious chemicals</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey paying shipping on toothpaste, but haven&#x27;t located a local outlet.</li>

            <li> Tube keeps its shape until last bit of toothpaste is gone, which is a long, long time.  </li>

            <li> It only has a slight flavor which tastes like a tab of sugar.  </li>

            <li> Taste is ok very natural like baking soda really wholesome, most importantly free of noxious chemicals</li>
            <li> This seems to be a fine toothpaste that I can use because I have an allergy to Nickel.</li>
            <li> The only toothpaste I use. Love it!</li>
            <li> The Cleure toothpastes, are pretty good, for people needing products without salicylate.  I just have to get use to not having the minty taste in my mouth, after brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t leave flavor in your mouth, then this is the one you should get.  I have sensitive teeth and this toothpaste is great because it doesn&#x27;t have ingredients like other toothpastes do that are bad for your teeth.  It is fluoride-free !  It only has a slight flavor which tastes like a tab of sugar.  So it isn&#x27;t bad tasting.  I am definitely going to continue using this toothpaste from now on.</li>
            <li> this is the only thing I&#x27;ve been able to use besides baking soda. Not the best flavor,  but way better than baking soda.</li>
            <li> I found another brand I prefer to this one.  I tried several after my brand was discontinued.  I do not think they publish other brands if you list them.</li>
            <li> My husband and I think this tastes fine.  It cleans our teeth and with out all the chemicals.  We just have to keep it out of the dogs reach, which is what we already have to do with things like garlic and onion.  No big deal.</li>
            <li> Lately, I have developed a strong distaste for flavored toothpaste - my mouth tastes on fire using mint or cinnamon flavors.  Tried oodles of brands.  This Cleure works very well; perhaps a little baking soda taste, but usable. It has &amp;#34;sls&amp;#34; but I don&#x27;t care now.  Kind of pricey paying shipping on toothpaste, but haven&#x27;t located a local outlet.</li>
            <li> my kids love it - they do not like the taste of mint toothpaste</li>
            <li> I have sensitivity to any mint products. It is very hard to find any toothpaste that does not include mint flavoring. I originally purchased two tubes and have since went back and order extra. This is a great product. The paste does not taste great but it does not have a strong baking soda taste either. And it does foam as you are brushing. I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t handle mint so was happy to find this.  Tube keeps its shape until last bit of toothpaste is gone, which is a long, long time.  For carry-on plane travel I squeeze out some into a small container.</li>
            <li> Causes my throat to burn when I use it.  The entire reason I bought this toothpaste is because I am sensitive to chemicals, so it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Will not be purchasing this product again. My gums started bleeding in spots.</li>
            <li> Expensive, and sometimes out of stock. I bought this since I&#x27;m intolerant to fluoride,  peppermint, and psyllium. I can&#x27;t afford to repurchase it. However, I&#x27;m hoping it will help take away my peppermint intolerance. However, I&#x27;m also intolerant too baking soda, and xylitol too.  I&#x27;m okay with xanthan gum, but, who really wants too digest that?!  I can never win! This is however, the most sensitive, food intolerant, toothpaste,  on the market however. It&#x27;s also the safest, if you have no allergy or intolerance to any of it&#x27;s ingredients.</li>
            <li> A+ for taste, consistency, and safety! Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> Excellent product good for dysgusia and burning tounge</li>
            <li> Tried to use it in place of Plain brand, but it created mouth sores.</li>
            <li> It is SO hard to find an unflavored toothpaste with no fluoride. I was so happy to find this. It takes a little getting used to having a toothpaste with no flavor but it was not a bad taste at all. My mouth is very sensitive to mint, fluoride and sulfates so this toothpaste is a miracle worker for me. I received it so quickly as well and was glad for that.</li>
            <li> I love love love love love this toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Very little taste (Wife is allergic to mint)&lt;br /&gt;It cleans teeth surprisingly well (better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Holy freaking cow!  It&#x27;s about $14 with shipping.  That&#x27;s way expensive!&lt;br /&gt;Is there any way to buy this in bulk at a lower cost?</li>
            <li> Very good natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> didnt enjoy it like i thought i would. may be me and not the product.</li>
            <li> I can no longer use toothpaste with mint and this was the 1st I found without mint. It is flavorless; It does not however, have anything to help with sensitive teeth and for that reason I will not buy it again. I found one that has no mint and does help sensitive teeth. It is Squigle Tooth Builder for Sensitive Teeth and I love that one.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a flavorless tooth paste for a very long time and I have finally found it. This tooth paste tastes very slightly like vanilla but that taste goes away after a couple brushed.</li>
