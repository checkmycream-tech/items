            <li>Amazing stuff and affordably priced.</li>
            <li>received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li>I liked the ease of use and performance of these strips.</li>
            <li>I received this pack of strips for expressing my honest opinions.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price n fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Does provide an effective whitening to peroxide-based whitestrips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad I had a chance to try these, I really loved the strips.</li>
            <li>I got these with instructions and a shade guide to see what kind of an improvement I could do.</li>
            <li>Purchased these because of the great reviews but after trying them and *then* realizing that there is NO info about the company anywhere online or on the packaging, I got super paranoid that these were like, off-brand cancer death strips or something.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than crest brand and very good results.</li>
            <li>Never considered whitening my teeth, and I was happy with the brightness of my smile.</li>
            <li>Looks like a good budget friendly whitening product.</li>
            <li>I have consistent results and I am happy with the strips.</li>
            <li>I liked these strips, they are easy to apply and they work.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I am sure that I would have seen better results had I given up coffee, but even with drinking coffee</li>
            <li>They do the trick and keep my teeth flawless until the next treatment is needed!</li>
            <li>But the strips have removed most of those stains.</li>
            <li>I think things will look much better at the end of week 2.</li>
            <li>If this review helped, please click &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li>I must get more of these, I did quit smoking and soda but coffee will forever stay in my life.</li>
            <li>and they are not bulky - allowing me to be able to speak with strips on.</li>
            <li>I have used many whitening strips over the years.</li>
            <li>Better than the named</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>initially bought this because of the excellent reviews.</li>
            <li>Well, if you count the price factor, these are better.</li>
            <li>I really love these strips.</li>
            <li>The pics (taken after I&#x27;d removed the strip and wiped away most of the goop) don&#x27;t even do the damage justice.</li>
            <li>However, despite the enamel safe claim, they still do.</li>
            <li>I will have a really bright smile in all the pictures for many years to show.</li>
            <li>What’s even better is that the whitening lasts.</li>
            <li>I was able keep them on for 30 minutes with no problems.</li>
            <li>My smile was gorgeous</li>
            <li>and I love showing it off</li>
            <li>I am glad I gave this a chance.</li>
            <li>Compared to crest strips, these stick on much better.</li>
            <li>I think this is a better way to whiten compared to the bleaching gels.</li>
            <li>and I think its safe to say this is a winner.</li>
            <li>I am sure at the end of the 14 day run, things will look much better.</li>
            <li>And may be even a bit better.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research beforehand and bought it to know for sure.</li>
            <li>This whitening product was provided merely as a free sample to give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to use the strips right after brushing, it won&#x27;t stick good.</li>
            <li>This is a new europen brand, they are cost effective and a good alternative to the famous brands.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this product, the value for money is great.</li>
            <li>Great so far!</li>
            <li>I would rather spend more for a brand that leaves my teeth feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Also, no teeth or gum sensitivity which I sometimes experienced when using the higher-end Crest strips... AND the mystery-ish whitening goo has not killed me.</li>
            <li>Also, no teeth or gum sensitivity which I sometimes experienced when using the higher-end Crest strips... AND the mystery-ish whitening goo has not killed me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to deal with.</li>
            <li>were easy to remove and came off in one piece.</li>
            <li>The strips were really easy to apply and were easily stored in my bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything came just as described and this is an easy to use product.</li>
            <li>I can easily recommend this brand of strips to anyone who is looking.</li>
            <li>my friends have noticed, and i can easily tell in the mirror and in pics.</li>
            <li>They are easy to peel and apply.</li>
            <li>I guess the chemical is not that strong.</li>
            <li>The whitening isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li>The strips stay on my teeth just fine.</li>
            <li>I liked the improvement I see, and now these are my new favorite strips.</li>
            <li>Very stretchy and fit nicely over teeth.  </li>
            <li>When those didn&#x27;t work, I bought the Crest Advanced ($50).</li>
            <li>2 weeks later my smile is still nice and bright.</li>
            <li>used my two week supply and started to notice light stains fading after four days</li>
            <li>I liked the lumeeno teeth whitening strips, they really work.</li>
            <li>Cant believe they are so cheap.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used a lot of teeth whitening products in my life, as a coffee and wine lover, it&#x27;s important....</li>
            <li>but I would much much much rather pay for a safer treatment and effective treament.</li>
            <li>Supplies is extremely cheap, no instructions, takes a lot of effort to get the gel on the brush if you haven&#x27;t burned your gums after meticulously trying to prevent it.</li>
            <li>experience has been good thus far.</li>
            <li>but I honestly don&#x27;t understand how this product is so highly rated.</li>
            <li>Easy to use overall, I have nothing but good things to say, honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited to give them a shot.  </li>
            <li>my teeth still have improved significantly.  </li>
            <li>Just to be on the safe side, I ended my first session as 15 minutes</li>
            <li>I was able to get results just after the first two uses.</li>
            <li>What I love most is that its not messy, easy and quick to apply, and it doesn&#x27;t damage the enamel.</li>
            <li>I decided the first step was to get my teeth nice and pretty.</li>
            <li>I saw a handful of reviews and they all were positive for the most part.</li>
            <li>I am getting ready for a very important event for my life and teeth whitening was on my list of things to do.</li>
            <li>There are many other similiar but  superior produdcts on the market for  </li>
            <li>I also want to mention if you have an event or special occasion</li>
            <li>Effective in whitening my teeth and easy to work with but caused significantly more gum sensitivity than any other brand of strips I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Good experience overall.</li>
            <li>This deterred me from using them the full 2 weeks, so I cannot speak to the quality of whiteness.</li>
            <li>I was given an opportunity to try these strips for my true assessment of the product based on my experience.</li>
            <li>I can tell that they are almost as good as crest and one third of the cost.</li>
            <li>Based on my experience, there is no bad after taste.</li>
            <li>no mess nice and convenient.</li>
            <li>Get pretty gooey, and curl-up easily when being removed from wrapper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am smiling bigger and feeling more confident.</li>
            <li>I needed to increase the whiteness in my teeth and purchased this whitening system because of the quick use.</li>
            <li>and already I see tremendous results.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t believe how quick these work.</li>
            <li>and I am really impressed with these especially given the low price.</li>
            <li>They were nice, not cheap but effective.</li>
            <li>I noticed an improvement at the very first use.  </li>
            <li>I am one who has been trying to find a good whitening product for a very long time!</li>
            <li>These worked great, little tought to keep on, but you&#x27;ll come up with a system, and there is plenty of  tips from others in this thread.</li>
            <li>Having  a hard time with the bottoms strip, is slips up, will not stick as good as the top</li>
            <li>But I will say this; for the price of this product, it is worth a shot.</li>
            <li>and if I have a wider smile than that, what should I do??</li>
            <li>but it’s gonna be so worth it.</li>
            <li>The strips stick to your teeth nicely, the discomfort caused by wearing them is minimal but the overall effect is not as good as I wanted.</li>
            <li>I decided I needed to start fresh with white(r) teeth but didn’t know how.</li>
            <li>Fun experience.</li>
            <li>I drink everything out of a straw now, and my smile is whiter brighter</li>
            <li>These are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend wearing the strips more than 30 minutes every day, or your teeth will get sensitive.</li>
            <li>The strips are very easy to apply there is no messy gel I have to apply, all I have to do is make sure my teeth are dry and clean.</li>
            <li>these strips however, actually really brighten up your smile!</li>
            <li>I know all the reviews are super positive, but after this I would not say it&#x27;s worth the risk.</li>
            <li>most whitening products make a barely noticeable impact.</li>
            <li>and I started my first application of the strips right away.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>I was leaving the comfort of home and starting out in the real world on my own.</li>
            <li>I found these and ordered them, shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>Right after use, you will have a much whiter smile.</li>
            <li>The Lumeeno strips are probably right up there with the Crest Advanced Seal as far as adherence goes, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are a little bit stretchy, which is perfect, so I can make them fit over all of my front teeth and there arent any missing spots.</li>
            <li>;) 👍</li>
            <li>I like that Lumeeno&#x27;s teeth whitening product is in strip form, making it possible to limit the product to touching my teeth, and</li>
            <li>As a wine lower, I have found that over the years my teeth get pretty stained.</li>
            <li>The first set of whitening strips I ever used were the Crest originals (first one created by Crest)</li>
            <li>These are comparable to the ones that cost more than double.</li>
            <li>I think this 14 pack will last me more than 2 months.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any issues for the first 12 days</li>
            <li>and I plan on using more later.</li>
            <li>Yeah, crest is more expensive and perhaps not quite as effective, but it never gave me chemical burns!</li>
            <li>Top strips are OK but bottom ones are too small to cover your teeth.</li>
            <li>I started them on a Sunday since I had exactly two weeks</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how detailed the instructions were yet</li>
            <li>By the end of the first week I was two shades lighter by day 14</li>
            <li>I have used many different type of whitening systems over the years.</li>
            <li>:) I saw results after the first or second use.</li>
            <li>Sorry for the grossness of pictures 1 and 2, but you have to see them too understand how awesome picture 3 is.  </li>
            <li>These strips claim to have 6% hydrogen peroxide - most over-the-counter products range from five to ten percent hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>This is my first whitening product experience, and I had never used anything like this.</li>
            <li>I could see a bit of whitening after my first use.</li>
            <li>I recommend these whitening strips to anyone who wants to get a brighter smile.</li>
            <li>and you want a white smile quick, try this!</li>
            <li>I am 30, don&#x27;t have terribly yellow teeth, but some staining from coffee, and I can tell you that from the first use you notice your teeth will be much brighter and a shade or more lighter.</li>
            <li>More convenient than the mouth trays, don&#x27;t seem to be as effective as Crest White Strips, but half the price.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of teeth whiteners and nothing seem to really work.</li>
            <li>Read the reviews, followed the instructions, basic peel and stick except these don&#x27;t really stick- when you try and press them on your teeth to make sure they are on like they should be they move around</li>
            <li>So far, they did not make my teeth any more sensitive.</li>
            <li>I think my teeth were really stained when i first started, I wish I made a comparison with the color chart.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply, and you only need to leave them on for 15- 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before applying the strips be sure to rise your mouth with water and then use a napkin to dry your teeth well.</li>
            <li>Like others have mentioned, make sure to dry your teeth before placement.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use and results are almost instant.</li>
            <li>For the past few year, I have been loyally paying a lot for the famous crest brand, and the results have been good.</li>
            <li>I have whitened my teeth before by using mouth trays that I needed to fill with gel to whitening my teeth before, and while they worked well, the gel really burned my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will really help the strips to stick on your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much so I had to write this review.</li>
            <li>Those did not to much of anything at all.</li>
            <li>much cheaper than the brand names.</li>
            <li>The stripes to stick to your teeth very well.</li>
            <li>It is really slippery once you put it on.</li>
            <li>you dont really see a lot of difference rightt away.</li>
            <li>My whole life</li>
            <li>These work well and are reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>it really helped my teeth look whiter.  </li>
            <li>This is a real money saver.</li>
            <li>My teeth are really whiter than before</li>
            <li>Thanks will buy again.</li>
            <li>I have gone through the whole 14 packs in 2 weeks and my teeth have never been whiter.  </li>
            <li>Gets very gloppy on the fingers and in the mouth.  </li>
            <li>It might work if you don&#x27;t bleach very often.</li>
            <li>Plus it delivers quality results for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, there isn&#x27;t much to lose with this product.</li>
            <li>I am not done with the whole set of 14</li>
            <li>My husband even noticed how much whiter my teeth are and asked me to order them for him.  </li>
            <li>Because what makes a crappy whitening strip crappy is when the whitener/adhesive isn&#x27;t very adherent..</li>
            <li>And the caveat is that I don&#x27;t want to spend too much money.</li>
            <li>It gets easier as you keep applying these strips and they don&#x27;t cause that much sensitivity, well not in my case.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different whiteners over the years, from professional grade to top of the line OTC to this one on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I followed other people&#x27;s advice and waited 30mins after brushing and flossing my teeth; be sure to wipe your teeth dry before application, but it&#x27;s pretty easy setting the strips on.</li>
            <li>I was starting to be very self conscience and had adopted a mona lisa smile!</li>
            <li>My teeth were pretty white to start with, but if I ever want them whitened again, I&#x27;ll prob just pay the extra money to have a dentist do it safely.</li>
            <li>You place one strip on the top and the other on your bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>First, let me just say that I am a coffee addict and my smile was starting to show it!</li>
            <li>I have tried several products and Lumeeno is the one for me, It is easy convenient and not messy.</li>
            <li>Better than other more expensive strips...buying more</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t stick as well or work as well as White Strips, but not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>I love these because they are half the price and NONE OF THE PAIN.</li>
            <li>Noticed a change in my teeth after 2 uses but the white fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>Results were decent.</li>
            <li>I really wish the strips were longer as it only covered the front teeth that show when you smile.</li>
            <li>I went 3 shades lighter just after 4 days that is better than some of the more expensive kits.</li>
            <li>The whitening efficacy is about the same as most products, but these  do not adhere as well ; especially  the lower strips.</li>
            <li>As a user of the more expensive brand name strips, these did not apply as nicely, and there was a lot more gel gunk to deal with, but at the end of the day my teeth are just as white as using other brands.</li>
            <li>Then I noticed my teeth were discolored must be from all those tea and energy drinks I consumed to survive high school.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but I still rather have white crooked teeth than yellow and crooked teeth lol.</li>
            <li>Clearly there was a patch of hydrogen peroxide much stronger than 6% on this strip, and it freaking gave me chemical burns.</li>
            <li>These didn&#x27;t stay on my teeth very well, invested in the Professional Whitestrips.</li>
            <li>I normally wouldn&#x27;t expect a miracle from an over the counter teeth whitening product but these strips met my expectations.</li>
            <li>After only one week my smile was 4 shades lighter, I used the chart included with the strips to determine this.</li>
            <li>Most other whiteners were probably too strong and burned my gums, but this one only has a slight tingle and worked much faster!</li>
            <li>I will be doing another period of whitening with a new batch of these soon.</li>
            <li>I wanted to start college of feeling new and refreshed</li>
            <li>I got a new clothes and new shoes.</li>
            <li>and I assumed it was new since I hadn&#x27;t seen it before.</li>
            <li>And I always look for new teeth whitening products.</li>
            <li>I tried crest whitening strips, however they made my teeth very sensitive.</li>
            <li>but wow! I&#x27;ve only used it just once before I was floored at how well and fast this works!</li>
            <li>I have pretty white teeth to begin with because of that on the shade chart</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t stick to my teeth nearly as well as Crest Whitestrips!</li>
            <li>My teeth got very white after my first 6 sessions</li>
            <li>I would much prefer (even though the back teeth may rarely show) to have all my teeth be white instead of just the front ones.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The sensitivity began with the application of the first set of strips causing me to wait several days between each application to allow for healing time.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are already pretty white (shade 3, according to the BONUS TOOTH SHADE CHART THAT IS INCLUDED)</li>
            <li>My teeth are already pretty white (shade 3, according to the BONUS TOOTH SHADE CHART THAT IS INCLUDED)</li>
            <li>When done and remove them from the teeth, there is a residual &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; of gel left on your teeth (comparing to Crest strips which peel off clean) but its no big deal...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really have high expectations since it was priced so low -</li>
            <li>When you put them on, they really just stick nicely and no more slipping.</li>
            <li>The only positive side to this product is that it did not make my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>(they make my teeth sensitive), and things had been going pretty well, but after less than 5 minutes of wearing them tonight, I realized I had a pretty severe pain on my lower gums.</li>
            <li>only a little more money.</li>
            <li>I have not even been using it for a week and after even the second use i have seen a very noticeable change in my teeth and friends and family</li>
            <li>not my sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are actually working really well.</li>
            <li>My teeth are sensitive but these strips did not cause me any irritation.</li>
            <li>This has whitened my teeth by 3 shades so far.</li>
            <li>Also, I had no issues with my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>but so far I am on day 5, I used them 5 times and people started to see a definitive whitening already.</li>
            <li>I think they worked well so far.</li>
            <li>Ihad really let my teeth go,  drinking a ton of iced tea and sodas while smoking daily.  </li>
            <li>I used 5 pairs so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 8 so far</li>
            <li>Since I’m starting fresh with taking proper care of my body, cleansing dieting and exercising</li>
            <li>So after the 14 days, I used the chart to evaluate how much my smile had been whitened overall, an my total was 11 shades!</li>
            <li>These white strips definitely do the job and are a great price, but be prepared to get a little messy.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I gave this new brand a chance was the cost.</li>
            <li>The dentist was charging an arm and a leg for a single treatment and whitening tooth paste didn’t really work.</li>
            <li>old and had never previously used this type of whitening product (only whitening toothpaste/mouthwash).  </li>
            <li>but from what I researched about the ingredients and whitening strips in general, these seem A-OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After two weeks of using these strips I did not really notice much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 5 so nearly the whitest white.</li>
            <li>So far, I used only once</li>
            <li>So far, I used these strips 4 times only</li>
            <li>However if you have somewhere to go immediately after, you might want to wait to use these because it does look kind of weird</li>
            <li>This one is not great that is for sure.</li>
            <li>I noticed, after a couple hours the effect wears down a tad, but your smile will still be white!</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews due to different opinions and try to be open minded</li>
            <li>My only problem with it is that it leaves my teeth feeling VERY sensitive to temperatures especially when eating things like ice cream.  </li>
            <li>I have tried crest white strips in the past and they really didnt work as fast as these have.</li>
            <li>One pic is just a straight pic and the other</li>
            <li>There is no strange residue left on my teeth after each use and my teeth are whiter than ever.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Amazing stuff and affordably priced.</li>
            <li> received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> I liked the ease of use and performance of these strips.</li>
            <li> I received this pack of strips for expressing my honest opinions.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price n fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Does provide an effective whitening to peroxide-based whitestrips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am glad I had a chance to try these, I really loved the strips.</li>
            <li> I got these with instructions and a shade guide to see what kind of an improvement I could do.</li>
            <li> Purchased these because of the great reviews but after trying them and *then* realizing that there is NO info about the company anywhere online or on the packaging, I got super paranoid that these were like, off-brand cancer death strips or something.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than crest brand and very good results.</li>
            <li> Never considered whitening my teeth, and I was happy with the brightness of my smile.</li>
            <li> Looks like a good budget friendly whitening product.</li>
            <li> I have consistent results and I am happy with the strips.</li>
            <li> I liked these strips, they are easy to apply and they work.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I am sure that I would have seen better results had I given up coffee, but even with drinking coffee</li>
            <li> They do the trick and keep my teeth flawless until the next treatment is needed!</li>
            <li> But the strips have removed most of those stains.</li>
            <li> I think things will look much better at the end of week 2.</li>
            <li> If this review helped, please click &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> I must get more of these, I did quit smoking and soda but coffee will forever stay in my life.</li>
            <li> and they are not bulky - allowing me to be able to speak with strips on.</li>
            <li> I have used many whitening strips over the years.</li>
            <li> Better than the named</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> initially bought this because of the excellent reviews.</li>
            <li> Well, if you count the price factor, these are better.</li>
            <li> I really love these strips.</li>
            <li> The pics (taken after I&#x27;d removed the strip and wiped away most of the goop) don&#x27;t even do the damage justice.</li>
            <li> However, despite the enamel safe claim, they still do.</li>
            <li> I will have a really bright smile in all the pictures for many years to show.</li>
            <li> What’s even better is that the whitening lasts.</li>
            <li> I was able keep them on for 30 minutes with no problems.</li>
            <li> My smile was gorgeous</li>
            <li> and I love showing it off</li>
            <li> I am glad I gave this a chance.</li>
            <li> Compared to crest strips, these stick on much better.</li>
            <li> I think this is a better way to whiten compared to the bleaching gels.</li>
            <li> and I think its safe to say this is a winner.</li>
            <li> I am sure at the end of the 14 day run, things will look much better.</li>
            <li> And may be even a bit better.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research beforehand and bought it to know for sure.</li>
            <li> This whitening product was provided merely as a free sample to give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to use the strips right after brushing, it won&#x27;t stick good.</li>
            <li> This is a new europen brand, they are cost effective and a good alternative to the famous brands.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this product, the value for money is great.</li>
            <li> Great so far!</li>
            <li> I would rather spend more for a brand that leaves my teeth feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Also, no teeth or gum sensitivity which I sometimes experienced when using the higher-end Crest strips... AND the mystery-ish whitening goo has not killed me.</li>
            <li> Also, no teeth or gum sensitivity which I sometimes experienced when using the higher-end Crest strips... AND the mystery-ish whitening goo has not killed me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> were easy to remove and came off in one piece.</li>
            <li> The strips were really easy to apply and were easily stored in my bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything came just as described and this is an easy to use product.</li>
            <li> I can easily recommend this brand of strips to anyone who is looking.</li>
            <li> my friends have noticed, and i can easily tell in the mirror and in pics.</li>
            <li> They are easy to peel and apply.</li>
            <li> I guess the chemical is not that strong.</li>
            <li> The whitening isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li> The strips stay on my teeth just fine.</li>
            <li> I liked the improvement I see, and now these are my new favorite strips.</li>
            <li> Very stretchy and fit nicely over teeth.  </li>
            <li> When those didn&#x27;t work, I bought the Crest Advanced ($50).</li>
            <li> 2 weeks later my smile is still nice and bright.</li>
            <li> used my two week supply and started to notice light stains fading after four days</li>
            <li> I liked the lumeeno teeth whitening strips, they really work.</li>
            <li> Cant believe they are so cheap.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used a lot of teeth whitening products in my life, as a coffee and wine lover, it&#x27;s important....</li>
            <li> but I would much much much rather pay for a safer treatment and effective treament.</li>
            <li> Supplies is extremely cheap, no instructions, takes a lot of effort to get the gel on the brush if you haven&#x27;t burned your gums after meticulously trying to prevent it.</li>
            <li> experience has been good thus far.</li>
            <li> but I honestly don&#x27;t understand how this product is so highly rated.</li>
            <li> Easy to use overall, I have nothing but good things to say, honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was excited to give them a shot.  </li>
            <li> my teeth still have improved significantly.  </li>
            <li> Just to be on the safe side, I ended my first session as 15 minutes</li>
            <li> I was able to get results just after the first two uses.</li>
            <li> What I love most is that its not messy, easy and quick to apply, and it doesn&#x27;t damage the enamel.</li>
            <li> I decided the first step was to get my teeth nice and pretty.</li>
            <li> I saw a handful of reviews and they all were positive for the most part.</li>
            <li> I am getting ready for a very important event for my life and teeth whitening was on my list of things to do.</li>
            <li> There are many other similiar but  superior produdcts on the market for  </li>
            <li> I also want to mention if you have an event or special occasion</li>
            <li> Effective in whitening my teeth and easy to work with but caused significantly more gum sensitivity than any other brand of strips I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Good experience overall.</li>
            <li> This deterred me from using them the full 2 weeks, so I cannot speak to the quality of whiteness.</li>
            <li> I was given an opportunity to try these strips for my true assessment of the product based on my experience.</li>
            <li> I can tell that they are almost as good as crest and one third of the cost.</li>
            <li> Based on my experience, there is no bad after taste.</li>
            <li> no mess nice and convenient.</li>
            <li> Get pretty gooey, and curl-up easily when being removed from wrapper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am smiling bigger and feeling more confident.</li>
            <li> I needed to increase the whiteness in my teeth and purchased this whitening system because of the quick use.</li>
            <li> and already I see tremendous results.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t believe how quick these work.</li>
            <li> and I am really impressed with these especially given the low price.</li>
            <li> They were nice, not cheap but effective.</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement at the very first use.  </li>
            <li> I am one who has been trying to find a good whitening product for a very long time!</li>
            <li> These worked great, little tought to keep on, but you&#x27;ll come up with a system, and there is plenty of  tips from others in this thread.</li>
            <li> Having  a hard time with the bottoms strip, is slips up, will not stick as good as the top</li>
            <li> But I will say this; for the price of this product, it is worth a shot.</li>
            <li> and if I have a wider smile than that, what should I do??</li>
            <li> but it’s gonna be so worth it.</li>
            <li> The strips stick to your teeth nicely, the discomfort caused by wearing them is minimal but the overall effect is not as good as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I decided I needed to start fresh with white(r) teeth but didn’t know how.</li>
            <li> Fun experience.</li>
            <li> I drink everything out of a straw now, and my smile is whiter brighter</li>
            <li> These are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend wearing the strips more than 30 minutes every day, or your teeth will get sensitive.</li>
            <li> The strips are very easy to apply there is no messy gel I have to apply, all I have to do is make sure my teeth are dry and clean.</li>
            <li> these strips however, actually really brighten up your smile!</li>
            <li> I know all the reviews are super positive, but after this I would not say it&#x27;s worth the risk.</li>
            <li> most whitening products make a barely noticeable impact.</li>
            <li> and I started my first application of the strips right away.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> I was leaving the comfort of home and starting out in the real world on my own.</li>
            <li> I found these and ordered them, shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> Right after use, you will have a much whiter smile.</li>
            <li> The Lumeeno strips are probably right up there with the Crest Advanced Seal as far as adherence goes, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are a little bit stretchy, which is perfect, so I can make them fit over all of my front teeth and there arent any missing spots.</li>
            <li> ;) 👍</li>
            <li> I like that Lumeeno&#x27;s teeth whitening product is in strip form, making it possible to limit the product to touching my teeth, and</li>
            <li> As a wine lower, I have found that over the years my teeth get pretty stained.</li>
            <li> The first set of whitening strips I ever used were the Crest originals (first one created by Crest)</li>
            <li> These are comparable to the ones that cost more than double.</li>
            <li> I think this 14 pack will last me more than 2 months.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues for the first 12 days</li>
            <li> and I plan on using more later.</li>
            <li> Yeah, crest is more expensive and perhaps not quite as effective, but it never gave me chemical burns!</li>
            <li> Top strips are OK but bottom ones are too small to cover your teeth.</li>
            <li> I started them on a Sunday since I had exactly two weeks</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how detailed the instructions were yet</li>
            <li> By the end of the first week I was two shades lighter by day 14</li>
            <li> I have used many different type of whitening systems over the years.</li>
            <li> :) I saw results after the first or second use.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the grossness of pictures 1 and 2, but you have to see them too understand how awesome picture 3 is.  </li>
            <li> These strips claim to have 6% hydrogen peroxide - most over-the-counter products range from five to ten percent hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> This is my first whitening product experience, and I had never used anything like this.</li>
            <li> I could see a bit of whitening after my first use.</li>
            <li> I recommend these whitening strips to anyone who wants to get a brighter smile.</li>
            <li> and you want a white smile quick, try this!</li>
            <li> I am 30, don&#x27;t have terribly yellow teeth, but some staining from coffee, and I can tell you that from the first use you notice your teeth will be much brighter and a shade or more lighter.</li>
            <li> More convenient than the mouth trays, don&#x27;t seem to be as effective as Crest White Strips, but half the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of teeth whiteners and nothing seem to really work.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews, followed the instructions, basic peel and stick except these don&#x27;t really stick- when you try and press them on your teeth to make sure they are on like they should be they move around</li>
            <li> So far, they did not make my teeth any more sensitive.</li>
            <li> I think my teeth were really stained when i first started, I wish I made a comparison with the color chart.</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply, and you only need to leave them on for 15- 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before applying the strips be sure to rise your mouth with water and then use a napkin to dry your teeth well.</li>
            <li> Like others have mentioned, make sure to dry your teeth before placement.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to use and results are almost instant.</li>
            <li> For the past few year, I have been loyally paying a lot for the famous crest brand, and the results have been good.</li>
            <li> I have whitened my teeth before by using mouth trays that I needed to fill with gel to whitening my teeth before, and while they worked well, the gel really burned my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will really help the strips to stick on your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much so I had to write this review.</li>
            <li> Those did not to much of anything at all.</li>
            <li> much cheaper than the brand names.</li>
            <li> The stripes to stick to your teeth very well.</li>
            <li> It is really slippery once you put it on.</li>
            <li> you dont really see a lot of difference rightt away.</li>
            <li> My whole life</li>
            <li> These work well and are reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> it really helped my teeth look whiter.  </li>
            <li> This is a real money saver.</li>
            <li> My teeth are really whiter than before</li>
            <li> Thanks will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have gone through the whole 14 packs in 2 weeks and my teeth have never been whiter.  </li>
            <li> Gets very gloppy on the fingers and in the mouth.  </li>
            <li> It might work if you don&#x27;t bleach very often.</li>
            <li> Plus it delivers quality results for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, there isn&#x27;t much to lose with this product.</li>
            <li> I am not done with the whole set of 14</li>
            <li> My husband even noticed how much whiter my teeth are and asked me to order them for him.  </li>
            <li> Because what makes a crappy whitening strip crappy is when the whitener/adhesive isn&#x27;t very adherent..</li>
            <li> And the caveat is that I don&#x27;t want to spend too much money.</li>
            <li> It gets easier as you keep applying these strips and they don&#x27;t cause that much sensitivity, well not in my case.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different whiteners over the years, from professional grade to top of the line OTC to this one on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I followed other people&#x27;s advice and waited 30mins after brushing and flossing my teeth; be sure to wipe your teeth dry before application, but it&#x27;s pretty easy setting the strips on.</li>
            <li> I was starting to be very self conscience and had adopted a mona lisa smile!</li>
            <li> My teeth were pretty white to start with, but if I ever want them whitened again, I&#x27;ll prob just pay the extra money to have a dentist do it safely.</li>
            <li> You place one strip on the top and the other on your bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> First, let me just say that I am a coffee addict and my smile was starting to show it!</li>
            <li> I have tried several products and Lumeeno is the one for me, It is easy convenient and not messy.</li>
            <li> Better than other more expensive strips...buying more</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stick as well or work as well as White Strips, but not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I love these because they are half the price and NONE OF THE PAIN.</li>
            <li> Noticed a change in my teeth after 2 uses but the white fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> Results were decent.</li>
            <li> I really wish the strips were longer as it only covered the front teeth that show when you smile.</li>
            <li> I went 3 shades lighter just after 4 days that is better than some of the more expensive kits.</li>
            <li> The whitening efficacy is about the same as most products, but these  do not adhere as well ; especially  the lower strips.</li>
            <li> As a user of the more expensive brand name strips, these did not apply as nicely, and there was a lot more gel gunk to deal with, but at the end of the day my teeth are just as white as using other brands.</li>
            <li> Then I noticed my teeth were discolored must be from all those tea and energy drinks I consumed to survive high school.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but I still rather have white crooked teeth than yellow and crooked teeth lol.</li>
            <li> Clearly there was a patch of hydrogen peroxide much stronger than 6% on this strip, and it freaking gave me chemical burns.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t stay on my teeth very well, invested in the Professional Whitestrips.</li>
            <li> I normally wouldn&#x27;t expect a miracle from an over the counter teeth whitening product but these strips met my expectations.</li>
            <li> After only one week my smile was 4 shades lighter, I used the chart included with the strips to determine this.</li>
            <li> Most other whiteners were probably too strong and burned my gums, but this one only has a slight tingle and worked much faster!</li>
            <li> I will be doing another period of whitening with a new batch of these soon.</li>
            <li> I wanted to start college of feeling new and refreshed</li>
            <li> I got a new clothes and new shoes.</li>
            <li> and I assumed it was new since I hadn&#x27;t seen it before.</li>
            <li> And I always look for new teeth whitening products.</li>
            <li> I tried crest whitening strips, however they made my teeth very sensitive.</li>
            <li> but wow! I&#x27;ve only used it just once before I was floored at how well and fast this works!</li>
            <li> I have pretty white teeth to begin with because of that on the shade chart</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t stick to my teeth nearly as well as Crest Whitestrips!</li>
            <li> My teeth got very white after my first 6 sessions</li>
            <li> I would much prefer (even though the back teeth may rarely show) to have all my teeth be white instead of just the front ones.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The sensitivity began with the application of the first set of strips causing me to wait several days between each application to allow for healing time.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are already pretty white (shade 3, according to the BONUS TOOTH SHADE CHART THAT IS INCLUDED)</li>
            <li> My teeth are already pretty white (shade 3, according to the BONUS TOOTH SHADE CHART THAT IS INCLUDED)</li>
            <li> When done and remove them from the teeth, there is a residual &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; of gel left on your teeth (comparing to Crest strips which peel off clean) but its no big deal...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really have high expectations since it was priced so low -</li>
            <li> When you put them on, they really just stick nicely and no more slipping.</li>
            <li> The only positive side to this product is that it did not make my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> (they make my teeth sensitive), and things had been going pretty well, but after less than 5 minutes of wearing them tonight, I realized I had a pretty severe pain on my lower gums.</li>
            <li> only a little more money.</li>
            <li> I have not even been using it for a week and after even the second use i have seen a very noticeable change in my teeth and friends and family</li>
            <li> not my sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are actually working really well.</li>
            <li> My teeth are sensitive but these strips did not cause me any irritation.</li>
            <li> This has whitened my teeth by 3 shades so far.</li>
            <li> Also, I had no issues with my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> but so far I am on day 5, I used them 5 times and people started to see a definitive whitening already.</li>
            <li> I think they worked well so far.</li>
            <li> Ihad really let my teeth go,  drinking a ton of iced tea and sodas while smoking daily.  </li>
            <li> I used 5 pairs so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 8 so far</li>
            <li> Since I’m starting fresh with taking proper care of my body, cleansing dieting and exercising</li>
            <li> So after the 14 days, I used the chart to evaluate how much my smile had been whitened overall, an my total was 11 shades!</li>
            <li> These white strips definitely do the job and are a great price, but be prepared to get a little messy.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I gave this new brand a chance was the cost.</li>
            <li> The dentist was charging an arm and a leg for a single treatment and whitening tooth paste didn’t really work.</li>
            <li> old and had never previously used this type of whitening product (only whitening toothpaste/mouthwash).  </li>
            <li> but from what I researched about the ingredients and whitening strips in general, these seem A-OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using these strips I did not really notice much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 5 so nearly the whitest white.</li>
            <li> So far, I used only once</li>
            <li> So far, I used these strips 4 times only</li>
            <li> However if you have somewhere to go immediately after, you might want to wait to use these because it does look kind of weird</li>
            <li> This one is not great that is for sure.</li>
            <li> I noticed, after a couple hours the effect wears down a tad, but your smile will still be white!</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews due to different opinions and try to be open minded</li>
            <li> My only problem with it is that it leaves my teeth feeling VERY sensitive to temperatures especially when eating things like ice cream.  </li>
            <li> I have tried crest white strips in the past and they really didnt work as fast as these have.</li>
            <li> One pic is just a straight pic and the other</li>
            <li> There is no strange residue left on my teeth after each use and my teeth are whiter than ever.</li>
            <li> So far only a slight shade difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 12 days (14 days recommended) and myself, nor my husband, really notices a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it is pretty common with all whitening strips.</li>
            <li> The pack I received contained 14 flat packets, and a shade guide.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and not too uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I did follow a reviewer&#x27;s recommendation to brush/floss and dry the surface of teeth with paper towel prior to application.  </li>
            <li> (Wiping my teeth dry with a paper towel beforehand definitely helped.)</li>
            <li> (Wiping my teeth dry with a paper towel beforehand definitely helped.)</li>
            <li> -I keep trying alternatives to the more expensive brands like Crest but end up not liking those alternatives, this one and Rembrandt fail in my opinion-guess it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I am experiencing some tooth sensitivity but that is only due to the multiple times I have whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> It was a little difficult applying the strips at first because this is the first time I use this type of product.</li>
            <li> My teeth were not really &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; to begin with, but they could definitely use some whitening...</li>
            <li> but after that all 30 minutes long sessions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used white strips for years, but never really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Just as when people bleach their hair within reason, a lightening effect changes the hair but doesn&#x27;t make it break and fall out.&amp;#34; So follow the guidelines and maybe don&#x27;t use if you have super weak enamel or other teeth/gum damage?</li>
            <li> Anyway,  I found a 14 day whitening kit for 14.99 which were just plain old whitening strips</li>
            <li> I feel the reason why they do not stick as well is due to the extra gel.</li>
            <li> Not for someone who does not want to sit for 20 minutes with cotton in their mouth (need to do this to keep teeth and strips dry)  </li>
            <li> You need dry hands and dry teeth for the strips to work.</li>
            <li> but now I can see that they were not super white either.</li>
            <li> Upper teeth got a little lighter and the gaps between my bottom teeth are also lighter.</li>
            <li> * Do not handle the strips with wet hands.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Now I just finished Lumeeno strips and not much of any change.</li>
            <li> Item received as expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just too impatient to wait for the entire time required</li>
            <li> I dried my teeth before putting it on and still did not stay in place the entire 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Immediately after whitening you will notice some really white parts (it&#x27;ll look uneven).</li>
            <li> There is not much drooling.</li>
            <li> I saw results only within a few days.</li>
            <li> I also tried five minute white, and a few whitening pens.</li>
            <li> so I only needed a few treatments to brighten them up.</li>
            <li> so I only needed a few treatments to brighten them up.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised, because they do not have a harsh chemical taste nor do they make your teeth ache after they have been applied for a while, like a few others that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Running a business has me moving constantly, giving me little time to do other things.</li>
            <li> While I was using the crest strips in the past, I had to use several times before I could see any improvement.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t beat the price compared to other whitening strips.</li>
            <li> (But as the Crest website pointed out &amp;#34;The enamel is not living tissue, so your body can rebuild tooth enamel that has been damaged or worn away due to erosion from dietary acids.&amp;#34; So there&#x27;s still hope for folks out there with damaged enamel!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was sick of the tedious gel and trays, and I needed something easy and fast, because I had a wedding in about a month.</li>
            <li> The lower strip covers 4-6 front teeth and both hardly cover back of the teeth.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I got a headache as soon as I put the stripes on.</li>
            <li> These strips do whiten your teeth, but they are extremely messy and dissolve partially on your teeth, rendering clean-up when you remove them a pain, with sticky stuff on your gums, lips, and teeth that require flossing, brushing, etc.....  </li>
            <li> From HowStuffWorks: &amp;#34;When used in excess, however, teeth can become porous and enamel can break down.</li>
            <li> works equally well if not better !</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I do store them in the fridge, after reading some of the other reviews...Makes the gel firm and peels off the backing and application easier...</li>
            <li> and I used these strips for a few days, it worked.</li>
            <li> They were gone after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I am planning to buy another set of 14 to maintain my whiteness and I will stay away from coffee for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and used them for 30 minutes everyday.</li>
            <li> I just used it and it left horrible and very noticeable white spots on my front teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy coffee &amp; tea drinker and 50 yrs.</li>
            <li> but it all got evened out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> am seriously shocked right now.</li>
            <li> lot of other negative reviews have also noted how sticky the residue is.</li>
            <li> And recently I wanted to try another brand (something less expensive) to save some money.</li>
            <li> After I opened a package I am not sure whether to use it or not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird idea to whiten only what&#x27;s seen</li>
            <li> You get 14 small aluminum bags, each containing a pair of strips.</li>
            <li> googled the ingredients and nothing seems to be out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> not sure what that means?</li>
            <li> Lumeeno did nothing for my teeth other than making them extremely sensitive : (</li>
            <li> but my teeth got a little sensitive on day 13 and 14, and even then, it wasn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> I could understand something happening if you fell asleep with them on or something, but I had serious damage/pain within a few minutes of applying them.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to get my teeth whiter:(</li>
            <li> they were not that hard to use.</li>
            <li> It is hard to keep on your teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried really hard to like it</li>
            <li> For the price of this, I would at least try.</li>
            <li> Another product that sucks.  </li>
            <li> (at least i did).</li>
            <li> I hate the color of my teeth, and I am very self-conscious about it.  </li>
            <li> I was/am truly horrified by this, and shocked that it hasn&#x27;t happened to anyone else (or to me with one of the earlier strips).</li>
            <li> With all the whitening products out there, its difficult choosing which one to try since we all don&#x27;t want to waste money.</li>
            <li> my teeth are not attractive to look at.</li>
            <li> 2 complaints; they do not stick as well and leave behind a lot of the gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battle terrible teeth, but after buying these strips my whole outlook has changed.</li>
            <li> The gel residue it leaves behind after the treatment is the olnly thing that bothers me</li>
            <li> I tried to tolerate it for a little longer but after another minute or two it became too painful to bear</li>
            <li> i have used it for 3 days once a day so ill see.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed, I dislike how they leave a gooey residue on your teeth.</li>
            <li> This product is sad..</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s been little whitening happening :( !</li>
            <li> and they kinda felt dirty.</li>
            <li> I got these Lumeeno at a promotional discount, I was very skeptical of how this may work.</li>
            <li> My teeth were not that bad frankly, but I had invisiline for a couple of years</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a bad thing.</li>

            <li> I was very disappointed with these products as they gave me no results.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have not even been using it for a week and after even the second use i have seen a very noticeable change in my teeth and friends and family are commenting saying my teeth look whiter. Very pleased and deffinetly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I think these work just as good as the Crest Luxe Whitening strips...&lt;br /&gt;I do store them in the fridge, after reading some of the other reviews...Makes the gel firm and peels off the backing and application easier...When done and remove them from the teeth, there is a residual &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; of gel left on your teeth (comparing to Crest strips which peel off clean) but its no big deal...either brush or wipe off with a tissue or napkin and you&#x27;re GOOD to GO!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be reordering again...Think they work GREAT and can&#x27;t beat the price! ;) 👍</li>
            <li> I hate the color of my teeth, and I am very self-conscious about it.  I am a coffee-addict, and drinking multiple cups a day has left my teeth stained. I have whitened my teeth before by using mouth trays that I needed to fill with gel to whitening my teeth before, and while they worked well, the gel really burned my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was offered an opportunity to try Lumeeno Elastic Teeth Whitening Strips I was excited to give them a shot.  I like that Lumeeno&#x27;s teeth whitening product is in strip form, making it possible to limit the product to touching my teeth, and not my sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips come in individually wrapped pouches, making it simple to grab one and use it on the go.  They are easy to apply, and you only need to leave them on for 15- 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product description states that during the duration of the whitening treatment (14 days) that you do not eat or drink foods or beverages that may stain your teeth. I could not follow this instruction, as I could not give up my beloved coffee. I am sure that I would have seen better results had I given up coffee, but even with drinking coffee my teeth still have improved significantly.  I plan on ordering these strips in the future when my teeth need to be whitened again. You can&#x27;t beat this price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;* Do not handle the strips with wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;* Before applying the strips be sure to rise your mouth with water and then use a napkin to dry your teeth well. This will really help the strips to stick on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;* Brush your teeth after removing the strips, to remove all the left over gel from your teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> Always wanted to try teeth whitening strips but the cost of crest kinda drove me away. This brand was inexpensive so I tried it. It is very easy to use and I don&#x27;t mind them on my teeth. My teeth were not gross at the begining but now I can see that they were not super white either. I can now see the improvement and I plan to buy another pack next month.</li>
            <li> As a wine lower, I have found that over the years my teeth get pretty stained. I decided to stick to a whitening regimen once a year. Every year for 2 weeks I do abstain from wine (and coffee) to whiten my teeth with these whitening strips. They do the trick and keep my teeth flawless until the next treatment is needed!</li>
            <li> I liked the ease of use and performance of these strips. I started seeing big difference after week 1 and things kept improving until I ran out of strips. I think my teeth were really stained when i first started, I wish I made a comparison with the color chart. Oh well....</li>
            <li> Used Lumeeno for about a week and I see a difference in the whiteness level of my teeth. They send you a color chart to keep track. As a coffee and cola drinker, I had stains on my teeth. But the strips have removed most of those stains. I think things will look much better at the end of week 2.</li>
            <li> I am about seven days into the treatment now, and I can see the change. They are actually working really well. I am pleasantly surprised, because they do not have a harsh chemical taste nor do they make your teeth ache after they have been applied for a while, like a few others that I have tried. They are a little bit stretchy, which is perfect, so I can make them fit over all of my front teeth and there arent any missing spots. Easy to use overall, I have nothing but good things to say, honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> Better than other more expensive strips...buying more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different whiteners over the years, from professional grade to top of the line OTC to this one on Amazon. I didn&#x27;t really have high expectations since it was priced so low - but wow! I&#x27;ve only used it just once before I was floored at how well and fast this works! So much so I had to write this review. I followed other people&#x27;s advice and waited 30mins after brushing and flossing my teeth; be sure to wipe your teeth dry before application, but it&#x27;s pretty easy setting the strips on. Most other whiteners were probably too strong and burned my gums, but this one only has a slight tingle and worked much faster! If this review helped, please click &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> My teeth were not really &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; to begin with, but they could definitely use some whitening... After two weeks of using these strips I did not really notice much of a difference at all. The only positive side to this product is that it did not make my teeth sensitive. But I will say this; for the price of this product, it is worth a shot. All whitening strips are different relative to each person. The first set of whitening strips I ever used were the Crest originals (first one created by Crest) Those worked wonders for me. I did not have to whiten my teeth again for another 2-3 years. When I did try them a second time, they did not work for me (maybe because at that time those were discontinued, so I may have gotten an expired set online). When those didn&#x27;t work, I bought the Crest Advanced ($50). Those did not to much of anything at all. Now I just finished Lumeeno strips and not much of any change. So moral of the story, whitening strips vary between person and its hit or miss I think. For the price of this, I would at least try.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of teeth whiteners and nothing seem to really work. With the years of smoking and drinking soda and coffee my teeth are not attractive to look at. I got these Lumeeno at a promotional discount, I was very skeptical of how this may work. After using these for 2 weeks I am very impressed. The strips are very easy to apply there is no messy gel I have to apply, all I have to do is make sure my teeth are dry and clean. There is no strange residue left on my teeth after each use and my teeth are whiter than ever. I am smiling bigger and feeling more confident. I must get more of these, I did quit smoking and soda but coffee will forever stay in my life.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my teeth. Will stick with crest brand.</li>
            <li> Since I’m starting fresh with taking proper care of my body, cleansing dieting and exercising I figured I would show my teeth some care as well. I decided the first step was to get my teeth nice and pretty. I am hooked on Lumeeno, they work great. My teeth are white. When I go  away for three days all I had to do is pack three of the sealed pouches in my bag and I am good for 3 days. No bulky kits no mess nice and convenient. I can put the strips on anywhere, strips stick well and they are not bulky - allowing me to be able to speak with strips on. After just days I was seeing results. 2 weeks later my smile is still nice and bright.</li>
            <li> Never considered whitening my teeth, and I was happy with the brightness of my smile. But I needed an extra boost for a job interview and I used these strips for a few days, it worked.</li>
            <li> Item received as expected</li>
            <li> I have used many whitening strips over the years. I have pretty white teeth to begin with because of that on the shade chart it comes with I&#x27;m a 5 so nearly the whitest white. I am also a smoker and coffee drinker so I use strips as maintenance. Crest white strips hurt my teeth. I love these because they are half the price and NONE OF THE PAIN. Same results. Love these strips will repurchase!</li>
            <li> Started noticing a difference in teeth whitening in a couple of days. This product does work.</li>
            <li> Better than the named brands.&lt;br /&gt;Whitens perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a teeth whitening product so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 12 days (14 days recommended) and myself, nor my husband, really notices a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially bought this because of the excellent reviews. I&#x27;ll try something else next time.</li>
            <li> These are comparable to the ones that cost more than double. They whiten just as well. 2 complaints; they do not stick as well and leave behind a lot of the gel. I feel the reason why they do not stick as well is due to the extra gel. But it&#x27;s only for 30 minutes and it&#x27;s easy to deal with. I brush my teeth after using the strips and that takes care of the remaining gel.</li>
            <li> Noticed a change in my teeth after 2 uses but the white fades quickly.  Good price but you would have to use continuously.</li>
            <li> much cheaper than the brand names. works equally well if not better !</li>
            <li> Still using them.  So far only a slight shade difference.  Will continue.  Not for someone who does not want to sit for 20 minutes with cotton in their mouth (need to do this to keep teeth and strips dry)  I have also started drinking my coffee with a straw to keep the stain off the teeth.</li>
            <li> I received this pack of strips for expressing my honest opinions. After I tried Lumeeno teeth whitening strips for 5 days in a row, I can see my teeth are getting whiter and I did not experience any sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Very stretchy and fit nicely over teeth.  Like others have mentioned, make sure to dry your teeth before placement.  I noticed an improvement at the very first use.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t stick to my teeth nearly as well as Crest Whitestrips! The strips fell apart in my mouth too.</li>
            <li> Works just great!  Good price.  Even my dentist commented on my white teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth are sensitive but these strips did not cause me any irritation. I guess the chemical is not that strong. Just to be on the safe side, I ended my first session as 15 minutes but after that all 30 minutes long sessions. My teeth got very white after my first 6 sessions and I now use the strips to maintain that level with twice treatments a week. I think this 14 pack will last me more than 2 months. Good bargain.</li>
            <li> So far, I used only once and I think I can already see a difference. While I was using the crest strips in the past, I had to use several times before I could see any improvement. Much cheaper than crest brand and very good results. Good deal.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stick as well or work as well as White Strips, but not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I literally received this product a couple hours ago and gave it a try. I had the stripes on for 28 minutes. I&#x27;m just too impatient to wait for the entire time required that is 30. I already saw improvement on my teeth. Upper teeth got a little lighter and the gaps between my bottom teeth are also lighter. The only complaint I have is that I got a headache as soon as I put the stripes on. I&#x27;ll keep you posted as I use them.  The stripes to stick to your teeth very well. It is really slippery once you put it on. I dried my teeth before putting it on and still did not stay in place the entire 30 minutes.  I am on my 4th day today and I can definitely see results. My teeth are whiter. But I notice that after the 3rd day of use, white spots appeared on my upper teeth. They were gone after a few hours.</li>
            <li> you dont really see a lot of difference rightt away. i have used it for 3 days once a day so ill see.</li>
            <li> These strips do whiten your teeth, but they are extremely messy and dissolve partially on your teeth, rendering clean-up when you remove them a pain, with sticky stuff on your gums, lips, and teeth that require flossing, brushing, etc.....  I had some Crest strips laying around too, so I compared those strips to the Lumeeno&#x27;s and the Crest strips were easy to remove and came off in one piece.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing. My whole life I&#x27;ve battle terrible teeth, but after buying these strips my whole outlook has changed. My teeth became whiter in a week. I highly recommend buying this product, the value for money is great.</li>
            <li> These work well and are reasonably priced.  Used daily it really helped my teeth look whiter.  I actually can see a difference just from one or two uses.</li>
            <li> After I opened a package I am not sure whether to use it or not. The lower strip covers 4-6 front teeth and both hardly cover back of the teeth. It&#x27;s a weird idea to whiten only what&#x27;s seen and if I have a wider smile than that, what should I do??</li>
            <li> Running a business has me moving constantly, giving me little time to do other things. I needed to increase the whiteness in my teeth and purchased this whitening system because of the quick use. In a 15-25 minute session every day I can make my teeth whiter. The added bonus is that once the strips are in my mouth I can still go on with my life. No need to pause life for whitening.</li>
            <li> This is a real money saver. Great online price at amazon, plus free prime shipping. I didn&#x27;t have any issues for the first 12 days but my teeth got a little sensitive on day 13 and 14, and even then, it wasn&#x27;t so bad. Sensitivity went away after 2 days. The strips stay on my teeth just fine. My teeth are really whiter than before and I plan on using more later.</li>
            <li> What an amazing product. For the past few year, I have been loyally paying a lot for the famous crest brand, and the results have been good. And recently I wanted to try another brand (something less expensive) to save some money. To me, it looked like I was paying for the name all this time. So, after looking around for some time, I wanted to try the lumeeno. The results are amazing. I can compare with the crest, and these are just as good. Well, if you count the price factor, these are better. I will stick with the lumeeno and save me some money.</li>
            <li> The best, no sensitivity with this one. Thanks will buy again.</li>
            <li> Price is great, shipped on time. Only one  reason not 5 star. Having  a hard time with the bottoms strip, is slips up, will not stick as good as the top</li>
            <li> This brand was recommended by a friend of mine, and I didn&#x27;t know about it before. Looks like a good budget friendly whitening product. My teeth are already white and I am using the strips to maintain my whiteness. Works for me and I definately recommend it.</li>
            <li> This has whitened my teeth by 3 shades so far. I really love these strips. I have tried crest white strips in the past and they really didnt work as fast as these have. I will be continuing to purchase these when i run out.</li>
            <li> CHEMICAL BURNS on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;I am seriously shocked right now. I was on strip 8 in about an 11 day period (they make my teeth sensitive), and things had been going pretty well, but after less than 5 minutes of wearing them tonight, I realized I had a pretty severe pain on my lower gums. I tried to tolerate it for a little longer but after another minute or two it became too painful to bear so I got up and looked in the mirror. My bottom gums on one side were being EATEN AWAY/DISSOLVING and turning white. I was/am truly horrified by this, and shocked that it hasn&#x27;t happened to anyone else (or to me with one of the earlier strips). I could understand something happening if you fell asleep with them on or something, but I had serious damage/pain within a few minutes of applying them. Clearly there was a patch of hydrogen peroxide much stronger than 6% on this strip, and it freaking gave me chemical burns. Yeah, crest is more expensive and perhaps not quite as effective, but it never gave me chemical burns! I know all the reviews are super positive, but after this I would not say it&#x27;s worth the risk. The pics (taken after I&#x27;d removed the strip and wiped away most of the goop) don&#x27;t even do the damage justice. My teeth were pretty white to start with, but if I ever want them whitened again, I&#x27;ll prob just pay the extra money to have a dentist do it safely. I&#x27;ve shadowed a hematologist and the whiteness looks like the sores leukemia and lymphoma patients get in their mouths. One pic is just a straight pic and the other I outlined the parts that were worst affected. The white parts within the outlined areas are burned gum, not glare!</li>
            <li> i purchased these solely because i have sensative teeth, ansld wanted something that wouldnt make my teeth hurt after. However, despite the enamel safe claim, they still do.</li>
            <li> Results were decent. However, there is one thing that dissatisfied me. I really wish the strips were longer as it only covered the front teeth that show when you smile. I would much prefer (even though the back teeth may rarely show) to have all my teeth be white instead of just the front ones.</li>
            <li> These white strips definitely do the job and are a great price, but be prepared to get a little messy. As a user of the more expensive brand name strips, these did not apply as nicely, and there was a lot more gel gunk to deal with, but at the end of the day my teeth are just as white as using other brands.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t stay on my teeth very well, invested in the Professional Whitestrips. If you have the patience to let these things sit on your teeth you may see similar results</li>
            <li> I am getting ready for a very important event for my life and teeth whitening was on my list of things to do. I have gone through the whole 14 packs in 2 weeks and my teeth have never been whiter.  I am planning to buy another set of 14 to maintain my whiteness and I will stay away from coffee for a few weeks. I know this is a big sacrifice but it’s gonna be so worth it. I will have a really bright smile in all the pictures for many years to show.</li>
            <li> It makes your teeth somehow whiter, but only somehow. It&#x27;s the third teeth whitening product I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s somewhere in between. The strips stick to your teeth nicely, the discomfort caused by wearing them is minimal but the overall effect is not as good as I wanted. Not buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try teeth whitening for some time after seeing it has started to become quite a craze, I&#x27;ve always seen my dental hygiene as a great importance as I work in sales and in my belief, having a great smile can be the difference between completing or losing a sale!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my two week supply and started to notice light stains fading after four days, my dentist recommended strips over the kits which come with mouth trays etc. as sometimes the solution won&#x27;t make contact with your teeth if the mold hasn&#x27;t been done correctly. The strips were really easy to apply and were easily stored in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the two weeks had finished, I could notice really great results, my teeth were noticeably whiter to the point where some of my colleagues at work had commented on them!</li>
            <li> I liked the lumeeno teeth whitening strips, they really work. Everything came just as described and this is an easy to use product. You get 14 small aluminum bags, each containing a pair of strips. You place one strip on the top and the other on your bottom teeth. It takes about 25-30 minutes per session and your teeth gets whiter. Simple and inexpensive. You need dry hands and dry teeth for the strips to work. You can compare day 1 and day 14 with the provided color chart. This set was offered to me at a discounted price for my unbiased product review based on my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> Wow! Two days in and already I see tremendous results. I purchased this products based on all the great reviews. They did not disappoint me. I am experiencing some tooth sensitivity but that is only due to the multiple times I have whiten my teeth. I have had issues posting pics but I will post to show results. Great product, great price n fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I normally wouldn&#x27;t expect a miracle from an over the counter teeth whitening product but these strips met my expectations. They are easy to use and results are almost instant. Good experience overall. Thank you.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. Cant believe they are so cheap. I noticed a difference after just one time, and didn&#x27;t end up needing the entire package. Immediately after whitening you will notice some really white parts (it&#x27;ll look uneven). This is calcium deposits, and it will fade and all look the same after a couple hours. However if you have somewhere to go immediately after, you might want to wait to use these because it does look kind of weird</li>
            <li> Top strips are OK but bottom ones are too small to cover your teeth.</li>
            <li> Great so far! Some before and after. This was after the 2nd use</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly...will order again. Can see big difference in the color of my teeth. Several shades whiter after a couple of uses. Will order again. Very simple to use...Love It ❤</li>
            <li> I am not impressed, I dislike how they leave a gooey residue on your teeth. This deterred me from using them the full 2 weeks, so I cannot speak to the quality of whiteness. I would rather spend more for a brand that leaves my teeth feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> People often take oral health for granted. They brush they floss and go to the dentist but they don’t brighten or whiten their teeth. I have tried several products and Lumeeno is the one for me, It is easy convenient and not messy. Great price too. I went 3 shades lighter just after 4 days that is better than some of the more expensive kits. What’s even better is that the whitening lasts. It doesn’t fade away after a day.</li>
            <li> Lumeeno did nothing for my teeth other than making them extremely sensitive : (</li>
            <li> 1 shade whiter after only 1 use!  i can&#x27;t believe how quick these work. I&#x27;ve used white strips for years, but never really noticed a difference. After using these just 1x, my teeth went from a 5 to a 4 (shade guide). I&#x27;m hoping to get to a 1!!!</li>
            <li> Get pretty gooey, and curl-up easily when being removed from wrapper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;  Does provide an effective whitening to peroxide-based whitestrips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;  Gets very gloppy on the fingers and in the mouth.  Requires a lot of mouth rinsing after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Used to chew tobacco when I was stressed but after kicking the habit I was constantly reminded by the yellow stains on my teeth. I decided I needed to start fresh with white(r) teeth but didn’t know how. The dentist was charging an arm and a leg for a single treatment and whitening tooth paste didn’t really work. After some research I purchased these white strips as a last ditch effort and I must say they did the job. After the two week period I saw noticeable change! I will be doing another period of whitening with a new batch of these soon.</li>
            <li> Another product that sucks.  Read the reviews, followed the instructions, basic peel and stick except these don&#x27;t really stick- when you try and press them on your teeth to make sure they are on like they should be they move around-I keep trying alternatives to the more expensive brands like Crest but end up not liking those alternatives, this one and Rembrandt fail in my opinion-guess it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I was given an opportunity to try these strips for my true assessment of the product based on my experience. The results are really good. After using the entire box of 14 pairs of strips in 2 weeks, the whiteness of my teeth was changed by 6 shades. I followed the instructions and used them for 30 minutes everyday. Based on my experience, there is no bad after taste. But the strips leave some gel back that needs to be brushed and rinsed. Very good product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It works, and you&#x27;ll get the best results when using this consistently.  My only problem with it is that it leaves my teeth feeling VERY sensitive to temperatures especially when eating things like ice cream.  This is a problem that all teeth whiteners seem to have though.  Really good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I liked these strips, they are easy to apply and they work. I was able keep them on for 30 minutes with no problems. They stick well and they stay in place. I can talk while strips are on. There is not much drooling. Just peel off the strips and rinse real good. Fun experience.</li>
            <li> Great whitening strips! I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different whitening agents over the years and I am really impressed with these especially given the low price. The shipping was super fast. I&#x27;m very happy I took a chance on these!</li>
            <li> These are terrible. I just used it and it left horrible and very noticeable white spots on my front teeth. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> My teeth were not that bad frankly, but I had invisiline for a couple of years and they kinda felt dirty. I am glad I had a chance to try these, I really loved the strips. This is the brand I prefer from now on. Great find. Such a bargain.</li>
            <li> I wanted to start college of feeling new and refreshed I was leaving the comfort of home and starting out in the real world on my own. I got a new clothes and new shoes. Then I noticed my teeth were discolored must be from all those tea and energy drinks I consumed to survive high school. I asked my parents what I could do that was affordable. They said she would help me find something that was in my budget and didn’t take a lot of preparation or effort. We found these strips and I got them. I started them on a Sunday since I had exactly two weeks till I moved in on campus. I was surprised by how detailed the instructions were yet they were not that hard to use. It comes with a shade guide and each pack has pictures on it of what they looked like and how to apply them. By the end of the first week I was two shades lighter by day 14 I was almost 4 shades lighter. My smile was gorgeous and I was smiling all the time. I drink everything out of a straw now, and my smile is whiter brighter and I love showing it off</li>
            <li> I have used many different type of whitening systems over the years. This one is not great that is for sure. It is hard to keep on your teeth. The whitening isn&#x27;t that strong. It might work if you don&#x27;t bleach very often. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was able to get results just after the first two uses. I liked the improvement I see, and now these are my new favorite strips. I can easily recommend this brand of strips to anyone who is looking. So far, they did not make my teeth any more sensitive. Easy to apply and not too uncomfortable to wear. I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have a very bad habit and I don&#x27;t like the yellowish brown teeth. While I was shopping for strips, I did some research on whitening products and I decided to try this brand. I am glad I gave this a chance. Compared to crest strips, these stick on much better. And results are easier to get - quicker. I saw results only within a few days. Also, I had no issues with my sensitive gums. I think this is a better way to whiten compared to the bleaching gels.</li>
            <li> These whitening strips are amazing! First, let me just say that I am a coffee addict and my smile was starting to show it! I was starting to be very self conscience and had adopted a mona lisa smile! I purchased this because I was sick of the tedious gel and trays, and I needed something easy and fast, because I had a wedding in about a month. I found these and ordered them, shipping was super fast and I started my first application of the strips right away. After only one week my smile was 4 shades lighter, I used the chart included with the strips to determine this. The instructions say it takes 14 days to see results so I was very impressed that I saw results faster than this! So after the 14 days, I used the chart to evaluate how much my smile had been whitened overall, an my total was 11 shades! Amazing! What I love most is that its not messy, easy and quick to apply, and it doesn&#x27;t damage the enamel. Plus it delivers quality results for a reasonable price. I will be using this again and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am one who has been trying to find a good whitening product for a very long time! I tried crest whitening strips, however they made my teeth very sensitive. I also tried five minute white, and a few whitening pens. I was very disappointed with these products as they gave me no results. I stumbled upon this product and I assumed it was new since I hadn&#x27;t seen it before. I saw a handful of reviews and they all were positive for the most part. I figured I would give this a shot since the price is amazing. I have been using it for about a week and I think its safe to say this is a winner. :) I saw results after the first or second use. With all the whitening products out there, its difficult choosing which one to try since we all don&#x27;t want to waste money. In my opinion, there isn&#x27;t much to lose with this product. Spend $10 or so and give it a try, I don&#x27;t think you will regret it! I also want to mention if you have an event or special occasion and you want a white smile quick, try this! Right after use, you will have a much whiter smile. (at least i did). I noticed, after a couple hours the effect wears down a tad, but your smile will still be white! Perfect for special occasion!</li>
            <li> I am not done with the whole set of 14 yet but so far I am on day 5, I used them 5 times and people started to see a definitive whitening already. I think they worked well so far.</li>
            <li> Staarted using it waaiting for the results.</li>
            <li> Effective in whitening my teeth and easy to work with but caused significantly more gum sensitivity than any other brand of strips I&#x27;ve ever used.  The sensitivity began with the application of the first set of strips causing me to wait several days between each application to allow for healing time.  The next time I want to use a whitener, I&#x27;ll buy one with a lower concentration of hydrogen peroxide.  This Lumeeno product is 6%.  .</li>
            <li> These are some awesome strips.  I have used Crest Whitening Strips and let me tell you, Crest is  garbage compared to this.  I am 30, don&#x27;t have terribly yellow teeth, but some staining from coffee, and I can tell you that from the first use you notice your teeth will be much brighter and a shade or more lighter. These are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Ihad really let my teeth go,  drinking a ton of iced tea and sodas while smoking daily.  Of course this did a number on my teeth. So anyway,  I decided to whiten my teeth and I turned to Amazon. Anyway,  I found a 14 day whitening kit for 14.99 which were just plain old whitening strips like you get in the Crest whitening kit,  but for a 1/3rd of the cost. Then I purchased the Optic White toothpaste,  and the Optic white mouth rinse (red tube/red bottle) and the results are in the picture. Sorry for the grossness of pictures 1 and 2, but you have to see them too understand how awesome picture 3 is.  Note,  pictures 1 and 2 were taken inside and picture 3 was taken outside.</li>
            <li> So far, I used these strips 4 times only and I can see a definitive whitening of my teeth. They have already worked for me. I am sure at the end of the 14 day run, things will look much better.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff and affordably priced. Great buy. The gel residue it leaves behind after the treatment is the olnly thing that bothers me but I need to admit, it is pretty common with all whitening strips. You just need to brush it away. Don&#x27;t try to use the strips right after brushing, it won&#x27;t stick good.</li>
            <li> I saw very noticeable whitening after only 5 uses (and that&#x27;s missing one day of application).  I&#x27;m a heavy coffee &amp; tea drinker and 50 yrs. old and had never previously used this type of whitening product (only whitening toothpaste/mouthwash).  I am extremely impressed by how well these work.  My husband even noticed how much whiter my teeth are and asked me to order them for him.  I did follow a reviewer&#x27;s recommendation to brush/floss and dry the surface of teeth with paper towel prior to application.  All in all I am delighted with the product and you can&#x27;t beat the price compared to other whitening strips.</li>
            <li> Purchased these because of the great reviews but after trying them and *then* realizing that there is NO info about the company anywhere online or on the packaging, I got super paranoid that these were like, off-brand cancer death strips or something. (Not that whitening strips are even regulated or anything anyway.) Still no info about the company (tho they do have a Twitter account!) but from what I researched about the ingredients and whitening strips in general, these seem A-OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I googled the ingredients and nothing seems to be out of the ordinary. These strips claim to have 6% hydrogen peroxide - most over-the-counter products range from five to ten percent hydrogen peroxide. Some reviewers claimed these dissolve your teeth -- not sure what that means? From HowStuffWorks: &amp;#34;When used in excess, however, teeth can become porous and enamel can break down. Just as when people bleach their hair within reason, a lightening effect changes the hair but doesn&#x27;t make it break and fall out.&amp;#34; So follow the guidelines and maybe don&#x27;t use if you have super weak enamel or other teeth/gum damage? (But as the Crest website pointed out &amp;#34;The enamel is not living tissue, so your body can rebuild tooth enamel that has been damaged or worn away due to erosion from dietary acids.&amp;#34; So there&#x27;s still hope for folks out there with damaged enamel!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of other negative reviews have also noted how sticky the residue is. I don&#x27;t think this is a bad thing. In fact, some brands (like Crest) even have options that are specifically made/marketed as no-slip. Because what makes a crappy whitening strip crappy is when the whitener/adhesive isn&#x27;t very adherent.. and when it&#x27;s not sticky enough, the strip doesn&#x27;t stay in place and the peroxide isn&#x27;t applied to the tooth properly. The Lumeeno strips are probably right up there with the Crest Advanced Seal as far as adherence goes, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience has been good thus far. The strips themselves are not too flimsy and they sealed closely to my teeth. (Wiping my teeth dry with a paper towel beforehand definitely helped.) My teeth are already pretty white (shade 3, according to the BONUS TOOTH SHADE CHART THAT IS INCLUDED) so I only needed a few treatments to brighten them up. Also, no teeth or gum sensitivity which I sometimes experienced when using the higher-end Crest strips... AND the mystery-ish whitening goo has not killed me. So that&#x27;s a thumbs up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Prepping my teeth beforehand using the DenTek Oral Care Kit definitely made a big difference. Using the pick goes above and beyond flossing.

            <li> I do have some experince with tooth whitening products and I used Crest strips before. They were nice, not cheap but effective. The only reason why I gave this new brand a chance was the cost. The pack I received contained 14 flat packets, and a shade guide. I used 5 pairs so far. I can tell that they are almost as good as crest and one third of the cost.</li>
            <li> The whitening efficacy is about the same as most products, but these  do not adhere as well ; especially  the lower strips. They are squishy . There are many other similiar but  superior produdcts on the market for  only a little more money.</li>
            <li> I care about the whiteness of my teeth. And I always look for new teeth whitening products. And the caveat is that I don&#x27;t want to spend too much money. This is why I tried the lumeeno strips. This is a new europen brand, they are cost effective and a good alternative to the famous brands. After using these, I found this brand to work the same as crest. And may be even a bit better. Because I did not have the slippery strip problem with lumeeno. When you put them on, they really just stick nicely and no more slipping. I don&#x27;t recommend wearing the strips more than 30 minutes every day, or your teeth will get sensitive.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used a lot of teeth whitening products in my life, as a coffee and wine lover, it&#x27;s important.... most whitening products make a barely noticeable impact. these strips however, actually really brighten up your smile! my friends have noticed, and i can easily tell in the mirror and in pics. i didn&#x27;t use all of them because i noticed some sensitivity developing in my teeth (a risk with ANY whitening product), but i will keep the extras for a whitening tune-up.</li>
            <li> More convenient than the mouth trays, don&#x27;t seem to be as effective as Crest White Strips, but half the price.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews due to different opinions and try to be open minded but I honestly don&#x27;t understand how this product is so highly rated. I did a lot of research beforehand and bought it to know for sure. I&#x27;ve tried really hard to like it but I would much much much rather pay for a safer treatment and effective treament. Supplies is extremely cheap, no instructions, takes a lot of effort to get the gel on the brush if you haven&#x27;t burned your gums after meticulously trying to prevent it. This product is sad..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 8 so far and there&#x27;s been little whitening happening :( ! When I take them off after the 30 minutes they are really white but then it goes away and turns yellow once again. I was really hoping to get my teeth whiter:(</li>
            <li> This is my first whitening product experience, and I had never used anything like this. I got these with instructions and a shade guide to see what kind of an improvement I could do. They send you 14 sealed bags and you open up a bag every day. They are easy to peel and apply. Once you put the strips on, they stay there until you are done. I could see a bit of whitening after my first use. I had some white spots kinda whiter than the others but it all got evened out after a few uses. I have consistent results and I am happy with the strips. This whitening product was provided merely as a free sample to give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t beat this price!  It works. My teeth have already whitened just after three sessions.</li>
            <li> These worked great, little tought to keep on, but you&#x27;ll come up with a system, and there is plenty of  tips from others in this thread.</li>
            <li> After three days of using this product, I have definitely seen improvement in whiteness. It was a little difficult applying the strips at first because this is the first time I use this type of product. It gets easier as you keep applying these strips and they don&#x27;t cause that much sensitivity, well not in my case.  I recommend these whitening strips to anyone who wants to get a brighter smile. I&#x27;m posting a picture of my teeth after 3 day use of Lumeeno strips. My teeth aren&#x27;t the nicest but I still rather have white crooked teeth than yellow and crooked teeth lol.</li>
