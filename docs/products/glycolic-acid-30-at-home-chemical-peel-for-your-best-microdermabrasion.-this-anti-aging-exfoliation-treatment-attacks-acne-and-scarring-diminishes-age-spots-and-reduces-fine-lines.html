            <li>I recieved this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion and truley love it</li>
            <li>This time I felt a bit more tingling</li>
            <li>I get so many emails and</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use the peel any more often than every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s safe to do once a week.  </li>
            <li>Item was returned because after almost a month (and many attempts by me) instructions for use were never received.</li>
            <li>Really pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m an Esthetician, I was very excited to use this brand and see how well it works.</li>
            <li>I needed my face to be fresh and amazing.</li>
            <li>and so far my skin is smoother, clearer, even, and happy.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li>It was easy.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to get off.  </li>
            <li>sure your face is clean, then wipe it off with an astringent like witch hazel or sea breeze.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I had tried to purchase a stronger face peel, but after speaking with a customer service rep, they explained that you need to start off with one that is not so strong</li>
            <li>The packing is nice and simple while still looking like a good quality product.</li>
            <li>hen sent me detailed easy to follow instructions to get the maximum benefit.  </li>
            <li>The peel is very easy to use and after the first use I noticed a healthier glow to my skin and diminished fine lines.</li>
            <li>I had a huge function to go to.</li>
            <li>*Free product provided for evaluation and review.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only is this a GREAT product....</li>
            <li>if you have never tried a peel before, this is a great one to start with, as it did not leave my skin red or irritated afterwards.</li>
            <li>&gt;* easy to apply to clean skin</li>
            <li>And on a side note: chemical peels will most likely make you break out, and THIS is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I think this is good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li>It is a very good product, but I need something a little stronger; therefore, I ordered the Jessner Peel.</li>
            <li>I am sure with extended use of the Carbon serum, that it may even repair some of my newly forming fine lines.</li>
            <li>I am very grateful that i was able to come across this product.</li>
            <li>I have never used a Face Peel before, so I was a bit nervous about trying this, but I was happy with my other Carbon Skincare products, so I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>But overall, it has been working great, pretty much exactly what I was expecting after reading the description.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant; it just lets you know the product is working.  </li>
            <li>like the product and will continue to use it until I find that sweet spot of time that&#x27;s just right for me.  </li>
            <li>It has left my skin clearer, softer, and most of all, brighter!</li>
            <li>I really decided to wait and post an accurate review.</li>
            <li>I use this about 3 nights a week before bed followed by my favorite serum and moisturizer, and have noticed how soft my skin is feeling.  </li>
            <li>truly believe this was cheaper and far more convenient than going to a dermatologist or esthetician for treatments.</li>
            <li>when referring to your face can be a little intimidating, so having handy instructions to make sure I&#x27;m using the product right is preferred.</li>
            <li>Though I did have some reservations about using it at first, but that quickly subsided with my first use!</li>
            <li>30 % acid is not too strong to irritate your skin but strong enough to give you a youthful glow.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any real progress with fine lines, but I can tell the potential is there and will happen with time and more treatments.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s safe to plan to use this the same day you want to look your best for an important event; it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin red or raw, just refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I would have to say, without the emailed instructions, I may have messed up at first.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking to get started with facial peels :)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s enough in the bottle for MANY treatments.  </li>
            <li>Got a bit of a tingle going for the first couple of minutes, then took off after 10 minutes, followed with the baking soda/water neutralizing solution (as in instructional email).  </li>
            <li>This was my first chemical peel.</li>
            <li>no ill after affects like redness</li>
            <li>Smooth naturally glowing face.</li>
            <li>( I started higher</li>
            <li>I will continue using this product for it&#x27;s fast results and effectiveness!</li>
            <li>Works very well for my combination skin!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t harsh which is great for those who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve never used a peel before it was really easy to do especially after being emailed  the instructions from the company, I did exactly what they said using 2 bowls one with the Glycolic Acid and one bowl with a paste made with baking soda and water.</li>
            <li>This 30% glycolic acid peel is gentle, and left my skin smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li>I actually really appreciate that, you dont see that much</li>
            <li>My skin is much clearer and tighter.</li>
            <li>My skin looks much brighter over all, and it seemed like it lightened my faded freckles up even more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so much spam</li>
            <li>Although they are available online or via email, I would prefer a paper copy that I can keep in the box to ensure proper use.</li>
            <li>a difference in my skin, pores and marks.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>but the Peel was gentle.</li>
            <li>It really is working well.</li>
            <li>It contains glycolic acid that is the key ingredient in this serum that makes the skin smooth and helps reducing wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I can see where this treatment does help skin to look younger and more clear.  </li>
            <li>This face peel is amazing, i used it it combination with a face serum from this same company, I could see a noticeable difference in my skin tone being softer and a renewed brightness in the overall appearance of my face, will be purchasing more of this product in the near future and working my way to new and higher strengths .</li>
            <li>I got some baking soda, and a new artist&#x27;s paintbrush and cottonballs, as recommended, to do my first peel.  </li>
            <li>i love chemical peels and this one did not disappoint ,left my skin feel tighter and help clear up some my adult acne,great deal for a chemical peel ,and if your a first time user always read instructions</li>
            <li>I have seen significant lessening of my red scars.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this was the first acid peel I used.</li>
            <li>The bottle has a simplified version of the directions, but Im new to this stuff and really didnt know what I was doing yet.</li>
            <li>This peel is mild enough to use a couple of times a week, and it&#x27;s everything the manufacturer says it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I will be buying again and i completely recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li>Looking forward to the new year with a new youthful glow!</li>
            <li>I also love how it removes the dead skin cells, and it has no smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product and believe it&#x27;s worth every</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was new to face peels.  </li>
            <li>The peel makes my skin look new.  </li>
            <li>I cant say enough about the customer service of this company, first off.</li>
            <li>The instructions had said for the first time to be only 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I am a first time user and following instructions to the T.</li>
            <li>I was definitely nervous at first</li>
            <li>I have acne scars both old and relatively new ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no fragrance, and the solution comes in a dark blue dropper top bottle.  </li>
            <li>I am counting down the days to be able to apply my next treatment!</li>
            <li>and wow my face was so soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li>I received this product and couldnt get it out of the package fast enough</li>
            <li>and I have a few more days to use it the second time.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I left it on for only a couple of minutes to see how my skin would react.  </li>
            <li>If you are new to using it start with only 2 or 3 minutes with the glycolic acid on your face.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to these at home peels, I&#x27;d recommend starting with five minutes to see how your skin reacts.  </li>
            <li>So i expected my skin to be kind of raw and red after using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once thus far for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>I usually use it at night once a week for 4-5 minutes and then follow with the Hyaluronic Acid Anti-Aging Facial Serum to cool off my face.</li>
            <li>The 30% Glycolic Acid is gentle and works by sluffing off old, dead skin leaving you with renewed skin!</li>

            <li> I got some baking soda, and a new artist&#x27;s paintbrush and cottonballs, as recommended, to do my first peel.  </li>

            <li> The bottle has a simplified version of the directions, but Im new to this stuff and really didnt know what I was doing yet.</li>
            <li> This peel is mild enough to use a couple of times a week, and it&#x27;s everything the manufacturer says it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I will be buying again and i completely recommend to anyone!!</li>

            <li> I definitely recommend this product and believe it&#x27;s worth every</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was new to face peels.  </li>
            <li> The peel makes my skin look new.  </li>
            <li> I cant say enough about the customer service of this company, first off.</li>
            <li> The instructions had said for the first time to be only 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I am a first time user and following instructions to the T.</li>
            <li> I was definitely nervous at first</li>
            <li> I have acne scars both old and relatively new ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no fragrance, and the solution comes in a dark blue dropper top bottle.  </li>
            <li> I am counting down the days to be able to apply my next treatment!</li>
            <li> and wow my face was so soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li> I received this product and couldnt get it out of the package fast enough</li>
            <li> and I have a few more days to use it the second time.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I left it on for only a couple of minutes to see how my skin would react.  </li>
            <li> If you are new to using it start with only 2 or 3 minutes with the glycolic acid on your face.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to these at home peels, I&#x27;d recommend starting with five minutes to see how your skin reacts.  </li>
            <li> So i expected my skin to be kind of raw and red after using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once thus far for 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I usually use it at night once a week for 4-5 minutes and then follow with the Hyaluronic Acid Anti-Aging Facial Serum to cool off my face.</li>
            <li> The 30% Glycolic Acid is gentle and works by sluffing off old, dead skin leaving you with renewed skin!</li>
            <li> You only need a dropper full for a thin coat on face and neck.  </li>
            <li> The next time I left it on for 5 minutes, because my face is pretty tough.  </li>
            <li> I used a fan brush to put a layer of acid on my face and left it on 2 minutes, I did feel a ltttle tingly sensation but nothing extreme</li>
            <li> My face felt a bit dry, so I followed up with hyaluronic acid serum.  </li>
            <li> I have dry but oily skin</li>
            <li> Glycolic acid helps control acne, or problem prone skin disorders by properly exfoliating dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> It takes patience and you have to follow the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> Now, a few days later, I leave it on for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> In the other bowl mix up a paste of baking soda and water.</li>
            <li> Other than that, nothing.</li>
            <li> I apply it every other week</li>
            <li> Skin is brighter, smoother, dark spots are gone.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates, smooths, and lightens dark spots.</li>
            <li> After placing my order they emailed me and suggested that since I have not done a chemical peel at home a use a slightly milder product.</li>
            <li> skin breaks out less and the scars fade faster.</li>
            <li> After applying, there&#x27;s a little tingle.  </li>
            <li> In one bowl place a few dropper fulls of the glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> Avoid retinols, harsh face products and sunlight without sunscreen for a week.</li>
            <li> Glycolic acid works by sloughing off the dead skins cells, it efficiently helps control abnormal keratinization (the abnormal build up of skin cells),</li>
            <li> I believe over all my skin looks less dull.</li>
            <li> Apply the glycolic acid with the cosmetic brush to your face in a thin layer, taking care not to place it too close to your eyes or lips.</li>
            <li> I was completely wrong.</li>
            <li> Stuff is fake</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Still too soon to tell, but I can feel it working when applied.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough about the customer service of this company, first off. I had tried to purchase a stronger face peel, but after speaking with a customer service rep, they explained that you need to start off with one that is not so strong so you do not hurt your skin. She emailed me in depth instructions and has offered support for any questions I might have in the future. I actually really appreciate that, you dont see that much anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Now, on to the product. I would have to say, without the emailed instructions, I may have messed up at first. The bottle has a simplified version of the directions, but Im new to this stuff and really didnt know what I was doing yet. But overall, it has been working great, pretty much exactly what I was expecting after reading the description. My skin is much clearer and tighter. I would recommend this to anyone looking to get started with facial peels :)</li>
            <li> *Free product provided for evaluation and review.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was new to face peels.  This came with a e-book that described the process.  I got some baking soda, and a new artist&#x27;s paintbrush and cottonballs, as recommended, to do my first peel.  It was easy.  The instructions had said for the first time to be only 2 minutes.  I used a kitchen timer and using the eyedropper and the brush, applied the 30% glycolic acid solution and left it on for 2 minutes.  It tingled a bit but that was all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face didn&#x27;t look much different afterwards.  It was easy to get off.  My face felt a bit dry, so I followed up with hyaluronic acid serum.  I never did note any peeling, and I didn&#x27;t have any redness, but in the days to follow I did notice that my skin seemed a bit brighter.  The next time I left it on for 5 minutes, because my face is pretty tough.  This time I felt a bit more tingling and I did have a bit of flaking.  My skin looks much brighter over all, and it seemed like it lightened my faded freckles up even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product and will continue to use it until I find that sweet spot of time that&#x27;s just right for me.  I can see where this treatment does help skin to look younger and more clear.  I haven&#x27;t had any real progress with fine lines, but I can tell the potential is there and will happen with time and more treatments.  There&#x27;s enough in the bottle for MANY treatments.  It only takes a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I recommend it, along with a good hyaluronic serum to follow the treatments.</li>
            <li> I must say I have never used a chemical peel before. So i expected my skin to be kind of raw and red after using. I was completely wrong. I had a huge function to go to. I needed my face to be fresh and amazing. I used this peel left it on for about 5 minutes and wow my face was so soft and refreshed! I put on my make up short after went to my function and got nothing but compliments the entire night!!! Amazing product I will be buying again and i completely recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Not only is this a GREAT product....this is a GREAT company.  After placing my order they emailed me and suggested that since I have not done a chemical peel at home a use a slightly milder product. hen sent me detailed easy to follow instructions to get the maximum benefit.  The peel is very easy to use and after the first use I noticed a healthier glow to my skin and diminished fine lines. I am counting down the days to be able to apply my next treatment! Looking forward to the new year with a new youthful glow!</li>
            <li> I was very happy to receive this in exchange for my honest review.  I have never used a Face Peel before, so I was a bit nervous about trying this, but I was happy with my other Carbon Skincare products, so I gave it a try.  I use this about 3 nights a week before bed followed by my favorite serum and moisturizer, and have noticed how soft my skin is feeling.  I am sure with extended use of the Carbon serum, that it may even repair some of my newly forming fine lines. I also love how it removes the dead skin cells, and it has no smell.&lt;br /&gt;So if you have never tried a peel before, this is a great one to start with, as it did not leave my skin red or irritated afterwards.</li>
            <li> Just a tip - If you do order this watch your email for the instructions that should be emailed to you. There are no instructions that come with the product. I get so many emails and so much spam I don&#x27;t know if I ever got the email so I searched online for instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found these instructions online:&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your face is clean, then wipe it off with an astringent like witch hazel or sea breeze. Buy a &amp;#34;fan&amp;#34; shaped cosmetic brush and get 2 ceramic bowls. In one bowl place a few dropper fulls of the glycolic acid. In the other bowl mix up a paste of baking soda and water. Apply the glycolic acid with the cosmetic brush to your face in a thin layer, taking care not to place it too close to your eyes or lips. Immediately start timing the application. If you are new to using it start with only 2 or 3 minutes with the glycolic acid on your face. As soon as the time is up, place the baking soda and water paste on your face to neutralize. Then rinse with lots of water. Follow up with a soothing face cream or aloe Vera for hydration. Avoid retinols, harsh face products and sunlight without sunscreen for a week. Don&#x27;t use the peel any more often than every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be helpful if simple instructions were included with the product.</li>
            <li> Nice results after 1st try!  Got a bit of a tingle going for the first couple of minutes, then took off after 10 minutes, followed with the baking soda/water neutralizing solution (as in instructional email).  Very nice customer service.  Will buy again for sure!  :-)</li>
            <li> One star because it does actually tingle. Other than that, nothing. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> This face peel is amazing, i used it it combination with a face serum from this same company, I could see a noticeable difference in my skin tone being softer and a renewed brightness in the overall appearance of my face, will be purchasing more of this product in the near future and working my way to new and higher strengths .</li>
            <li> This was my first chemical peel. I have never even had one at a salon. After one use my face feels amazing! It wasn&#x27;t harsh which is great for those who have sensitive skin. The packing is nice and simple while still looking like a good quality product. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars was becuse it didn&#x27;t come with instructions. Although they are available online or via email, I would prefer a paper copy that I can keep in the box to ensure proper use. The words chemical peel when referring to your face can be a little intimidating, so having handy instructions to make sure I&#x27;m using the product right is preferred.</li>
            <li> I am trying to work on my aging skin. I decided to get the Glycolic Acid 30% peel by Carbon Skincare. Here&#x27;s what I think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* no ill after affects like redness&lt;br /&gt;* easy to apply to clean skin&lt;br /&gt;* dropper included for convenient application&lt;br /&gt;* 30% Glycolic Acid&lt;br /&gt;* cruelty free&lt;br /&gt;* made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying this for three weeks. I really decided to wait and post an accurate review. I have acne scars both old and relatively new ones. This peel has definately evened out my skin tone. I have seen significant lessening of my red scars. I believe over all my skin looks less dull. I am pleased with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly believe this was cheaper and far more convenient than going to a dermatologist or esthetician for treatments. I definitely recommend this product and believe it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for a discount or was given it complementary in exchange for my honest unbiased review. All of the opinions expressed here are solely my own.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once and I have a few more days to use it the second time. I am a first time user and following instructions to the T. I can say I have noticed any difference just yet, so will keep you all posted after my second peel.. Giving a 3 star from prompt service and the instruction manual</li>
            <li> This is great product! 30 % acid is not too strong to irritate your skin but strong enough to give you a youthful glow. I usually use it at night once a week for 4-5 minutes and then follow with the Hyaluronic Acid Anti-Aging Facial Serum to cool off my face. The result? Smooth naturally glowing face. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Stuff is fake it&#x27;s supose to burn left if on my face for 30 min nothing happend</li>
            <li> I received this product and couldnt get it out of the package fast enough I was so excited to try it. Although I&#x27;ve never used a peel before it was really easy to do especially after being emailed  the instructions from the company, I did exactly what they said using 2 bowls one with the Glycolic Acid and one bowl with a paste made with baking soda and water.I used a fan brush to put a layer of acid on my face and left it on 2 minutes, I did feel a ltttle tingly sensation but nothing extreme, I rinsed it off and put the baking soda paste on and rinsed really good with warm water, My face felt and looked amazing when I was done, I am totally impressed with this product from carbon and will definalty be ordering more products along with more of the glycolic acid face peel from this company, I highly recommend and cant wait to do it again  I recieved this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion and truley love it</li>
            <li> Glycolic acid works by sloughing off the dead skins cells, it efficiently helps control abnormal keratinization (the abnormal build up of skin cells), This build up may cause various skin conditions, such as acne, oily skin, scaling, hardening of the outer layer. Glycolic acid helps control acne, or problem prone skin disorders by properly exfoliating dead skin cells. Efficient sloughing of the skin cells also helps alleviate the effects and appearance of Hyperpigmentation. Because I&#x27;m an Esthetician, I was very excited to use this brand and see how well it works. I&#x27;ve only used it once thus far for 5 minutes ( I started higher cause I&#x27;m in the profession and I use peels on the regular) and so far my skin is smoother, clearer, even, and happy. I can&#x27;t wait to see my results after 6 weeks. I will update my review than! And on a side note: chemical peels will most likely make you break out, and THIS is a good thing. It means it&#x27;s working, getting all that gunk out, so please don&#x27;t panic, this is a good sign!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion &#x27; &#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;Great Amazon Reviewers</li>
            <li> Good for in between visits to your skin care specialist.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  The peel makes my skin look new.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This 30% glycolic acid peel is gentle, and left my skin smooth and glowing.  I&#x27;m no stranger to peels; I know what my skin can handle, and I left it on for fifteen minutes. If you&#x27;re new to these at home peels, I&#x27;d recommend starting with five minutes to see how your skin reacts.  This peel is mild enough to use a couple of times a week, and it&#x27;s everything the manufacturer says it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no fragrance, and the solution comes in a dark blue dropper top bottle.  You only need a dropper full for a thin coat on face and neck.  After applying, there&#x27;s a little tingle.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant; it just lets you know the product is working.  The results are immediate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s safe to plan to use this the same day you want to look your best for an important event; it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin red or raw, just refreshed.  I&#x27;d recommend using a hyurolonic oil or heavy-duty moisturizer afterwards.  Good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received for review.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter she loved it ! It has helped with her acne scares👍🏻</li>
            <li> It is a very good product, but I need something a little stronger; therefore, I ordered the Jessner Peel. I think this is good for people with sensitive skin. I like the accessibility of the company. I did not need to contact them, but the literature that you download has all contact information on it. The company states that it is there for any questions or concerns. This is my company of choice. I ordered the Jessner Peel from this company.</li>
            <li> i love chemical peels and this one did not disappoint ,left my skin feel tighter and help clear up some my adult acne,great deal for a chemical peel ,and if your a first time user always read instructions</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this was the first acid peel I used. It didn&#x27;t make me peel, but it does have an affect you can feel. I usually only put it on for a minute before neutralizing. So far so good...skin breaks out less and the scars fade faster. I plan to use it weekly.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I also use the lactic peel 30%&lt;br /&gt;Made a difference in my skin, pores and marks.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Great product. I was definitely nervous at first but the Peel was gentle. I stared off at 2 minutes then worked my way up to about 10. I apply it every other week but it&#x27;s safe to do once a week.  I have been using the peel for about 5 months and it has reduced my acne and scarring by about 50%. I am very grateful that i was able to come across this product. It takes patience and you have to follow the directions carefully. Trust me, it does wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li> Item was returned because after almost a month (and many attempts by me) instructions for use were never received.</li>
            <li> This face peel by Carbon Skincare is amazing! I love it! Though I did have some reservations about using it at first, but that quickly subsided with my first use! I have Rosacea which is reddening of the skin so I thought this product might help. The first time I used it I left it on for only a couple of minutes to see how my skin would react.  Now, a few days later, I leave it on for 10 minutes. It has left my skin clearer, softer, and most of all, brighter! The 30% Glycolic Acid is gentle and works by sluffing off old, dead skin leaving you with renewed skin! It comes with all the instructions you will need to utilize this great product. I will continue using this product for it&#x27;s fast results and effectiveness! **I recieved this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I have dry but oily skin this seems to help moisturize deeper and last longer without feeling oily</li>
            <li> Came without instructions.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I will buy again! Skin is brighter, smoother, dark spots are gone. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it! The peel works just as well as the ones done at a spa, at a fraction of the cost. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My face looked shiny after using this serum. It really is working well. It contains glycolic acid that is the key ingredient in this serum that makes the skin smooth and helps reducing wrinkles. Really pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> Works very well for my combination skin! Exfoliates, smooths, and lightens dark spots.</li>
