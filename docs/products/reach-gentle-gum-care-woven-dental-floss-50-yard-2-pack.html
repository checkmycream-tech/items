    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best floss ever.</li>
            <li>My dental hygenist thinks it is the best dental floss out.</li>
            <li>The product is wonderful but 2 rolls of floss for $45 is a ripoff.  </li>
            <li>but it works great and does not hurt...</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant peppermint-like taste.</li>
            <li>I assume that it&#x27;s this feature that makes for the reported superior cleaning ability.  </li>
            <li>What it didn&#x27;t do, by the way, which is a good point, is fray or break.  </li>
            <li>this makes flossing painless and cool :D</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled I can still get the woven kind via Amazon!</li>
            <li>I like the woven kind.</li>
            <li>Also the most effective, evidenced by my hygienist&#x27;s approval every 6 months.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite dental floss as it&#x27;s a woven material, has fluoride and is really effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I got this because my dentist told me it was better than wax</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>There is nothing better, more soothing, more comfy...</li>
            <li>My favorite floss, it is woven so</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I love it...</li>
            <li>This floss does a much better job of getting food out from between my teeth than anything else.  </li>
            <li>Love this floss...</li>
            <li>and most floss does not work well.</li>
            <li>I like it because the woven fibers do their job, and also are better for tooth</li>
            <li>I WILL BUY PLENTY MORE.</li>
            <li>I love the thickness of the floss (two pieces interwoven), and the minty burst is an added bonus.</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, but cleans effectively!</li>
            <li>still enjoy wax floss</li>
            <li>Found this some years ago and really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>It is coated with fluoride which is important to me to ward off cavities.</li>
            <li>Available for about $2.99.</li>
            <li>It came apart right out of the package and it never stayed &#x27;put together&#x27; despite my many Herculean efforts to fix the situation.  </li>
            <li>Medium strong \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; #490; &amp; Thick #630 ~ all fast easy flossing streamlined woven fibers I no longer avoid, yay! :D</li>
            <li>I use it every night and my teeth are so clean.</li>
            <li>I was crushed when the poison fluoride-free version of this formerly favorite floss was discontinued...until its forcing me to try others helped me find even better floss!</li>
            <li>AND IT I SUN-WAXED AND TASTES FRESH AND CLEAN.  </li>
            <li>It is super minty</li>
            <li>My teeth aren&#x27;t, for the most part, particularly close together, but I did find that the woven-ness eventually got flattened out.  </li>
            <li>so I guess it&#x27;ll work better on the tartar better than the traditional ones.</li>
            <li>It was $45 for a case of 12 packs of floss and when it arrived it was 2 packages of floss worth $2.49/ea.</li>
            <li>The seller wasn&#x27;t clear how many rolls of floss are in a package and I will not deal with this seller again.</li>
            <li>Does not slide right over the plaque as Glide does.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really, really minty with sweet tones and it leaves my mouth feeling fresher than even toothpaste</li>
            <li>The original dental floss, P.O.H. (Personal Oral Hygiene), available on Amazon cheaper than mfr (except</li>
            <li>I first discovered this floss when my dentist used it</li>
            <li>And when it disappeared from my local drugstores I did try most of the alternatives and none worked as well.  </li>
            <li>and i can see how the thick soft material could be more effective at getting stuff out from between teeth.</li>
            <li>My periodontist told me to use this floss and no other: it really does the job much more effectively than the usual floss, which seems akin to sewing thread.</li>
            <li>If this is the case, then it&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;ll have to use more floss than normal to maintain that cleaning edge.  </li>

            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve decided that I really like this floss.  </li>
            <li>This one cleans well and doesn&#x27;t bother my gums much.</li>

            <li>every one who tries it seems to love it.</li>
            <li>It is the only one that fits between my closely-space teeth, effectively cleans under my gums and the bits that get stuck, all without any pain or bleeding from needing to repeatedly target the same area.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion it is way better than any other floss I have tried.</li>
            <li>Woven floss is gentle on the gums, but it also works like a soft cleaning cloth, clearing film from teeth below the gum line.</li>
            <li>so it is important that you floss carefully</li>
            <li>If your teeth are very tightly spaced Glide might be a better floss.</li>
            <li>its slightly wider than traditional floss and in my experience does a better job of being both gentle and removing food particles.</li>
            <li>I really hope that the prices drop way back down, because this floss is effective and simple to use</li>

            <li> In fact, what I ended up doing is using the cutting edge on the children&#x27;s Reach floss container.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, J&amp;J reintroduced this floss with the Listerine name, and put cinnamon in it!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> There is now no dental floss brand that includes fluoride. The &amp;#34;Listerine Gentle Gum Care&amp;#34; that is supposed to be the same is not. Cinnamon is not fluoride.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by the dentist. It doesn&#x27;t cut my gums, like others do. I really like it. The price in store is $3.49 (vs. $3.90 on amazon). I gave it 4 stars, not five, since it&#x27;s still cheaper to buy at the local store.</li>
            <li> I find that this floss is so much gentler than regular or waxed floss. It is super minty and I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
            <li> Bought a bunch of these when I could not find it in the store. The packaging is different from the original - the silkscreenng is not the same, cheaper looking, the product number 032297 is different,. the floss looks slightly different. -  I do not think that this product is the same as Johnson and Johnson Reach 723448.</li>
            <li> I got this because my dentist told me it was better than wax floss.&lt;br /&gt;I still enjoy wax floss, I guess old habits die hard, but this is gentler on your teeth and i can see how the thick soft material could be more effective at getting stuff out from between teeth.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this floss when my dentist used it and I love it. It is gentle, but cleans effectively!</li>
            <li> Works well. My dentist recommended it. The only disadvantage in this product in my view is that it is not widely available in my Los Angeles area. I had to go on line to get it</li>
            <li> I am out !!! There is no place online or in-store that has it!!!&lt;br /&gt;This happened last year and I bought like 15 of them...&lt;br /&gt;I floss every day... a LOT... like maybe 3-4 times..&lt;br /&gt;I need this floss!! :&#x27;( There is nothing better, more soothing, more comfy... this makes flossing painless and cool :D</li>
            <li> I have been using this floss for years.  It is the only one that fits between my closely-space teeth, effectively cleans under my gums and the bits that get stuck, all without any pain or bleeding from needing to repeatedly target the same area.  I use it at least twice a day and actually look forward to using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I want to know is why the price has skyrocketed?????  It used to be a typical price, and when it went on sale at a nearby store or I found an online coupon, I stocked up.  Well, I just ran out and popped online and it seems the cheapest I can find it is now at least TEN TIMES the previous cost!!  I really hope that the prices drop way back down, because this floss is effective and simple to use, it is comfortable, and every time I go for my cleaning, my hygienist tells me how little plaque I have thanks to my thorough flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring the price back down and I give it two thumbs and a mouthful of pearly whites up!</li>
            <li> Woven floss is gentle on the gums, but it also works like a soft cleaning cloth, clearing film from teeth below the gum line.</li>
            <li> My favorite floss, it is woven so its slightly wider than traditional floss and in my experience does a better job of being both gentle and removing food particles. If your teeth are very tightly spaced Glide might be a better floss.</li>
            <li> I have to say that it&#x27;s a mixed message when it comes to this floss.  On the up side it&#x27;s really, really minty with sweet tones and it leaves my mouth feeling fresher than even toothpaste does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside however, the dispenser is horrible.  It came apart right out of the package and it never stayed &#x27;put together&#x27; despite my many Herculean efforts to fix the situation.  In fact, what I ended up doing is using the cutting edge on the children&#x27;s Reach floss container.  So down point on that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as far as the floss, it&#x27;s loosely woven.  I assume that it&#x27;s this feature that makes for the reported superior cleaning ability.  If this is the case, then it&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;ll have to use more floss than normal to maintain that cleaning edge.  My teeth aren&#x27;t, for the most part, particularly close together, but I did find that the woven-ness eventually got flattened out.  What it didn&#x27;t do, by the way, which is a good point, is fray or break.  You know, the way some flosses fray and then sub-strands get stuck between your teeth.  This Reach floss did not do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve decided that I really like this floss.  It&#x27;s a pain to cut, but the minty flavor and floride have sold me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam T~</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Why on earth is it discontinued? It&#x27;s the best floss ever. I use it every night and my teeth are so clean.</li>
            <li> I like the woven kind. Other kinds tend to either not work well, or hurt. This one cleans well and doesn&#x27;t bother my gums much.</li>
            <li> My periodontist told me to use this floss and no other: it really does the job much more effectively than the usual floss, which seems akin to sewing thread. But then it does cost twice the price....</li>
            <li> I have used this Dental Floss for quite some time and I love it...although it is not as thin as the regular ones so it is important that you floss carefully but it works great and does not hurt...I wouldn&#x27;t change it for another one...</li>
            <li> This floss does a much better job of getting food out from between my teeth than anything else.  And when it disappeared from my local drugstores I did try most of the alternatives and none worked as well.  I&#x27;m thrilled I can still get the woven kind via Amazon!</li>

            <li> This is the only floss that does not get caught between my teeth (as long as you keep sliding it to a dry section for each tooth). Also the most effective, evidenced by my hygienist&#x27;s approval every 6 months. It was in short supply due to J &amp; J&#x27;s slowdown in production but now it is back. It is near impossible to find at local stores, so Amazon is the place to get it. Love this floss... By the way, I do not own stock in the company- yet. Does not slide right over the plaque as Glide does.</li>
            <li> Pricey but works the way it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li> There was no fluoride in the dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;It was returned</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dental floss as it&#x27;s a woven material, has fluoride and is really effective and easy to use.  The dispenser also works well without corruption.</li>
            <li> I am a senior. Lots of space between my teeth. and most floss does not work well. Found this some years ago and really enjoy using it. It is thick enough to work well and still fits between my teeth, and the mint flavor is nice.</li>
            <li> Does have a slight abrasive coating so I guess it&#x27;ll work better on the tartar better than the traditional ones.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find this product in the store anymore.  I like it because the woven fibers do their job, and also are better for tooth caps-- the fibers break rather than accidentally pull off a cap.</li>
            <li> TRY FLOSSING WITH A RUBBER BAND.....THAT IS WHAT DENTAL FLOSS NOWADAYS IS LIKE.  IT IS MESSY AND DOES NOT CLEAN VERY WELL, I THINK.  THIS STUFF IS COTTON WOVEN WITH NYLON AND GETS ALL THE PLAQUE OUT BENEATH THE TEETH. AND IT I SUN-WAXED AND TASTES FRESH AND CLEAN.  I CANNOT FIND IT AT ANY OF THE SOTRES NEAR ME.  I WILL BUY PLENTY MORE.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, J&amp;J reintroduced this floss with the Listerine name, and put cinnamon in it! How stupid.</li>
            <li> This floss is actually a couple of soft threads twisted (woven) together. It has a pleasant peppermint-like taste. It is coated with fluoride which is important to me to ward off cavities. It is gentle on gums, cleans well &amp; does not shred.&lt;br /&gt;But if you have tight-contact teeth it might be tricky to use even if you stretch it to thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not easily excited by dental products, but this definitely is definitely a full-tooth grin. I love the thickness of the floss (two pieces interwoven), and the minty burst is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I was crushed when the poison fluoride-free version of this formerly favorite floss was discontinued...until its forcing me to try others helped me find even better floss! The original dental floss, P.O.H. (Personal Oral Hygiene), available on Amazon cheaper than mfr (except refills) inc fluoride-free &amp; wax-free (dentist advises v. wax build up) versions in 3 strengths: Super thin strong #420; Medium strong \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; #490; &amp; Thick #630 ~ all fast easy flossing streamlined woven fibers I no longer avoid, yay! :D</li>
            <li> I have been told by a couple different dentist&#x27;s that this is their preferred floss. I love it and will continue to buy it. In my opinion it is way better than any other floss I have tried.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist thinks it is the best dental floss out.</li>
            <li> J&amp;J rebranded this product.  It&#x27;s now called &amp;#34;LISTERINE Gentle Gum Care&amp;#34;.  Available for about $2.99.</li>
            <li> ask your dentist for a sample if you&#x27;ve never tried it. every one who tries it seems to love it.</li>
            <li> Complete bust!  It was $45 for a case of 12 packs of floss and when it arrived it was 2 packages of floss worth $2.49/ea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a total ripoff.  The product is wonderful but 2 rolls of floss for $45 is a ripoff.  The seller wasn&#x27;t clear how many rolls of floss are in a package and I will not deal with this seller again.</li>
