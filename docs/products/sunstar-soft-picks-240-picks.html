            <li>What I love is these are as effective as floss if you maintain a cleaning schedule with your dentist.</li>
            <li>And these are certainly more effective than toothpicks - and probably safer as well when it comes to gums.</li>
            <li>They are more effective if it&#x27;s been a while since you have had a dental visit.</li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>What more can one ask for in a dental pick?</li>
            <li>she likes them better than dental floss.  </li>
            <li>Indeed, that makes them a pleasure to use if your gums are in healthy condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I end up with more problems than I care to mention.  </li>
            <li>These are much better.</li>
            <li>what a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps your bridges and in between your teeth nice and clean.</li>
            <li>They help keep the space between your teeth nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>This may not seem important, but many times food stuck between teeth (in a food trap)</li>
            <li>It feels better to clean vs toothpick but can cuz some bleed</li>
            <li>I love this product because it is so handy to be able to clear any food lodged between my teeth.</li>
            <li>the bristles work beautifully in cleaning between my teeth, especially on the occasions when I cannot brush after meals.</li>
            <li>After trying the sample provided by my hygienist, I realized that they would do the trick just fine.  </li>
            <li>The are convenient and comfortable.</li>
            <li>They work great for between regular teeth too.  </li>
            <li>Far superior to dental floss.</li>
            <li>I have been using these picks for years to clean a bridge but also to floss when away from home.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a substitute for brushing and flossing, but it does help clean the area between the teeth - in the gap - thougoughly.</li>
            <li>While I still use Stimudents, these are excellent for those hard to reach places!</li>
            <li>These are great for cleaning the little space between your teeth.</li>
            <li>I carry in my pocketbook and use right after eating.  </li>
            <li>Works better than wooden dental picks</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of flossing but I am motivated to use these picks because they are easier to use than floss and they feel like they are doing the job better ....</li>
            <li>A healthy mouth means teeth that last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not rough on your gums and can fit into even the tightest spaces because they&#x27;re flexible.</li>
            <li>Works very well in combination with brushing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I found these too work really well as toothpicks.  </li>
            <li>It really gets between your teeth and gumline.</li>
            <li>These are available in a drug store or WalMart, but rarely in a big package, which is why I buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t think that would be very sanitary.</li>
            <li>If you have a food trap, these will help clean the entire area as you remove the food.  </li>
            <li>These help clean the area thougoughly - beyond what even basic brushing and flossing can do.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I find the picks bend so easily when using, but my teeth are very close, which makes this item more difficult to use.  </li>
            <li>These are gentle on the gums, and they do get in between tight spaces and remove debris easily.</li>
            <li>Today I can&#x27;t live without a plastic box (which comes with the Picks) in my pocket.</li>
            <li>You get 240 soft picks and</li>
            <li>The bristles quickly wear down and they lose their effectiveness after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>soft pick will suffice for an entire after meal cleaning or routine flossing.</li>
            <li>They are made of soft enough material that I don&#x27;t feel like I am hurting my gums.</li>
            <li>One reviewer wrote that they are too soft to be durable, but I only use them once, so I don&#x27;t know if they could last longer.</li>
            <li>No excuse now for not flossing after eating!</li>
            <li>The size of this package is also higher count and less cost than at my local stores.</li>
            <li>I only gave them 4 stars, as some of these seem a bit weak, and they bend and/or break fairly easily.  </li>

            <li> Great product for dental hygiene at home and on the go...travel cases included! Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> You get 240 soft picks and what a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps your bridges and in between your teeth nice and clean.</li>

            <li> Great. Almost as effective as flossing and much better than toothpicks. The size of this package is also higher count and less cost than at my local stores.</li>
            <li> Far superior to dental floss.</li>
            <li> I found these too work really well as toothpicks.  If you have a food trap, these will help clean the entire area as you remove the food.  This may not seem important, but many times food stuck between teeth (in a food trap) starts to hurt as the tissue becomes inflamed.  These help clean the area thougoughly - beyond what even basic brushing and flossing can do.  It&#x27;s not a substitute for brushing and flossing, but it does help clean the area between the teeth - in the gap - thougoughly.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is so handy to be able to clear any food lodged between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been using Soft-Picks for years.  Today I can&#x27;t live without a plastic box (which comes with the Picks) in my pocket. Now I have those boxes all over my home.  Oh . . and they do get out the junk between my teeth.</li>
            <li> It feels better to clean vs toothpick but can cuz some bleed</li>
            <li> These little picks are a supplement to flossing &amp; brushing.  They help keep the space between your teeth nice and clean.  I bought them from amazon because they sell the multipacks which I can&#x27;t find at any local store.  The picks work great!</li>
            <li> I just got back from the dentist and was told that my use of these gave me teeth that had almost no tartar on them.  A healthy mouth means teeth that last a lifetime.  Guess I will keep buying these!</li>
            <li> they are great better than toothpicks.  I carry in my pocketbook and use right after eating.  It allows you not to be embarassed about using this tool at the table.  It really gets between your teeth and gumline.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal... buying from the pharmacy is 10 times more! !</li>
            <li> These are gentle on the gums, and they do get in between tight spaces and remove debris easily. What more can one ask for in a dental pick?</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist put me on to these...she likes them better than dental floss.  Though she still recommends using both.  I now use them every day...I&#x27;m sort of addicted to them!  To be clear, you run them between your teeth, down by the gums...just in and out a few times.  These are available in a drug store or WalMart, but rarely in a big package, which is why I buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a five pack of these and I have been using them ever since. What I love is these are as effective as floss if you maintain a cleaning schedule with your dentist. I mention that because if you have a build up of plaque these may not reach places they should whereas floss can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the bristles work beautifully in cleaning between my teeth, especially on the occasions when I cannot brush after meals. And these are certainly more effective than toothpicks - and probably safer as well when it comes to gums. Per claims they so, in fact, massage gums. Indeed, that makes them a pleasure to use if your gums are in healthy condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One soft pick will suffice for an entire after meal cleaning or routine flossing. They are &#x27;use once and discard&#x27; picks, so do not try to save a used one for a second flossing. The bristles quickly wear down and they lose their effectiveness after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: these are effective and work as advertised. If you need a good cleaning or periodontics work you may want to try [[ASIN:B00EZWSCPY Sunstar Gum Eez-Thru Flossers]] instead. They are more effective if it&#x27;s been a while since you have had a dental visit.</li>
            <li> The brush picks I was using before were larger and had harder bristles which hurt my gums. These are small enough to reach into all the spaces I need to reach. They are made of soft enough material that I don&#x27;t feel like I am hurting my gums. They still have bristles, though. One reviewer wrote that they are too soft to be durable, but I only use them once, so I don&#x27;t know if they could last longer. However, I don&#x27;t think that would be very sanitary. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> While I still use Stimudents, these are excellent for those hard to reach places!</li>
            <li> These picks work quite well for in between times.  My dentist and dental hygienist both recommended that I try these, especially for under bridge work.  After trying the sample provided by my hygienist, I realized that they would do the trick just fine.  If you have a hard time flossing under your bridges, these are very helpful.  They work great for between regular teeth too.  I have found that if I don&#x27;t floss (who likes flossing?), I end up with more problems than I care to mention.  So I use these during the day or while watching television or reading a book.  They are very handy.  I only gave them 4 stars, as some of these seem a bit weak, and they bend and/or break fairly easily.  I would definitely recommend these over regular toothpicks for anyone needing them for specific dental care</li>
            <li> Prior to using these &amp;#34;SOFT-PICKS&amp;#34; I used the hard plastic picks which I also obtained thru Amazon. These are much better.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I buy these picks to help reduce larger &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; in my gums.  I find the picks bend so easily when using, but my teeth are very close, which makes this item more difficult to use.  These have the smaller green tips... I can&#x27;t use the larger blue tip ones.</li>
            <li> These are great. They&#x27;re not rough on your gums and can fit into even the tightest spaces because they&#x27;re flexible. Each pack comes with a case, which is very handy. The kids can carrying picks in their pocket or purse when they&#x27;re on the go. No excuse now for not flossing after eating! The dentist has already commented on the improvement in their gums.</li>
            <li> These are great for cleaning the little space between your teeth. Doesn&#x27;t hurt. I recommend it</li>
