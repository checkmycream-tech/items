            <li>Nature&#x27;s gate makes some of the best products.</li>
            <li>The best lotion existing!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had an interest in trying others because it is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Very good for reflexology!</li>
            <li>Great for a lotion to use at night during the winter, but you&#x27;ll never get your jeans on after applying this stuff during the day!  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find great deals on multi-packs on amazon.com</li>
            <li>Why do they have to  \\&quot;improve\\&quot; products that worked great before and raise the price to boot?  </li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t cause you to sweat.</li>
            <li>I am sooooooo happy I found Nature&#x27;s Gate Moisturizing Lotion, I am planning to keep on using it forever.</li>
            <li>So happy to find this lotion on Amazon and buy in bulk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy after applying.</li>
            <li>Great lotion.</li>
            <li>This is truly a good product.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over 15 years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Now, on to the good.  </li>
            <li>why on earth they would change a good thing is beyond me</li>
            <li>Nice ingredients too.  </li>
            <li>This is nice.</li>
            <li>It is fairly good but there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s doing a nice job</li>
            <li>This is by far the best body lotion I have found.  </li>
            <li>It works, and it smells nice, but there has to be something better.</li>
            <li>It worked great, great consistency and left skin feeling silky UNTIL they changed it.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I am TOTALLY Happy with a body lotion.</li>
            <li>I need to moisten my hands, which seem to be drying out more and more as I age.  </li>
            <li>(okay, a bit of hyperbole but</li>
            <li>and hopefully that will help it absorb better.  </li>
            <li>It is virtually odorless (though for some reason my cat loves to wash it off my hands at night), has safe ingredients, and is not overly greasy.</li>
            <li>I can still feel the lotion on me as I rinse off, but it is not greasy at all or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for maybe a dozen years or more.  </li>
            <li>so it would absorb better.</li>
            <li>Most of the health store brands are still as toxic as the drug store brands.</li>
            <li>do have to rub it in for longer to make sure it absorbs, and to wash my hands after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>However, what I might add is that despite it saying fragrance-free, the lotion does have a smell to it and for this particular one its not that great of a scent at all in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Good value in buying two 3-packs with free super saver shipping.  </li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate Fragrance-Free Moisturizing Lotion for Sensitive Skin is great for hand lotion, as well as all over body</li>
            <li>and I am quite pleased with the fact that t is not greasy at all, fragrance free, ZERO chemicals (check cosmetics database) and works wonders even in coldest and harshest weather conditions.  </li>
            <li>Strongly dislike this lotion on my body.</li>
            <li>live in the desert and NEED a good moisturizer,</li>
            <li>and there is an odd pattern of many of them having changed their formulas and many people not being too happy about it.</li>
            <li>...dye free...</li>
            <li>Fragrance free is a must for me.  </li>
            <li>This product is quite simply fabulous.</li>
            <li>It was fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I liked the old one better.</li>
            <li>I loved the old lotion formula.  </li>
            <li>The cream does a very good job in moisturizing the body, also does not smell a lot compared to other brands</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the purchase which was priced somewhat higher than it had been at my store, but delivered promptly</li>
            <li>Their other lotions have a more pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The old formula was so much better!  </li>
            <li>My skin feels great and some rough patches I had are going</li>
            <li>And it really should absorb better than it does.</li>
            <li>I loved this lotion until recently.</li>
            <li>Loyal customer will seek another brand.  </li>
            <li>I have tried, many, many lotions with very mixed results / varying degrees of reaction to their contents.  </li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t completely scent free; there is a very light scent if you&#x27;re really scrutinizing things.  </li>
            <li>The only lotion of its kind</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my conclusion: yes, it&#x27;s thicker and gooier, but it smells the same (vaguely nicely oat-y)</li>
            <li>Delivered right to my house.</li>
            <li>For those of you who are sensitive to perfumes, who work or live with people who are, or just rather smell like another scent you are wearing, Nature&#x27;s Gate Fragrance-Free Moisturizing Lotion for Sensitive Skin is a great product for you.  </li>
            <li>and  exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that this lotion is paraben free and fragrance free (enough).  </li>
            <li>but I will try water at first.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am going back to Sephora Collection Supreme Body Lotion, it&#x27;s more expensive, but works great!</li>
            <li>Fragrance free is never really fragrance free.</li>
            <li>However it is not nearly as good as the original recipe which was my very favorite of all lotions.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free (a tiny odor at first and then zip)and not at all greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin nice and soft all day long.</li>
            <li>i have found that i tolerate it to a certain degree.  </li>
            <li>Spreads very well</li>
            <li>And at a price much cheaper than what the grocery stores sold it for, here, before they discontinued it.</li>
            <li>- something like that to warn people because this is just too much.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t absorb  at all and leaves a sticky residue, so much it stick to your clothes.</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t really care.  </li>
            <li>I am diligently trying to buy only household items that are fragrance free</li>
            <li>This lotion is very benign, and my skinseems to take to it well; no breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Only one word to describe this product: FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>such that are toxin free</li>
            <li>The lotion leaves streaks unless you really work to rub it in.</li>
            <li>and it really does moisturize very well.</li>
            <li>I have tried many lotions (including conventional products that contain parabens and whatnot)</li>
            <li>But nothing else really worked, so I shelled out for a new bottle.</li>
            <li>I am just grateful they still make a decent non toxic lotion.  </li>
            <li>I used to love this lotion and used it for many years, but recently they changed the formula and now it is so thick that it cannot even be spread!</li>
            <li>I loved the old formula, and was hesitant to get more when my bottle ran out, due to poor reviews of the new formula here.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy, while moisturizing my 53 yr old skin very well.</li>
            <li>It is rare to find a lotion that is this low in toxins.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nature&#x27;s Gate products can sometimes be found in your local grocery, drug, or health food store, but you will be paying top dollar for a single item.</li>
            <li>The formula seemed to change when the new label was introduced.</li>
            <li>while i agree with others about the consistency of the lotion and the new formula of the product i have continued to use it out of necessity.  </li>
            <li>While EWG doesn&#x27;t have the new formulation in the database, I checked every ingredient and they are all 0 except for 2 at the end of the ingredients list that are 2.</li>
            <li>thought I could get by with the new formula, but after a couple months of using it, I&#x27;ve decided to look for another brand.</li>
            <li>what i do is pour some in a previously outgassed lotion bottle and mix it with purified water and shake it up real well thus diluting it significantly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to smell and this one has an odor now.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this lotion for years, and decided to order it online for the first time to save money over local store prices.</li>
            <li>I really liked the previous formula as it was clean smelling and not so thick greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically have to reapply during the day, as the moisturizing effects seem to last a bit longer than most</li>
            <li>Let me quickly verify a couple of things from the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it is fragrance-free for sensitive skin, has \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients, and does not use animals for testing which is the reason for a \\&quot;2\\&quot; thumb-down rating.</li>
            <li>i use it because I am chemically sensitive.  </li>
            <li>also chemically sensitive</li>
            <li>No mineral oi ensures no blocked pores, and soft, soft skin.</li>
            <li>I wish Nature&#x27;s Gate would return to the old recipe.  </li>
            <li>This lotion does not rub in as well or keep my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>Made with quality natural ingredients by a trusted company.  </li>
            <li>The old formulation of this lotion was a 5 or 6 (out of 10)on the EWG database for toxicity.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t mind the extra effort as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with it until I hear of something better, at least.</li>
            <li>A small amount of this lotion goes a long way, and blends into the skin nicely, without any sticky or greasy</li>
            <li>Nice and thick and lasting.</li>
            <li>by contrast, plain old vaseline brand intensive care lotion goes on light and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>I like Nature&#x27;s gate fragrance free lotion, but due shipping or handling or packaging issue, one of the bottle has lotion leakage all over the outside of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>my experience is very similar to others here with the new formula.</li>
            <li>The product was familiar to me but not available anymore at my local stores.  </li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate, please bring back the old lotion.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product EVER that keeps my skin soft and moisturized until I go to take a shower.</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado, suffer from very dry skin, and this is the only product that keeps me sane.  </li>

            <li> I have been using this lotion for years, and decided to order it online for the first time to save money over local store prices.</li>
            <li> I really liked the previous formula as it was clean smelling and not so thick greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically have to reapply during the day, as the moisturizing effects seem to last a bit longer than most</li>
            <li> Let me quickly verify a couple of things from the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is fragrance-free for sensitive skin, has \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients, and does not use animals for testing which is the reason for a \\&quot;2\\&quot; thumb-down rating.</li>
            <li> i use it because I am chemically sensitive.  </li>
            <li> also chemically sensitive</li>
            <li> No mineral oi ensures no blocked pores, and soft, soft skin.</li>
            <li> I wish Nature&#x27;s Gate would return to the old recipe.  </li>
            <li> This lotion does not rub in as well or keep my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> Made with quality natural ingredients by a trusted company.  </li>
            <li> The old formulation of this lotion was a 5 or 6 (out of 10)on the EWG database for toxicity.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mind the extra effort as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with it until I hear of something better, at least.</li>
            <li> A small amount of this lotion goes a long way, and blends into the skin nicely, without any sticky or greasy</li>
            <li> Nice and thick and lasting.</li>
            <li> by contrast, plain old vaseline brand intensive care lotion goes on light and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> I like Nature&#x27;s gate fragrance free lotion, but due shipping or handling or packaging issue, one of the bottle has lotion leakage all over the outside of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> my experience is very similar to others here with the new formula.</li>
            <li> The product was familiar to me but not available anymore at my local stores.  </li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate, please bring back the old lotion.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product EVER that keeps my skin soft and moisturized until I go to take a shower.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado, suffer from very dry skin, and this is the only product that keeps me sane.  </li>
            <li> used this product for years and loved it until the last batch arrived &#x27;New Improved&#x27; and HATED it ... fails to absorb into the skin and leaves a white greasy film ... now using another moisturizer and would recommend that this particular product be left alone until Natures Gate reverts back to the original pre improved product ...</li>
            <li> Does moisturize well, but very heavy and does not absorb very well -</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a long time.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to find a lotion I like.  </li>
            <li> It also feels sticky on your skin long after you have applied it.  </li>
            <li> That it has an odd odor is the only problem, almost like it is fermented.  </li>
            <li> I wish it were a more lightweight lotion or at least that it were advertised as a heavy lotion for serious skin dryness etc.  </li>
            <li> When you apply, it might look like white coating but let it dry a few seconds</li>
            <li> It is also FAR too thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> I like a lot of other nature gates products, but not this one.</li>
            <li> (perhaps due to the thickness and lack of any alcohol in the ingredient list).  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is the scent.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a thin residue where the moisturizer didn&#x27;t absorb completely.</li>
            <li> , if you are like me, cold weather and constant hand washing can leave your hands and knuckles chapped and sensitive to some of the perfumes and dyes in other lotions.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is thick, and takes a little extra work to rub the lotion in fully.  </li>
            <li> This had less slip/glide than the hemp lotion.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles arrived with a piece broken off the pump and had leaked slightly, but I plan to switch it with the pump from my current bottle.</li>
            <li> But this lotion is NOT cheap.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like the residue left behind on my skin.</li>
            <li> The hand pump sometimes is difficult to open and it gets clogged.</li>
            <li> not sure what to use</li>
            <li> It is hard to rub into your skin.  </li>
            <li> It goes on thick and sticks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also thick and doesn&#x27;t go on well.  </li>
            <li> This is just too thick</li>
            <li> but its full of all those nasty chemicals etc.  </li>
            <li> I HATE the new formula&#x27;s smell and don&#x27;t like the thickness.  </li>
            <li> I am trying to thin it out</li>
            <li> The lotion is so thick now that the pump dispenser fails to work.</li>
            <li> The homemade stuff has either been very expensive to buy or when I tried to make it was just a mess.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds of something like someone&#x27;s nasty personal smell.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, Nature&#x27;s Gate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate big corporations that dont give a crap about us.......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m desperately trying to find another lotion</li>
            <li> But I hate scented lotions.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;new\\&quot; formula is awful</li>
            <li> It is horrible for me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product was familiar to me but not available anymore at my local stores.  I was pleased with the purchase which was priced somewhat higher than it had been at my store, but delivered promptly and  exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a long time. It seems recently they changed the formula. I liked the old one better. The hand pump sometimes is difficult to open and it gets clogged.</li>
            <li> That it has an odd odor is the only problem, almost like it is fermented.  Perhaps a \\&quot;vintage\\&quot; batch was sent.</li>
            <li> This is truly a good product. Spreads very well but it&#x27;s not watery. Nice and thick and lasting. The only complaint is the scent. Fragrance free is never really fragrance free. The smell didn&#x27;t bother me, but you may not care for it. Overall I will buy again. Maybe this time w/fragrance.</li>
            <li> Another great Nature&#x27;s Gate product! For those of you who are sensitive to perfumes, who work or live with people who are, or just rather smell like another scent you are wearing, Nature&#x27;s Gate Fragrance-Free Moisturizing Lotion for Sensitive Skin is a great product for you.  A small amount of this lotion goes a long way, and blends into the skin nicely, without any sticky or greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are like me, cold weather and constant hand washing can leave your hands and knuckles chapped and sensitive to some of the perfumes and dyes in other lotions.  Nature&#x27;s Gate Fragrance-Free Moisturizing Lotion for Sensitive Skin is great for hand lotion, as well as all over body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nature&#x27;s Gate products can sometimes be found in your local grocery, drug, or health food store, but you will be paying top dollar for a single item. I was happy to find great deals on multi-packs on amazon.com</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 15 years and loved it.  Why the marginal review?  The \\&quot;new\\&quot; formula is awful (preferred the \\&quot;old\\&quot; formula; obviously, I used it for years).  It goes on thick and sticks.  It is hard to rub into your skin.  Yes, it is fragrance-free for sensitive skin, has \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients, and does not use animals for testing which is the reason for a \\&quot;2\\&quot; thumb-down rating. I would suggest not wasting your money and trying something else.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best body lotion I have found.  I have tried many lotions (including conventional products that contain parabens and whatnot) and this beats them all.  I live in Colorado, suffer from very dry skin, and this is the only product that keeps me sane.  Excellent.</li>
            <li> I like a lot of other nature gates products, but not this one. It is horrible for me.It does not moisturize. It sits on the skin, does not absorb, and leaves a matte finish on my skin. I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> The only lotion of its kind I know of, that is fragrance-free. And at a price much cheaper than what the grocery stores sold it for, here, before they discontinued it. I use it on my face for wind and sunburn, and after washing my face, every time.</li>
            <li> I used to love this lotion and used it for many years, but recently they changed the formula and now it is so thick that it cannot even be spread! It takes forever to absorb and meanwhile, you can&#x27;t put your clothes on because your skin is all white. Nature&#x27;s Gate, please bring back the old lotion.</li>
            <li> I need to moisten my hands, which seem to be drying out more and more as I age.  But I hate scented lotions.  This stuff works great and it does not have an odor!</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that this lotion is paraben free and fragrance free (enough).  But this lotion is NOT cheap.  And it really should absorb better than it does. It is also FAR too thick and creamy.  I don&#x27;t want to feel like I just put vaseline on my hands (okay, a bit of hyperbole but you get the point).  I wish it were a more lightweight lotion or at least that it were advertised as a heavy lotion for serious skin dryness etc.  - something like that to warn people because this is just too much.  I am trying to thin it out and hopefully that will help it absorb better.  not sure what to use but I will try water at first.   by contrast, plain old vaseline brand intensive care lotion goes on light and absorbs well.  but its full of all those nasty chemicals etc.  sigh......I hate big corporations that dont give a crap about us.......</li>
            <li> I loved this lotion until recently. i use it because I am chemically sensitive.  It worked great, great consistency and left skin feeling silky UNTIL they changed it.  The lotion is so thick now that the pump dispenser fails to work. Doesn&#x27;t absorb  at all and leaves a sticky residue, so much it stick to your clothes. Loyal customer will seek another brand.  Why do they have to  \\&quot;improve\\&quot; products that worked great before and raise the price to boot?  The formula seemed to change when the new label was introduced.</li>
            <li> The cream does a very good job in moisturizing the body, also does not smell a lot compared to other brands</li>
            <li> I loved the old lotion formula.  However, they changed. I&#x27;m very sensitive to smell and this one has an odor now.  It&#x27;s also thick and doesn&#x27;t go on well.  I called the company and they didn&#x27;t really care.  I&#x27;m desperately trying to find another lotion and there is an odd pattern of many of them having changed their formulas and many people not being too happy about it.</li>
            <li> I am diligently trying to buy only household items that are fragrance free...dye free...and this is our newest addition. Works great and doesn&#x27;t cause you to sweat.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for years, and decided to order it online for the first time to save money over local store prices. It is virtually odorless (though for some reason my cat loves to wash it off my hands at night), has safe ingredients, and is not overly greasy. One of the bottles arrived with a piece broken off the pump and had leaked slightly, but I plan to switch it with the pump from my current bottle. I would order this item again.</li>
            <li> Strongly dislike this lotion on my body. Returning this item. I applied it after showering and toweling off, this lotion just wouldn&#x27;t absorb and left my skin feeling gooey. Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in the desert and NEED a good moisturizer, but, this is just gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going back to Sephora Collection Supreme Body Lotion, it&#x27;s more expensive, but works great!</li>
            <li> Fragrance free is a must for me.  Nice ingredients too.  Good value in buying two 3-packs with free super saver shipping.  Delivered right to my house.</li>
            <li> Let me quickly verify a couple of things from the other reviews.  Yes, it is thick, and takes a little extra work to rub the lotion in fully.  It also isn&#x27;t completely scent free; there is a very light scent if you&#x27;re really scrutinizing things.  Now, on to the good.  I have tried, many, many lotions with very mixed results / varying degrees of reaction to their contents.  This lotion is very benign, and my skinseems to take to it well; no breakouts.  I don&#x27;t typically have to reapply during the day, as the moisturizing effects seem to last a bit longer than most (perhaps due to the thickness and lack of any alcohol in the ingredient list).  For those who are eczema sufferers, I would recommend, as it has worked for me where the unscented offerings for many others (cetaphil, cerave, lubriderm, aveeno, curel, eucerin, aquaphor) have failed me.</li>
            <li> Shipping experience was excellent. This lotion is wonderful for your skin and I would recommend this company to anyone. Leaves my skin nice and soft all day long. Even when I go to shower I can still feel the lotion on me as I rinse off, but it is not greasy at all or overwhelming. However, what I might add is that despite it saying fragrance-free, the lotion does have a smell to it and for this particular one its not that great of a scent at all in my opinion. So before purchasing you might want to keep that in mind. Their other lotions have a more pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for over two years and I am quite pleased with the fact that t is not greasy at all, fragrance free, ZERO chemicals (check cosmetics database) and works wonders even in coldest and harshest weather conditions.  When you apply, it might look like white coating but let it dry a few seconds and it will disappear.  Nature&#x27;s gate makes some of the best products.</li>
            <li> while i agree with others about the consistency of the lotion and the new formula of the product i have continued to use it out of necessity.  also chemically sensitive i have found that i tolerate it to a certain degree.  what i do is pour some in a previously outgassed lotion bottle and mix it with purified water and shake it up real well thus diluting it significantly.  this reduces the thickness and, also makes it last longer. it works for me until i find a replacement.</li>
            <li> The best lotion existing!!!  No mineral oi ensures no blocked pores, and soft, soft skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only hand lotion I&#x27;ve used for years and years.  I&#x27;ve never had an interest in trying others because it is perfect for me.  It&#x27;s fragrance free (a tiny odor at first and then zip)and not at all greasy or sticky.  Also, I can use it on my face and lips with no problem.  Try it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for maybe a dozen years or more.  I really liked the previous formula as it was clean smelling and not so thick greasy feeling.  It took me a long time to find a lotion I like.  I HATE the new formula&#x27;s smell and don&#x27;t like the thickness.  The smell reminds of something like someone&#x27;s nasty personal smell.  I kid you not.  I will never use again.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I am TOTALLY Happy with a body lotion. Only one word to describe this product: FANTASTIC. This is the ONLY product EVER that keeps my skin soft and moisturized until I go to take a shower. I have also noticed that this product BRIGHTENS my skin, even though it doesn&#x27;t even make that claim on its label. This product is quite simply fabulous. I am sooooooo happy I found Nature&#x27;s Gate Moisturizing Lotion, I am planning to keep on using it forever.</li>
            <li> I like Nature&#x27;s gate fragrance free lotion, but due shipping or handling or packaging issue, one of the bottle has lotion leakage all over the outside of the bottle.  Please improve!</li>
            <li> This is nice. However it is not nearly as good as the original recipe which was my very favorite of all lotions.  I wish Nature&#x27;s Gate would return to the old recipe.  It was fabulous.  This lotion does not rub in as well or keep my skin so soft.  I am just grateful they still make a decent non toxic lotion.  I think they need to leave out the Shea Butter so it would absorb better.</li>
            <li> This had less slip/glide than the hemp lotion. Felt sticker. Smells like glue. Threw this one away--couldn&#x27;t even gift it to my mother.</li>
            <li> CONS:  The lotion does not absorb well so it causes white streaks on your skin.  It also feels sticky on your skin long after you have applied it.  PROS:  Made with quality natural ingredients by a trusted company.  My skin started clearing up after a week of use.    In all, I gave this product 3 stars.  It is fairly good but there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> So happy to find this lotion on Amazon and buy in bulk. It&#x27;s a great product that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy after applying.</li>
            <li> used this product for years and loved it until the last batch arrived &#x27;New Improved&#x27; and HATED it ... fails to absorb into the skin and leaves a white greasy film ... now using another moisturizer and would recommend that this particular product be left alone until Natures Gate reverts back to the original pre improved product ... why on earth they would change a good thing is beyond me but they lost me as a customer...</li>
            <li> Great lotion. I use it everyday. Not too greasy, while moisturizing my 53 yr old skin very well.</li>
            <li> I picked this up because I was looking for a non-toxic lotion. Most of the health store brands are still as toxic as the drug store brands. The old formulation of this lotion was a 5 or 6 (out of 10)on the EWG database for toxicity. While EWG doesn&#x27;t have the new formulation in the database, I checked every ingredient and they are all 0 except for 2 at the end of the ingredients list that are 2. It is rare to find a lotion that is this low in toxins. I know I can find oils and such that are toxin free but I don&#x27;t like the texture and greasiness of oils. The homemade stuff has either been very expensive to buy or when I tried to make it was just a mess.</li>
            <li> Very good for reflexology!</li>
            <li> The lotion leaves streaks unless you really work to rub it in. But I like the way it feels and the fact that is has no added fragrance.</li>
            <li> UPDATE (end of March, 2013):&lt;br /&gt;I thought I could get by with the new formula, but after a couple months of using it, I&#x27;ve decided to look for another brand. This is just too thick and I don&#x27;t like the residue left behind on my skin. It works, and it smells nice, but there has to be something better. Sorry, Nature&#x27;s Gate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original (Feb 2013):&lt;br /&gt;So I loved the old formula, and was hesitant to get more when my bottle ran out, due to poor reviews of the new formula here. But nothing else really worked, so I shelled out for a new bottle. Here&#x27;s my conclusion: yes, it&#x27;s thicker and gooier, but it smells the same (vaguely nicely oat-y) and it really does moisturize very well. My skin feels great and some rough patches I had are going away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to rub it in for longer to make sure it absorbs, and to wash my hands after I&#x27;m done. Also I&#x27;ve noticed when I shower later there&#x27;s a thin residue where the moisturizer didn&#x27;t absorb completely. I use a different lighter product for my face. That said, it&#x27;s doing a nice job and I don&#x27;t mind the extra effort as much as I thought I would. I&#x27;ll stick with it until I hear of something better, at least. Hope this helps others!</li>
            <li> Does moisturize well, but very heavy and does not absorb very well - my experience is very similar to others here with the new formula. Great for a lotion to use at night during the winter, but you&#x27;ll never get your jeans on after applying this stuff during the day!  I will not be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;The old formula was so much better!  Nature&#x27;s Gate, please rethink!</li>
