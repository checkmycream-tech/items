            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t the best, but I very much like the way I can still feel some skin protection as the day goes on.</li>

            <li>It is nice to use after the shower because it moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>Its a good product and am sure would work better on my arms if I would use it faithfully.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is convenient too--it&#x27;s very easy to toss into a gym bag and keep with you when you are travelling or on the go.  </li>
            <li>This is the most lovely body cream!</li>
            <li>This product worked better than their Eczema cream and that was pretty good too but not as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I like the olay body lotion better.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I bought the body cream and will use it forever.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I tried using this product during the day and it was ok</li>
            <li>but then I moved to bedtime application hoping for a better result.</li>
            <li>And drug stores aren&#x27;t much better.</li>
            <li>I will try to give it a better try.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>and I have used many products.</li>
            <li>I have been using this lotion for the passed 3 years now, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend this product for healthy moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>I love this skin cream.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff been using it awhile before purchasing here.  </li>
            <li>But this has a strong feminine fragrance that I didn&#x27;t like, so I returned it.</li>
            <li>This particular cream was rated the &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; in Good Housekeeping&amp;#34; a couple of months ago.</li>
            <li>It was ok but nothing special.</li>
            <li>It works well and has a light scent.</li>
            <li>So far, so good for what I can tell.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about two months and the results are significant.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>The price is comparable to stores and I don&#x27;t have to go to special stores to find it for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>The smell is mild and inoffensive too.</li>
            <li>Stores sell out quickly.</li>
            <li>Really good lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Not sure I can really speak to the skin strengthening aspect, but my skin feels great!</li>
            <li>thanks !!</li>
            <li>The scent is reminiscent of a flower garden in May (with mostly roses!)</li>
            <li>After two dr.s told me nothing could help the sun damaged skin on my 75 year old arms that torn off easy in large amounts this cream was able to stop the tearing</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and used a foam medication that thinned out the skin on my arms so much that they bled just from lightly rubbing over them.  </li>
            <li>AND it comes right to</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to turn 31, and when I first started using this product I thought, I&#x27;d better get an early start to prevent aging skin.  </li>
            <li>I use other Aveeno products which I am very satisfied with.  </li>
            <li>The first patch to appear was on my chest.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and smooth, it&#x27;s wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It actually did strengthen the skin on my hands and feet most noticeably.  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B004D2C4X2 Aveeno Positively Ageless Skin Strengthening Body Cream, 7.3 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Aveeno Positively Ageless Skin Strengthening cream seems to be moisturizing.</li>
            <li>From reviewing other Aveeno product reviews (most notably its eye product), I see that I am not the only one to have this type of reaction.</li>
            <li>The container is quite large at 7.3 ounces so it lasts quite awhile.</li>
            <li>My veins are less obvious and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream</li>
            <li>Everyone I have told to use it have had great results thin skin strengthed</li>
            <li>and it really does.  </li>
            <li>I also think the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I have many other moisturizers but always looking for a miracle.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not easily impressed, but this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Any lotion will take care of dry skin if you are sure to apply it regularly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to lotions/creams/moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Was well worth the purchase even if it is not completely successfull.</li>
            <li>Since she began using Aveeno her skin is looking better and no more bruising.  </li>
            <li>Some skin creams, oddly, leave my skin dry after application, this one softens, smooths and feels nice to the touch.</li>
            <li>Ulta was actually the cheapest place and the Amazon price is a little better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion and mixing in a few drops of lavender oil and it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I am 70 yrs old and this really helps my skin look &amp; feel younger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unexpected benefit came about by my adding my elbows to the ritual.</li>
            <li>This old, sun damaged skin needs all the help it can get....</li>
            <li>They are now soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I especially like to use it on newly shaved legs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now and really like it....seems to be adding moisture to my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>, when the flowers begin to open and the fragrance is still light, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>However, within 24 to 48 hours of using this product, I developed a blistery red rash.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this on his hands to lessen dark age spots and it certainly does help</li>

            <li> The other day I realized when I was putting the cream on my elbows during the after bath ritual, that the dermatitis on BOTH elbows had healed completely.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the cream as my skin is dry but also thin, ie prone to fine lines and</li>
            <li> bought a few different Aveeno creams from Ulta to find one that would work on my now 52 year old thinning skin.</li>
            <li> It has taken care of my dry itchy knuckles and elbows and feet as well.  </li>
            <li> I do not normally have allergic reactions to anything.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my arms, loose skin, &amp; have used it according to directions without seeing any noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> As I am losing weight, I needed a lotion that would help tighten my loose skin on my arms.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for 3 weeks now and noticed my loose skin is tightening and appears smoother.  </li>
            <li> think it works as well as the Daily Moisturising Lotion but has a slightly thicker consistency.</li>
            <li> My skin was getting thin and fragile and now it is normal again.  </li>
            <li> I  have always had a hard time finding moisturizer that works and doesn&#x27;t irritate my (unfortunately) sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The product really works on senior thin skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> other then buy it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the price of it seems to fluctuate a lot.</li>
            <li> This lotion healed with just one application about five times a week on average.  </li>
            <li> that menopause has begun, my skin has become thin, dry, and has definitely lost some of its elasticity.</li>
            <li> A little greasier than I would like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy or oily and it works--stops the itching and keeps the skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my mother who has thin skin normally but with illness, it&#x27;s gotten worse.</li>
            <li> It was less expensive on Amazon than at my local Walmart .</li>
            <li> described as usual spot on.</li>
            <li> It will be a small treasure to you.</li>
            <li> But after a few weeks of use, there is a serious improvement in the appearance of her arms.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few weeks now on a casual schedule (maybe once or twice a week) and it seems to be working a little.  </li>
            <li> I do not feel greasy after applying, which is somewhat common with creams (as opposed to lotions).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and keeps the skin moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale and thin skin, so the veins in my legs look like a road map.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d been seriously chapped, basically dermatitis; red, ugly, and itchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been told that I was thin skinned</li>
            <li> My husband has started using it when he saw my dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> I have tried very expensive age spot remover that has not done anything for my spots.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this because I like Aveeno&#x27;s regular skin cream and the skin on my forearms is thinning from sun exposure over the years.  But this has a strong feminine fragrance that I didn&#x27;t like, so I returned it. They should make a separate product for men or a fragrance-free version.</li>
            <li> Incredibly great product!</li>
            <li> The Aveeno skin cream I found works well for me.  Some skin creams, oddly, leave my skin dry after application, this one softens, smooths and feels nice to the touch.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my arms, loose skin, &amp; have used it according to directions without seeing any noticeable improvement. It does absorb into the skin good but the smell is not the best in the world. I will probably switch to Olay&#x27;s brand.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream</li>
            <li> I have very pale and thin skin, so the veins in my legs look like a road map. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion and mixing in a few drops of lavender oil and it has made a huge difference. My veins are less obvious and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> This is very good and it hasn&#x27;t any odor. I cannot use anything that has perfume. It helps my hands, arms and legs. It does not have a greasy feel and works great</li>
            <li> Really good lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Best stuff I ever used on legs arms neck.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product-I use it as a body cream and the texture and appearance of my skin, particularly on my hands and chest, has improved remarkably</li>
            <li> After two dr.s told me nothing could help the sun damaged skin on my 75 year old arms that torn off easy in large amounts this cream was able to stop the tearing I can&#x27;t get along with out it. Everyone I have told to use it have had great results thin skin strengthed</li>
            <li> More expensive than regular lotion but it seems to moisturize for longer. I can feel it wash off in the shower the next day. The smell is mild and inoffensive too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it strengthens. I liked it thogh and would buy it again. I think I like the olay body lotion better.</li>
            <li> I always can notice if I haven&#x27;t applied this moisturizer.  My skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t the best, but I very much like the way I can still feel some skin protection as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on his hands to lessen dark age spots and it certainly does help</li>
            <li> This particular cream was rated the &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; in Good Housekeeping&amp;#34; a couple of months ago. I thought I would try it and it does the trick and feels wonderful. I am glad that I bought the body cream and will use it forever. thanks !!</li>
            <li> I bought this item in a retail store.  The back of my hands get puckered and have premature age spots.  I bought this lotion for the dryness factor of my hands.  However, my age spots have started fading.  I have tried very expensive age spot remover that has not done anything for my spots.  But this lotion was fading my spots, and it it does not advertise to do so.  Bonus!  I&#x27;m not easily impressed, but this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I do not normally have allergic reactions to anything. However, within 24 to 48 hours of using this product, I developed a blistery red rash. The first patch to appear was on my chest. About 48 hours later, patches appeared on my shins and arms. From reviewing other Aveeno product reviews (most notably its eye product), I see that I am not the only one to have this type of reaction. Although my rash does not itch as others have reported, I will cut my losses and not use any Aveeno products in the future.</li>
            <li> Does what it says.  All the tiny lines are disappearing.</li>
            <li> Love it I use it every day.</li>
            <li> a great product. described as usual spot on. love this product and i will buy more when i need it as i gave a friend one, to  share a great product</li>
            <li> I decided to try the cream as my skin is dry but also thin, ie prone to fine lines and eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it works as well as the Daily Moisturising Lotion but has a slightly thicker consistency. It also has a fragrance that may not suit everyone&#x27;s taste. I prefer the tube to bottle packaging (of the Daily Moisturising Lotion) as it&#x27;s easier to squeeze out the last bits while the bottle packaging isn&#x27;t as convenient towards the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004D2C4X2 Aveeno Positively Ageless Skin Strengthening Body Cream, 7.3 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;I bought a few different Aveeno creams from Ulta to find one that would work on my now 52 year old thinning skin. I&#x27;ve always been told that I was thin skinned but I don&#x27;t think that this is what they had in mind. Anyhow, LOVE this stuff! I&#x27;m new to lotions/creams/moisturizers. Never used them until about a month ago because my skin was always too oily to handle any type of lotion that didn&#x27;t cause a breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that menopause has begun, my skin has become thin, dry, and has definitely lost some of its elasticity. I tried using this product during the day and it was ok but then I moved to bedtime application hoping for a better result. It was ok but nothing special. One day I decided to try it after I got out of the shower and could feel the difference immediately. My skin is so soft and smooth, it&#x27;s wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unexpected benefit came about by my adding my elbows to the ritual. They&#x27;d been seriously chapped, basically dermatitis; red, ugly, and itchy. The other day I realized when I was putting the cream on my elbows during the after bath ritual, that the dermatitis on BOTH elbows had healed completely. How I didn&#x27;t notice that I wasn&#x27;t scratching all the time anymore is beyond me. This product worked better than their Eczema cream and that was pretty good too but not as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plan is to put a regular order for this item through Amazon. The price is comparable to stores and I don&#x27;t have to go to special stores to find it for a cheaper price. Never buy from a grocery store! And drug stores aren&#x27;t much better. Ulta was actually the cheapest place and the Amazon price is a little better AND it comes right to my door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother who has thin skin normally but with illness, it&#x27;s gotten worse. But after a few weeks of use, there is a serious improvement in the appearance of her arms. Worth a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now and really like it....seems to be adding moisture to my dry skin.  I use other Aveeno products which I am very satisfied with.  This old, sun damaged skin needs all the help it can get....Aveeno Positively Ageless Skin Strengthening cream seems to be moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and used a foam medication that thinned out the skin on my arms so much that they bled just from lightly rubbing over them.  I have been using this cream for a few weeks now on a casual schedule (maybe once or twice a week) and it seems to be working a little.  Was well worth the purchase even if it is not completely successfull.</li>
            <li> I bought the product thinking I would use it on my face to strengthen the skin and prevent wrinkles.  I have many other moisturizers but always looking for a miracle.  Its a good product and am sure would work better on my arms if I would use it faithfully.  I must admit I wasn&#x27;t using it daily.  I will try to give it a better try.</li>
            <li> I read about it in Prevention Magazine being described as the best.  It is good and I like it but found others just as good</li>
            <li> My wife is 68 and her skin would bruise every time she bumped or brushed against anything.  Since she began using Aveeno her skin is looking better and no more bruising.  She is very happy with this product. Finally, a product that does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.  It makes my skin feel great and seems to do as promised.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wanted to enhance the feeling of their skin.  My only complaint is that the price of it seems to fluctuate a lot.</li>
            <li> It works well and has a light scent. It disappears on the skin after application not leaving a greasy residue. I especially like to use it on newly shaved legs. The container is quite large at 7.3 ounces so it lasts quite awhile. It was less expensive on Amazon than at my local Walmart .</li>
            <li> As I am losing weight, I needed a lotion that would help tighten my loose skin on my arms.  I read this lotion would strengthening the skin and it really does.  I have been using this lotion for 3 weeks now and noticed my loose skin is tightening and appears smoother.  I will definitely keep using this lotion.</li>
            <li> It actually did strengthen the skin on my hands and feet most noticeably.  My skin was getting thin and fragile and now it is normal again.  It has taken care of my dry itchy knuckles and elbows and feet as well.  They are now soft and supple. Any lotion will take care of dry skin if you are sure to apply it regularly.  This lotion healed with just one application about five times a week on average.  I would forget it sometimes and sometimes just used Aveeno Daily moisturizer as I had a bottle to finish.  Great stuff.  I recommend it highly.  I am 57 yo and I have used many products. Aveeno is the best I have used. My dermatologist recommended it along with giving me a prescription.  I did not have to use the Rx, I just used this and it worked.</li>
            <li> This is the most lovely body cream! The scent is reminiscent of a flower garden in May (with mostly roses!), when the flowers begin to open and the fragrance is still light, not overwhelming. I do not feel greasy after applying, which is somewhat common with creams (as opposed to lotions). Not sure I can really speak to the skin strengthening aspect, but my skin feels great!</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find.Stores sell out quickly. This swift seller saved the day. The product really works on senior thin skin.&lt;br /&gt; I can&#x27;t say enough about this product other then buy it. It will be a small treasure to you.</li>
            <li> I read about this product when it won the Prevention Magazine 2012 product award.    I have used this product for about two months and the results are significant.  My husband has started using it when he saw my dramatic results.  The skin on my face is tighter and my neck skin looks improved.    This one is a winner.    More on the award that this great product won.  [...]</li>
            <li> My favorite skin cream!  Ordered on Amazon, because of the very good price!</li>
            <li> Sees to help strengthen my forearms as I have thinning skin. I sue this everyday after  shower and really seems to help.</li>
            <li> I am 70 yrs old and this really helps my skin look &amp; feel younger. Just wish it came in a pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I  have always had a hard time finding moisturizer that works and doesn&#x27;t irritate my (unfortunately) sensitive skin.  This body cream is wonderful.  It&#x27;s not too heavy or oily and it works--stops the itching and keeps the skin moisturized.  The packaging is convenient too--it&#x27;s very easy to toss into a gym bag and keep with you when you are travelling or on the go.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for the passed 3 years now, and I love it.  It&#x27;s thick and keeps the skin moisturized all day.  I&#x27;m about to turn 31, and when I first started using this product I thought, I&#x27;d better get an early start to prevent aging skin.  So far, so good for what I can tell.  I use it on my entire body including my face, but only on the face at night.  During the day, I use the Aveeno moisturizing cream with SPF 30.  I do recommend this product for healthy moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> Probably a 3.5 star. A little greasier than I would like.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very good price.</li>
            <li> I love this skin cream. It has a very pleasant scent. It is nice to use after the shower because it moisturizes well. I don&#x27;t need a touch up on my skin after using this cream. I also think the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff been using it awhile before purchasing here.  Worth the money!</li>
