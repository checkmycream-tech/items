    <ol>
            <li>Perfect for a beginner.</li>
            <li>Which was a great thing for</li>
            <li>so I was happy about that</li>
            <li>If you are looking to experiment on doing nails then go ahead and get this but don&#x27;t expect for it to be a great product.</li>
            <li>but it is a good set for beginners to get used to doing the acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>Everything was great except my polymer the containers were melted from the liquid but beside that I liked everything else</li>
            <li>I loved it its sooo cute</li>
            <li>I really liked the glitter</li>
            <li>I could have gotten better quality product from Walmart.</li>
            <li>Otherwise everything was okay.</li>
            <li>I honestly love how they work and you have to be a pro</li>
            <li>but over all it came very quickly</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t include the primer or the nail molds and the acrylic tips break easily and started falling off after 2 days.</li>
            <li>So cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Overall great, fun purchase</li>
            <li>None of this was true for me.</li>
            <li>but I am excited to use this to do nails for fun.</li>
            <li>Everything came in it the products are great and what I expected and came fast</li>
            <li>Some of the powders were opened everywhere but worth the money anyways</li>
            <li>so you have to really wet your brush in order to get a a good consistency.</li>
            <li>Got here pretty quick.</li>
            <li>so I normally am pretty good with using them and having them stay on an average of 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li>So I really can&#x27;t give this a good rating because I&#x27;m not able to use it.</li>
            <li>Everything came on time just some of the color power wash full and the acrylic powders is not the same in the picture.</li>
            <li>these didn&#x27;t even last a full week.</li>
            <li>Products were decent size and you get a lot for the money you&#x27;re spending.</li>
            <li>Everything was so tiny and after using the acrylic powder which dries up quickly</li>
            <li>I disaponed because the clear acrylic spread to the whole box and everything</li>
            <li>The only reason why I didn&#x27;t returned it was because I was too excited to learn how to do my nails and didn&#x27;t want to wait another 2 weeks to get a different product.</li>
            <li>They must have changed the way the pack it because everything was packed in really tight and secure.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m only giving this a three mostly because the items are really small</li>
            <li>The nails are extremely poor quality, and many of them are deformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get barely any pink or white powder, and the acrylic doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li>I purchased this kit to learn how to do my own nails as I was getting tired of going to the nail salon every other week.</li>
            <li>None of the products were wrapped and protected so half of the glitters and powders were spilled , all the nail are cheap and white tips, the powder containers are  tiny and only half actually has powder .....</li>

            <li> Some of the powders were opened everywhere but worth the money anyways</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t come with the duck tips :( but I am excited to use this to do nails for fun.</li>
            <li> Everything came on time just some of the color power wash full and the acrylic powders is not the same in the picture.</li>
            <li> When I ordered it, it said \\&quot;guaranteed arival by June 23rd\\&quot;. It got here the 24th. I know, I know, its only one day late. But my birthday was June 23rd and this was a gift from my husband. We were hoping it would be on time, so I could do my nails for my birthday dinner. Nope, didn&#x27;t happen. It wouldn&#x27;t have been a big deal if the arival date wasn&#x27;t GUARANTEED. Also the glitter acrylic powder doesn&#x27;t work. And it spilled all over everything. The acrylic liquid also spilled. The nails are extremely poor quality, and many of them are deformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does work, with effort and experience. However I would never recommend thidls to anyone. I could have gotten better quality product from Walmart.</li>
            <li> Unable to do the acrylic nails because the all of the nail glues came dried up and the nail clipper came in broken. So I really can&#x27;t give this a good rating because I&#x27;m not able to use it. Otherwise everything was okay.</li>
            <li> I received my products earlier than expected. Which was a great thing for I was suppose to receive my package May 11th. Everything in the picture was also in my package. The only issue I had with product is that a little of the clear acrylic powder spilled out. Other than that I cannot not wait to use the products on my clients and I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dominique</li>
            <li> It came with a lot of stuff but the acrylic I got wasn&#x27;t a lot in each container. And I didn&#x27;t get the round thing with molds of flowers.</li>
            <li> The glue liquid and powder containers are a lot smaller than pictures but it is a good set for beginners to get used to doing the acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> I honestly love how they work and you have to be a pro but I&#x27;m only giving this a three mostly because the items are really small and I thought that I was getting everything like in the pic but over all it came very quickly so I was happy about that</li>
            <li> Got here pretty quick. I read some of the old reviews about the glitter being spilt everywhere and the clippers broken. None of this was true for me.
