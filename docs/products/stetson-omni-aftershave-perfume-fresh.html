            <li>I Been using this product for years, and I have enjoyed it ..</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Stetson Products.  </li>
            <li>I like it even better than Polo.</li>
            <li>But I sure love this scent, and,</li>
            <li>Some people don&#x27;t like it, most do.</li>
            <li>I love it, I used to wear this in my twenties.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t something I think most women would like.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>cologne spray arrived soo fast!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a product that I would highly recommend to any person looking for a great cologne,</li>
            <li>I have used Stetson Original Cologne Spray for over twenty years!  </li>
            <li>Nice reliable fragrance and well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Love Stetson Original Cologne Spray  </li>
            <li>this is the only Cologne he uses and I was happy that I was able to find it for him.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best, hands down.  </li>
            <li>The best places to apply it are a little on your and and in the arms pits.</li>
            <li>For those of you who remember the cologne Mon Triomphe, the smell of Stetson original is practically identical and, in fact, Stetson came out after Mon Triomphe was history.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of using Stetson aftershave to get that short-lived clean scent</li>
            <li>If you like Stetson it was nice to be able to buy a larger size with the spray.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this product but the fact that they (Amazon) pester you for a review kinda irks me after all buying cologne is not a monumentus occasion nor a major purchase nor life altering All that is really inportant about this purchase</li>
            <li>Women (all women that I have encountered) love this fragrance on a man and a whole lot of them have said so.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly</li>
            <li>I NEVER fail to get a compliment on it!</li>
            <li>Much easier to just order from Amazon and with the free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it contains any kind of aphrodisiac in it or not, but it has the same effect as mens colognes that do.</li>
            <li>Makes my wife happy what else can I say this works for me, can not find locally must be getting old</li>
            <li>Will order again in the future Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>Good for young and old.</li>
            <li>Every time I spray it it takes me Bach to my twenties, I can&#x27; help it but smile, sometimes laugh ....hard....</li>
            <li>Stetson original is a classic, no doubt about it.</li>
            <li>I use Stetson daily and love the fresh smell of the cologne.</li>
            <li>The only time you can get a better value is right after the holidays when the stores have it for 50% off.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s mysterious and sexy.</li>
            <li>This is the same price all year long  so a great deal, I will order from them again.</li>
            <li>I have used Stetson for years since it first hit the market.</li>
            <li>It is getting hard to find large bottles and was happy I did for him .</li>
            <li>I tend to prefer the mature fragrances so of course Stetson original made the list of colognes to try, and I bought a bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wanting to get other opinions besides just my own</li>
            <li>My husband loves the Stetson Original Cologne Spray, we wanted the larger size</li>
            <li>some extra cuddles).&lt;br /&gt;So Stetson original gets 3 stars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s spicy, clean, and musky (don&#x27;t ask me how they managed to get &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; into the same fragrance, but they did).</li>
            <li>The cologne is one of my favorite scents that I&#x27;ve sorn for over half my lenghty life.  </li>
            <li>Stetson Original has been around for a long tome and it has stood the test of time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cologne since high school.  </li>
            <li>this smells exactly like my granddad&#x27;s bathroom&amp;#34; (apparently her grandfather used Stetson aftershave).</li>
            <li>I had a minor problem with the supplier relating to package size but it was resolved quickly to my satisfaction</li>
            <li>but I can live</li>
            <li>, the whole point of cologne is to smell good enough and last long enough into the evening that it can encourage some extra late-night cuddles.</li>
            <li>to old school</li>
            <li>The fragrance last much longer that way.</li>
            <li>It is distinctively masculine, rugged, and, well, 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I like it too so much that I bought the aftershave balm in the same scent.</li>
            <li>We will buy again as his birthday is not too far away.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Pleasing, subtle, and very clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>None of them disliked it, but none of them thought it was worth a repeat sniff.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>Product was delivered before the due date and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>The convenience was definitely worth the small amount of shipping I had to pay.</li>
            <li>You will work a whole lot less trying to attract any romantic interest, than without it.</li>

            <li> will continue using it...just hard to find locally.....</li>
            <li> When I came home I went to the computer and ordered it in less than five (5) minutes.</li>
            <li> I would wear Kenneth Cole Black, Burberry Londo, Kenzo Toyko or Izzy Miyake any day of the week over this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t just mean my girlfriends, I mean every single female I&#x27;ve ever met in my life --</li>
            <li> I had a few lady friends smell-test it as well.</li>
            <li> To be a less expensive cologne, this fragrance packs a wollop.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>

            <li> To be a less expensive cologne, this fragrance packs a wollop. There&#x27;s just something about it that&#x27;s mysterious and sexy. When my man wears it, I get all frisky. Enough said.</li>
            <li> Ever time I spray on stetson I get complements&lt;br /&gt;So i&#x27;m asking every man who reads this review go&lt;br /&gt;Back to old school&lt;br /&gt;try stetson.&lt;br /&gt;  Try IT YOU LIKE</li>
            <li> Nice reliable fragrance and well worth the price.  I have been using Stetson for years and have had no complaints from family and friends.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for a person who like this fragrance.  He especially like the spray cologne over the splash on.</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING SCENT FOR  MEN</li>
            <li> My honey is happy...this is the only Cologne he uses and I was happy that I was able to find it for him.</li>
            <li> I Been using this product for years, and I have enjoyed it ..will continue using it...just hard to find locally.....</li>
            <li> Love Stetson Original Cologne Spray  I have used Stetson Original Cologne Spray for over twenty years!  A bit pricey but I can live</li>
            <li> My husband loves the Stetson Original Cologne Spray, we wanted the larger size but it was sold out.  I like to buy things to make my man smell like a man and this smells real good!!!</li>
            <li> Women (all women that I have encountered) love this fragrance on a man and a whole lot of them have said so. I don&#x27;t know if it contains any kind of aphrodisiac in it or not, but it has the same effect as mens colognes that do. Trust me on this, I have been using Stetson for over 40 years with the same results. You will work a whole lot less trying to attract any romantic interest, than without it. The best places to apply it are a little on your and and in the arms pits. The fragrance last much longer that way.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping. The only time you can get a better value is right after the holidays when the stores have it for 50% off. This is the same price all year long  so a great deal, I will order from them again.</li>
            <li> This cologne is one of my husband&#x27;s favorites and I was very happy to have found it on Amazon. It arrived in perfect condition.  I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Gloria Reediger</li>
            <li> I use Stetson daily and love the fresh smell of the cologne. This is a product that I would highly recommend to any person looking for a great cologne,</li>
            <li> My son wears cologne every day.  He always smells so good.  This is one of his favorites.  We both recommend it.</li>
            <li> My Husband loves this Cologne and won&#x27;t wear anything else. It is getting hard to find large bottles and was happy I did for him . It was his Christmas gift and he was very happy.</li>
            <li> Makes my wife happy what else can I say this works for me, can not find locally must be getting old</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband who loves this scent and so do I.&lt;br /&gt;I think the size is great for the cost.</li>
            <li> Very good product &amp;  price. Excellent fragrance. This was a gift for my brother &amp; he loved it. Excellent seller. A+++++</li>
            <li> Stetson original is a classic, no doubt about it. Launched in 1981 it embodies that time. It is distinctively masculine, rugged, and, well, 1980&#x27;s. It&#x27;s spicy, clean, and musky (don&#x27;t ask me how they managed to get &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; into the same fragrance, but they did). I tend to prefer the mature fragrances so of course Stetson original made the list of colognes to try, and I bought a bottle. After trying it regularly over the course of several months, however, it just wasn&#x27;t doing it for me. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. But it just never made the impression I wanted and I couldn&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;Wanting to get other opinions besides just my own I had a few lady friends smell-test it as well. Their reactions were that it was &amp;#34;clean,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;every-day,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;nice but nothing special,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;ohmygosh this smells exactly like my granddad&#x27;s bathroom&amp;#34; (apparently her grandfather used Stetson aftershave). None of them disliked it, but none of them thought it was worth a repeat sniff.&lt;br /&gt;While I like the idea of using Stetson aftershave to get that short-lived clean scent, the whole point of cologne is to smell good enough and last long enough into the evening that it can encourage some extra late-night cuddles. And I don&#x27;t see this one doing that (Stetson Black, on the other hand has DEFINITELY gotten me some extra cuddles).&lt;br /&gt;So Stetson original gets 3 stars. Not bad, not great, just average.</li>
            <li> Xmas gift for dad. Couldn&#x27;t find spray anywhere, just splash!  He loved it! Price was great as well. Made for great gift</li>
            <li> What can I say?  If you like Stetson it was nice to be able to buy a larger size with the spray.</li>
            <li> I had shopped at several drugstores for this Stetson Spray Cologne but nobody had the 2.25 fl. ounce. When I came home I went to the computer and ordered it in less than five (5) minutes. The convenience was definitely worth the small amount of shipping I had to pay.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my husband &amp; son, they both wear Stetson regularly, the price thru Amazon was defiantly a savings from the local drug store.</li>
            <li> Good size and a good price. My husband loves this cologne. Will order again in the future Nice fragrance. Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> We bought this for my father-in-law for father&#x27;s day. It arrived on the date estimated at the time of the order. The exact product ordered was received in perfect condition. This is the fragrance he loves not overwhelming but very masculine.  I like it too so much that I bought the aftershave balm in the same scent. Sometimes you can find this locally but it is a hit and miss proposition. Much easier to just order from Amazon and with the free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime it&#x27;s a no brainer.  We will buy again as his birthday is not too far away.</li>
            <li> I love Stetson Products.  I get compliments all the time that, &amp;#34;I smell good&amp;#34;.  I would recommend it to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Stetson Original has been around for a long tome and it has stood the test of time. Pleasing, subtle, and very clean fragrance. Good for young and old. Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I have used Stetson for years since it first hit the market. It is the only cologne I will use. The Amazon pricing beats the pants off of any retail store on the planet!</li>
            <li> Stetson cologne was excellent in all ways, price, shipping and updates was packed great and arrived in perfect condition and package was easy to open</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne since high school.  It&#x27;s the best, hands down.  I like it even better than Polo. I like it and so does every single woman I&#x27;ve ever met.  I don&#x27;t just mean my girlfriends, I mean every single female I&#x27;ve ever met in my life -- my sisters, my mother, my grandmother, my aunts, my cousins, my co-workers, even my boss, cashiers at the grocery store, waitresses, strangers passing me on the street, you name it.  Every female on the planet (or at least here in West Texas, where I live) seems to like this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt; And by the way, you don&#x27;t have to be a cowboy to use this fragrance.  I am not a cowboy in any way, even though, as mentioned above, I am from West Texas.  Heck, I don&#x27;t even like country music.  But I sure love this scent, and, like I said, so does every woman I meet.  I NEVER fail to get a compliment on it!</li>
            <li> For those of you who remember the cologne Mon Triomphe, the smell of Stetson original is practically identical and, in fact, Stetson came out after Mon Triomphe was history. I&#x27;ve often wondered if Coty bought the rights to the &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stetson is always on my shelf. Some people don&#x27;t like it, most do. Nuff said podnuh !</li>
            <li> This cologne is great!!!</li>
            <li> great smell and great price</li>
            <li> This is a lifetime smell</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product but the fact that they (Amazon) pester you for a review kinda irks me after all buying cologne is not a monumentus occasion nor a major purchase nor life altering All that is really inportant about this purchase is that it was reasanably priced and timley deliveried. This is what amazon does best</li>
            <li> What can one say about a favored product?  The cologne is one of my favorite scents that I&#x27;ve sorn for over half my lenghty life.  I had a minor problem with the supplier relating to package size but it was resolved quickly to my satisfaction</li>
            <li> I love it, I used to wear this in my twenties. And I switch to polo, I am in my four ties I decided to go back to it, guess what?? Every time I spray it it takes me Bach to my twenties, I can&#x27; help it but smile, sometimes laugh ....hard....for long time, I was really on long leash</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know. The smell isn&#x27;t something I think most women would like.  It&#x27;s strong. I will say that. Not my favorite.  I would wear Kenneth Cole Black, Burberry Londo, Kenzo Toyko or Izzy Miyake any day of the week over this.</li>
            <li> Lawyer cowboy, enough said.</li>
            <li> Stetson is for my husband he likes this cologne. I got exactly what I expected. Product was delivered before the due date and was packaged very well.</li>
