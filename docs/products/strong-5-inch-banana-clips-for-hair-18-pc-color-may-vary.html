            <li>At this price point for this many I don&#x27;t even care.</li>
            <li>because I really liked the original clips from years ago and was excited to find them again.</li>
            <li>if it appears to be to good to be true then..............not worth the hassle of returning or cannot return.  </li>

            <li>Will buy more very soon.</li>
            <li>I had them back in the 80&#x27;s and loved them....</li>
            <li>Cheap and break right out of the package.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re like new again, If one gets a good chomp &amp; can&#x27;t be fixed who cares ?</li>
            <li>Spend the extra &amp; get a good brand with a better design, that are easier to open on one end &amp; that won&#x27;t break if you try to get them apart!  </li>
            <li>I used to own these when I was younger and thought that we could use it on the girls.</li>
            <li>They are great colors only they frequently come apart</li>
            <li>The snaps are good and tight.</li>
            <li>The first one came apart taking it out of the package.</li>
            <li>There were what you would expect for a package this large.</li>
            <li>Still pretty decent items.</li>
            <li>I paid too much for such cheaply made hair clips.  </li>
            <li>Very disapointed</li>
            <li>After struggling to just open one up, I knew my young girls would not be able to do this by themselves, not even for their mothers.  </li>
            <li>Got them, just the right size, have worn several of them already</li>
            <li>They were very flimsy &amp; when I put one in my hair, it fell apart &amp; would not go back together.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know if the plastic is old or what</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on these.  </li>
            <li>On the good side they weren&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and hard to open and close.</li>
            <li>Yes, I would recommend these to anyone who has medium to long hair and who wants a different color for every day of the week.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t grip very well and start slipping after about an hour.  </li>
            <li>Not made like the old ones back in the 1970&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>the first one that I tried on my granddaughters hair broke the clip in half, it just fell apart</li>
            <li>The first one I tried putting in my hair broke in half as I was opening the end.&lt;br /&gt;The opposite end of the clip won&#x27;t stay together while you are trying to put it in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>They are not very sturdy a rubbery plastic not a stiff plastic.  </li>
            <li>The quality wasn&#x27;t extremely good or bad.</li>

            <li> the first one that I tried on my granddaughters hair broke the clip in half, it just fell apart</li>

            <li> The quality wasn&#x27;t extremely good or bad.</li>
            <li> They Pull apart, don&#x27;t stay clipped at either end, slide down hair if fine, hard to put in b/c</li>
            <li> They are short not adult sized.</li>
            <li> The clips are really stiff at first, and a little bit like dollar store quality, but I guess that&#x27;s what I was getting from the description and pictures anyway.</li>
            <li> Just right for thin hair.</li>
            <li> not very high quality.</li>
            <li> but it was very hard to get the clips open and a few of them even broke when i first tried t open them.  </li>
            <li> so they aren&#x27;t strong enough to hold thick hair and too flimsy to hold less thick hair.</li>
            <li> but I think they are too big for a little girls</li>
            <li> Few of them broke just trying to open them.  </li>
            <li> Pity</li>
            <li> These were not as sturdy as I expected!</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in the big box stores.</li>
            <li> but not worth what i paid</li>
            <li> be it dress up or dress down...</li>
            <li> TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!</li>
            <li> if half of them are going to break.  </li>
            <li> like they are for little girls</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all!</li>
            <li> Well, they were very hard to open and close.</li>
            <li> I have only opened one package of them, and 3 of them are broken already.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> thought they were a little too small</li>
            <li> A few have broken when I tried to snap them closed.</li>
            <li> Bought them for my daughter for a 80&#x27;s party for her sorority, and out of 15 clips she was not able to use any of them.  </li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY!  </li>
            <li> I thought they might be too flimsy for all my heavy, thick, hair, but they seem to be holding up alright!</li>
            <li> they are really hard to get apart.</li>
            <li> these were a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves these and with our parrots breaking them (when they sit on her shoulder) she goes through a &amp;#34;few&amp;#34; to say the least.</li>
            <li> and she doesn&#x27;t have thick hair</li>
            <li> Poor construction and just plain unusable.  </li>
            <li> IF you can get them apart without breaking them, they are STILL next to impossible to get apart</li>
            <li> then I was afraid it would break because there is not much to them.  </li>
            <li> Quality was poor.  </li>
            <li> , I think its just made poorly.</li>
            <li> Afraid to use them in my hair for fear they would get stuck.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Christmas gift and dd was disappointed.</li>
            <li> very disappointed in the clips.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE!!  </li>
            <li> The worst!</li>

            <li> cheap and flimsy and falls apart when you try to use them</li>
            <li> not very high quality. They break very easily</li>
            <li> Got them, just the right size, have worn several of them already and they work great, so glad I found them!</li>
            <li> Quality was poor.  Two of the clips broke when I tried to open them, and I only opened one package.</li>
            <li> Few of them broke just trying to open them.  Afraid to use them in my hair for fear they would get stuck.  Pity because I really liked the original clips from years ago and was excited to find them again.</li>
            <li> I paid too much for such cheaply made hair clips.  I couldn&#x27;t believe them when I opened them up...I had to try to pry them apart to even open one...then I was afraid it would break because there is not much to them.  I purchased them to begin with for my granddaughters and myself.  After struggling to just open one up, I knew my young girls would not be able to do this by themselves, not even for their mothers.  Save your $ and look at the swap meets...or the 99 cent stores...You can save a lot of money and find better quality.</li>
            <li> thought they were a little too small</li>
            <li> Save your money!  Very cheap!  Bought them for my daughter for a 80&#x27;s party for her sorority, and out of 15 clips she was not able to use any of them.  They all broke!  I think they must have been left over from 1980!</li>
            <li> very disappointed in the clips. did not fasten well at all.</li>
            <li> Broke apart.....can not use...terrible</li>
            <li> The first one I tried putting in my hair broke in half as I was opening the end.&lt;br /&gt;The opposite end of the clip won&#x27;t stay together while you are trying to put it in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Its like they are for little girls but I think they are too big for a little girls head.&lt;br /&gt;I should have sent them back for a refund but I opened the packages and threw it away!&lt;br /&gt;Save your money on these.  Not worth it at all!</li>
            <li> They are not very sturdy a rubbery plastic not a stiff plastic.  The first one came apart taking it out of the package. They don&#x27;t grip very well and start slipping after about an hour.  On the good side they weren&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> These are JUNK!  IF you can get them apart without breaking them, they are STILL next to impossible to get apart once you have them in your hair!  Spend the extra &amp; get a good brand with a better design, that are easier to open on one end &amp; that won&#x27;t break if you try to get them apart!  TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!</li>
            <li> they are good to put ur hair up with to keep cool and they go good with a lot of did styles</li>
            <li> I was excited when I ordered these. Opened up the package, and tried to open one up and put it in my hair. Well, they were very hard to open and close. It took a minute for me to get it open, then I couldn&#x27;t get it to close in my hair, I finally did. But 3 of them broke while opening or closing. I have only opened one package of them, and 3 of them are broken already. I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> they did not hold together at all ,came apart before could even clip them. Very disapointed</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in the big box stores. The price was really fair for them. Will buy more very soon.</li>
            <li> There were what you would expect for a package this large. The quality wasn&#x27;t extremely good or bad. They served their purpose.</li>
            <li> the first one that I tried on my granddaughters hair broke the clip in half, it just fell apart and she doesn&#x27;t have thick hair, I think its just made poorly. I used to own these when I was younger and thought that we could use it on the girls. Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> They were very cheaply made, when I put in my hair they came apart.</li>
            <li> I got this to give as a gift...she loved it!  Holds her hair wonderfully and had all the colors she wanted.</li>
            <li> My friend was looking for these and could not find them. She loves them to put her hair up while cleaning</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money. Cheap and break right out of the package. Do NOT purchase.</li>
            <li> They are very cheaply made. Does not stay in hair and does not stay connected!</li>
            <li> Would not recommend. A few have broken when I tried to snap them closed. Seemed cheaply made. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I thought they might be too flimsy for all my heavy, thick, hair, but they seem to be holding up alright!</li>
            <li> these were a big disappointment.  They were very flimsy &amp; when I put one in my hair, it fell apart &amp; would not go back together.  I returned them</li>
            <li> Just right for thin hair. The snaps are good and tight.</li>
            <li> Price was great for how many clips, wish there were more of the good colors, but still decent. The clips are really stiff at first, and a little bit like dollar store quality, but I guess that&#x27;s what I was getting from the description and pictures anyway. Still pretty decent items.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if the plastic is old or what but it was very hard to get the clips open and a few of them even broke when i first tried t open them.  i love the size and they are exactly what i wanted otherwise.  but not worth what i paid if half of them are going to break.  they are really hard to get apart.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on these.  Poor construction and just plain unusable.  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR WITH THIS PRODUCT.......................if it appears to be to good to be true then..............not worth the hassle of returning or cannot return.  Hope this helps then next customer.</li>
            <li> Clips wont come apart easily..when u get them open its bcuz they snap and break. Cheap junk. Christmas gift and dd was disappointed.</li>
            <li> These were not as sturdy as I expected!</li>
            <li> They were very cheaply made and would come apart before I could get it in my hair. Very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Got these for my granddaughter. Very cheaply made and hard to open and close. The comb part was sharpe and scratchy. Couldn&#x27;t use them and gave them away. Not made like the old ones back in the 1970&#x27;s. They are short not adult sized.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE!!  WASTE OF MONEY!  DON&#x27;T PURCHASE THESE!  Wish I&#x27;d never bought them.  All but 2 of them broke as soon as I opened them so I threw them in the trash.  The 2 that didn&#x27;t break don&#x27;t hold my hair, either.  The worst!</li>
            <li> These are flimsy, they easily open from both ends so they aren&#x27;t strong enough to hold thick hair and too flimsy to hold less thick hair. They either pop open or fall out. I don&#x27;t recommend these at all.</li>
            <li> They Pull apart, don&#x27;t stay clipped at either end, slide down hair if fine, hard to put in b/c both ends would undo</li>
            <li> My wife loves these and with our parrots breaking them (when they sit on her shoulder) she goes through a &amp;#34;few&amp;#34; to say the least. With these, I can snap them back together and they&#x27;re like new again, If one gets a good chomp &amp; can&#x27;t be fixed who cares ? At this price point for this many I don&#x27;t even care. Great product !</li>
            <li> I had been looking for these for years.....I have always loved the 80&#x27;s and since now my hair is longer I wanted the Banana Clips.....I had them back in the 80&#x27;s and loved them....the rating I gave is simply because their Great and with 18 of them it works out where I can mix and match them to whatever I am wearing....be it dress up or dress down...they work......And when I received them they came in a somewhat small box perfect fit with some room and packaging material.....Yes, I would recommend these to anyone who has medium to long hair and who wants a different color for every day of the week.</li>
            <li> They are great colors only they frequently come apart</li>
