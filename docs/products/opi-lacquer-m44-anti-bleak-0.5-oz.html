            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the Mariah Carey collection</li>
            <li>I bought it in store when it initially came out over a year ago and so happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty dark purple and looks great against my fair skin.</li>

            <li>Very dark &amp; fabulous for winter.</li>
            <li>I prefer opi nail polish in general.</li>

            <li> Great color and coverage!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this color. I bought it in store when it initially came out over a year ago and so happy to find it on Amazon. This is a limited edition color and will be sad once it&#x27;s all sold out!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this color and receive many compliments while wearing it and would buy it again.  I will keep wearing it.</li>
            <li> Sent it to a girlfriend, she painted her toes and fingers and sent me pics. I like the color and she liked it.</li>
            <li> Very nasty color and I love wearing it .  It feels like you are on a vacation and you&#x27;re in paradise.</li>
            <li> I love how rich and vibrant this color came out! If you&#x27;re looking for something sexy, this is a great polish! I&#x27;m a purple lover and it&#x27;s in the purple/wine family. Looks great on my olive skin. I def reccommend this color!</li>
            <li> A little pinky for my fall taste but looks great with glitter on top! Got so many compliments. Great for a holiday or NYE look.</li>

            <li> I give this 5 stars because the color was exactly what I wanted for a fall nail.  The order came within 3 days and I&#x27;m just totally please with it.  The color is more of a deep purple than pink.</li>
            <li> What is there to say about OPI is that they always have the prettiest colors and this color is beautiful is opaque I only needed one coat when I applied for a manicure. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Love this shade!  I wear mostly purples/plums/reds and this is my new favorite.  The endurance is also very good - I apply a top coat every other day and I get a full week with this color before a fresh mani.  I will buy this again For Sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice color. And of course the quality is really good too! It was not the color I was looking for though.</li>

            <li> i was so excited when this polish came in the mail. such a lovely color i just put it on my nails and i love it!</li>
            <li> This is another great color by OPI. It tends to work well with the reds, purples and even some pinks, making it a very versatile color when on the nail.</li>
            <li> What a lovely color!!!! i had it on my nails and toes. it really looked fabby. would wear it again anytime</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the Mariah Carey collection but this was definitely the stand out. It is very similar to Skyfall from the James Bond collection. It might even be a dupe.</li>
            <li> Amazing and  Lasts long!</li>
            <li> this color is soooo stinkin beautiful I can&#x27;t believe it. it is a gorgeous raspberry that looks smokin hot and works for all seasons I&#x27;m so happy with it I&#x27;m purchasing another asap!!</li>
            <li> I gave this polish 3 stars because I don&#x27;t really like how the color looks on. It&#x27;s a little dark and boring for me.</li>
            <li> Very dark &amp; fabulous for winter. I wear this all the time, it is a fav. OPI is consistently good quality, of course. Packaged carefully, delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I prefer opi nail polish in general. This particular color went on smoothly with no clumps or brush marks. I debated if I even needed a second coat. Do need to be careful about scraping nails against anything non fabric. Without a clear coat it will transfer color if an object is hit just right. Color is vibrant didn&#x27;t show any issues of age. (Worried I would since ordered online.)</li>
            <li> Love this color!  OPI always has such smooth application.  Love this color with light pink and white polka dots on top of it.  It&#x27;s very Mariah Carey!  :0)</li>
            <li> COLOR WAS PERFECT.....</li>
            <li> OPI is one of my favorite nail polish brands so when I found this color for a good price, I wanted to try it out. It&#x27;s a pretty dark purple and looks great against my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Close to discontinued Casino Royale</li>
            <li> Color is exactly like picture. I loved the color on and it dryed very quickly with a quick dry top coat.</li>
