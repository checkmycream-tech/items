            <li>so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>I have tried Layrite&#x27;s original pomade and it is working great.</li>

            <li>At first I thought they would fade into my hair like JS SLOANE( great pomade btw)</li>
            <li>more of a gel then pomade.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I also think for the price I can buy two Suavicito Pomades, a Layrite, Georgia Brown Pomade with much better quality.</li>
            <li>This stuff, overall, is probably the best pomade from the dozens I&#x27;ve used.</li>

            <li>Will post review updates as able to.</li>
            <li>My favorite pomade from Imperial.  </li>
            <li>I get most of my compliments about my hair when I use this product.  </li>
            <li>Has slight sheen that is attractive, smells great and NOT overpowering, allows my cologne to be the fragrance</li>
            <li>but not least, for $25, its a great deal considering the 6 oz you get...</li>
            <li>hold is okay not too strong.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and how easily it washed</li>
            <li>It seems to work best when applied to damp, but not overly wet hair.</li>
            <li>USA made and all have a very nice masculine scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Very easy to apply and spread across hair evenly&lt;</li>
            <li>oh and it&#x27;s also water-based, which means it washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Has a strong hold, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like gel.</li>
            <li>Layrite gives a strong vanilla smell all day.</li>
            <li>like a cheap hair gel</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>so it washes out super easy.  </li>
            <li>Seems to have a hold some where between thres flores waterbased and layrite original pomade.</li>
            <li>The smell is really sweet.</li>
            <li>Then take a bit of Fiber Pomade, rub it in you hands till your hands get warm, then spread the product over the top of your rough mold just to add the bit of shine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*Loses its hold very quickly in the heat&lt;br /&gt;*Requires too much product&lt;</li>
            <li>I t holds where I want it to, adds a nice sheen, and doesnâ€™t weigh down the top.</li>
            <li>The shine is also just right (for my taste) as it isn&#x27;t super shiny like you would get from Crew pomade.  </li>
            <li>Great product, does exactly what other reviews said it would.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to work into your hair and it gently washes right out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The Classic Pomade from Imperial seems way too strong for my needs.</li>
            <li>change confirmed as a glitch; orders directly from Imperial should contain the original product.</li>
            <li>and the hold is just right.  </li>
            <li>And the shine is also just right.</li>
            <li>I have a couple of their hair products and haven&#x27;t quite found the right one for my hair, even when I try to combine them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used over a dozen pomade products in the past couple years and this is by far the best for my hair and my needs.</li>
            <li>pomade is excellent if you have long hair and it works extremely well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of price points when it comes to pomade, the cheap $5 stuff from Walgreens up to crazy $35 jars from NYC boutiques and Imperial is THE BEST I&#x27;ve found so</li>
            <li>Good product, but careful as it will make your hair very shinny.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t find much of a difference between the Fiber version and the regular Imperial pomade.</li>
            <li>I slick my hair back with some volume, and this is the best Hybrid Pomade I have ever used.</li>
            <li>also have Imperial&#x27;s regular Pomade and Gel-Pomade for when I need a more sturdy hold.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a smaller amount first to style.</li>
            <li>it holds well, goes into the hair easy, washes out easily and holds firm all day.  </li>
            <li>After blow dry -- go ahead and top it off with this pomade for that added shine/weight or whatever u need the pomade</li>
            <li>This product is definitely not greasy - it&#x27;s water based and washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>Must be a certain ingredient or two...</li>
            <li>This one is smack down the middle with the perfect hold that actually holds yet allows to maneuver thru out the evening.</li>
            <li>All 3 products are water based and very high quality.</li>
            <li>Fantastic water based product, it adds a little shine and extra sparkle (it does contain some kind of glitter).</li>
            <li>and I had to use twice as much</li>
            <li>This makes my morning routine so much quicker.</li>
            <li>As much as I am a fan of Imperial as a company, I can no longer recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Smells very fruity.</li>
            <li>Very easy to work with, almost gel-like, slight sheen.</li>
            <li>Better than expected!</li>
            <li>This is right up there with my usual favorite (Grants).</li>
            <li>The color, scent, hold, and texture of the new product is drastically different than the original container purchased six months ago.</li>
            <li>I use this and their classic product</li>
            <li>might try the classic pomade</li>
            <li>Really high shine.</li>
            <li>I need a little more shine for my frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have medium to short, medium-fine hair, that previously I would try to control with a combo of another popular pomade and maybe hair spray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right in the middle.</li>
            <li>a result, the new product induces curls, and seems to de-volumise your hair.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>Front of bottle not the exact same as the picture but at end of the day the pomade holds up.</li>
            <li>price is right at $25, especially when you consider this 6 ounce jar will last you 2-4 months depending how much product you use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a hair product for my thick but very fine hair for a couple years now.  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients seem to have changed when comparing the old and new containers, and water content seems to have gone up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes I will find a flake or two of the pomade after it has dried, but it is easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>The best thing is that after it&#x27;s dried in your hair, you can run your fingers through your hair to break up the hold a little more and even add a little more volume and take the shine down a little (for those of us who don&#x27;t want that shiny super slick look).&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>it must have come into contact with my sensitive pores and inflamed the hairline of my head.  </li>
            <li>caution if you have sensitive scalp/skin.</li>
            <li>back and forth with the manufacturer and finally have gotten it back to where it was with the original batch.</li>
            <li>So for starters, don&#x27;t put this on while your hair is wet right after the shower.  </li>
            <li>Im able to use a very small amount</li>
            <li>It really makes the curly hair straight and lie down.  </li>
            <li>I quality does not reflect the high price, after trying this product, it should be priced at $4, and I&#x27;ve tried several $5 products to compare.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the reason I like this particular pomade is because it&#x27;s not too strong and not too weak.</li>
            <li>And other pomades such as American Crew Pomade is too light.</li>
            <li>The old product (6 months old) is on the left and the new product purchased from Amazon on the left.</li>
            <li>I used my first jar in about 4 months, applying every other day to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a wet hair and apply product.</li>
            <li>I have also emailed Imperial directly to inquire about a possible change in the way the fiber pomade is made.</li>
            <li>I generally go with an undercut slicked back or sometimes a one-sided part with buzzed sides -- and this does the trick for me based on the look I want to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this stuff was not really thick and felt really wet.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a wet look, simply do not dry your hair completely before starting the process I mentioned above.  </li>
            <li>It did settle a little too fast, but nothing water cannot change.  </li>
            <li>the other reviewer on this board, then went ahead and acquired the new &#x27;corrected&#x27; product after waiting for a month.</li>

            <li> The best thing is that after it&#x27;s dried in your hair, you can run your fingers through your hair to break up the hold a little more and even add a little more volume and take the shine down a little (for those of us who don&#x27;t want that shiny super slick look).&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> it must have come into contact with my sensitive pores and inflamed the hairline of my head.  </li>
            <li> caution if you have sensitive scalp/skin.</li>
            <li> back and forth with the manufacturer and finally have gotten it back to where it was with the original batch.</li>
            <li> So for starters, don&#x27;t put this on while your hair is wet right after the shower.  </li>
            <li> Im able to use a very small amount</li>
            <li> It really makes the curly hair straight and lie down.  </li>
            <li> I quality does not reflect the high price, after trying this product, it should be priced at $4, and I&#x27;ve tried several $5 products to compare.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, the reason I like this particular pomade is because it&#x27;s not too strong and not too weak.</li>
            <li> And other pomades such as American Crew Pomade is too light.</li>
            <li> The old product (6 months old) is on the left and the new product purchased from Amazon on the left.</li>
            <li> I used my first jar in about 4 months, applying every other day to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a wet hair and apply product.</li>
            <li> I have also emailed Imperial directly to inquire about a possible change in the way the fiber pomade is made.</li>
            <li> I generally go with an undercut slicked back or sometimes a one-sided part with buzzed sides -- and this does the trick for me based on the look I want to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this stuff was not really thick and felt really wet.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a wet look, simply do not dry your hair completely before starting the process I mentioned above.  </li>
            <li> It did settle a little too fast, but nothing water cannot change.  </li>
            <li> the other reviewer on this board, then went ahead and acquired the new &#x27;corrected&#x27; product after waiting for a month.</li>
            <li> Not too powerful and not too dull like the Imperial Classic Pomade -- which to me has little to no shine.</li>
            <li> If I am a few weeks overdue for a haircut it keeps the sides clean and tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying various products over the last two years looking for a product that kept my hair in place while being loose enough to run my fingers through, and I&#x27;ve finally found it with Imperial Fiber Pomade.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is fizzy then you need to use a very tiny spare amount of matte paste (e.g. Redken Rough Paste, American Crew paste, Uppercut Featherweight, etc.)</li>
            <li> and it took twice as long.</li>
            <li> I generally use less than the quarter-sized amount they recommend, but note that it becomes harder to restyle later.</li>
            <li> Not too stiff and not so soft to where a gust of wind would make you run to the nearest mirror.  </li>
            <li> its a tiny bit sticky after it dries but other than that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to be used with dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for dry hair or helmet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I wear a side part), blow dry into place, and re-apply (think nickle-sized).  </li>
            <li> Not very much shine.</li>
            <li> on wet hair then blow dry to what u want.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have not had a change to the products, with that said, yes there was a slight difference in the last batch of Fiber.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> not really a pomade, it hardens but reactivates after you apply water.</li>
            <li> this product is not pliable unless you wet it.</li>
            <li> not to do: Do not use this with wet hair.</li>
            <li> , i use it almost everyday, and Ive only used maybe 1/8 of the container.</li>
            <li> It also has minimal scent to it.</li>
            <li> Apply a generous about of Matte Pomade paste to damp or just less than dry hair and mold you hair with your hands roughly to the way you style it.  </li>
            <li> were told that the manufacturer had a change in one of the raw materials in the last production.</li>
            <li> The consistency and the smell have changed drastically (in a negative way) as compared to the product that was sold until half way through 2014,  and the product no longer performs the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got in touch with the company and received the same response</li>
            <li> Never have had this happen before with other pomades and pastes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what some of the other reviewers were saying but its a water based product.</li>
            <li> For hair like mine, I towel + blow dry, apply a small amount (think dime-sized) throughout hair, style with comb</li>
            <li> No change was noted as compared to previous unsatisfactory</li>
            <li> Product holds hair well and allows for a slight bounce or shift.  </li>
            <li> I use less of the layrite pomade than the Imperial fiber pomade.</li>
            <li> I typically combine the Matte Pomade Paste and this Fiber Pomade which is one of the techniques demonstrated on their site.  </li>
            <li> But it still gets a little crunchy.  </li>
            <li> Firm hold all day and you just add a little water to your hair when you need to touch it up.</li>
            <li> I have very thick short hair</li>
            <li> I got it just a few days ago</li>
            <li> Does not feel heavy or greasy and do not need to use a lot of it for hair to be styled.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day at work and holds up to putting on and taking off a hat a few times a day.  </li>
            <li> since I&#x27;ve bought hair products close to $30 in the past, my issues is with the quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a byproduct of how it&#x27;s made</li>
            <li> a weak and at that price just not worth it.</li>
            <li> I had to throw this away about half way through as I got tired of putting up with the greasy feeling</li>
            <li> Hard to wash out.  </li>
            <li> It works well in thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have medium to slightly thick hair.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;*Weak, Weak Hold&lt;br /&gt;*Difficult</li>
            <li> It is very thick.  </li>
            <li> Also the smell in my opinion, is awful with this new jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but just looks a bit weird.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive</li>
            <li> be disappointed with the Fiber Pomade.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> not really a pomade, it hardens but reactivates after you apply water. more of a gel then pomade. hold is okay not too strong. this product is not pliable unless you wet it.</li>
            <li> This is my daily go-to hair product. I slick my hair back with some volume, and this is the best Hybrid Pomade I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t overly harden my hair and has a perfect amount of shine and hold. What&#x27;s best is you can re-comb your hair at any time by just applying some water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have Imperial&#x27;s regular Pomade and Gel-Pomade for when I need a more sturdy hold. All 3 products are water based and very high quality.</li>
            <li> Very nice texture and good hold. Not very much shine. I need a little more shine for my frizzy curly hair. What I do is mix it with the crew pomade, which doesn&#x27;t have very good hold but great shine, to get perfect balance of both.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Smells awesome, great hold, and I can wet my hair after work and restyle for the night.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Nice scent&lt;br /&gt;*Very easy to apply and spread across hair evenly&lt;br /&gt;*Nice container&lt;br /&gt;*Washes out like a gel&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*High Price&lt;br /&gt;*Weak, Weak Hold&lt;br /&gt;*Difficult to style&lt;br /&gt;*Hardens like a cheap hair gel&lt;br /&gt;*Loses its hold very quickly in the heat&lt;br /&gt;*Requires too much product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I can find several water-based products that out perform this pomade, American Crew Fiber, TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Separation Wax, Tigi Wax Stick. I also think for the price I can buy two Suavicito Pomades, a Layrite, Georgia Brown Pomade with much better quality. I didn&#x27;t have a problem paying $20, since I&#x27;ve bought hair products close to $30 in the past, my issues is with the quality. I quality does not reflect the high price, after trying this product, it should be priced at $4, and I&#x27;ve tried several $5 products to compare. I do not recommend this product, stay away, and find something else.</li>
            <li> Goopy. Have to wash hands a lot.</li>
            <li> Purchased many  times and very pleased!</li>
            <li> Best I have used.  It really makes the curly hair straight and lie down.  Does not flake or cause irritation.  It is very thick.  Lots of brushing is needed.</li>
            <li> This is a great pomade that smells great and the hold is just right.  Not too stiff and not so soft to where a gust of wind would make you run to the nearest mirror.  The shine is also just right (for my taste) as it isn&#x27;t super shiny like you would get from Crew pomade.  The best thing is that after it&#x27;s dried in your hair, you can run your fingers through your hair to break up the hold a little more and even add a little more volume and take the shine down a little (for those of us who don&#x27;t want that shiny super slick look).&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, for $25, its a great deal considering the 6 oz you get... oh and it&#x27;s also water-based, which means it washes out easily.</li>
            <li> This has sparkles in it!  I&#x27;m not into looking like Elton John on Broadway. At first I thought they would fade into my hair like JS SLOANE( great pomade btw) it didn&#x27;t and I looked like a fat disco ball all day.</li>
            <li> This is right up there with my usual favorite (Grants). Love the smell and how easily it washed out.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this for guys that need a stronger hold but dont want the traditional oilier look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my fair share of fiber, gels, waxes, etc. and this is the best so far. I got it just a few days ago and it&#x27;s just amazing. With this product, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it to style your hair. I used to use another brand and I had to use twice as much and it took twice as long. This makes my morning routine so much quicker.</li>
            <li> Works great! Easy to style and work with, holds great, smells sweet without being to over powering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of price points when it comes to pomade, the cheap $5 stuff from Walgreens up to crazy $35 jars from NYC boutiques and Imperial is THE BEST I&#x27;ve found so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is right at $25, especially when you consider this 6 ounce jar will last you 2-4 months depending how much product you use. I used my first jar in about 4 months, applying every other day to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds great! Has slight sheen that is attractive, smells great and NOT overpowering, allows my cologne to be the fragrance star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever buy a different pomade for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used over a dozen pomade products in the past couple years and this is by far the best for my hair and my needs. I generally go with an undercut slicked back or sometimes a one-sided part with buzzed sides -- and this does the trick for me based on the look I want to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What not to do: Do not use this with wet hair. It&#x27;s not intended to work for that purpose. It&#x27;s to be used with dry hair. If your hair is fizzy then you need to use a very tiny spare amount of matte paste (e.g. Redken Rough Paste, American Crew paste, Uppercut Featherweight, etc.) on wet hair then blow dry to what u want. After blow dry -- go ahead and top it off with this pomade for that added shine/weight or whatever u need the pomade for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a product that is to be used as a &amp;#34;helmet hair&amp;#34; product -- so if you&#x27;re doing a lot of biking or cycling and take your helmet off when you arrive to your destination - this is the product to use. It&#x27;s not a wet hair and apply product. It&#x27;s for dry hair or helmet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the reason I like this particular pomade is because it&#x27;s not too strong and not too weak. It&#x27;s just right in the middle. The Classic Pomade from Imperial seems way too strong for my needs. And other pomades such as American Crew Pomade is too light. This one is smack down the middle with the perfect hold that actually holds yet allows to maneuver thru out the evening. And the shine is also just right. Not too powerful and not too dull like the Imperial Classic Pomade -- which to me has little to no shine. This stuff, overall, is probably the best pomade from the dozens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The consistency and the smell have changed drastically (in a negative way) as compared to the product that was sold until half way through 2014,  and the product no longer performs the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got in touch with the company and received the same response the other reviewer on this board, then went ahead and acquired the new &#x27;corrected&#x27; product after waiting for a month. No change was noted as compared to previous unsatisfactory product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients seem to have changed when comparing the old and new containers, and water content seems to have gone up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, the new product induces curls, and seems to de-volumise your hair.  As much as I am a fan of Imperial as a company, I can no longer recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a hair product for my thick but very fine hair for a couple years now.  But, the search is finally over.  For hair like mine, I towel + blow dry, apply a small amount (think dime-sized) throughout hair, style with comb (I wear a side part), blow dry into place, and re-apply (think nickle-sized).  I&#x27;ve been trying various products over the last two years looking for a product that kept my hair in place while being loose enough to run my fingers through, and I&#x27;ve finally found it with Imperial Fiber Pomade.  If you are looking for a wet look, simply do not dry your hair completely before starting the process I mentioned above.  Again, I can not recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> Terrific product. Keeps my hair styled even after a nights rest.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. It is easy to work into your hair and it gently washes right out.&lt;br /&gt;This pomade is excellent if you have long hair and it works extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;It is not heavy and leaves your hair looking great with a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best!</li>
            <li> The best Pomade out their!</li>
            <li> great smell, hold, and shine.</li>
            <li> I had to throw this away about half way through as I got tired of putting up with the greasy feeling it left me with.  Hard to wash out.  Also--made the edge of my scalp itch.  Whenver I sweated (from working out) it must have come into contact with my sensitive pores and inflamed the hairline of my head.  Never have had this happen before with other pomades and pastes.  Even their matte pomade paste which I used to use.  Only this one had the problem for me.  Must be a certain ingredient or two...caution if you have sensitive scalp/skin.</li>
            <li> This is a first-class, one stop hair grooming product. I have medium to short, medium-fine hair, that previously I would try to control with a combo of another popular pomade and maybe hair spray. This eliminates that hassle. I t holds where I want it to, adds a nice sheen, and doesnâ€™t weigh down the top. If I am a few weeks overdue for a haircut it keeps the sides clean and tight.</li>
            <li> Better than expected! its a tiny bit sticky after it dries but other than that it holds well, goes into the hair easy, washes out easily and holds firm all day.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Product is really good but there is a bit of an issue I have with it. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a byproduct of how it&#x27;s made but there is a glitter effect from it. Holds well but just looks a bit weird.</li>
            <li> Love imperial products.  USA made and all have a very nice masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Great product. Has a strong hold, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like gel. It seems to work best when applied to damp, but not overly wet hair. I generally use less than the quarter-sized amount they recommend, but note that it becomes harder to restyle later.</li>
            <li> Great product, does exactly what other reviews said it would.  I use this and their classic product</li>
            <li> Good product, but careful as it will make your hair very shinny.</li>
            <li> Very nice but a bit to pricey  for me i would go threw a can a weak and at that price just not worth it.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t find much of a difference between the Fiber version and the regular Imperial pomade. Really high shine. Did not like that one bit. It was so shiny that a coworker commented on it. The smell is really sweet. You can&#x27;t smell it all throughout the day so that&#x27;s nice. Layrite gives a strong vanilla smell all day. So it does get points for that. I found this stuff was not really thick and felt really wet. I will use it since I bought it but I won&#x27;t be buying anymore.</li>
            <li> Smells very fruity. Has glitter for shine. Seems to have a hold some where between thres flores waterbased and layrite original pomade. A bit expensive and I would rather go with layrite instead.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff. Perfect styling product, smells so good, will restock for sure.</li>
            <li> Product holds hair well and allows for a slight bounce or shift.  Does not feel heavy or greasy and do not need to use a lot of it for hair to be styled. Sometimes I will find a flake or two of the pomade after it has dried, but it is easy to remove.  Front of bottle not the exact same as the picture but at end of the day the pomade holds up.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. It works well in thick hair. It did settle a little too fast, but nothing water cannot change.  Make sure you use a smaller amount first to style.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product line ive ever used. I don&#x27;t know what some of the other reviewers were saying but its a water based product. It washes out in seconds and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. Im able to use a very small amount and it lasts all day. Ive had one container of this for almost two months now, i use it almost everyday, and Ive only used maybe 1/8 of the container.</li>
            <li> this is an okay product. Depends what you are trying to achieve.  I have a couple of their hair products and haven&#x27;t quite found the right one for my hair, even when I try to combine them.  I wanted a moldable hold that is not crunchy.  So for starters, don&#x27;t put this on while your hair is wet right after the shower.  Damp hair only.  But it still gets a little crunchy.  I have very thick short hair and I do not like greasy stuff.  This product is definitely not greasy - it&#x27;s water based and washes out easily.  It also has minimal scent to it. It&#x27;s a challenge to find something that provides a moldable hold that I can restyle throughout the day.  I would not likely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic water based product, it adds a little shine and extra sparkle (it does contain some kind of glitter). Firm hold all day and you just add a little water to your hair when you need to touch it up. Washes out really easy without residual film or build up!</li>
            <li> UPDATE 9 Feb 2015&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Imperial emailed me back the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have not had a change to the products, with that said, yes there was a slight difference in the last batch of Fiber.&lt;br /&gt;We were told that the manufacturer had a change in one of the raw materials in the last production. We have since then&lt;br /&gt;gone back and forth with the manufacturer and finally have gotten it back to where it was with the original batch. You will&lt;br /&gt;not be disappointed with the Fiber Pomade. We are back ordered online now, however we re expecting it in stock any day.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your support.&lt;br /&gt;~~~&lt;br /&gt;Product change confirmed as a glitch; orders directly from Imperial should contain the original product. I have tried Layrite&#x27;s original pomade and it is working great. Only $14.99 for a  4oz size jar. I use less of the layrite pomade than the Imperial fiber pomade. Take your pick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a jar from my barber about six months ago. The jar I purchased in January 2015 is completely different. The color, scent, hold, and texture of the new product is drastically different than the original container purchased six months ago. I have added pictures for comparison and sent an email to imperial about a possible product change. The old product (6 months old) is on the left and the new product purchased from Amazon on the left. Notice the change in color. Also the smell in my opinion, is awful with this new jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try the classic pomade but my local barber stopped carrying Imperial products mentioning a possible product change. I have also emailed Imperial directly to inquire about a possible change in the way the fiber pomade is made. Will post review updates as able to.</li>
            <li> Great pomade for all types of hair</li>
            <li> Very easy to work with, almost gel-like, slight sheen. Washes out easily.</li>
            <li> My favorite pomade from Imperial.  Just the right amount of shine and the perfect amount of hold.  I have medium to slightly thick hair.  Bangs are about 4.5in and the rest is about 2-3in with the sides tapered. Lasts all day at work and holds up to putting on and taking off a hat a few times a day.  it is water soluble so it washes out super easy.  A touch of water will activate it if you need to restyle.  I get most of my compliments about my hair when I use this product.  If you go to the Imperial website they show you how to use their products and ways to maximize their effectiveness.  I typically combine the Matte Pomade Paste and this Fiber Pomade which is one of the techniques demonstrated on their site.  Apply a generous about of Matte Pomade paste to damp or just less than dry hair and mold you hair with your hands roughly to the way you style it.  Then take a bit of Fiber Pomade, rub it in you hands till your hands get warm, then spread the product over the top of your rough mold just to add the bit of shine.  After than comb to perfection.</li>
