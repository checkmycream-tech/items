            <li>the best!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an ideal gift for grandpa.</li>
            <li>Very good, inexpensive, good smelling lotion.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is so great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great after shave.</li>
            <li>My husband was happy to get this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a powdery floral scent, but good floral.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;User</li>
            <li>This is completely original and just as wonderful as it always was!</li>
            <li>Great Aftershave - Excellent price - Fast Shipping</li>
            <li>Smells great and is not so strong that it hurts to apply after shaving.  </li>
            <li>I honestly tried to like it for a day.  </li>
            <li>I like PINAUD products and continue to look for more.</li>
            <li>Nice robust scent without being sweet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it does a great job of revitalizing skin post-shave, but I cannot express my distaste for the smell enough.</li>
            <li>Just give it a chance, it may come of strong in the bottle</li>
            <li>Fragrance goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>This Clubman Lilac is definitely not for me and probably not for most people.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since the 1950&#x27;s, when I first I began to shave.</li>
            <li>this is a classic!</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Real men wear this!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Lilac Vegetal (The VEG) chooses you and it&#x27;s a honor to be chosen by the VEG!&lt;br /&gt;VEG on real men that wear the Lilac Vegetal!&lt;br /&gt;Real</li>
            <li>If there was no connection between the two smells, I believe this cologne would be much more widely</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a shame!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does remind me of a nursing home scent, or senior citizens.  </li>
            <li>Some after shaves and colognes say they are original, but when you get them, their formula DID change and they don&#x27;t have the same fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The scent is lightly floral and highly reminicent of the old-time babershop I patronized back in the 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not Clubman&#x27;s fault, since I&#x27;m sure this aftershave pre-dates the urinal cake by quite a few years.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing without a heavy feel.</li>
            <li>Exactly the same formula my husband remembered from high school in the 60&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li>I started using this many years ago when it still came in the heavy glass bottles.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I smell like an old man.  </li>
            <li>but it dries down to a sweet powdery/green/floral scent.</li>
            <li>This scent is somewhat different than my usual choices but it&#x27;s ok, wife likes it.</li>
            <li>I ended up throwing the full bottle away (and I rarely waste anything).  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> get me wrong, I love all the other Clubman colognes and aftershaves, and despite reading the reviews I decided to try the Lilac.  </li>
            <li> The scent is sharp, pungent, and did not mellow despite several reviews stating as such.  </li>

            <li> Great Aftershave - Excellent price - Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> this is a classic! My father used it and 50 years later it still smells the same. Nice robust scent without being sweet.</li>
            <li> I smell like an old man.  Which is what I was going for.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so great.  I really like it.  It&#x27;s a powdery floral scent, but good floral.  I&#x27;ve heard that John Wayne himself wore this.  It takes a man to wear it.</li>
            <li> Just give it a chance, it may come of strong in the bottle but it dries down to a sweet powdery/green/floral scent.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;User 20 days younger than saddam hussein.</li>
            <li> This is a great after shave. There is nothing like it.</li>
            <li> Wow! What a scent! Real men wear this!&lt;br /&gt;This is the smell of gunpowder, courage, and victory!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t listen to the ones that have not been chosen.&lt;br /&gt;The Lilac Vegetal (The VEG) chooses you and it&#x27;s a honor to be chosen by the VEG!&lt;br /&gt;VEG on real men that wear the Lilac Vegetal!&lt;br /&gt;Real men rock the VEG daily!&lt;br /&gt;Blessings!&lt;br /&gt;In Christ,&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews about the Clubman Lilac aftershave which claim it smells like a urinal cake, and I have to agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not Clubman&#x27;s fault, since I&#x27;m sure this aftershave pre-dates the urinal cake by quite a few years.  It&#x27;s just unfortunate that the scent was adopted by the makers of these cakes.  If there was no connection between the two smells, I believe this cologne would be much more widely accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love all the other Clubman colognes and aftershaves, and despite reading the reviews I decided to try the Lilac.  It&#x27;s not a horible smell like some others have said, but in my opinion it is not a scent that I equate with a gentleman.  In fact each time I tried it I am immediately reminded of a bar urinal smell.  (Not a pretty picture.)  It&#x27;s really a shame!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as others have said, it&#x27;s definitely an aftershave you either love or hate.  This is one I&#x27;ll pass on.</li>
            <li> Refreshing without a heavy feel.</li>
            <li> This Clubman Lilac is definitely not for me and probably not for most people. Sorry but it does have a urine / urinal smell.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same formula my husband remembered from high school in the 60&#x27;s!  Some after shaves and colognes say they are original, but when you get them, their formula DID change and they don&#x27;t have the same fragrance.  This is completely original and just as wonderful as it always was!</li>
            <li> the best! it smells like 1890!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since the 1950&#x27;s, when I first I began to shave. The product has remained unchanged since then even though at that time it was imported from France. The scent is lightly floral and highly reminicent of the old-time babershop I patronized back in the 50&#x27;s.  As a post-shave lotion it is quite soothing.&lt;br /&gt;It is an ideal gift for grandpa. It will take him back.</li>
            <li> I like the Clubman Pinaud &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; but was feeling like trying something different so I ordered a the Lilac Vegetal.  I am not a fan of this stuff.  It really does remind me of a nursing home scent, or senior citizens.  Musty, floral, sharp, and septic.  I honestly tried to like it for a day.  My wife did not care for it either.  I ended up throwing the full bottle away (and I rarely waste anything).  The scent is sharp, pungent, and did not mellow despite several reviews stating as such.  It smells womanly in my opinion.  I would NOT want to submit my co-workers to this scent.  I&#x27;m sure it does a great job of revitalizing skin post-shave, but I cannot express my distaste for the smell enough.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The Veg&amp;#34; chooses you, you do not choose to wear &amp;#34;The Veg&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> BOUGHT AS GIFT FOR MY FATHER FOR CHRISTMAS. HE ASKED ME FOR THIS SPECIFICALLY SO THAT IS WHAT I GOT FOR HIM.</li>
            <li> My husband was happy to get this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I began shaving 50 years ago.  Fragrance goes away quickly.  The few other products on the market are marketing gimmicks.</li>
            <li> I like PINAUD products and continue to look for more. This scent is somewhat different than my usual choices but it&#x27;s ok, wife likes it.</li>
            <li> just like the barber shop smell as stated.</li>
            <li> I started using this many years ago when it still came in the heavy glass bottles.  CVS finally stopped stocking it, and so I&#x27;ve been getting it from Amazon.  Smells great and is not so strong that it hurts to apply after shaving.  Very good, inexpensive, good smelling lotion.  Highly recommended.</li>
