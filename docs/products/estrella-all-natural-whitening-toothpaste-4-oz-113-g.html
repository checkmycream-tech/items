            <li>It took about 2 months of consistent use</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy it at my local health food store.</li>

            <li>Really, look it up . . .)</li>
            <li>and I love it, but recently took a look at the ingredients and saw it has grapefruit oil, which I&#x27;m sensitive to.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is actually removing the tea stains from my teeth, all natural ingredients, I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and looking at other paste and their ingredients</li>
            <li>I have braces right now, so my teeth seemed to be staining more than usual.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of the following regimen I am pleased to report that my gums are actually returning to health and the recession is filling in.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth and couldn&#x27;t take the hot/cold change very well.</li>
            <li>Leaves mouth fresh and clean, does not taste like other all natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel extra clean and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>So far I cannot tell if it really is whitening.</li>
            <li>It totally does what it says it will do which is so rare these days.  </li>
            <li>A tiny bit goes a long way, so even though the price is higher, you are getting your money&#x27;s worth!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re tired of being a walking treatment plant for the hazardous waste from big industry, Estrella is a great addition to your daily deal.  </li>
            <li>I think this toothpaste may be worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>I like it because its all natural!.</li>

            <li>Instead of wasting the tube,I have it to my health conscious daughter.</li>
            <li>Taste is unusual but after a few uses I&#x27;ve grown to like it.&lt;br /&gt;Product is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>your mouth is like what is this; but by the second brushing my mouth was alive.  </li>
            <li>Worth it IMO to avoid toxic ingredients like fluoride (actually fluorosilicic acid, extracted from the smokestack scrubbers required by the EPA in aluminum, agri fertilizer, and other hazmat-producing industries) and the other iffy ingredients found in store toothpastes.  </li>

            <li> it keeps your teeth feeling freshly brushed all day long!</li>
            <li> but my teeth are whiter than they have ever been as long as I recall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll use it long term because of the price:</li>
            <li> When I ran out and had to use my old toothpaste I was in shock at the difference in how my teeth were polished and  how my entire mouth felt dull.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few other natural toothpastes before I discovered Estrella in a Chinaberry catalog.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a day or two you will notice less &amp;#34;fuzziness&amp;#34; on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand the concern that this is expensive toothpaste, but it is actually less $$ than I was paying with better results.</li>
            <li> Only need to use a little at a time</li>
            <li> A little bit does indeed go a long way which makes it comparable to other toothpastes in a brushes per tube sense.  </li>
            <li> Wife and I are now convinced that other toothpastes use &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; this is so concentrated in comparison.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any negative side effects from it, but I&#x27;ll probably intersperse my use of it with Tom&#x27;s of Maine to cut down my chances of possible allergic reaction to the grapefruit.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of black tea and this product keeps my teeth from staining.</li>
            <li> It is a little too chalky for me.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey for toothpaste,but you get what you pay for and if you shop around you can find it a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a few months</li>
            <li> After using it twice a day for a few weeks I can tell my teeth are whiter and the stains are fading.</li>
            <li> so I use very little</li>
            <li> A bit spendy, but it takes very little.  </li>
            <li> If you are a fanatic about chemicals you probably wont mind this.</li>
            <li> ; not happy with it</li>
            <li> so it is difficult to find toothpaste.</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> you won&#x27;t use anything else after trying this!</li>
            <li> great product, really whitens teeth.  Only need to use a little at a time</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of black tea and this product keeps my teeth from staining. Great taste, too!</li>
            <li> It took about 2 months of consistent use but I am not a believer. My gums have never looked this healthy!</li>
            <li> This was worth the price of admission.  4 shades whiter in 2wks, great texture, great taste.  A little bit does indeed go a long way which makes it comparable to other toothpastes in a brushes per tube sense.  Gives teeth a nice shine and fresh breath lasts a long time.  Wife and I are now convinced that other toothpastes use &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; this is so concentrated in comparison.  I&#x27;ve recommended this to family and friends.  Best on the market I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was touted as excellent for sensitive teeth. It is definitely better than any well-marketed brand that I&#x27;ve ever tried. I never have a problem with my teeth at all now and I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years. Yay! Buy it. Do it.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I have ever used. It totally does what it says it will do which is so rare these days.  Enjoy</li>
            <li> Seems to be whitening my teeth! Good flavor and love that is natural!</li>
            <li> I like anything that is natural and healthy and this one is it. It&#x27;s pricey so I use very little but I feel that a &amp;#34;pea size&amp;#34; amount does not feel like enough. :(&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I tried a few other natural toothpastes before I discovered Estrella in a Chinaberry catalog.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since!&lt;br /&gt;I love the taste, how clean my mouth, teeth feel and how white my teeth are!</li>
            <li> It works like it is supposed to.  Really like this toothpaste.  I used to be able to buy it at my local health food store. (I&#x27;ve been using it for years) but they no longer carry it.  Thank goodness for Amazin</li>
            <li> But oh so worth it, tastes great, it is safe has no fluoride and really makes your teeth white. Love It</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste!  I want to avoid fluoride however possible, and this toothpaste is free of the toxin.  A bit spendy, but it takes very little.  Worth it IMO to avoid toxic ingredients like fluoride (actually fluorosilicic acid, extracted from the smokestack scrubbers required by the EPA in aluminum, agri fertilizer, and other hazmat-producing industries) and the other iffy ingredients found in store toothpastes.  If you&#x27;re tired of being a walking treatment plant for the hazardous waste from big industry, Estrella is a great addition to your daily deal.  Cleaning-wise, nothing in a tube at Wally World even comes close.  Tastes fantastic, too.</li>
            <li> Great Toothpaste. Your teeth feel extra clean and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> this dentist has made an excellent product. whitening results are immediate, but it has to be kept up as a cup of tea or anything that can stain will undo the results. i always look for products which have safe ingredients and are cruelty free. this is the one for that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a few months and I love it, but recently took a look at the ingredients and saw it has grapefruit oil, which I&#x27;m sensitive to.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any negative side effects from it, but I&#x27;ll probably intersperse my use of it with Tom&#x27;s of Maine to cut down my chances of possible allergic reaction to the grapefruit.</li>
            <li> While the ingredients seem healthful, the so-called whitening aspect of this paste did not work for me. At this price per tube, it should do what it says it is supposed to do. Will definitely not re-purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite toothpaste!  A tiny bit goes a long way, so even though the price is higher, you are getting your money&#x27;s worth!  I actually think this toothpaste has helped my gums.  It does a beautiful job on my teeth, but isn&#x27;t harsh.  I truly love this product!!!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> this is good toothpaste but there are some others that are a bit better and taste better also.</li>
            <li> Good product...highly recommend</li>
            <li> Really does help make your teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> Your teeth won&#x27;t be eye blinding white but you will see a difference.  Taste is unusual but after a few uses I&#x27;ve grown to like it.&lt;br /&gt;Product is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this product. Leaves mouth fresh and clean, does not taste like other all natural toothpastes. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this product I was unsure just like products that contain baking soda your mouth is like what is this; but by the second brushing my mouth was alive.  When I ran out and had to use my old toothpaste I was in shock at the difference in how my teeth were polished and  how my entire mouth felt dull.  I love this product and looking at other paste and their ingredients I do not feel the need to try them because this one is great and non that I found have what this offers.</li>
            <li> Great tasting, no fluoride; however has carrageenan (found naturally in seaweed which is good for you) for which there is a debate about its health efficacy for human consumption. In my understanding concentration seems to be most important. Humans have a funny habit of distilling/ concentrating things to levels not found in non-human-influenced-nature. I will be doing more research. Until then though, this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> How to review toothpaste? First do no harm. This whitens as well as my dentist cleaning and he notices. Just enough abrasion. This is pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to sodium laurel sulfate and sorbitol so it is difficult to find toothpaste. This is a great product even if you aren&#x27;t allergic to those substances. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone. My husband prefers it and he could use any toothpaste. Thank heavens for Amazon. Would not have found it otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for about a year.  Not crazy about the taste but I do notice that it is very effective in whitening.  To counteract the taste, I use a little of another peppermint whitening toothpaste with it and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I read about this toothpaste in the Chinaberry catalogue, and decided to try it when I noticed with dismay that my recent gum transplant was receding AGAIN! I had been using a $50 per-tube high-end whitening brand which maintained but did not increase my level of whitening. After two weeks of the following regimen I am pleased to report that my gums are actually returning to health and the recession is filling in. Not only that, but my teeth are whiter than they have ever been as long as I recall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Brush after breakfast with Estrella.&lt;br /&gt;2. Brush after dinner with Estrella. (Don&#x27;t use water as this method is said to be more effective at getting rid of the bacteria that cause gingivitis and recession.)&lt;br /&gt;3. Floss thoroughly, then brush again lightly with water to remove anything dislodged by flossing. Brush tongue. Rinse thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;4. Before bed, swish and thoroughly agitate 1 tsp of pure coconut oil throughout mouth for 20 minutes. The oil supposedly kills and disables the plaque causing bacteria. After a day or two you will notice less &amp;#34;fuzziness&amp;#34; on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand the concern that this is expensive toothpaste, but it is actually less $$ than I was paying with better results. Wish I had found it before the gum transplant. Considering the cost of most dental procedures (and the new findings that Alzheimers may be influenced by plaque causing bacteria in the mouth that enter the bloodstream during invasive dental procedures! Really, look it up . . .) I think this toothpaste may be worth it in the long run. Try it!</li>
            <li> If you are a fanatic about chemicals you probably wont mind this. It is a little too chalky for me. So far I cannot tell if it really is whitening.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is actually removing the tea stains from my teeth, all natural ingredients, I love it.</li>
            <li> I used this toothpaste for about two weeks before I gave it to my daughter. I have very sensitive teeth and couldn&#x27;t take the hot/cold change very well. It did start to whiten my teeth and the taste wasn&#x27;t that bad,also a pea size amount does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;  Instead of wasting the tube,I have it to my health conscious daughter. She has called and begged me to send her another tube when she started to run out. She loves this paste and since she can read all the ingredients &amp; there is no fluoride that&#x27;s even better. It is a little pricey for toothpaste,but you get what you pay for and if you shop around you can find it a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> Not too sweet. Makes my teeth feel wonderful</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. I feel so comfortable using it because of its all natural ingrediates and does such a great job.</li>
            <li> My wife says this is the best for sensitive teeth .</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste. Turned my son&#x27;s yellow teeth white.</li>
            <li> love this toothpaste! it has  a mild cinnamony minty flavor! it keeps your teeth feeling freshly brushed all day long! would definetly reccomend;)</li>
            <li> i have sensitive gums and this seems to irritate..have used vita-myr for years and love it. a friend recommended this so i gave it a try; not happy with it</li>
            <li> My teeth feel sooo clean when I use this. After using it twice a day for a few weeks I can tell my teeth are whiter and the stains are fading. I have braces right now, so my teeth seemed to be staining more than usual. I like it because its all natural!. Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll use it long term because of the price:( Great product all around.</li>
