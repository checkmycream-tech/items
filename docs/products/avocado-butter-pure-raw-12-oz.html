            <li>It came in a padded package with a happy face on it. :)</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>After months of usage, I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li>It was surprised since I tried this butter before and wasn&#x27;t impressed at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just one of the best of the many natural products you can use.</li>
            <li>I got this to try in my hair since I react to many nut butters and oils.</li>
            <li>I still love it.</li>
            <li>So I would recommend that Dr. Adorable do a better job of labeling their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>I also love that there is no stron smell like Shea butter, and its also a softer butter than shea.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it works much better at softening my 4c hair, without the smell.</li>
            <li>Product is OK...</li>
            <li>great products for natural hair</li>
            <li>smell is not too pleasant , hard to describe, but works great for moisturizing.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s just as creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I mix this product with my shea and it makes it so smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li>enjoy</li>
            <li>video may shed a bit of light on how to get it out of the jar.</li>
            <li>Spreads smoothly as well.</li>
            <li>this is my new favorite!  </li>
            <li>And there products are cost friendly.</li>
            <li>and shea butter irritates my skin, so I decided to order this butter along with sweet almond</li>
            <li>was very pleased with the container (it was an actually jar w/</li>
            <li>love the fact that it is completely organic.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>This Raw Avocado Butter is great</li>
            <li>At least with detailed labeling as to what&#x27;s in the product, people feel a bit more confident in their choice to purchase what they feel is beneficial to them.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to be good because it made me a little itchy</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like the first order I got.</li>
            <li>I purchased avocado butter years ago from a different company and this butter seems to be better on my hair.</li>
            <li>(you need to place the bottle under running hot water and let it melt)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is light &amp; absorbs quickly even on my combanation skin (oily face &amp; dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odorless with a solid consistency that melts fairly easily.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day who really knows what&#x27;s in anything anymore?</li>
            <li>If you use too much, your hair may become too oily.  </li>
            <li>a screw on lid) &amp; the fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m however getting some sort of inflammatory skin reaction near my left eye that I want to believe is a result of changing my skin care routine to oil cleansing rather than this avocado butter which I really love and have not yet put on my skin.</li>
            <li>I received this in a small nice tub (not the dreaded bottle I&#x27;d been led to believe by the reviews on here) and it&#x27;s quite a large amount.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my hair pretty soft.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to go outside of the oils I already use (sweet almond oil &amp; avocado)</li>
            <li>However, unlike candle wax, as soon as you scrape some out of the jar (with fingers or a tool of some sort), it melts in the hands easily or liquefies in a microwavable dish (just be careful to watch</li>
            <li>The high quality product</li>
            <li>This product is super light, which is something I can hardly find for my hair type.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product and would say its definitely a keeper and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have tried Shea &amp; Cocoa Butters in the past but, neither compare to my new love Avocado Butter.  </li>
            <li>It is a staple in my natural hair regimen!</li>
            <li>Whenever a company doesn&#x27;t have ingredients/product info on a label, consumers are led to believe that the product may be something other than what originally believed (if that makes sense).</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft without it feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African-American with natural  4c hair (no chemicals)</li>
            <li>Not pure, gritty and does not whip smooth, This company is not producing quality products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I love this product and it takes care of my dry skin but takes a little time for skin to absorb.</li>
            <li>Since most people seem to use this for hair (and the remaining few for skin), I thought that I should give tips on exactly HOW to get the product out of the jar (it is, in fact, as tough as candle wax).</li>

            <li> I received this in a small nice tub (not the dreaded bottle I&#x27;d been led to believe by the reviews on here) and it&#x27;s quite a large amount. It&#x27;s odorless with a solid consistency that melts fairly easily. I got this to try in my hair since I react to many nut butters and oils. At first, I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to be good because it made me a little itchy but that&#x27;s subsided and it leaves my hair pretty soft. I&#x27;m however getting some sort of inflammatory skin reaction near my left eye that I want to believe is a result of changing my skin care routine to oil cleansing rather than this avocado butter which I really love and have not yet put on my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the first order I got. But, it&#x27;s just as creamy and smooth. I still love it.</li>
            <li> love the fact that it is completely organic. great glide! it is great for massage. i will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this butter along with almond butter for my hair and I am so glad I did! I purchased avocado butter years ago from a different company and this butter seems to be better on my hair. I became curious again of this butter after hearing about it through YouTube hair vlogger Naturalme4c. I was in the market for a butter to use during these cold months and I didn&#x27;t want to go outside of the oils I already use (sweet almond oil &amp; avocado) and shea butter irritates my skin, so I decided to order this butter along with sweet almond butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This butter is great and my hair responds to it wonderfully with smoothness, softness and pliability. It was surprised since I tried this butter before and wasn&#x27;t impressed at all. So I can only assume that the ingredients and how it was processed are just different from the prior company I ordered avocado butter from. The one thing I will say it that I don&#x27;t care for is the lack luster labeling. At the end of the day who really knows what&#x27;s in anything anymore? At least with detailed labeling as to what&#x27;s in the product, people feel a bit more confident in their choice to purchase what they feel is beneficial to them. So I would recommend that Dr. Adorable do a better job of labeling their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s a great butter!</li>
            <li> Same as the review for the aloe butter. Not pure, gritty and does not whip smooth, This company is not producing quality products.</li>
            <li> I wished the product came in a tub as advertised instead of plastic bottle, made it difficult to get out of the bottle since it&#x27;s butter!! (you need to place the bottle under running hot water and let it melt)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I love this product and it takes care of my dry skin but takes a little time for skin to absorb.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on a review. I did not realize this product would be difficulty to use on hair. Getting it out of the jar was also difficult.</li>
            <li> The high quality product</li>
            <li> This site is absolutely wonderful. And there products are cost friendly. I order this butter because I use is constantly the quality was great!!! I mix it with shea butter and its a great moisturizer when doing the LOC method.</li>
            <li> The avocado butter was moisturizing for my hair and body which made it great!  It wasn&#x27;t greasy at all!  Would definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft without it feeling greasy. This is my first time using this product and would say its definitely a keeper and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I will repurchase in the future when it runs out, which seems like a long time from now. I use this to seal and moisturize and it provides lots of moisture. Definitely a Holy Grail product.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this butter. It is a staple in my natural hair regimen!</li>
            <li> great products for natural hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just one of the best of the many natural products you can use. I&#x27;m loving it you have to try it.</li>
            <li> I mix this product with my shea and it makes it so smooth and creamy.  Used on the skin it is not greasy. enjoy</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that my hair loves and keeps moisturized!  I&#x27;m African-American with natural  4c hair (no chemicals) and I use this avocado butter to seal in the moisture using the LOC method, and I haven&#x27;t had a dry day yet.  A little goes a long way.  If you use too much, your hair may become too oily.  I will order again!</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff!! It is a great consistency! I also love that there is no stron smell like Shea butter, and its also a softer butter than shea.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it works much better at softening my 4c hair, without the smell. Would recommend it to all naturals</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo9DTB50HYRV2Y]]I bought this for hair a few months back as an alternative to shea butter. It came in a padded package with a happy face on it. :) After months of usage, I love it! It helps soften hair and skin, and helps the hair and skin retain moisture. Unlike shea butter, this avocado butter doesn&#x27;t have a scent. The one thing that bothered me is that it doesn&#x27;t have ingredients/product info listed and I can&#x27;t seem to find the company online. Whenever a company doesn&#x27;t have ingredients/product info on a label, consumers are led to believe that the product may be something other than what originally believed (if that makes sense). Eh, at least it works, right? o__O&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS Since most people seem to use this for hair (and the remaining few for skin), I thought that I should give tips on exactly HOW to get the product out of the jar (it is, in fact, as tough as candle wax). However, unlike candle wax, as soon as you scrape some out of the jar (with fingers or a tool of some sort), it melts in the hands easily or liquefies in a microwavable dish (just be careful to watch it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My video may shed a bit of light on how to get it out of the jar.</li>
            <li> Very good butter. smell is not too pleasant , hard to describe, but works great for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This Raw Avocado Butter is great this is my new favorite!  I have tried Shea &amp; Cocoa Butters in the past but, neither compare to my new love Avocado Butter.  I use this on the face, neck, on my scalp &amp; all over.  It is light &amp; absorbs quickly even on my combanation skin (oily face &amp; dry skin).&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with the container (it was an actually jar w/ a screw on lid) &amp; the fast shipping.  I will be buying this again &amp; again.</li>
            <li> This product is super light, which is something I can hardly find for my hair type. Spreads smoothly as well.</li>
            <li> Product is OK... I use it as a night cream... I was thinking it was going to come in the container shown on the picture, but they put it in a bottle and it is very hard to get the butter out! I had to cut the bottle out and move the butter to another container. will not order this from this company again.</li>
