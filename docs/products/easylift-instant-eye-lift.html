    <ol>
            <li>Yup, they lift wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I did not buy it thinking it would be the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>But I am happy that it raises my droopy eye lid that I inherited!</li>
            <li>You will be very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>This works great.  </li>
            <li>I use a good magninfying  mirror tweezers  .</li>
            <li>Easy to do, works so nice.</li>
            <li>ANYONE has this problem &amp; found a product that they love</li>
            <li>Product is just okay.</li>
            <li>While satisfied with me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments.</li>
            <li>But I tried it 1 time and totally love it.  </li>
            <li>You can just rinse with warm water and they&#x27;ll come right off.</li>
            <li>I found the product easy to use and apply.</li>
            <li>I also think they are really easy to put on.</li>
            <li>fairly easy to use</li>
            <li>I was surprised how effective this was in changing my appearance.</li>
            <li>You make a few mistakes trying to figure out the ideal place, but once you get it, it&#x27;s cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>vision is better and my eyes look so much prettier.  </li>
            <li>then you can move it if it not in the right place, I really did find it very easy, and made my eyes look awake .</li>
            <li>It is hard to work with, but I was happy with the end results before I am able to get eyelid surgery.</li>
            <li>I wanted a slight lift for my eyelids for special occasions and they work great for me.  </li>
            <li>I have found that when I put taupe or light brown colored powder shadow on first, the tapes do not show at all.</li>
            <li>I used them right out of the box.</li>
            <li>I ptosis in the right eye.</li>
            <li>have to put them close to if not on the fold to get the right &amp;#34;lift.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been using them for over a week and they get easier to apply every day as I get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>My sister loves these things &amp; they do lift the eye &amp; make them look more open.</li>
            <li>when I first saw this product I thought, REALLY!?  </li>
            <li>The Easy Life Instant Eye Life did lift my eyelids as it claims.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it takes hardly any stickiness to keep them in place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does require a second person to fit them.</li>
            <li>Very cumbersome process to put it on.&lt;br /&gt;opaque and visible.&lt;br /&gt;waste of money</li>
            <li>haha, I forget to remove it from my eyes before going to bed at night</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t put too much of the paste on tab</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I am an older woman</li>
            <li>My husband is scheduled for an eyelid lift in a few months and I was surprised that they help him see better.  </li>
            <li>(EasyLift does a much better job at the actual lifting part) &amp; tried putting them on top of the easylifts, which did make it better, but it was so hard to double them up &amp; align them perfectly due to the different sizes, that it&#x27;s just not realistic that I&#x27;ll be wasting that much time every morning trying to achieve the desired effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend easylift  to anyone with baggy loose skin eyes , so easy to use just follow the instructions if u have loose skin the tabs fit in between , push skin up and the other skin hides the tab....</li>
            <li>You can clearly see the tape and there is no way of hiding it with makeup.</li>

            <li> You can clearly see the tape and there is no way of hiding it with makeup.</li>
            <li> With the other, I found that pulling the lid a little taut upward helped it into the right position.</li>
            <li> The strips are not clear, they are opaque.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several positions to make them less obvious.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting them on the right way that doesn&#x27;t pull the eyelid down or crease it!</li>
            <li> I saw a few negative reviews for this product and figure that the people who don&#x27;t like it probably don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li> They do not show on me if I position them carefully.  </li>
            <li> I am not much into taking time for reveiws, BUT . .  </li>
            <li> I guess like any other parts of the body, not each eyelid is identical.</li>
            <li> So I go from feeling self-conscious due to my sagging eyelid to feeling self-conscious that people are staring at my eyes trying to figure what the hell is going on up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is slightly visible when I look down but not much.</li>
            <li> the down side is wearing eye make up shadow , it will not hold any colour at all , I put shadow in the space between  my eye and tab</li>
            <li> even use an eye cream a half hour or so before I put them on and it doesn&#x27;t affect the staying</li>
            <li> After a little practice, I found that applying them just adds a minute or so to my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> Once I learned how to place it, my eyelid was lifted a little.  </li>
            <li> maybe my eyelids are too heavy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford surgery that usually takes care of this problem.</li>
            <li> As usual, my vanity led me to spend money for a scam.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to use and had no effect whatsoever, other than to frustrate me during the application, and disappoint me with the results.</li>
            <li> This is a totally worthless product if you are wanting to lift your eyelid a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried cutting them, putting makeup on under/over-nothing helps.</li>
            <li> I go from having no eyelid to &#x27;holy crap</li>
            <li> so one of my eyelids sags horribly).</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I had eye fatigue and this cured it.  This works great.  It does require a second person to fit them.</li>
            <li> Very cumbersome process to put it on.&lt;br /&gt;opaque and visible.&lt;br /&gt;waste of money</li>
            <li> I was surprised how effective this was in changing my appearance. I couldn&#x27;t afford surgery that usually takes care of this problem. EasyLift opens my eyes up. I&#x27;ve just ordered my second box. I used them right out of the box. I found the product easy to use and apply. [[ASIN:B006425FWQ EasyLift Instant Eye Lift]] I had no problem whatsoever with one lid. With the other, I found that pulling the lid a little taut upward helped it into the right position. I guess like any other parts of the body, not each eyelid is identical. If you run into something like this, just work with it a bit as I described. I use powder eye makeup as I did before.  It stays put all day or evening.</li>
            <li> Does not work. It is very obvious you have plastic strip on your eyelid. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a totally worthless product if you are wanting to lift your eyelid a little. Doesn&#x27;t happen!! See an eye Doctor!</li>
            <li> Yup, they lift wonderfully. I go from having no eyelid to &#x27;holy crap I have an eyelid!&#x27; It makes my eyes look open, make me look younger/my age (i&#x27;m 25 &amp; caucasian but had a cyst removed from my eyebrow so one of my eyelids sags horribly). I also think they are really easy to put on. You make a few mistakes trying to figure out the ideal place, but once you get it, it&#x27;s cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUUUUUT if you raise your eyebrows or close your eyes it is SO OBVIOUS. The strips are not clear, they are opaque. I&#x27;ve tried cutting them, putting makeup on under/over-nothing helps. So I go from feeling self-conscious due to my sagging eyelid to feeling self-conscious that people are staring at my eyes trying to figure what the hell is going on up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigh. I even bought the double-sided eyelid strips ( [[ASIN:B000V2F6BU D.U.P Wonder Eyelid Tape Extra - 120 pcs]] ), which don&#x27;t work well enough for me alone (EasyLift does a much better job at the actual lifting part) &amp; tried putting them on top of the easylifts, which did make it better, but it was so hard to double them up &amp; align them perfectly due to the different sizes, that it&#x27;s just not realistic that I&#x27;ll be wasting that much time every morning trying to achieve the desired effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If ANYONE has this problem &amp; found a product that they love, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let me know!</li>
            <li> It does the Job I was hoping for. I did not buy it thinking it would be the perfect solution. But I am happy that it raises my droopy eye lid that I inherited! So...that is why I gave it 5 stars. My downfall...haha, I forget to remove it from my eyes before going to bed at night</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell a difference...maybe my eyelids are too heavy..won&#x27;t purchase again..</li>
            <li> Product is just okay. fairly easy to use but doesn&#x27;t cover enough area, so it just moves the excess to another area.</li>
            <li> You can clearly see the tape and there is no way of hiding it with makeup. I tried covering it up with foundation, shadow, eyeliner and nothing worked. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> If this product is used correctly, it satisfies the product&#x27;s claims.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this item, so this speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting them on the right way that doesn&#x27;t pull the eyelid down or crease it!</li>
            <li> Finally got! I ptosis in the right eye. I would like to a longer tape. Only two days learning to use. While satisfied with me.</li>
            <li> I can see my eye makeup now!  I am an older woman and I use this product to lift my drooping eyelids.  Works great!&lt;br /&gt;My vision is better and my eyes look so much prettier.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments.</li>
            <li> As usual, my vanity led me to spend money for a scam.  Did not work as advertised...oh, it stuck alright, but was noticeable and ugly.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
            <li> My sister loves these things &amp; they do lift the eye &amp; make them look more open. I don&#x27;t like it that you can see them &amp; I&#x27;ve tried several positions to make them less obvious.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money. It does not do what the seller claims it will do. It is very difficult to use and had no effect whatsoever, other than to frustrate me during the application, and disappoint me with the results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a twofold reason.  I wanted a slight lift for my eyelids for special occasions and they work great for me.  They do not show on me if I position them carefully.  My husband is scheduled for an eyelid lift in a few months and I was surprised that they help him see better.  He uses them daily and we even reuse them.</li>
            <li> I am not much into taking time for reveiws, BUT . .  when I first saw this product I thought, REALLY!?  (Thinking it was going to be a joke)  But I tried it 1 time and totally love it.  Easy to do, works so nice.</li>
            <li> I would recommend easylift  to anyone with baggy loose skin eyes , so easy to use just follow the instructions if u have loose skin the tabs fit in between , push skin up and the other skin hides the tab.... the down side is wearing eye make up shadow , it will not hold any colour at all , I put shadow in the space between  my eye and tab a brown works well ,,mascara eyeliner on bottom outer lid . I use a good magninfying  mirror tweezers  . don&#x27;t put too much of the paste on tab then you can move it if it not in the right place, I really did find it very easy, and made my eyes look awake . will def buy them again .. thanks</li>
            <li> They work like they say they do. You will be very happy with this product. so try it today..thank you!</li>
            <li> The Easy Life Instant Eye Life did lift my eyelids as it claims.  It is hard to work with, but I was happy with the end results before I am able to get eyelid surgery.</li>
            <li> I saw a few negative reviews for this product and figure that the people who don&#x27;t like it probably don&#x27;t really need it. I&#x27;m mid 60s, caucasian, and have saggy eyelids. I have found that when I put taupe or light brown colored powder shadow on first, the tapes do not show at all. Positioned correctly, they do not show, even when blinking.&lt;br /&gt;You have to put them close to if not on the fold to get the right &amp;#34;lift.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been using them for over a week and they get easier to apply every day as I get the hang of it. Also, use the gel that comes with it -- they&#x27;re way too sticky without it. Surprisingly, it takes hardly any stickiness to keep them in place.&lt;br /&gt;I even use an eye cream a half hour or so before I put them on and it doesn&#x27;t affect the staying power.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t make me look like a 20-year-old, but my eyes are open and brighter looking. After a minute or so, I forget they&#x27;re on. They stay on all day.&lt;br /&gt;Removing them is no problem. You can just rinse with warm water and they&#x27;ll come right off. Or peel them off; it&#x27;s painless.&lt;br /&gt;I tried sleeping with them on one night after reading a review from someone who said they do that. I won&#x27;t do it again, but not because there was any problem. It&#x27;s just that I like using an eye cream at night.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder these and keep using them until I can afford eyelid surgery. After a little practice, I found that applying them just adds a minute or so to my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> Once I learned how to place it, my eyelid was lifted a little.  It is slightly visible when I look down but not much.</li>
