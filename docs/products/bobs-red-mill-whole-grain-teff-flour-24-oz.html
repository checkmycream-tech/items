    <ol>
            <li>Delicious great product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tasted very good and has a pungent aroma!</li>
            <li>Makes great injera bread.  </li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>great for baking with brown rice flour</li>
            <li>The muffins I had intended to make turned out great.  </li>
            <li>Teff flour makes great crepes and it is not GMO.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>so the product is always good quality.</li>
            <li>I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very interesting flavor.</li>
            <li>First, you need to know that GF flours need to be blended together to get the best results, not used alone, when you are baking.</li>
            <li>My bread bakes up a beautiful chocolaty brown color with rich flavor.</li>
            <li>I think I need to try Teff in more recipes to give it a fair rating.</li>
            <li>Rare grain but healthy and delicious.</li>
            <li>You can take almost any recipe for rice flour pancakes and replace it with teff to get a nice, hearty, filling, full-flavored, nutritious pancake.</li>
            <li>If I was baking bread, Amaranth bread would offer more starch 111-71&#x3D;40gr which translates into more calories but for cardio, it is well needed.</li>
            <li>Makes nice light breakfast pancakes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still figuring out how to use it appropriately.</li>
            <li>Have yet to successfully use it, but expectations are high.</li>
            <li>One of the ingredients in many of he recipes is Teff flour, so I was excited to see that it was available on Amazon and eligible for shipping with Prime.</li>
            <li>Teff is never organic, produced in US, gluten free with calcium and magnesium, Teff is kissing cousin of Amaranth.</li>
            <li>Used it in a recipe for a gkuten free flour mix.  </li>
            <li>it going gluten free.</li>
            <li>My wife got a gluten-free cookbook for Christmas and was excited to begin using it.</li>
            <li>Starch makes you feel full just like rice, potato, pasta unlike greens where you can eat and eat and still feel hungry but with starch it is like eating protein.</li>
            <li>Teff works well in quick breads and muffins.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That makes this is a fantastic all-around flour!</li>
            <li>Teff, a mainstay of diets in Ethiopia and popular in surrounding African countries as well, has the highest calcium content of any grain.</li>
            <li>I use the flour mix instead of regular flour and everything comes out nice.</li>
            <li>It’s actually a variety of millet that’s easy to grow in diverse climates and under unpromising conditions and has a sweet, molasses-like taste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that I was pleased with the product, it is Bob&#x27;s Red Mill</li>
            <li>The 50% extra starch difference is what pushes Amaranth to sell more than Teff.</li>
            <li>I tried many different flours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Powder will go rancid so need to purchase what is needed and kept in freezer.spot, whenever I wish, with no hassle, with great taste but Amaranth and Teff take longer, and I mean really, really longer.</li>
            <li>Bob&#x27;s Red Mill are fine</li>
            <li>Was not Teff flour, but whole Teff</li>
            <li>I ordered the flour but receive whole grain.</li>
            <li>Too much teff flavor.</li>
            <li>What I got was whole grain Teff.</li>
            <li>I know there has been much hype about Teff</li>
            <li>Amaranth offers more selenium 52-12&#x3D;40% and vitamin B5 28-18&#x3D;10% which are essential nutrients.</li>
            <li>So far, I am not using it very much.</li>
            <li>The main reason I took off 2 stars is because of the incorrect description.</li>
            <li>Both have almost the same composition, mostly the same minerals and vitamins except Teff is high in manganese.</li>
            <li>It is a different grain but a rare grain</li>
            <li>so I mix it with many other grains like amaranth and barley which take long time to cook as well and the result is one fulfilling, nutritious mix that I add to all my soups.</li>
            <li>Quinoa cooks in ten minutes, no more no less, ready on the spot, whenever I wish, with no hassle, with great taste but Amaranth and Teff take longer, and I mean really, really longer.</li>
            <li>I clearly ordered Teff Flour and my invoice shows Teff Flour.  </li>
            <li>An absolute must for making Ethiopian Injera (flat bread)</li>
            <li>There are other kinds of teff flour that work better for injera, in my experience, but that also means this flour isn&#x27;t very bitter, by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should have listened to the other reviewers who said that they received whole grain teff,not teff flour, because I did not receive the flour as well.</li>
            <li>I bought Bob&#x27;s Red Mill and was quite surprised with the taste and potential of Teff.</li>

            <li> Have yet to successfully use it, but expectations are high. It&#x27; a learning curve.</li>
            <li> This is disappointing.  I clearly ordered Teff Flour and my invoice shows Teff Flour.  But I was sent Teff grain.  I can go anywhere and get the same item for the same price.  I don&#x27;t want Teff grain.  I want Teff Four.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Makes great injera bread.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Was not Teff flour, but whole Teff</li>
            <li> great for baking with brown rice flour</li>

            <li> An absolute must for making Ethiopian Injera (flat bread)</li>
            <li> The main reason I took off 2 stars is because of the incorrect description. I was looking for flour. I&#x27;d to grind the grain to make injeras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I was pleased with the product, it is Bob&#x27;s Red Mill so the product is always good quality.</li>
            <li> My wife got a gluten-free cookbook for Christmas and was excited to begin using it. One of the ingredients in many of he recipes is Teff flour, so I was excited to see that it was available on Amazon and eligible for shipping with Prime. I ordered the flour but receive whole grain. I though it was a simple shipping mistake until I read the other reviews. Be advised, if you order this you will get Teff grain, not flour.</li>
            <li> Teff, a mainstay of diets in Ethiopia and popular in surrounding African countries as well, has the highest calcium content of any grain. It’s actually a variety of millet that’s easy to grow in diverse climates and under unpromising conditions and has a sweet, molasses-like taste. It’s also gluten-free. You need to read Nutrition Facts on this grain to see the shocking amount of minerals and vitamins that it contains. Rare grain but healthy and delicious. Takes long time to cook so I mix it with many other grains like amaranth and barley which take long time to cook as well and the result is one fulfilling, nutritious mix that I add to all my soups. It is a different grain but a rare grain and I consume with all oher grains. Teff is never organic, produced in US, gluten free with calcium and magnesium, Teff is kissing cousin of Amaranth. Both have almost the same composition, mostly the same minerals and vitamins except Teff is high in manganese. I stopped consuming oats since I could never find oats having any Phytosterols and hardly any other minerals, so amaranth offer more nutrients, especially when it is raw and uncooked. If I was baking bread, Amaranth bread would offer more starch 111-71&#x3D;40gr which translates into more calories but for cardio, it is well needed. Starch makes you feel full just like rice, potato, pasta unlike greens where you can eat and eat and still feel hungry but with starch it is like eating protein. The 50% extra starch difference is what pushes Amaranth to sell more than Teff. Teff vs. Amaranth in calories 708/716, calcium DV% 35/31, magnesium DV% 89/120, potassium DV% 24/28, zinc DV% 47/37... Teff is never USDA organic certified. Amaranth offers more selenium 52-12&#x3D;40% and vitamin B5 28-18&#x3D;10% which are essential nutrients. All those measurements where for one cup serving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quinoa is a milder taste grain in comparison to Amaranth or Teff but regardless I consume it all. Quinoa cooks in ten minutes, no more no less, ready on the spot, whenever I wish, with no hassle, with great taste but Amaranth and Teff take longer, and I mean really, really longer. Cooking Teff and Amaranth is a process, time consuming regardless of the brand but I ground amaranth for calcium and magnesium with flax and sesame seed and consume it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powder will go rancid so need to purchase what is needed and kept in freezer.spot, whenever I wish, with no hassle, with great taste but Amaranth and Teff take longer, and I mean really, really longer.

            <li> I like it several way&#x27;s</li>
            <li> There are other kinds of teff flour that work better for injera, in my experience, but that also means this flour isn&#x27;t very bitter, by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That makes this is a fantastic all-around flour!

            <li> I use this teff flour to bake my gluten-free banana bread and it&#x27;s terrific. First, you need to know that GF flours need to be blended together to get the best results, not used alone, when you are baking. Teff works well in quick breads and muffins. My bread bakes up a beautiful chocolaty brown color with rich flavor. I blend several other flours with it. For the recipe, see my blog [...]</li>
            <li> Delicious great product!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried enough recipes to test correct proportions, since I&#x27;m winging it going gluten free. So I mixed it with coconut flour and it was on the dry and grainy side. Too much teff flavor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently become a Teff fan. I read about Teff and was curious since I had never heard of it. I bought Bob&#x27;s Red Mill and was quite surprised with the taste and potential of Teff. I toasted the grain and it richened the taste of the Teff. I mix Teff with my Bob&#x27;s Red Mill Rolled Oaks and it adds a nutty taste with nutritional benefits......YUM YUM....</li>
            <li> I ordered Teff flour.  What I got was whole grain Teff.</li>
            <li> When I was diagnosed with Celiac I tried many different flours. I found Teff to be the least palatable of the bunch. I find it to be bitter and have an unpleasant taste. I know there has been much hype about Teff but the taste does not live up to the hype. I prefer Sorghum 1st, almond 2nd, millet 3rd, tapioca 4th, arrowroot 5th, coconut 6th, and brown rice 7th. Bob&#x27;s Red Mill are fine it is just a question of what you prefer.</li>
            <li> I made Injera and ethiopian food with this. My gf and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tasted very good and has a pungent aroma!</li>
