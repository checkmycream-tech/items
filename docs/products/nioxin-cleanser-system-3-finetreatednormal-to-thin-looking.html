            <li>Nioxin cleanser system 3 for color treated hair is amazing.</li>

            <li>My hair looks better and the cleanser smells good.</li>
            <li>Leaves your scalp nice and tingly.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li>however it does leave my scalp feeling great and my hair looking full because as all of the gunk has been efficently removed.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it helps grow more, but sure doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li>an amazing amount of static.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine</li>
            <li>Great product exactly what I anticipated</li>
            <li>love this shampoo for my hair, been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>However, I have been satisfied with the service.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I ve been using this for more than a month.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t feel like my hair got better than before.    </li>
            <li>I need to try it more than two months.    </li>
            <li>I have been using products from Nioxin&#x27;s for over 10 years though always purchased from reputable beauty salons.  </li>
            <li>i think it makes my hair more youthful.</li>
            <li>so I bought more.  </li>
            <li>As much as I love Amazon</li>
            <li>and you feel better about yourself</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 8 months now, and my hair is noticeably thicker and in better condition.</li>
            <li>and he is in love and hooked also.</li>
            <li>Love the price.</li>
            <li>Nioxin System 3 for fine hair is an excellent shampoo for fine hair particularly in summer when humidity is a problem.</li>
            <li>Pleased with the size of bottle and the price.  </li>
            <li>If I use another shampoo for more than two times in a row, the scalp is itchy for weeks.  </li>
            <li>Nioxin is the best and only thing for us.     </li>
            <li>During the holiday time, you might be able to find liter sizes at Costco or salons on sale.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Nioxin Cleanser System 3 leaves my hair feeling and looking like it is thicker and has more volume and if your head ever itches it clears that itch up immediately.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I put henna in my hair over  a month ago and this shampoo hasn&#x27;t washed out the color like most shampoos.</li>
            <li>One of Mother&#x27;s greatest joys included using Nioxon after chemo and her hair was growing back to the point where she didn&#x27;t need to use a wig.   </li>
            <li>The Nioxin System 3 seems to work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 8 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I use We love it</li>
            <li>I love Nioxin.</li>
            <li>So glad I&#x27;ve read these reviews as now I&#x27;m not going to use it anymore.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that it keeps my hair color better than most shampoos, and believe me...</li>
            <li>I have found that Pureology Volume set works much better.</li>
            <li>husband has started to use it as well and is pleased.</li>
            <li>OK product.</li>
            <li>So, I made sure that the photo and bottle looked correct when I reordered.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for nearly 20 years - and I believe it does what it says it will do - keep your hair on your head and make it look good too!</li>
            <li>Item also shipped quickly and safely!</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day and that works best for me.</li>
            <li>In the summer, it&#x27;s so cool &amp; refreshing.  </li>
            <li>The product speaks for itself I have fine hair the product gives volume</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m very pleased and will try more of the Nioxin products.</li>
            <li>My fine hair does not get fly-away and flimsy with this .  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my fine hair thicker or fuller</li>
            <li>It had a gold top (the photo had a bronze top) and said it was for treated hair where this shampoo started dying my hair lighter from the first applcation.  </li>
            <li>-- For light conditioning, I add 4-5 drops of argan oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d think you&#x27;d want chemically treated if you&#x27;ve had chemo as this says is has additional moisturizers for your scalp, and that would be important.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it because of my hair loss and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They changed the ingredients lists of the products, removing important plant extracts.</li>
            <li>Has a nice minty smell and washes hair really well.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m fortunate to have a lot of it</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and it not only smells good but cleanses hair and makes it healthy,</li>
            <li>As I get older I feel my hair thinning more and more.</li>
            <li>I returned it ,because it is a cheap knock-off of the original Nioxin.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I would reccomend that everyone who desires that freedom and wants to give their own hair the best chance, try this for at least 3-4 mo.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget the \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; called Scalp Therepy and the Nioxin special scalp spray on stuff for thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>True, it is shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have full coloring, just highlighting.  </li>
            <li>The best price I&#x27;ve found lately.  </li>
            <li>Love the product and so much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>love, love, love this stuff, can&#x27;t tell if my hair is thicker but it isn&#x27;t weighed down with conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The three together worked tremendously for her.</li>
            <li>I was losing more hair than is normal</li>
            <li>I have been using Nioxin System 3 (color treated hair) Cleanser and Therapy Rinse for about 20 years now and it really works fantastic on keeping your hair growing and full.</li>
            <li>This is best shampoo for thin coloured blond hair.</li>
            <li>But, worth to try it, I guess.</li>
            <li>I love the smell because it not to strong unlike other shampoos</li>
            <li>I have to say I was very surprised by how fast I sa positive results!!!</li>
            <li>I am so pleased to see my hair coming back in!</li>
            <li>It is the only product I have used that makes it look this healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s any color issues, it&#x27;s more likely from overusing the blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>I used Nioxin for many years but now it&#x27;s completely different product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Nioxin for many years and my hair hasn&#x27;t thinned and actually seems to be thicker than before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it highly!!</li>
            <li>Feedback to that was that Nioxin creates an environment for growth at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Nioxin products for many years, especially the System 3.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have very thin hair and this product along with the shampoo is superb.  </li>
            <li>and I still love the shampoo and conditioner for fine limp hair.  </li>
            <li>, it looks like more hair started growing in near the front, love the tingling sensation with the conditioner, it may come off as intense to others especially for people with sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I want and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>We saw spectacular results in much less time than that.  </li>
            <li>The large bottle lasts forever, it seems.</li>
            <li>High confidence in the product to gently clean my scalp/hair as needed, even though I frequently lap swim in chlorinated pools.  </li>
            <li>Once I get the shampoo in my hands, I quickly go under the water stream to wet my hair again, then apply shampoo for a rich lather.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is the real product.  </li>
            <li>That is not on my &#x27;real&#x27; bottle.  </li>
            <li>I used a variety of well known products and after about three months, I noticed that my hair was beginning to fall out in unusual amounts.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>As a woman, having thinning patches causes me much distress.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, this product works very well.  </li>
            <li>it is not the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Then you get taken advantage of by these scam artists, some people really don&#x27;t have souls.</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>I stoped loosing hair and it feels and looks much healthier and thicker.</li>
            <li>it really helps with thinning hair...</li>
            <li>It really worked to stop so much hair loss.</li>
            <li>This product really does work.</li>
            <li>Glad to be back to my old routine.</li>
            <li>I did buy and use the product and it did indeed help stimulate hair growth--not fast, just steady growth.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a product that leaves your scalp feeling clean then look no further.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel fuller with less static in winter months</li>
            <li>It smells the same but certainly doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel right.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo itself also looked different - not as blue and more runny.  </li>
            <li>and before I could stop the high rate of product escaping from the bottle, I&#x27;d lost more than half the Nioxin shampoo...........</li>
            <li>It was originally recommended by my hairstylist, and it has made my hair really long and soft!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Nioxin for anyone who&#x27;s hair is thinning.</li>
            <li>have helped me stop losing hair and start growing hair - highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend all nioxin products.</li>
            <li>I have always washed my hair every day just to achieve a little fullness, but I think I could skip a day and look OK.  </li>
            <li>It makes my fine hair look thick and full.</li>
            <li>My husband &amp; I have been using Nioxin Cleanser to a few years, and love it.  </li>
            <li>I quit using it for a few months and started losing more hair again.</li>
            <li>-- To get an extra clean rinse for long hair, I part the back at 5-6 places (one at a time) and rinse each part under the shower stream to clean the hard-to-reach places.  </li>
            <li>and I have new hair growth sticking up in places that I had not realized my hair had been thinning.</li>
            <li>I can see the new hairs growing in around the hair line.</li>
            <li>My stylist also recommended taking the supplement biotin and with the combination of the two products I began seeing new hair growth within one month.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years because it thoroughly cleans my hair, leaving it soft, fluffy with bounce.</li>
            <li>Despite being told by salons that I would not receive the real product it was in fact what I have been using for several years now and at a much discounted price.</li>
            <li>other reviewers did not always have the same results I had, so I feel very fortunate.</li>
            <li>It became clear to me that the Nioxin had been continuing to strengthen my hair at the roots and should be continued to infinity!  </li>
            <li>I do not usually purchase the conditioner, but did this time around and is something I would also recommend.  </li>
            <li>I went back to using Nioxin after taking a break, and all of a sudden, noticed drain was full of hair again.</li>
            <li>-- Also, I figure No. 3 is better for my children since there&#x27;s likely less chemicals than #1 for non-color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>my hair is in better condition with this cleanser- less trips to the hair dresser for trims, it helps the split ends, and is much more manageable for thin hair.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I can only afford Nioxin when I purchase the product in the large 33.8oz</li>
            <li>The Nioxin sales are hard to come by -- I am so glad Amazon offers the auto ship program.  </li>
            <li>It is not the same product, the real cleanser 3 is pearly, this is clear.  </li>
            <li>My wife was a professional hair stylist and recommended it.  </li>
            <li>After using this my hair feels lighter and gave me soft shinny hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is solid silver but always has a very healthy,clean and shiny look.</li>
            <li>They seem to have it really bad--huge white flakes since 5 (now 12 &amp; 14).  </li>
            <li>I had no idea, but I realized it was true because in the light you could see just how very thin it had gotten.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much for each shampoo (apply 2x/wash) and it lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li>Seems to agree with my very fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair and have had some hair loss here and there</li>
            <li>(I have long layered hair to mid back) after I pour out the shampoo, rub my hands together, quickly rewet my hair, and spread the mixture to the crown, sides, and nape.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser asked me if I was still using it the last time I saw him because he noticed a lot of new growth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry hair out and worlds very well with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>it have the same results that I have had so far.</li>
            <li>My hair looked and felt thicker much sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li>Never really did much for my hair.</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommend to those with thin or weak hair.</li>
            <li>Ive noticed also that my hair doesnt get oily as fast as It normaly would using other shampoos.</li>
            <li>Also shipping is fast, I suggest this product to other but with SCALP treatment and Spray</li>
            <li>It arrived in a timely manner and I am back on track with healthy, very thick, hair.</li>
            <li>The original metallic gold colored and the new metallic dark grey colored cap / pivoting-lid is designed to dispense shampoo by pushing down on the pivoting lid cutout labeled &#x27;PRESS&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I had read reviews before I bought my first order that there was an alternate or imitation Nioxin being sold and to only get the bronze cap bottles.  </li>
            <li>$25 for a bottle of shampoo is too much to spend for something that is not right.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered, it was looking for a more convenient &amp; less expensive way to buy this product &amp; I found it.</li>
            <li>I would expect the cost of the Nioxin shampoo would include prioritizing an adequate product bottle cap / pivoting-lid systems engineering design/review/oversight, or at the least just tape a pump onto the bottle to provide an enhanced user/product interface.</li>
            <li>My hair is very thin and very fine.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>It does make my fine thin hair look fuller</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I observed the product weight (inside the 33.8oz bottle) when rotated upside down (as you&#x27;ve designed the Nioxin bottle to be used ) was in fact resulting in over pressuring/overloading of your recently modified bottle/cap/lid redesign, and along with the inadequate fitting pivot nipple to cap detent design and production methods, precipitated a &#x27;typical-use&#x27; failure event...........</li>

            <li> Nioxin cleanser system 3 for color treated hair is amazing.</li>
            <li> Nioxin products are amazing.</li>
            <li> My hair looks better and the cleanser smells good.</li>
            <li> Leaves your scalp nice and tingly.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> however it does leave my scalp feeling great and my hair looking full because as all of the gunk has been efficently removed.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it helps grow more, but sure doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> an amazing amount of static.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine</li>
            <li> Great product exactly what I anticipated</li>
            <li> love this shampoo for my hair, been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> However, I have been satisfied with the service.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I ve been using this for more than a month.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t feel like my hair got better than before.    </li>
            <li> I need to try it more than two months.    </li>
            <li> I have been using products from Nioxin&#x27;s for over 10 years though always purchased from reputable beauty salons.  </li>
            <li> i think it makes my hair more youthful.</li>
            <li> so I bought more.  </li>
            <li> As much as I love Amazon</li>
            <li> and you feel better about yourself</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 8 months now, and my hair is noticeably thicker and in better condition.</li>
            <li> and he is in love and hooked also.</li>
            <li> Love the price.</li>
            <li> Nioxin System 3 for fine hair is an excellent shampoo for fine hair particularly in summer when humidity is a problem.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the size of bottle and the price.  </li>
            <li> If I use another shampoo for more than two times in a row, the scalp is itchy for weeks.  </li>
            <li> Nioxin is the best and only thing for us.     </li>
            <li> During the holiday time, you might be able to find liter sizes at Costco or salons on sale.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Nioxin Cleanser System 3 leaves my hair feeling and looking like it is thicker and has more volume and if your head ever itches it clears that itch up immediately.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I put henna in my hair over  a month ago and this shampoo hasn&#x27;t washed out the color like most shampoos.</li>
            <li> One of Mother&#x27;s greatest joys included using Nioxon after chemo and her hair was growing back to the point where she didn&#x27;t need to use a wig.   </li>
            <li> The Nioxin System 3 seems to work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 8 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I use We love it</li>
            <li> I love Nioxin.</li>
            <li> So glad I&#x27;ve read these reviews as now I&#x27;m not going to use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it keeps my hair color better than most shampoos, and believe me...</li>
            <li> I have found that Pureology Volume set works much better.</li>
            <li> husband has started to use it as well and is pleased.</li>
            <li> OK product.</li>
            <li> So, I made sure that the photo and bottle looked correct when I reordered.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for nearly 20 years - and I believe it does what it says it will do - keep your hair on your head and make it look good too!</li>
            <li> Item also shipped quickly and safely!</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff.  </li>
            <li> It is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and that works best for me.</li>
            <li> In the summer, it&#x27;s so cool &amp; refreshing.  </li>
            <li> The product speaks for itself I have fine hair the product gives volume</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m very pleased and will try more of the Nioxin products.</li>
            <li> My fine hair does not get fly-away and flimsy with this .  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my fine hair thicker or fuller</li>
            <li> It had a gold top (the photo had a bronze top) and said it was for treated hair where this shampoo started dying my hair lighter from the first applcation.  </li>
            <li> -- For light conditioning, I add 4-5 drops of argan oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d think you&#x27;d want chemically treated if you&#x27;ve had chemo as this says is has additional moisturizers for your scalp, and that would be important.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it because of my hair loss and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They changed the ingredients lists of the products, removing important plant extracts.</li>
            <li> Has a nice minty smell and washes hair really well.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m fortunate to have a lot of it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it not only smells good but cleanses hair and makes it healthy,</li>
            <li> As I get older I feel my hair thinning more and more.</li>
            <li> I returned it ,because it is a cheap knock-off of the original Nioxin.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I would reccomend that everyone who desires that freedom and wants to give their own hair the best chance, try this for at least 3-4 mo.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget the \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; called Scalp Therepy and the Nioxin special scalp spray on stuff for thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> True, it is shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have full coloring, just highlighting.  </li>
            <li> The best price I&#x27;ve found lately.  </li>
            <li> Love the product and so much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> love, love, love this stuff, can&#x27;t tell if my hair is thicker but it isn&#x27;t weighed down with conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The three together worked tremendously for her.</li>
            <li> I was losing more hair than is normal</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin System 3 (color treated hair) Cleanser and Therapy Rinse for about 20 years now and it really works fantastic on keeping your hair growing and full.</li>
            <li> This is best shampoo for thin coloured blond hair.</li>
            <li> But, worth to try it, I guess.</li>
            <li> I love the smell because it not to strong unlike other shampoos</li>
            <li> I have to say I was very surprised by how fast I sa positive results!!!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased to see my hair coming back in!</li>
            <li> It is the only product I have used that makes it look this healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s any color issues, it&#x27;s more likely from overusing the blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I used Nioxin for many years but now it&#x27;s completely different product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin for many years and my hair hasn&#x27;t thinned and actually seems to be thicker than before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it highly!!</li>
            <li> Feedback to that was that Nioxin creates an environment for growth at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin products for many years, especially the System 3.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and this product along with the shampoo is superb.  </li>
            <li> and I still love the shampoo and conditioner for fine limp hair.  </li>
            <li> , it looks like more hair started growing in near the front, love the tingling sensation with the conditioner, it may come off as intense to others especially for people with sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I want and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> We saw spectacular results in much less time than that.  </li>
            <li> The large bottle lasts forever, it seems.</li>
            <li> High confidence in the product to gently clean my scalp/hair as needed, even though I frequently lap swim in chlorinated pools.  </li>
            <li> Once I get the shampoo in my hands, I quickly go under the water stream to wet my hair again, then apply shampoo for a rich lather.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is the real product.  </li>
            <li> That is not on my &#x27;real&#x27; bottle.  </li>
            <li> I used a variety of well known products and after about three months, I noticed that my hair was beginning to fall out in unusual amounts.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> As a woman, having thinning patches causes me much distress.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, this product works very well.  </li>
            <li> it is not the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Then you get taken advantage of by these scam artists, some people really don&#x27;t have souls.</li>
            <li> This really works.  </li>
            <li> I stoped loosing hair and it feels and looks much healthier and thicker.</li>
            <li> it really helps with thinning hair...</li>
            <li> It really worked to stop so much hair loss.</li>
            <li> This product really does work.</li>
            <li> Glad to be back to my old routine.</li>
            <li> I did buy and use the product and it did indeed help stimulate hair growth--not fast, just steady growth.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a product that leaves your scalp feeling clean then look no further.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel fuller with less static in winter months</li>
            <li> It smells the same but certainly doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel right.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo itself also looked different - not as blue and more runny.  </li>
            <li> and before I could stop the high rate of product escaping from the bottle, I&#x27;d lost more than half the Nioxin shampoo...........</li>
            <li> It was originally recommended by my hairstylist, and it has made my hair really long and soft!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Nioxin for anyone who&#x27;s hair is thinning.</li>
            <li> have helped me stop losing hair and start growing hair - highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend all nioxin products.</li>
            <li> I have always washed my hair every day just to achieve a little fullness, but I think I could skip a day and look OK.  </li>
            <li> It makes my fine hair look thick and full.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I have been using Nioxin Cleanser to a few years, and love it.  </li>
            <li> I quit using it for a few months and started losing more hair again.</li>
            <li> -- To get an extra clean rinse for long hair, I part the back at 5-6 places (one at a time) and rinse each part under the shower stream to clean the hard-to-reach places.  </li>
            <li> and I have new hair growth sticking up in places that I had not realized my hair had been thinning.</li>
            <li> I can see the new hairs growing in around the hair line.</li>
            <li> My stylist also recommended taking the supplement biotin and with the combination of the two products I began seeing new hair growth within one month.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years because it thoroughly cleans my hair, leaving it soft, fluffy with bounce.</li>
            <li> Despite being told by salons that I would not receive the real product it was in fact what I have been using for several years now and at a much discounted price.</li>
            <li> other reviewers did not always have the same results I had, so I feel very fortunate.</li>
            <li> It became clear to me that the Nioxin had been continuing to strengthen my hair at the roots and should be continued to infinity!  </li>
            <li> I do not usually purchase the conditioner, but did this time around and is something I would also recommend.  </li>
            <li> I went back to using Nioxin after taking a break, and all of a sudden, noticed drain was full of hair again.</li>
            <li> -- Also, I figure No. 3 is better for my children since there&#x27;s likely less chemicals than #1 for non-color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> my hair is in better condition with this cleanser- less trips to the hair dresser for trims, it helps the split ends, and is much more manageable for thin hair.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I can only afford Nioxin when I purchase the product in the large 33.8oz</li>
            <li> The Nioxin sales are hard to come by -- I am so glad Amazon offers the auto ship program.  </li>
            <li> It is not the same product, the real cleanser 3 is pearly, this is clear.  </li>
            <li> My wife was a professional hair stylist and recommended it.  </li>
            <li> After using this my hair feels lighter and gave me soft shinny hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is solid silver but always has a very healthy,clean and shiny look.</li>
            <li> They seem to have it really bad--huge white flakes since 5 (now 12 &amp; 14).  </li>
            <li> I had no idea, but I realized it was true because in the light you could see just how very thin it had gotten.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much for each shampoo (apply 2x/wash) and it lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> Seems to agree with my very fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair and have had some hair loss here and there</li>
            <li> (I have long layered hair to mid back) after I pour out the shampoo, rub my hands together, quickly rewet my hair, and spread the mixture to the crown, sides, and nape.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser asked me if I was still using it the last time I saw him because he noticed a lot of new growth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry hair out and worlds very well with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> it have the same results that I have had so far.</li>
            <li> My hair looked and felt thicker much sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> Never really did much for my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommend to those with thin or weak hair.</li>
            <li> Ive noticed also that my hair doesnt get oily as fast as It normaly would using other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Also shipping is fast, I suggest this product to other but with SCALP treatment and Spray</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely manner and I am back on track with healthy, very thick, hair.</li>
            <li> The original metallic gold colored and the new metallic dark grey colored cap / pivoting-lid is designed to dispense shampoo by pushing down on the pivoting lid cutout labeled &#x27;PRESS&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I had read reviews before I bought my first order that there was an alternate or imitation Nioxin being sold and to only get the bronze cap bottles.  </li>
            <li> $25 for a bottle of shampoo is too much to spend for something that is not right.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I ordered, it was looking for a more convenient &amp; less expensive way to buy this product &amp; I found it.</li>
            <li> I would expect the cost of the Nioxin shampoo would include prioritizing an adequate product bottle cap / pivoting-lid systems engineering design/review/oversight, or at the least just tape a pump onto the bottle to provide an enhanced user/product interface.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and very fine.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> It does make my fine thin hair look fuller</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I observed the product weight (inside the 33.8oz bottle) when rotated upside down (as you&#x27;ve designed the Nioxin bottle to be used ) was in fact resulting in over pressuring/overloading of your recently modified bottle/cap/lid redesign, and along with the inadequate fitting pivot nipple to cap detent design and production methods, precipitated a &#x27;typical-use&#x27; failure event...........</li>
            <li> In fact, my hair is flat, but it is prob because of the conditioner weighing it down since you&#x27;re normally supposed to condition ends and not the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I reseated the lid into the cap, testing its functionality by repeatedly pressing to open and closing the lid, but the next use turning the bottle upside down, the lid completely separated from the cap</li>
            <li> my wife was experiencing some minor hair loss from years of hair coloring on top of the fact that she has very thin hair..</li>
            <li> The pump permits a much improved ability to control a regulated measure of the shampoo from the large cumbersome bottle, while at the same time, avoids having to depend on the functionality of the shampoo cap/lid assembly to operate as expected, mitigating against having to pick up the large/heavy/non-ergonomically designed bottle, and having to rotate the non-user ergonomic prioritized/heavy container, upside down in an clumsy attempt just to deliver an amount shampoo........</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it made a real difference or not.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews - I am not sure if it is the real thing or a knock-off.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s doing much to thicken my hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that I do not wake up with totally flat hair.  </li>
            <li> After the lid initially separated from the cap I noticed the pivoting lid was not completely seated into the cap, and upon examination the 2 pivot nipples each located across the cap diameter, weren&#x27;t seating into their cap seats.  </li>
            <li> I have not used nioxin very long but this was the third bottle I have purchased through  Amazon.  </li>
            <li> &quot;  Since Nioxin is more expensive than other shampoos, I listened to her.  </li>
            <li> This large bottle lasts me approximately 4 months (I generally wash my hair once a day).</li>
            <li> I had used this product a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> It changed a long time ago</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> -- Since the consistency may get thick over time, I find the shampoo spreads easier if I wet my hair and scalp thoroughly first before pouring out the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Alas, the product that arrived was very different and did not match my first order.</li>
            <li> This size is economical and the Nioxin shampoo and scalp treatment work well to relieve my thin hair.</li>
            <li> And, was instantly validated that the online product was in deed an imitation.</li>
            <li> to my busy schedule this past month, I purchased Nioxin, Cleaner, 3, from one of Amazon&#x27;s distributors.  </li>
            <li> so what is left is down the drain with my money.</li>
            <li> It is a watered down version with different ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing regrowth, this shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out!</li>
            <li> We both have been using it for over a year and a half and her hair loss stopped by about the second month since she began using it.</li>
            <li> She always had short, permed hair and it was growing back to her usual look.   </li>
            <li> (As I assumed would operate similarly to your previous cap / lid-pivot designs).  </li>
            <li> This shampoo lasts forever, you only need to use a little.</li>
            <li> The reason for this review is to alert the buyer to use caution before purchasing this hair product from online (unknown) vendors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> that I feel like I&#x27;m tugging and stretching my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thin, and I find that Nioxin gives me a fuller looking head of hair, and is gentle.</li>
            <li> The bottle labeling seemed a little strange and the quality and smell was off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to people with naturally thin hair or people who are loosing hair.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed as soon as I put it on that the usual product smell was different.</li>
            <li> Helps to regrow hair that is falling out due to age, hormones, etc.  </li>
            <li> Since using, I can&#x27;t seem to use any other.</li>
            <li> I was trying different products for a few months and my hair was a mess.</li>
            <li> Has not been the case with other stuff</li>
            <li> The bottle of &amp;#34;Nioxin&amp;#34; that I received was very different than what I have received in the past.  </li>
            <li> This is an imitation product.</li>
            <li> When it was wet, I felt like I had just a very small amount of hair left.</li>
            <li> After using another shampoo while on vacation, my hair felt weighted down and lacked a shine that my hair has when using this product.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair flat and extremely hard to manage...</li>
            <li> w/ my previous purchase of this product.  </li>
            <li> Ive been using system three for about a month and a half...</li>
            <li> i was a bit sceptical when people said they had hair loss buti  have lost less hair</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years and have noticed much less hair loss.</li>
            <li> I also noticed my hair felt filmy and not clean at all after shampooing as others here</li>
            <li> , that may cause the scalp to react with a little loss.</li>
            <li> Since that time, my hair stopped thinning, and may have even gotten a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I was particularly chagrined to learn you for some unknown justification changed the bottle opening and cap diameter, making it impossible to to use the previous Nioxinbottle cap/pivoting lid.....</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin products for a few years.</li>
            <li> But not year round.  </li>
            <li> I cannot use this everyday because it feels like my hair gets a waxy buildup.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I use with my thin hair.</li>
            <li> afterward my hair seemed to dry out and become very dull</li>
            <li> I have somewhat thin, color treated, dull hair, ive tried numerous products to get that fuller hair look...</li>
            <li> and you use very little, but no results.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it is Nioxin</li>
            <li> i had a few compliments on how shiny my hair looked!</li>
            <li> It really dried out my hair!  </li>
            <li> and I have hard water......</li>
            <li> I have thick hair but not a lot of body to it.</li>
            <li> About six months ago, my beautician said that I didn&#x27;t need to keep using it as my hair was \\&quot;plenty thick now.\\</li>
            <li> I tried this new formula cleanser and absolutely hate it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my biggest disappointment, has the loss of over half the content from the failure of your modified cap design.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t make my hair thick again; but it stopped it from getting any thinner!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and see no results, except it made my hair very dull.</li>
            <li> I dont have thin hair but use this anyways.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My shedding has decreased as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become addicted to this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s not as thin now and not&lt;br /&gt;coming out</li>
            <li> I was very sad and wanted to return this product but missed the return date by a few days.</li>
            <li> I was so sad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and I never saw a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> My two daughters unfortunately inherited dandruff genes from both my husband and me.  </li>
            <li> which is so very disturbing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always trusted her opinion and decided to give it a try, the price isn&#x27;t bad for the benefits promised.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser shocked me by recommending this product for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Still loosing hair. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and will be returning.</li>
            <li> the combination leaves my hair feeling/looking terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used Nioxin shampoo for years now. My wife was a professional hair stylist and recommended it.  I use it every other day and that works best for me. I would never want to be without it.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo for my hair, been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo. Have been using it for over 10 years. It hasn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
            <li> Still loosing hair. :(</li>
            <li> This is best shampoo for thin coloured blond hair. Price is really good for the bottle size.</li>
            <li> I dont have thin hair but use this anyways. This is the only shampoo that relieves my ithcy scalp. I have thick hair but not a lot of body to it. After using this my hair feels lighter and gave me soft shinny hair. Ive noticed also that my hair doesnt get oily as fast as It normaly would using other shampoos. Another thing I like is it wakes me up in the morning with its cooling effect. I love the smell because it not to strong unlike other shampoos it doesnt give me a headache (I get migraines from perfume).</li>
            <li> Item has been arrived promptly as promised. I have not been used the item to evaluate its benefit. However, I have been satisfied with the service. Good service</li>
            <li> My hairdresser shocked me by recommending this product for thinning hair. Thinning hair? I had no idea, but I realized it was true because in the light you could see just how very thin it had gotten. When it was wet, I felt like I had just a very small amount of hair left. I was so sad. I bought this product as he suggested, and it seems to be working for me! I&#x27;ve been using it for just over 4 months now and I have new hair growth sticking up in places that I had not realized my hair had been thinning. Hurray. I am so pleased to see my hair coming back in! Good luck to all that try it- other reviewers did not always have the same results I had, so I feel very fortunate. I hope others that try it have the same results that I have had so far. (I also use this in combination with its companion product, Nioxin Scalp Therapy.)</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and great buy.</li>
            <li> Using this product for years.  Does the job.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, thin hair. I have used this product for many years because it thoroughly cleans my hair, leaving it soft, fluffy with bounce. It is the only product I have used that makes it look this healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product from Amazon before but perhaps from a different vendor.  Anyway, when I opened the box, some portion have already been spilled insid the box as there was no seal on the cap which was not the case w/ my previous purchase of this product.  Then it makes me wonder if this product was legit or not.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this item to anyone...my wife was experiencing some minor hair loss from years of hair coloring on top of the fact that she has very thin hair..She was recommended this product by several hair stylists and she(we) finally tried it.We both have been using it for over a year and a half and her hair loss stopped by about the second month since she began using it.My hair is solid silver but always has a very healthy,clean and shiny look.We also found that Amazon has the best price for this item.....Try it,...I guarantee you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Cleans well, leaves hair feeling and smelling great. Don&#x27;t know if it helps grow more, but sure doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> I ve been using this for more than a month. Not bad but i don&#x27;t feel like my hair got better than before.    I need to try it more than two months.    But, worth to try it, I guess.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is the real product.  My hair is beginning to fall out after use.  It is not the same product, the real cleanser 3 is pearly, this is clear.  Also, the label on the front is pasted on.  Manufacturer on the back says Wella Corporation and made in Mexico.  That is not on my &#x27;real&#x27; bottle.  Not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> my hairstylist said to buy this as I was complaining about thinning hair... it was good for about one week. afterward my hair seemed to dry out and become very dull, no shine whatsoever. I was very sad and wanted to return this product but missed the return date by a few days. so what is left is down the drain with my money.</li>
            <li> Excellent Seller. Excellent Product. Will order again!</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it made a real difference or not.</li>
            <li> I have been using products from Nioxin&#x27;s for over 10 years though always purchased from reputable beauty salons.  Nixion delivers a quality product line that works.  The reason for this review is to alert the buyer to use caution before purchasing this hair product from online (unknown) vendors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to my busy schedule this past month, I purchased Nioxin, Cleaner, 3, from one of Amazon&#x27;s distributors.  After receiving it, I questioned the authenticity of it. The bottle labeling seemed a little strange and the quality and smell was off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I purchased another bottle from the local beauty salon.  And, was instantly validated that the online product was in deed an imitation.</li>
            <li> Ten years ago, when I had finished chemotherapy, my hair just wasn&#x27;t growing back.  A chemo nurse suggested Nioxin -- she said it \\&quot;might\\&quot; stimulate the follicles to begin growing.  I did buy and use the product and it did indeed help stimulate hair growth--not fast, just steady growth. About six months ago, my beautician said that I didn&#x27;t need to keep using it as my hair was \\&quot;plenty thick now.\\&quot;  Since Nioxin is more expensive than other shampoos, I listened to her.  I used a variety of well known products and after about three months, I noticed that my hair was beginning to fall out in unusual amounts.  It became clear to me that the Nioxin had been continuing to strengthen my hair at the roots and should be continued to infinity!  I couldn&#x27;t find it in any local stores, so bought it through Amazon.  It arrived in a timely manner and I am back on track with healthy, very thick, hair.</li>
            <li> my hair is in better condition with this cleanser- less trips to the hair dresser for trims, it helps the split ends, and is much more manageable for thin hair. i think it makes my hair more youthful.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and see no results, except it made my hair very dull. I would never buy again.  It does suds well and you use very little, but no results.</li>
            <li> great product at a good price, will buy again</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A GREAT CLEANSING SHAMPOO.  I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE MY HAIR WAS COMING OUT AND IT HELPED.  CAN&#x27;T USE IT EVERY TIME OR IT DRIES THE HAIR.  I ALTERNATE WITH A CONDITIONING SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER.</li>
            <li> Despite being told by salons that I would not receive the real product it was in fact what I have been using for several years now and at a much discounted price.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my wife and she is very happy with the product. she&#x27;s using it on a daily bases. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Have been using this shampoo for about a year now, and it&#x27;s done wonders for my hair - has made it thicker and stronger.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and was very pleased so I bought more.  The fragrance is wonderful and fresh.  This product works.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin products for a few years. My hair is very fine and I have hard water......the combination leaves my hair feeling/looking terrible. I don&#x27;t know if it actually \\&quot;thickens\\&quot; a person&#x27;s hair....however it does leave my scalp feeling great and my hair looking full because as all of the gunk has been efficently removed.  If in doubt, give it a try for your self and decide. This large bottle lasts me approximately 4 months (I generally wash my hair once a day).</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and it has improved my thinning hair problem.</li>
            <li> Love it! Only shampoo I will use!</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin for over 10 years.  If your looking for a product that leaves your scalp feeling clean then look no further.</li>
            <li> I will not be ordering this product again from this vendor GKC Enterprises - It says Nioxin 3 but it is not put out by Nioxin Laboratories - It is put out by Wella and the product doesn not have the same color or container I have before?  I am not sure it is Nioxin</li>
            <li> Works great for some itching scalp conditions.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleanser , I use it as part of the 3 product line for fine treated hair</li>
            <li> I have not used nioxin very long but this was the third bottle I have purchased through  Amazon.  The others were pearly with a creamy consistency but this product is green and very watery.  Also the labels are different.  It smells the same but certainly doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel right.  As much as I love Amazon and it is my go-to place to shop, I think I need to find this at the salon.  $25 for a bottle of shampoo is too much to spend for something that is not right.</li>
            <li> True, it is shampoo.  I don&#x27;t debate this.  As to it having any restorative and/or preventative effect relative to hair loss, my input is that you could probably use Dial soap and get similar results.  Not that I want to screw up a multi-billion dollar industry, of course....</li>
            <li> The product speaks for itself I have fine hair the product gives volume and you feel better about yourself I have used this product for 4 years now I do not want to be without it Can I order it again from same vendor?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 8 months now, and my hair is noticeably thicker and in better condition. It makes your scalp feeling tingly, but I love it! Feels refreshing!  My hairdresser asked me if I was still using it the last time I saw him because he noticed a lot of new growth. My shedding has decreased as well. I no longer need to use Draino in the shower every month! I would recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> love, love, love this stuff, can&#x27;t tell if my hair is thicker but it isn&#x27;t weighed down with conditioner.  talked my husband into trying system 2 and he is in love and hooked also.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I have been using Nioxin System 3 (color treated hair) Cleanser and Therapy Rinse for about 20 years now and it really works fantastic on keeping your hair growing and full. I highly recommend Nioxin for anyone who&#x27;s hair is thinning. It will keep your hair!</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. Love the price.</li>
            <li> Nioxin System 3 for fine hair is an excellent shampoo for fine hair particularly in summer when humidity is a problem.</li>
            <li> I was losing hair and these products - the shampoo and the treatment as well as the conditioner have helped me stop losing hair and start growing hair - highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This size is economical and the Nioxin shampoo and scalp treatment work well to relieve my thin hair. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and I never saw a difference in my hair.  In fact, my hair is flat, but it is prob because of the conditioner weighing it down since you&#x27;re normally supposed to condition ends and not the scalp.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.  After reading the reviews - I am not sure if it is the real thing or a knock-off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for nearly 20 years - and I believe it does what it says it will do - keep your hair on your head and make it look good too!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great price!</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Great product and works well!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help thinning hair</li>
            <li> Best price for the large liter bottle.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the size of bottle and the price.  Also was prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a hair loss problem, but that could be because I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin Shampoo for years (maybe 15+ years, I&#x27;m 52) as a dandruff and anti-itch wash.  If I use another shampoo for more than two times in a row, the scalp is itchy for weeks.  I&#x27;ve learned not to stray.  My two daughters unfortunately inherited dandruff genes from both my husband and me.  They can&#x27;t use anything but Nioxin either.  I tested Selsun Blue on them and the white flakes showed up.  They seem to have it really bad--huge white flakes since 5 (now 12 &amp; 14).  I grew up w/ Selsun and thought I could get away with a cheaper alternative, but NO! didn&#x27;t work on us.  Nioxin is the best and only thing for us.     -- The smell is menthol.  In the summer, it&#x27;s so cool &amp; refreshing.  We don&#x27;t have a problem with the scent.  -- No. 3 is great for color treated hair.  I don&#x27;t have full coloring, just highlighting.  I haven&#x27;t notice any color stripping yet.  If there&#x27;s any color issues, it&#x27;s more likely from overusing the blow dryer.  -- Also, I figure No. 3 is better for my children since there&#x27;s likely less chemicals than #1 for non-color treated hair.  -- Since the consistency may get thick over time, I find the shampoo spreads easier if I wet my hair and scalp thoroughly first before pouring out the shampoo.  Once I get the shampoo in my hands, I quickly go under the water stream to wet my hair again, then apply shampoo for a rich lather.  -- For light conditioning, I add 4-5 drops of argan oil (I have long layered hair to mid back) after I pour out the shampoo, rub my hands together, quickly rewet my hair, and spread the mixture to the crown, sides, and nape.  Then massage scalp to wash.  I find that it is easier to rinse my hair with the added oil because the hair is not so \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; that I feel like I&#x27;m tugging and stretching my wet hair.  -- To get an extra clean rinse for long hair, I part the back at 5-6 places (one at a time) and rinse each part under the shower stream to clean the hard-to-reach places.  -- After towel drying, leave-in conditioner and mousse/stylers, I rub in 3-4 drops of 100% argan oil only to the ends.  Hair feels softer.    The Nioxin sales are hard to come by -- I am so glad Amazon offers the auto ship program.  The best price I&#x27;ve found lately.  During the holiday time, you might be able to find liter sizes at Costco or salons on sale.  But not year round.  So happy I found this.  Sign me up!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I ordered, it was looking for a more convenient &amp; less expensive way to buy this product &amp; I found it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it daily. As I get older I feel my hair thinning more and more. This product helps my hair feel fuller.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and was as advertised</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Not sure it&#x27;s doing much to thicken my hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo! I&#x27;m seeing regrowth, this shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out! Love it! I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Seems to agree with my very fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I want and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> gives the wash you need!</li>
            <li> I was totally satisfied with my order!!</li>
            <li> Nioxin Cleanser System 3 leaves my hair feeling and looking like it is thicker and has more volume and if your head ever itches it clears that itch up immediately.</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair looks better and the cleanser smells good.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It is light and refreshing. Minty. It doesn&#x27;t dry hair out and worlds very well with the conditioner. I put henna in my hair over  a month ago and this shampoo hasn&#x27;t washed out the color like most shampoos.</li>
            <li> I tried this new formula cleanser and absolutely hate it. It made my hair flat and extremely hard to manage...an amazing amount of static. Is this formula change because P&amp;G bought out the company? Anyway, I am running around the internet hoarding bottles of the original, wonderful, made in the USA, gold cap version that I&#x27;ve used for years. Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when I run out of that!?!</li>
            <li> One of Mother&#x27;s greatest joys included using Nioxon after chemo and her hair was growing back to the point where she didn&#x27;t need to use a wig.   She always had short, permed hair and it was growing back to her usual look.   It was one of her great moments of freedom to not use the wig during a trying time for her.   I would reccomend that everyone who desires that freedom and wants to give their own hair the best chance, try this for at least 3-4 mo.  We saw spectacular results in much less time than that.  I&#x27;d think you&#x27;d want chemically treated if you&#x27;ve had chemo as this says is has additional moisturizers for your scalp, and that would be important.  Don&#x27;t forget the \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; called Scalp Therepy and the Nioxin special scalp spray on stuff for thinning hair.  The three together worked tremendously for her.</li>
            <li> My hair looked and felt thicker much sooner than expected.  As a woman, having thinning patches causes me much distress.  Thankfully, this product works very well.  ONE THING YOU SHOULD KNOW:  I cannot use this everyday because it feels like my hair gets a waxy buildup.  I alternate between NIOXIN and a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love the product and so much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li> I ordered Nioxin Cleanser System 3 about two weeks ago.  It does make my fine thin hair look fuller and I&#x27;ve noticed that I do not wake up with totally flat hair.  I have always washed my hair every day just to achieve a little fullness, but I think I could skip a day and look OK.  So far, I&#x27;m very pleased and will try more of the Nioxin products.</li>
            <li> This is an imitation product. I immediately noticed as soon as I put it on that the usual product smell was different. After washing, my scalp began to burn from the product.  I&#x27;m very disappointed and will be returning.</li>
            <li> Everyone posting here is correct, this is not Nioxin do not buy it.  I recently bought this from this seller and this is simply a knock off it is not the real thing.  Do not believe that it is Proctor &amp; Gambles fault for moving the plant to Mexico either this is not Nioxin.  Nioxin does NOT have stickers on their bottles the writing is printed on the plastic bottle.  This is a Scam to sell crappy shampoo to people who think they are getting a deal and you will just be paying over $20.00 for something that you would probably not pay a dollar for.  Please go to a Salon and buy Nioxin do not buy it here, for all of us women and men that suffer with thinning hair  and are trying to take care of it.  Then you get taken advantage of by these scam artists, some people really don&#x27;t have souls.</li>
            <li> Great price, great deal,fast delivery</li>
            <li> Nioxin cleanser system 3 for color treated hair is amazing. My dermatologist recommended it because of my hair loss and it is fantastic. I noticed a severe reduction  in the loss of hair.</li>
            <li> I had used this product a long time ago.  Purchased it again. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for this shampoo, it costs much more in a salon. This shampoo lasts forever, you only need to use a little. Leaves your scalp nice and tingly.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and very fine.  The Nioxin System 3 seems to work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great product exactly what I anticipated</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use this product</li>
            <li> The problem is Proctor and Gamble, not the vendors.  Proctor and Gamble moved the production to Mexico after buying Nioxin Research Laboratories and closing Georgia plant.&lt;br /&gt;They changed the ingredients lists of the products, removing important plant extracts. I used Nioxin for many years but now it&#x27;s completely different product.&lt;br /&gt;They are ruining the great brand.</li>
            <li> This really works.  I have very thin hair and this product along with the shampoo is superb.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and scalp conditioner, have used for 10 years now. Only thing I use with my thin hair. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for years. It was originally recommended by my hairstylist, and it has made my hair really long and soft!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 8 years and love it.  It helps with thinning hair and it doesn&#x27;t have some of the chemicals others have so is low lathering.  I don&#x27;t use much for each shampoo (apply 2x/wash) and it lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for three years.  My daughter, son and friends use it.  Helps to regrow hair that is falling out due to age, hormones, etc.  I can see the new hairs growing in around the hair line.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> I have somewhat thin, color treated, dull hair, ive tried numerous products to get that fuller hair look... Ive been using system three for about a month and a half... 1st day using this product i had a few compliments on how shiny my hair looked! Now it looks and feels fuller, it looks like more hair started growing in near the front, love the tingling sensation with the conditioner, it may come off as intense to others especially for people with sensitive skin... it works for me i was a bit sceptical when people said they had hair loss buti  have lost less hair then i was!</li>
            <li> As advertised at a fraction of salon price</li>
            <li> Nioxin products are amazing. I have used Nioxin for many years and my hair hasn&#x27;t thinned and actually seems to be thicker than before.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years.  Always great.  Highly recommend all nioxin products.</li>
            <li> only Shampoo I use We love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loosing hair and my hair dresser recommended this product. I&#x27;ve always trusted her opinion and decided to give it a try, the price isn&#x27;t bad for the benefits promised. I have to say I was very surprised by how fast I sa positive results!!! I stoped loosing hair and it feels and looks much healthier and thicker. I highly recommend this product to people with naturally thin hair or people who are loosing hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become addicted to this shampoo. Since using, I can&#x27;t seem to use any other. Makes my hair feel fuller with less static in winter months</li>
            <li> Great product. Have been using it for years now.  It makes my fine hair look thick and full. Has a nice minty smell and washes hair really well. I&#x27;d recommend it highly!!</li>
            <li> I love Nioxin. I am using it for 15 years already. I was trying different products for a few months and my hair was a mess. Glad to be back to my old routine.</li>
            <li> Great Value compared to salon prices!  I spoke with my stylist and she recommended this one for my hair type.  Worked well and I don&#x27;t have to use it any longer once my hair began to grow back in.  It really dried out my hair!  My stylist also recommended taking the supplement biotin and with the combination of the two products I began seeing new hair growth within one month.</li>
            <li> I bought my last bottle of Nioxin in a salon and it has a bronze cap, the label says Wella, both Ca and Canada, as well as Made In Mexico. Bye, bye Nioxin! Now back to researching shampoos. I have very fine, thin hair and have had some hair loss here and there which is so very disturbing. I went back to using Nioxin after taking a break, and all of a sudden, noticed drain was full of hair again. Upon doing some reading, I found others had the same reaction. Feedback to that was that Nioxin creates an environment for growth at first, that may cause the scalp to react with a little loss. BS!! I also noticed my hair felt filmy and not clean at all after shampooing as others here have noted. So glad I&#x27;ve read these reviews as now I&#x27;m not going to use it anymore. Mine is green and smells minty so may be the real deal, however, not taking chances with it. Back to wasting my time searching again.</li>
            <li> My fine hair does not get fly-away and flimsy with this .  Instead I can rely on getting manageable hair which.  Believe me.  Has not been the case with other stuff</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it not only smells good but cleanses hair and makes it healthy,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin products for many years, especially the System 3. It is one of the only cleansing shampoos that doesn&#x27;t create undesired or unintended health conditions to my scalp or interfere with my hair growth with use of extended periods.  High confidence in the product to gently clean my scalp/hair as needed, even though I frequently lap swim in chlorinated pools.  Additionally, I can only afford Nioxin when I purchase the product in the large 33.8oz containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my biggest disappointment, has the loss of over half the content from the failure of your modified cap design. The original metallic gold colored and the new metallic dark grey colored cap / pivoting-lid is designed to dispense shampoo by pushing down on the pivoting lid cutout labeled &#x27;PRESS&#x27;. (As I assumed would operate similarly to your previous cap / lid-pivot designs).  After the lid initially separated from the cap I noticed the pivoting lid was not completely seated into the cap, and upon examination the 2 pivot nipples each located across the cap diameter, weren&#x27;t seating into their cap seats.  I reseated the lid into the cap, testing its functionality by repeatedly pressing to open and closing the lid, but the next use turning the bottle upside down, the lid completely separated from the cap and before I could stop the high rate of product escaping from the bottle, I&#x27;d lost more than half the Nioxin shampoo...........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I observed the product weight (inside the 33.8oz bottle) when rotated upside down (as you&#x27;ve designed the Nioxin bottle to be used ) was in fact resulting in over pressuring/overloading of your recently modified bottle/cap/lid redesign, and along with the inadequate fitting pivot nipple to cap detent design and production methods, precipitated a &#x27;typical-use&#x27; failure event...........I was particularly chagrined to learn you for some unknown justification changed the bottle opening and cap diameter, making it impossible to to use the previous Nioxinbottle cap/pivoting lid.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution has been to use a an integrated cap/pump from a (no longer used) Nexus shampoo 44oz bottle along with tailoring the tube length to reach Nioxin shampoo bottle bottom.  The pump permits a much improved ability to control a regulated measure of the shampoo from the large cumbersome bottle, while at the same time, avoids having to depend on the functionality of the shampoo cap/lid assembly to operate as expected, mitigating against having to pick up the large/heavy/non-ergonomically designed bottle, and having to rotate the non-user ergonomic prioritized/heavy container, upside down in an clumsy attempt just to deliver an amount shampoo........ I would expect the cost of the Nioxin shampoo would include prioritizing an adequate product bottle cap / pivoting-lid systems engineering design/review/oversight, or at the least just tape a pump onto the bottle to provide an enhanced user/product interface.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use it yet, but it is good price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about the color of the cap.  It changed a long time ago and I still love the shampoo and conditioner for fine limp hair.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I have been using Nioxin Cleanser to a few years, and love it.  My hair is extremely thin, and I find that Nioxin gives me a fuller looking head of hair, and is gentle.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommend to those with thin or weak hair. Love the shampoo and conditioner used together and get great results!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years and have noticed much less hair loss. Would recommend to anyone losing hair for any reason.</li>
            <li> This is my go to shampoo.  I do not usually purchase the conditioner, but did this time around and is something I would also recommend.  After using another shampoo while on vacation, my hair felt weighted down and lacked a shine that my hair has when using this product.  From now on, I am going to have to travel with a smaller bottle of Nioxin.  I also noticed that it keeps my hair color better than most shampoos, and believe me...I&#x27;ve tried A LOT!  Item also shipped quickly and safely!</li>
            <li> My Mom used this product to stregthen and add volume to her hair so I decided to try it. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. It may work for some but not for me. I have fine hair but I&#x27;m fortunate to have a lot of it so maybe that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t work. It didn&#x27;t make my fine hair thicker or fuller like I was hoping it would do. I have found that Pureology Volume set works much better.</li>
            <li> This was rec. by my hairdresser...it really helps with thinning hair...I feel it&#x27;s not as thin now and not&lt;br /&gt;coming out like it was ..due to menopause..  .My husband has started to use it as well and is pleased.</li>
            <li> Great, very comfortable</li>
            <li> OK product. yet to see and changes. Prompt delivery</li>
            <li> The only shampoo I&#x27;ll use. Has helped my thinning color treated hair. The large bottle lasts forever, it seems. Buy it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.  It is excellent for thinning and older heads of hair...!</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff.  My wife noticed my hair thinning about 4 years ago, and made me start using it.  Since that time, my hair stopped thinning, and may have even gotten a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I was losing more hair than is normal so my hairstylist suggested I try the Nioxin 3-product system. It really worked to stop so much hair loss. I quit using it for a few months and started losing more hair again. I started it back and will never stop using it again. I have been using it for about 6 years.</li>
            <li> I use Nioxin Scalp Treatment and Nioxin Cleanser to maintain hait strength and coloring.  I have used these products for years and recommend them to prevent loss of hair and premature whitening.</li>
            <li> This product really does work. Helps with thinning hsir.</li>
            <li> I returned it ,because it is a cheap knock-off of the original Nioxin. It is not made by Nioxin. It is a watered down version with different ingredients.</li>
            <li> The Nioxin shampoo is excellent for my hair and I use it along with the scalp treatment.  My hairdresser told me to use it because my hair was thinning.  This didn&#x27;t make my hair thick again; but it stopped it from getting any thinner!</li>
            <li> I believe this product has a great effect oh your hair. Also shipping is fast, I suggest this product to other but with SCALP treatment and Spray</li>
            <li> Never really did much for my hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle of &amp;#34;Nioxin&amp;#34; that I received was very different than what I have received in the past.  It had a gold top (the photo had a bronze top) and said it was for treated hair where this shampoo started dying my hair lighter from the first applcation.  The shampoo itself also looked different - not as blue and more runny.  I had read reviews before I bought my first order that there was an alternate or imitation Nioxin being sold and to only get the bronze cap bottles.  So, I made sure that the photo and bottle looked correct when I reordered.  Alas, the product that arrived was very different and did not match my first order.</li>
