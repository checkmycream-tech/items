            <li>It heats up nicely and works to straighten or curl ends.</li>
            <li>These portable hair care products are great for quick touchups.</li>
            <li>I think it could have been more effective if it got hotter, but it did work.  </li>

            <li>When it gets hot it does a great job straightening my Maltese&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>better off getting the butane curling iron.</li>
            <li>It is outstanding.  </li>

            <li>I love the cute storage case.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my curling iron I got at walmart</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good product and gets hot quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a cordless flat iron for a while now and this product is perfect!</li>
            <li>I used it every day for 3 weeks and the cartridge is still 3/4 full of gas!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to start.</li>
            <li>I bought this for use when travelling and camping where electricity wasn&#x27;t available.  </li>
            <li>If you want something for touch ups for travel,camping etc I recommend looking into the hot tools cordless iron, it heats up much better.</li>
            <li>I was more concerned that it would get too hot and damage my hair, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li>Just the right temperature and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>When I get to work after taking the metro train and walking many blocks on very humid days, my bangs are frizzed uncontrollably and unattractively.  </li>
            <li>and i also leave it in my purse for quick touchups.</li>
            <li>i keep it in my gym bag for quick touch-ups after training.</li>
            <li>It was adequate -</li>
            <li>This straightener barely gets warm.  </li>
            <li>Well, I ended up not being very pretty.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little tool!</li>
            <li>Not even hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to pretty girl camp</li>
            <li>It actually works much better than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Not even sure how I can properly dispose of this with the gas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;;)</li>
            <li>Conair you really did it this time!</li>
            <li>This gal loves to camp and sometimes she needs to look pretty at the campsite parties.</li>
            <li>and I must say that it works pretty well for straightening my bangs which is all I really wanted it for in the first place.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really get as hot as I thought it would</li>
            <li>Nice little straightener.</li>
            <li>but, this one doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and evenly.</li>
            <li>This particular is great with carrying case, but does not get hot enough, especially, if you have long hair.</li>
            <li>Does not heat up quickly and doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to finally have a straightener to carry in my bag/purse!  </li>
            <li>The actually straightener is really cool, though.  </li>
            <li>This straightener works well enough for putting my bangs back in order, but I can&#x27;t imagine it could handle much more.  </li>
            <li>however it took about 10 minutes to heat up, and by \\&quot;heat up\\&quot; I mean get warm.</li>
            <li>I wanted something for touch ups, but when starting the butane heater, I waited 5 mins and it wasn&#x27;t even hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know what to say about this item once again a big thanks to amazon and the reseller for putting this item on the market and no limitations to what amazon or it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, small, and heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I use a plug in Conair flat iron at home, so I thought I would give this Cordless Conair a try.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would get this little guy for quick straightening in the morning</li>
            <li>(I have thin hair that is easily straightened with a normal electric straightener)...</li>
            <li>It barely did anything when I did manage to get it turned on.</li>
            <li>Plain and simple, it is cheap and only heats up just enough to damage your hair.  </li>
            <li>, so it does not stand a chance against thick or super-curly hair, but it is great for thin hair, shorter layers, or bangs.</li>
            <li>However, it is not really a flat iron.</li>

            <li> I only bought it to straighten my fringe/bangs, and that was fine, I did try to use it on the rest of my hair if I slept on it wrong</li>

            <li> Granted, it doesn&#x27;t close as tightly as my plug in one at home, but it does get the job done.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of space.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s a little on the small side, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> probably not much more than 200*F</li>
            <li> The &#x27;Discovery&#x27; is roaming Mars (the planet) and yet to be invented is one small hair dryer that operates with batteries and not this one which uses butane fuel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> anybody knows about small hair dryers with --batteries---kindly let me know.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want to use this for straightening a lot of long hair this is a bad product for you.</li>
            <li> resellers can put up for sale with no restrictions what so ever and needless to say no returns ever</li>
            <li> i sweat a lot at work and it makes my hair crazy, this thing saves me from looking like a fool.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Like the curling iron great idea but, this one doesn&#x27;t work very well. Took it on a camping trip. What a waste of space. Conair needs to rethink this one and improve. Does not heat up quickly and doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. great size for travel. better off getting the butane curling iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mini straightener for a trip that I&#x27;m going on in about a week and I must say that it works pretty well for straightening my bangs which is all I really wanted it for in the first place. If you want to use this for straightening a lot of long hair this is a bad product for you.</li>
            <li> This is a great compact curler. I&#x27;ve used butane curlers before and like them for what I need. This particular is great with carrying case, but does not get hot enough, especially, if you have long hair. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased the Conair butane curling iron and thought I would see what the flat iron would do for me.  It&#x27;s a very good product and gets hot quickly.  These portable hair care products are great for quick touchups.</li>
            <li> This product was NOT worth getting. I wanted something for touch ups, but when starting the butane heater, I waited 5 mins and it wasn&#x27;t even hot to the touch. I could leave my fingers on the iron for days and it wouldn&#x27;t bother me! If you want something for touch ups for travel,camping etc I recommend looking into the hot tools cordless iron, it heats up much better.</li>
            <li> Nice little straightener. Compact size with nice storage case. Easy to use. Easy to start. Best for just touch-ups when you need to fix your bangs !</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little on the small side, but it gets the job done. i think it&#x27;s wonderful. i take it camping and i also leave it in my purse for quick touchups. i sweat a lot at work and it makes my hair crazy, this thing saves me from looking like a fool.</li>
            <li> This straightener barely gets warm.  Not even hot to the touch.  Definitely will not straighten hair- don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Crap.  I wanted to pretty girl camp so I bought this to take with me.  Well, I ended up not being very pretty.  Basically, this thing doesn&#x27;t heat up at all.  I could have put my nose inside it and clamped down and nothing would have happened.  Plus is smelled like nastiness.  Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought this cordless flat iron after being without power for 5 days after Hurricane Irene.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I use a plug in Conair flat iron at home, so I thought I would give this Cordless Conair a try.  Turns out it is great !  I bring it to work almost daily, and especially on those \\&quot;humid\\&quot; days and I just love it! It&#x27;s lightweight, small, and heats up very quickly. It actually works much better than I was expecting.  Granted, it doesn&#x27;t close as tightly as my plug in one at home, but it does get the job done.  Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally have a straightener to carry in my bag/purse!  When I received the product I tried it immediately.  The package says it &#x27;heats in seconds&#x27;.  ya, right..  More like 10 minutes!!  The actually straightener is really cool, though.  The butane (yes, I said butane) pack is glittery and it will be great for camping/festivals!</li>
            <li> this did not work. just DID . NOT . WORK.&lt;br /&gt;but I&#x27;d opened it and tossed the packaging before I discovered that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;worse than useless!</li>
            <li> I have a short hair style that cannot be pulled back when needed- such as on a week long camping trip I recently took. I thought I would get this little guy for quick straightening in the morning (I have thin hair that is easily straightened with a normal electric straightener)... however it took about 10 minutes to heat up, and by \\&quot;heat up\\&quot; I mean get warm. It barely did anything when I did manage to get it turned on. Half the time when attempting to turn the thing on, it would turn on, then the flame would go out with no warning. I was alarmed of this by the smell of the butane filling the tent. I doubt there is enough butane in there to do any damage, but who knows. Not even sure how I can properly dispose of this with the gas. I would avoid getting this straightener- even if you are desperate!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really get as hot as I thought it would but it works and good for touch ups in the car or traveling on an airplane after a nice snooze</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is for my Chinese Crested &#x27;Mikey&#x27;.  It is outstanding.  Just the right temperature and so easy to use.  I use it right before he goes into the show ring to make the hair lie perfectly in place.</li>
            <li> I got this cordless straightener because i was going to another country. it fits in a compact case and was no problem for airport security. I didnt know it also doubles as a curler. I only bought it to straighten my fringe/bangs, and that was fine, I did try to use it on the rest of my hair if I slept on it wrong but it didnt work so well, but it was great for what I wanted it for. I used it every day for 3 weeks and the cartridge is still 3/4 full of gas!</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool! It heats up fast and evenly. However, it is not really a flat iron. The plates are slightly curved, so it is really hard to get a \\&quot;stick straight hair\\&quot; look. Also, it is not full sized and it heats up umm . . . probably not much more than 200*F, so it does not stand a chance against thick or super-curly hair, but it is great for thin hair, shorter layers, or bangs. I would totally recommend this product!</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t understand this.  The &#x27;Discovery&#x27; is roaming Mars (the planet) and yet to be invented is one small hair dryer that operates with batteries and not this one which uses butane fuel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it and I have used it only once.  I am sure the FAA would not allow you to board the plane with this thing.  If you need something to straighten your bands in a few seconds, this is the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anybody knows about small hair dryers with --batteries---kindly let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
            <li> Pure junk do not buy ever the greatest load of junk I have ever purchased ever,how do you people even charge money for this I don&#x27;t even know what to say about this item once again a big thanks to amazon and the reseller for putting this item on the market and no limitations to what amazon or it&#x27;s resellers can put up for sale with no restrictions what so ever and needless to say no returns ever</li>
            <li> This iron was purchased for use at ring side dog shows.  It takes a few minutes to heat up.  When it gets hot it does a great job straightening my Maltese&#x27;s hair.  A drawback would be the butane smell.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, it is cheap and only heats up just enough to damage your hair.  The curling one is better. I own both.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cordless flat iron for a while now and this product is perfect! It heats up nicely and works to straighten or curl ends. i keep it in my gym bag for quick touch-ups after training. I have to wait and see how long the cartridge lasts though. I love the cute storage case. Conair you really did it this time!</li>
            <li> I bought this for use when travelling and camping where electricity wasn&#x27;t available.  It was adequate - I think it could have been more effective if it got hotter, but it did work.  I was more concerned that it would get too hot and damage my hair, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> This gal loves to camp and sometimes she needs to look pretty at the campsite parties. I absolutely love my curling iron I got at walmart so I figured Id get a straightener too...yeah it didnt work at all. It gets 1 star cuz the gas thing works on my curling iron lol</li>
