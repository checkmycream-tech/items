            <li>make homemade lip balm and this is the best</li>
            <li>It was wonderful.</li>
            <li>Excellent choice!</li>
            <li>It works perfectly for my intended purpose.  </li>
            <li>I used it to make a lotion bar and the end product was perfect.</li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>Works great for lubricating wood screws.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great item.</li>
            <li>Very nice to work with.</li>
            <li>My cast iron pans have never looked or performed better!  </li>
            <li>I now know that I prefer the beads as they are easier to measure, but the quality of this wax is amazing.</li>
            <li>Bought this item as an ingredient to make my own eczema cream.</li>
            <li>So far seems to be a great product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting the really strong honey scent.  </li>
            <li>Great product for many of my homemade soaps and lotions, Product was very smooth and easy to melt with other ingredients .</li>
            <li>The beeswax itself seemed like fine quality.</li>
            <li>clean, filtered wax.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind grating or slicing instead of paying more to get the little pastille chunks, this is a good choice for medicine making.</li>
            <li>Very fragrant and smooth.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m thinking this is a more large scale problem and therefore can&#x27;t fault this company in particular.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, my advice is this: it&#x27;s worth it to pay a bit more for the pastilles; also, be sure to wipe up any mess you make with a paper towel while the beeswax is still liquid.</li>
            <li>This was my first time working with beeswax.</li>
            <li>First time buying beeswax.</li>

            <li>Received exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Why do they say its pure beeswax when it is not?  </li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t really bother me and I use it for making personal/beauty products.</li>
            <li>I bought it to attempt making my own solid perfume with essential oils.</li>
            <li>It is a bit of a pain to break off what you need, but the smell, look, and touch of the product seems to be high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly would recommend this block of beeswax for anyone into homemade products or crafts.</li>
            <li>It is kind of hard to shave off 2 oz from this bar.</li>
            <li>Not hard.  </li>
            <li>as expected - very pure</li>
            <li>It is difficult to shred with a hand shredder but does smell nice.</li>
            <li>However, many reviews I&#x27;ve read for beeswax products (from many different distributors) over the past few months have complained about the smoky smell of their beeswax.</li>
            <li>I agree with others that it smells slightly smoky, and I don&#x27;t detect much of a honey smell.</li>

            <li> Awesome product and arrived a week sooner then indicated thank you&lt;br /&gt;I make homemade lip balm and this is the best</li>
            <li> Very nice to work with.</li>
            <li> So far, this beeswax has performed exactly as I expected. It is a bit of a pain to break off what you need, but the smell, look, and touch of the product seems to be high quality. Looking forward to making a few new balms soon.</li>
            <li> I thought the fact it was a bar would not be an issue, so I bought it anyway.  I now know that I prefer the beads as they are easier to measure, but the quality of this wax is amazing. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the really strong honey scent.  It was wonderful.</li>
            <li> This was my first time working with beeswax. I bought it to attempt making my own solid perfume with essential oils. The beeswax itself seemed like fine quality. It was working with it that was the issue! I tried grating it, and ended up having to chop it into thin slices with a kitchen knife. This took a serious amount of pressure to cut. In the end, it was time-consuming and messy. I had to remove the beeswax from the knife, grater, and measuring cup with a blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, my advice is this: it&#x27;s worth it to pay a bit more for the pastilles; also, be sure to wipe up any mess you make with a paper towel while the beeswax is still liquid.</li>

            <li> First time buying beeswax. Great quality. However for my application the block was hard for me to use. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Works great for lubricating wood screws.</li>
            <li> Excellent choice! I would buy it again if I have a chance. I advice everyone who wants to buy beeswax that it really worth.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly for my intended purpose.  I used it to make a lotion bar and the end product was perfect.</li>
            <li> first time buying works well bought to use in homemade lotions  do not think it smells like honey at all</li>
            <li> So far seems to be a great product. I agree with others that it smells slightly smoky, and I don&#x27;t detect much of a honey smell. However, many reviews I&#x27;ve read for beeswax products (from many different distributors) over the past few months have complained about the smoky smell of their beeswax.

The smell doesn&#x27;t really bother me and I use it for making personal/beauty products.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make lotion with.  This is a great product.  In retrospect it would have been easier to use the pellets because in the recipe that I used, there needs to be 2 oz of beeswax. It is kind of hard to shave off 2 oz from this bar.</li>
            <li> My first time buying Beeswax, the package arrived on time with no problems. I recomment this product. I made some homemade antiperspirant and still have some beeswas left.</li>
            <li> Bought this item as an ingredient to make my own eczema cream. Ingredient performed as expected as a binder to create a salve/cream. Blended well with the other ingredients. Exactly what I needed, works well. It is difficult to shred with a hand shredder but does smell nice.</li>
            <li> Great item. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Why do they say its pure beeswax when it is not?  Surely not pure beeswax as described. I heated it at 108 degrees for one hour and it did not soften up. I needed it for the mouthpiece of a didgeridoo. It&#x27;s just too hard to work with.  Requested refund.</li>
            <li> The title and the other reviews say it all. I highly would recommend this block of beeswax for anyone into homemade products or crafts.</li>
            <li> clean, filtered wax.  Works well.  Not hard.  No burnt smell.  Would buy again.  quality beeswax for cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Received exactly what was advertised. Thanks!</li>
