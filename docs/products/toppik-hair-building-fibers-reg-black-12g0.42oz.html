            <li>/&gt;Classy Bunch to deal with very nice.</li>
            <li>This product is truly amazing!</li>
            <li>It stays in place until you wash it out, and no one can tell you have it in your hair, not even in bright sunlight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so good for frontal baldness.</li>
            <li>It works good for increasing the thickness and texture.</li>
            <li>Great product, applies easily, looks great and undetectable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing a wig most of the time, but when I let it all hang out I use Toppik!</li>
            <li>Very Good quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and tool to use in the salon for those clients who are thinning in certain areas.  </li>
            <li>but after three months use ........ will probably defecate three months or more after an allergic reaction .....</li>
            <li>I immediately applied the Toppik on my hair and was immediately satisfied.  </li>
            <li>and this does the work :) it covers all my bald spots .</li>
            <li>love my toppik</li>
            <li>I order this product all the time and love it</li>
            <li>But honestly, I couldn&#x27;t get it to cover up much of anything...</li>
            <li>It has allowed me to be wig free sometimes.</li>
            <li>Good luck if you actually have bald or almost bald spots.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head, which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair.</li>
            <li>Cool</li>
            <li>However you may want to use a mild hair spray to keep the fibers in place.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>This really works!!</li>
            <li>This product is great, I wear it in my hair everyday.</li>
            <li>toppik hair building fibers was delivered on time and the result is worth while for my scalp situation.</li>
            <li>It is a magic that will make you wonder how natural your hair looks from a couple of feet away</li>
            <li>Using Toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind, constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product, and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place.</li>
            <li>Has a natural appearance and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have used a regular hair spray to try to make sure that the fibers are kept in place before I wash them off my head.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was removing the top to install the Toppik Spray applicator.</li>
            <li>My clients have enjoy the instant thickness</li>
            <li>It really works by filling up my balding spot by sprinkling the fibers onto my targeted areas.  </li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t get much coverage.</li>
            <li>Toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair.</li>
            <li>The product worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li>They were very accomodating when I stated my dissatisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also last me about 4 months, well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who is thinning and very self conscious of their hair to give them the confidence they need.    </li>
            <li>but when I ordered it from (health and beauty) it was another story first of all the picture they show is the big toppik</li>
            <li>Never loses staying power and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I have seen the videos and maybe they just used the whole canister each time in order to get enough on your head to cover something</li>
            <li>So far toppick&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li>The claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie.</li>
            <li>It is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots.</li>
            <li>Covers grey hair very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34 yrs old female with hair loss</li>
            <li>It actually blends the shallow part of my hair, and makes it look very full.</li>
            <li>Instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it doesn&#x27;t even bother me, my husband constantly obsesses over his hair.</li>

            <li> ,secondly there was a lot less fibers than I usually get in the smaller ones I ran out faster, usually a smaller toppik last a month</li>

            <li> unless you have jet black hair, this will look weird.</li>

            <li> I purchased the black color to cover a bald spot in the crown of my head. It did the job. However you may want to use a mild hair spray to keep the fibers in place. It&#x27;s not so good for frontal baldness. It leaves a visible residue when sweating.     I am happy with the product and this is the reason why I bought it again.</li>
            <li> THIS IS TRULY AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR ANYONE WITH THINNING HAIR!! IT WILL IMPROVE ONE&#x27;S APPERANCE BY 200%!!!. THE PERSON WHO INVENTED THIS PRODUCT IS A  REAL GENIUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EXCELLENT 10,000 TIMES!!!!!! A MIRACLE INDEED!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and tool to use in the salon for those clients who are thinning in certain areas.  My clients have enjoy the instant thickness this product  provides. One of my clients calls it a miracle product.  I recommend this to anyone who is thinning and very self conscious of their hair to give them the confidence they need.    LuTillian Maxon</li>
            <li> It really works by filling up my balding spot by sprinkling the fibers onto my targeted areas.  I have used a regular hair spray to try to make sure that the fibers are kept in place before I wash them off my head.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it does what the advertisement says it will do.I would recommend this product to the person wanting to hide the ball spots</li>
            <li> I still have plenty of hair so I just wanted this to cover up a small area beginning to show. Keep in mind this is black black, there are no dark brownish fibers in it so unless you have jet black hair, this will look weird. But honestly, I couldn&#x27;t get it to cover up much of anything...and I hardly have anything to cover up. Good luck if you actually have bald or almost bald spots. I have seen the videos and maybe they just used the whole canister each time in order to get enough on your head to cover something but I couldn&#x27;t get much coverage.</li>
            <li> I have slightly been losing hair due to alopecia areata.&lt;br /&gt;I have also been covering up no hair around the&lt;br /&gt;hair line and a small size almost bald patch in the center.So far toppick&lt;br /&gt;has been a small blessings. It has allowed me to be wig free sometimes.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Toppik for awhile now. It is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots. My husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head, which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair. And in the sun, it actually turns a pinkish red (he uses dark brown)! The claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie. Even with a bit of wind or humidity, the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face, making it look like tar. It leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets. I would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity because my husband truly believes that I still don&#x27;t know that he uses the product! Toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair. Using Toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind, constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product, and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place. Instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it doesn&#x27;t even bother me, my husband constantly obsesses over his hair. Instead of enhancing his look, Toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place. Instead of boosting his confidence, Toppik has made him even more insecure about losing his hair.</li>
            <li> Very Good quality and fast shipping. Tnx</li>
            <li> The product worked better than I expected. It worked well in hiding my bald spot. The only problem I had was removing the top to install the Toppik Spray applicator. I will definitely continue to buy this product since it is cheaper than buying wigs.</li>
            <li> Great solution to thinning hair! My husband has been using it for almost 2 years now and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Got it for one of my friend. Wasnt that great experience. Had nver thought to be so pathetic after the use.</li>
            <li> but after three months use ........ will probably defecate three months or more after an allergic reaction ..... (red spots on the head, armpit and left breast)</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning terribly on the top of my head. I immediately applied the Toppik on my hair and was immediately satisfied.  Will definitely order again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 yrs old female with hair loss and this does the work :) it covers all my bald spots . love my toppik</li>
            <li> Great product for thinning spots if u need to cover up. I use it everyday. Wash out every week! Cool</li>
            <li> Covers grey hair very well. Works especially well with gel and/or lotion when you wear a ponytail or pull your hair back.</li>
            <li> This product is great, I wear it in my hair everyday. No one has noticed that my hair has been falling out for 3 years now. That is a great cover up! It also last me about 4 months, well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This really works!! It actually blends the shallow part of my hair, and makes it look very full.</li>
            <li> Wiped off before got a chance to shampoo hair wanted it to stay on til I wanted it off.  They were very accomodating when I stated my dissatisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Classy Bunch to deal with very nice.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and packaged well. It works good for increasing the thickness and texture. Has a natural appearance and easy to use. Impressive.</li>
            <li> Great product. If you have thinning hair this is the one to get. Shake it on the thin spots, pat it down with your hands, brush it out a bit, and apply hair spray. It stays in place until you wash it out, and no one can tell you have it in your hair, not even in bright sunlight. I&#x27;ve been wearing a wig most of the time, but when I let it all hang out I use Toppik!</li>
            <li> I have a thinning hair line and it helps it look fuller. And I&#x27;m not ashamed to pull my hair back.</li>
            <li> toppik hair building fibers was delivered on time and the result is worth while for my scalp situation.</li>
            <li> It is a magic that will make you wonder how natural your hair looks from a couple of feet away</li>
            <li> I order this product all the time and love it but when I ordered it from (health and beauty) it was another story first of all the picture they show is the big toppik but when you get it,the items the smaller toppik,secondly there was a lot less fibers than I usually get in the smaller ones I ran out faster, usually a smaller toppik last a month but this one lasted only two weeks.Be careful with this seller.</li>
            <li> Great product, applies easily, looks great and undetectable. Never loses staying power and looks natural.  This product is truly amazing!</li>
