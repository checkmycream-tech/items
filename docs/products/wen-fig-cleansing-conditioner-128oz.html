            <li> I love this product! I bought one for my mom and another for my sister for their birthdays and the both love it too!</li>
            <li> If you have been using WEN for a while (2 yrs) then you generally know which one works best for you.  Fig is great for ethnic hair and is the only cleansing conditioner I use on my hair and my daugther. Amazon use to have the best deal on the gallon size.  I wish it would combat again.</li>
            <li> Completely rejuvenated my hair!  My hair was thinning, breaking, dry, and lacked the curl I was accustomed.  Thanks to WEN my hair is soft, shiny, thick, and curly like when I was young again!  Every thing Chaz Dean promises is true about this product!  I&#x27;ve converted many friends.  While it may cost a bit more than what you are used to, it is worth the investment in yourself and what you will save in other products, treating damage to your hair, and for those of us who color our hair...fewer trips to the salon for color!!!  Give it a try, you will be so happy you did!</li>
            <li> I have natural curly, color treated hair.  This is the best product that I have found yet for moisturizing and frizz control. Pricey but well worth the results! I have been a Wen girl for 2 years and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> wife loves it. her hair feels and looks great</li>
            <li> oily,bad smell and infection on skull&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> Wife swears by it. so bought the gallon and saved some bucks.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product even use it in my kids and pets.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly reccomend to anyone !</li>
            <li> Love how my hair feels!</li>
            <li> Love this cleansing conditioner.  I have used this for around 5 years now.  Love, love, love it......</li>
            <li> I would not use anything else on my hair. Best product ever!</li>
            <li> IAM A WEN GIRL!!!!!!!!! NOTHING COMPARES!!!!</li>
            <li> Cheaper if you buy 4 (32oz) bottles, this is a rip off</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I love wen. My hair doesn&#x27;t look like every one elses&#x27; hair that we see on TV. Buuut it is so much better then with any other product I have used. Will never use any thing else. I got the gallon!!!!!! Go wen!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money for the larger size&lt;br /&gt;Helps keep  color true-er longer and hair always comes out shiny and soft &#x3D; healthy hair</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything on my hair except WEN.  I love it.  I am a redhead with naturally curly and frizzy long hair.  It tends to dry out very easily.  This helps immensely.  If it is your first time using it don&#x27;t get discouraged.  To use this you basically have to relearn how to wash your hair.  It doesn&#x27;t sud up like normal shampoo add water to it and scrub it into your scalp any way.  Then rinse thoroughly and it will work wonders!</li>
            <li> I love WEN.. Haven&#x27;t used anything else in 4yrs..</li>
