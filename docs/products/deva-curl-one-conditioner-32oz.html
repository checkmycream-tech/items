            <li>Deva products are wonderful for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Best conditioner for curly hair I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Works great on curly hair.</li>
            <li>but the conditioner itself is great.</li>
            <li>Great compliment to the No Poo cream</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner!  </li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, same as the Salon, but great price</li>
            <li>Deva products are high quality and perfect for curls.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and helps define my curls more.</li>
            <li>hair-- meaning the strands are very fine</li>
            <li>There are no products that do a better job.</li>
            <li>I love this product I have been using it for more than three years and nothing comes close.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair healthy and helps with detangling  it.</li>
            <li>We have been using this for more than a year.</li>
            <li>I love this product for my s&#x27;wavy hair but the pump doesn&#x27;t work so every time I use it I have to unscrew the top off and squeeze it into my hand...</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>Both are fantastic!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m just saying that my curls love it.</li>
            <li>I love my hair after I wash it</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a year now and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>When combined with the Deva Curl Llight Defining Gel, it makes my curls look and feel fabulous!</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely (very clean and herbal).</li>
            <li>My hair type easily becomes knotty, so I love that I can use a ton of this conditioner</li>
            <li>I use this paired with a J.R. Liggett Bar Shampoo Bar, and the combination is perfect for my slightly curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for several years and it is great.  </li>
            <li>I loved the shampoo the conditionaer doesnt make hair as soft as I would like&lt;br /&gt;may</li>
            <li>There is this one and a much heavier one (thicker consistency and more of a citrusy scent).</li>
            <li>so knowing I can buy it via amazon for a more reasonable price is worth continuing to use it</li>
            <li>received numerous compliments:  soft, shiny, curls beautifully, etc.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best conditioner for dry curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but the pump was crushed and unusable when it arrived, I would recommend better shipping procedures as packing material insufficient to protect it</li>
            <li>I feel certain that this isn&#x27;t a true deva curl product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not many people realize there are 2 different One Conditions.</li>
            <li>This is a great daily conditioner for dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li>But this product tones down frizz and allows my wavy curls to come through nicely defined.</li>
            <li>It is much thinner than what I am use to.</li>
            <li>Snarls dissolve with gentle pressure.</li>
            <li>I use it to scrub (gently)</li>
            <li>my scalp, ears, neck, etc., and then to gently wash my hair re directions.  </li>
            <li>work better for other types of hair&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Deva products for four years now, plus getting the Deva cut, and actually see a regrowth of hair - little wisps popping up from the top of my head!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li>In short, it helps make my hair and scalp clean, curly (hair only), soft, and beautiful.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The only leave-in (or rinse out if you wish) conditioner that I really like.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave hair greasy and all of the ingredients are natural</li>
            <li>Yes, my curls actually told me how much they L-O-V-E Deva products.</li>
            <li>I have fine thick</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t smell right at all and doesn&#x27;t have the same silky conditioning quality as a bottle I previously purchased from the salon.</li>
            <li>I occasionally will slightly rinse out and then put just a little more through my hair as a leave-in.</li>

            <li> works for my hair - dry and curly (frizzy tendency)</li>
            <li> My hair used to be ringlet curly but that has toned down now that my hair is white.</li>

            <li> Pretty annoying</li>
            <li> I will update this review if I find that the formula has changed, explaining this horrible smell, but I would bet $1000 this isn&#x27;t true deva curl product.</li>
            <li> Pump was broken but product works well.</li>
            <li> Its expensive</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Must have for all curls.  There are no products that do a better job.</li>
            <li> Works great on curly hair.</li>
            <li> I use this paired with a J.R. Liggett Bar Shampoo Bar, and the combination is perfect for my slightly curly/wavy hair. I have fine thick hair-- meaning the strands are very fine but I have a ton of hair on my head. My hair type easily becomes knotty, so I love that I can use a ton of this conditioner and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down. My curls are bouncier and healthier looking since using this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend the other Deva Curl No-Poo or Lo-Poo shampoo products-- they don&#x27;t work. But this conditioner does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a link to the shampoo bar if you&#x27;d like to try the same combination as me: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001W2K51O/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_8</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is the same product. It is much thinner than what I am use to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for almost 2 years. Its expensive so knowing I can buy it via amazon for a more reasonable price is worth continuing to use it</li>
            <li> Been using this product for several years and it is great.  Controls frizz when used alongside Diva Low Poo and Diva Ultra Defining gel (and of course coconut oil).</li>
            <li> I love this product I have been using it for more than three years and nothing comes close. Keeps my hair healthy and helps with detangling  it. Smells nice and helps define my curls more. I received the delivery on time and no issues. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Best product for Curly Hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, not real deva curl product</li>
            <li> Snarls dissolve with gentle pressure. Works well on curly haired pre-schooler, too.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell right at all and doesn&#x27;t have the same silky conditioning quality as a bottle I previously purchased from the salon. I feel certain that this isn&#x27;t a true deva curl product. I will update this review if I find that the formula has changed, explaining this horrible smell, but I would bet $1000 this isn&#x27;t true deva curl product. I purchased this on Amazon from a non prime seller.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I will never shampoo again.</li>
            <li> We have been using this for more than a year. I like it even though I always look at other things.</li>
            <li> Simply the best conditioner for dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my s&#x27;wavy hair but the pump doesn&#x27;t work so every time I use it I have to unscrew the top off and squeeze it into my hand... Pretty annoying but the conditioner itself is great.</li>
            <li> Every other bottle I purchase of this the pump doesn&#x27;t work! :(&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I love the product.  I use it as a leave in often.</li>
            <li> Deva products are high quality and perfect for curls.</li>
            <li> This is a great daily conditioner for dry, curly hair. The scent is lovely (very clean and herbal). I occasionally will slightly rinse out and then put just a little more through my hair as a leave-in. Great compliment to the No Poo cream cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not many people realize there are 2 different One Conditions. There is this one and a much heavier one (thicker consistency and more of a citrusy scent). Both are fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is the only cleanser and/or conditioner I have used on my medium-curly medium-long hair for over a year and a half. I use it to scrub (gently) my scalp, ears, neck, etc., and then to gently wash my hair re directions.  Just today I was at a get-together with several friends I had not seen for almost a year -- received numerous compliments:  soft, shiny, curls beautifully, etc.  Also, Did you do it yesterday?  (No, 3 days ago.)  How do you set it?  (Wash it and air-dry it, or use a portable hooded dryer.&lt;br /&gt;  In short, it helps make my hair and scalp clean, curly (hair only), soft, and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;  Down size?  I have to order through I-net.  I can&#x27;t find it locally?</li>
            <li> The only leave-in (or rinse out if you wish) conditioner that I really like.  It does not leave hair greasy and all of the ingredients are natural so you&#x27;re not using lots of chemicals on your hair.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Yes, my curls actually told me how much they L-O-V-E Deva products. Everything is so conditioning and my curly hair is the healthiest I ever remember. I&#x27;m nearing 40 and started to see my hair thin a little a few years back. I&#x27;ve been using Deva products for four years now, plus getting the Deva cut, and actually see a regrowth of hair - little wisps popping up from the top of my head! I&#x27;m not saying this product is a miracle worker, I&#x27;m just saying that my curls love it.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but the pump was crushed and unusable when it arrived, I would recommend better shipping procedures as packing material insufficient to protect it</li>
            <li> Pump was broken but product works well.</li>
            <li> I loved the shampoo the conditionaer doesnt make hair as soft as I would like&lt;br /&gt;may work better for other types of hair&lt;br /&gt;good product line</li>
            <li> Excellent product, same as the Salon, but great price</li>
            <li> DevaCurl is the best for curly hair! I don&#x27;t like using any other products for mine! I love my hair after I wash it, it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with the lo poo shampoo by Deva Curl.  No phosphates to dry my hair out.  In combination these products are awesome for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Deva products are wonderful for curly hair. Make curls relax just a little, cuts down on frizz and adds moisture to hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and LOVE it. My hair used to be ringlet curly but that has toned down now that my hair is white. But this product tones down frizz and allows my wavy curls to come through nicely defined. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner for curly hair I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> works for my hair - dry and curly (frizzy tendency)</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!  When combined with the Deva Curl Llight Defining Gel, it makes my curls look and feel fabulous!</li>
