            <li> cheaply made, not likely to wear</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s just OK, not great.</li>
            <li> My problem with this necklace is that the middle chain is not balanced--there&#x27;s a doodad on one side and another on the other side, and they aren&#x27;t at the same points.  </li>
            <li> While your wearing it just walking around will make the chains get wrapped around each other.</li>
            <li> I like the tiny little evil eye on the longest chain, and the tube on the shortest,  the chains are thicker than I&#x27;d expected, but that&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> but it turned my neck green</li>
            <li> Thanks delivery :(((</li>
            <li> Terrible quality.</li>

            <li> This is so cute! (: I love it! It goes with every outfit and I get so many compliments on it, bought this for such a good price too :D</li>
            <li> I like the tiny little evil eye on the longest chain, and the tube on the shortest,  the chains are thicker than I&#x27;d expected, but that&#x27;s OK.  My problem with this necklace is that the middle chain is not balanced--there&#x27;s a doodad on one side and another on the other side, and they aren&#x27;t at the same points.  I&#x27;ll still wear it, but you should know, it&#x27;s just OK, not great.</li>
            <li> May take a few minutes to untangle but very cute!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my friend and I really loved it and thanks God it was as same as the picture</li>

            <li> Color faded in 1 day. Terrible quality.</li>
            <li> This necklace faded in just one day after use</li>

            <li> Just loved it. Its a beautiful piece.</li>
            <li> Great little summer necklace! Very light weight. Looks great with a tan. Prefect with sundresses. Versatile for different age groups. My daughter loved it (20s) I&#x27;m in my (50s) and and aunt ordered  one and she&#x27;s in her (60&#x27;s). Great gift idea!</li>
            <li> Was good for 1 day then turned ugly ..</li>
