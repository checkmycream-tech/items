            <li>easy to use, lashes stay on, even if you cry!</li>
            <li>love, love, love, this product!</li>
            <li>I love this glue, easy to use and has a nice sticky hold.</li>
            <li>But what I like the most is it isnt a fuss trying to get the lashes to come off</li>
            <li>I LOVE this adhesive from Revlon.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the &amp;#34;eyeliner&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have been wearing lashes for many years.</li>
            <li>love the brush.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I love it</li>
            <li>Love this eyelash glue.</li>
            <li>Duo is sooooo much better.</li>
            <li>but the seller gladly accepted and refunded me.</li>
            <li>sure they stay in place and to give a clean/precise line.</li>
            <li>I love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>you can wipe that with a baby wipe and FInish :-)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>everything backwards...:-)</li>
            <li>Love, love this product.</li>
            <li>Awesome lash glue to make repairs to individual lashes.  </li>
            <li>The black color is amazing to blend with the eyelashes flawlessly.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;s pretty good...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just OK as the primary adhesive for strip lashes.  </li>
            <li>i was truly impressed and glad that it came in black.</li>
            <li>The brush applicator makes it so easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and always lasts ...</li>
            <li>but actually it&#x27;s pretty nice because I can see where I put it, and I use eyeliner anyway, if any glue winds up showing.</li>
            <li>Since I use dark liner, this blends perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love it but wishes it didn&#x27;t get goopy at the the rim so quick.</li>
            <li>The applicator brush is nice, it is much easier than a squeeze tube + toothpick for application.</li>
            <li>This is a dream come true and so easy.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t find this in stores anywhere anymore, but I&#x27;ve found somewhere with a more reasonable price closer to what you&#x27;d pay for in store</li>
            <li>Holds great and is easy to use, and most importantly, will last you a very long time without drying up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still in my makeup collection just because it did hold my lashes on tremendously</li>
            <li>So I give it three stars just because I did love the product so much when I first started using it</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, my favorite glue by far!</li>
            <li>This might be a great product, but the one I received was totally dried up.  </li>
            <li>This works better than the clear ones in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I apply right to my lid.</li>
            <li>With duo, it peeled right off.</li>
            <li>I tried to wipe it clean, but the super sticky formula never dries completely.</li>
            <li>I can get mine on straight now in a snap!</li>
            <li>But would not be my first choice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it was something similar to baby oil, ALSO over priced...</li>
            <li>I have had it for a month or so, and I think I will soon have to start running hot water over the bottle before use to get it at a manageable consistency.</li>
            <li>thanks revlon!</li>
            <li>would suggest you apply all your eye shadow, eye liner first</li>
            <li>it comes off easily without pulling any of your lashes off, major plus.</li>
            <li>It got REALLY chunky, and ruined the brush after the first use.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and in new/sealed condition.</li>
            <li>Just be careful when you apply this glue, make sure that you get the eye lash</li>
            <li>I switched over to my DUO glue for about a week just to really compare the two products.</li>
            <li>Because the other Revlon one was more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad they started making this one in black.  </li>
            <li>This glue is pretty nice, it holds well and with it being dark it makes concealing any extra on your eyelids easy with dark eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I was a beginner with lashes always made a mess trying to apply lost my lashes to chemo, so I tried this love it.</li>
            <li>And it comes in clear!! üòç</li>
            <li>The only thing she said is you have to be careful because the color is black, but match beautiful you eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I can wear my lashes all day with no irritation-even if I get them right in that tricky inner eye corner-no problems at all!</li>
            <li>My new fave glue.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and use, like the black.</li>
            <li>My eyes are very sensitive to glue, and this product did not cause any reaction.</li>
            <li>but I have to make sure it&#x27;s not touching anything or else</li>
            <li>my opinion the glue is very hard to remove completely, my lids became red and sensitive after using several Q-tips and a very good eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Would never take a chance of using this product again near my eye area.</li>
            <li>So far (3-4weeks, off/on use)</li>
            <li>and I have to say the results were a complete 180.</li>
            <li>The only reason this glue didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it thickens up in the bottle very quickly once opened, even with closing it tightly.</li>
            <li>RIGHT on the first time otherwise the black glue will be very hard to remove from your lid.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to remove, I use Ponds deep cleanser makeup remover with a q-tip, then after the glue has been removed you will still feel a bit sticky reminds......</li>
            <li>Only problem is you&#x27;re not supposed to apply directly to your lashes, but I do the make</li>
            <li>with this being similar to an eyeliner brush it makes it easy to apply that short, thin line.</li>
            <li>The price was ridiculously high, compared to what I pay for Duo&#x27;s Dark Adhesive ( about $2.50).</li>

            <li> with this being similar to an eyeliner brush it makes it easy to apply that short, thin line.</li>
            <li> The price was ridiculously high, compared to what I pay for Duo&#x27;s Dark Adhesive ( about $2.50).</li>
            <li> It holds your falsies secure in place if you know how to apply false lashes properly.</li>
            <li> When I purchased Revlon Precision Dark Lash Adhesive I thought it would be great because it would be easy to apply to my false eyelashes and the dark tone would give a look like you were wearing a black thin</li>
            <li> Just be very careful to place them properly because it is hard to clean whatever glue you get on your eyelid.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I have used before but totally wasted my money buying this old product.</li>
            <li> Does not take nearly as long as Duo to get tacky.</li>
            <li> Stayed put a long time</li>
            <li> The only reason why I took away a star is because I wear mink strip lashes (Velour Lashes) that can be worn up to 25 times and removing this glue is a little tricky and can mess up your lash band if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> As a person who wears lashes practically everyday, I bought this eyelash glue because Duo, while a nice lash glue itself, irritated my eyes really bad.</li>
            <li> I spent over $6 on Revlon&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> The glue looks green and it didn&#x27;t last even one night.</li>
            <li> With this glue, I use tweezers and a careful hand as to not damage the eyelash band.</li>
            <li> When I went back to the Revlon, it had dried up, I couldn&#x27;t even close it all the way without some oozing out the sides.</li>
            <li> I have trouble keeping lashes on the inner side of my lash line, so I put a thin, short line of glue directly on my lid along with putting the glue on the lash 30 seconds before I apply the lash to my lid -</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way &amp; I have NEVER had a problem with my lashes lifting.</li>
            <li> Other glues give out for me on the ends of the strips.  </li>
            <li> I could hardly get the brush applicator out of the bottle when i went to give it a second chance.</li>
            <li> Prime shipping or not, it is not worth ordering at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am sold on this glue!</li>
            <li> It left a gross looking residue that was really difficult to get off my eyes, hands, and</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s black glue EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> proof mess proof</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has a little brush for application.  </li>
            <li> and it is one of the few without latex.  </li>
            <li> installing lashes can get messy for me, so this brush idea is genius.</li>
            <li> I even went out and bought the remover, just in case it was the missing piece to the puzzle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Product was dried out with a flared ruined brush.  </li>
            <li> Received package dried ,1 time use for this price was upsetting.</li>
            <li> The black color looks like eyeliner too!</li>
            <li> Ok product but very hard to remove of your lids :(</li>
            <li> no squeezing a tube, or mess!</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to remove at the end of the day but that just tells me how bullet proof it is!</li>
            <li> I could hardly get the wand out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> It was hard as a rock</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This was the absolute WORST beauty product I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> The worse buy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have eyelashes and have to wear false ones every day.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone using false eyelashes.</li>

            <li> My new fave glue. I love this glue, easy to use and has a nice sticky hold. But what I like the most is it isnt a fuss trying to get the lashes to come off it comes off easily without pulling any of your lashes off, major plus.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this adhesive from Revlon. The brush-on glue is SO easy to work with and apply lashes correctly! I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the &amp;#34;eyeliner&amp;#34; color version compared to &amp;#34;dries clear,&amp;#34; but actually it&#x27;s pretty nice because I can see where I put it, and I use eyeliner anyway, if any glue winds up showing. I can get mine on straight now in a snap! Especially great for beginners.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that I could get this locally.  I looked in a couple of places to no avail before ordering here.  Then, after paying about $10 at the time...now I see it is FIFTEEN...I found it at Walmart for around 3 bucks.  Prime shipping or not, it is not worth ordering at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is the best lash glue I have tried as far as hold goes.  Other glues give out for me on the ends of the strips.  Since I use dark liner, this blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s pretty good... But would not be my first choice if I need the lashes to resist the entire night.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. My falsies stayed on for 14.5 hours. 11 hours at work, 2 hrs driving, 1.5 hours for dinner and drinks. Awesome.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money...received product and it was old and dried up.  I could hardly get the wand out of the tube.  This is a product that I have used before but totally wasted my money buying this old product.</li>
            <li> This is awesome.  I don&#x27;t have eyelashes and have to wear false ones every day.  This is a dream come true and so easy.</li>
            <li> According, to my daughter she loves this kind of adhesive because work better than others.  The only thing she said is you have to be careful because the color is black, but match beautiful you eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing lashes for many years.When I purchased Revlon Precision Dark Lash Adhesive I thought it would be great because it would be easy to apply to my false eyelashes and the dark tone would give a look like you were wearing a black thin eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion the glue is very hard to remove completely, my lids became red and sensitive after using several Q-tips and a very good eye makeup remover. Would never take a chance of using this product again near my eye area.</li>
            <li> This might be a great product, but the one I received was totally dried up.  The packaging was not tampered with.  I have a latex allergy and it is one of the few without latex.  It might work, but I&#x27;m not going to try and order another one.</li>
            <li> love the brush. installing lashes can get messy for me, so this brush idea is genius. I&#x27;ll be ordering again</li>
            <li> I was a beginner with lashes always made a mess trying to apply lost my lashes to chemo, so I tried this love it. Apply it like liner lay lashes on fool proof mess proof</li>
            <li> Love it but wishes it didn&#x27;t get goopy at the the rim so quick. Otherwise I love it it&#x27;s my favorite lash glue!</li>
            <li> Love this eyelash glue. It makes my falsies band vanish and blends in with my eyeliner. It holds your falsies secure in place if you know how to apply false lashes properly. This is my go to glue! I&#x27;m wearing eye splashes falsies in the picture, I got them on Amazon as well.</li>
            <li> This was the absolute WORST beauty product I have ever purchased.  The price was ridiculously high, compared to what I pay for Duo&#x27;s Dark Adhesive ( about $2.50). I spent over $6 on Revlon&#x27;s product. It left a gross looking residue that was really difficult to get off my eyes, hands, and whatever else it got on. I could hardly get the brush applicator out of the bottle when i went to give it a second chance. It got REALLY chunky, and ruined the brush after the first use. the brushes bristles were all over the place and I couldnt put the glue on my falsies without it getting all over them. When I went to put the applicator back in the bottle, it OOZED a ton of glue out and around the bottle to the point where I couldn&#x27;t even close it. I tried to wipe it clean, but the super sticky formula never dries completely. it just got tar looking gunk everywhere. I even went out and bought the remover, just in case it was the missing piece to the puzzle. I&#x27;m pretty sure it was something similar to baby oil, ALSO over priced... and it didn&#x27;t work in the slightest. Not on my face, or anything I got the glue on, like the bottle, my hands, and my counter. Duo is sooooo much better.</li>
            <li> The worst it was all dried up!!!! Never again. Don&#x27;t even want to give it a star. The worse buy.</li>
            <li> LOVE this glue! Great dupe for the house of lashes lash glue. A little does go a long way &amp; I have NEVER had a problem with my lashes lifting. Does not take nearly as long as Duo to get tacky. Just be very careful to place them properly because it is hard to clean whatever glue you get on your eyelid. Nonetheless, my favorite glue by far!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get one use out of it. It was hard as a rock so I returned it but the seller gladly accepted and refunded me.</li>
            <li> GREAT adhesive. I apply right to my lid. No need for eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Best lash glue out there! It is a little hard to remove at the end of the day but that just tells me how bullet proof it is!</li>
            <li> This glue is pretty nice, it holds well and with it being dark it makes concealing any extra on your eyelids easy with dark eyeliner. The applicator brush is nice, it is much easier than a squeeze tube + toothpick for application. I have trouble keeping lashes on the inner side of my lash line, so I put a thin, short line of glue directly on my lid along with putting the glue on the lash 30 seconds before I apply the lash to my lid - with this being similar to an eyeliner brush it makes it easy to apply that short, thin line. The only reason this glue didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it thickens up in the bottle very quickly once opened, even with closing it tightly. I have had it for a month or so, and I think I will soon have to start running hot water over the bottle before use to get it at a manageable consistency.</li>
            <li> So far (3-4weeks, off/on use), it&#x27;s just OK as the primary adhesive for strip lashes.  It&#x27;s great for finishing, looks like precision eyeliner. Only problem is you&#x27;re not supposed to apply directly to your lashes, but I do the make sure they stay in place and to give a clean/precise line.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and use, like the black. Would recommend to anyone using false eyelashes. Stayed put a long time</li>
            <li> Great product, use it all the time</li>
            <li> So not worth the price. The glue looks green and it didn&#x27;t last even one night. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> BURNED my eyelid!  I&#x27;ve never been allergic to any cosmetic (or anything at all, for that matter)... I&#x27;ve used just about every eye product, I am in health care and wear latex gloves daily with no problem so it can&#x27;t be that... but this lash adhesive instantly started BURNING when I tried to apply the lashes to my lash line.  I immediately pulled it off but had a red and swollen eye for 2 days.  WHY???</li>
            <li> This was the first time I used this eyelash adhesive and it works great! i was truly impressed and glad that it came in black. I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Product was dried out with a flared ruined brush.  I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Received package dried ,1 time use for this price was upsetting.</li>
            <li> It is the best adhesive I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used a lot. You can&#x27;t find this in stores anywhere anymore, but I&#x27;ve found somewhere with a more reasonable price closer to what you&#x27;d pay for in store</li>
            <li> As a person who wears lashes practically everyday, I bought this eyelash glue because Duo, while a nice lash glue itself, irritated my eyes really bad. I think it was the formaldahyde and the latex ingredients that were bothersome to the point where I would have to take my lashes off mid-day, my eyes were constantly watering up and looking very red and irritated. This adhesive does not have latex or formaldahyde and I have to say the results were a complete 180. I can wear my lashes all day with no irritation-even if I get them right in that tricky inner eye corner-no problems at all! The only reason why I took away a star is because I wear mink strip lashes (Velour Lashes) that can be worn up to 25 times and removing this glue is a little tricky and can mess up your lash band if you are not careful. With duo, it peeled right off. With this glue, I use tweezers and a careful hand as to not damage the eyelash band. Other than that, I am sold on this glue!</li>
            <li> only gave it four stars bc revlon knows it and so they rob you for it.  $15.00 a tube.  It&#x27;s the best one though: I&#x27;ve tried 4 or 6 different brands and types.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad they started making this one in black.  Because the other Revlon one was more noticeable.  You could see some of the glue.  It arrived fast and in new/sealed condition.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lash adhesive ever! I love it and it blends with your mascara or eyeliner!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff! I like the fact that it has a little brush for application.  Also my lashes stay put ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> I ordered two of the Revelon lash adhesive and one of the containers was cked up by the second time I needed to use it. For the amount of money that was paid, I was very disappointed that I lost out. The only reason I ordered ws my local store was out and a amuch lower cost. I will not order this item from this site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jazziJean</li>
            <li> Overpriced but great product!</li>
            <li> love, love, love, this product! easy to use, lashes stay on, even if you cry! love the eyeline type brush applicator! no squeezing a tube, or mess! thanks revlon!</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff. I will never switch my lash glue as this one is the best on the market. And it comes in clear!! üòç</li>
            <li> Just be careful when you apply this glue, make sure that you get the eye lash RIGHT on the first time otherwise the black glue will be very hard to remove from your lid.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to remove, I use Ponds deep cleanser makeup remover with a q-tip, then after the glue has been removed you will still feel a bit sticky reminds......you can wipe that with a baby wipe and FInish :-)&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest you apply all your eye shadow, eye liner first THEN you can apply the glue in the false eye lash then apply that into your eye lid.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t do like I do....everything backwards...:-)</li>
            <li> we really love this one works good</li>
            <li> Love, love this product. Lashes stay put even in humid weather. Just ordered more to have on hand for travel!</li>
            <li> This works better than the clear ones in my opinion.  These are hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Best adhesive on the market..The black color looks like eyeliner too!</li>
            <li> Ok product but very hard to remove of your lids :(</li>
            <li> The black color is amazing to blend with the eyelashes flawlessly. The brush applicator makes it so easy. I&#x27;ll&lt;br /&gt;never use anything else. My eyes are very sensitive to glue, and this product did not cause any reaction.</li>
            <li> I was relieved to see mixed reviews on this product considering I thought I was the crazy one who didn&#x27;t like it. I received this as a gift from somebody and used it religiously for about 2-3 weeks. I switched over to my DUO glue for about a week just to really compare the two products. When I went back to the Revlon, it had dried up, I couldn&#x27;t even close it all the way without some oozing out the sides. It&#x27;s still in my makeup collection just because it did hold my lashes on tremendously but I have to make sure it&#x27;s not touching anything or else there&#x27;s black glue EVERYWHERE. So I give it three stars just because I did love the product so much when I first started using it but I don&#x27;t think I will be repurchasing. If you&#x27;re looking for a great lash glue, DUO is the way to go. Holds great and is easy to use, and most importantly, will last you a very long time without drying up.</li>
            <li> Awesome lash glue to make repairs to individual lashes.  Love this glue!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and always lasts ...It is also waterproof..&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who wears false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Wish they was a squeeze tube version. But this work wonders with my latex allergy.</li>
