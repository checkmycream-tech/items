    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very good razor.</li>
            <li>Great price.  </li>
            <li>Good shave with good feel in the hand.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about all I can say that&#x27;s good about it.</li>
            <li>The Remington PF7300 F3 Comfort Series electric razor does a good job for a cordless electric razor in its price range.</li>
            <li>is something to give as a wonderful gift to a male in your life.</li>
            <li>This is better than the Braun cordless it replaced.</li>
            <li>Does the job , but needs too many passes, at the end : skin irritation</li>
            <li>The razor manages to remove most of the whiskers, but it does not provide a super-close shave.  </li>
            <li>The sixth time, a bit more.</li>
            <li>my favorite shaver of all time, but it works.</li>
            <li>The shave isn&#x27;t quite as close as some of the more pricey models but the shave is more than good enough to get you off to the office looking good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean with the included brush.</li>
            <li>On the many days when I am in a rush, this cordless razor has been a lifesaver and certainly is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It fits well in your hand and is easy to operate.</li>
            <li>took just a bit of doing to figure out how get the pop-up trimmer to work, but it is excellent for trimming all those longer hairs on places other than your cheeks--ahem!</li>
            <li>He says it is easy to clean also.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product for shaving areas that you are looking for a smooth surface.</li>
            <li>An LED light lets you know when the shaver is fully charged, so you can take it with you on the go and use it without a cord.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>Its alright shaver just not as comfortable as I thought it would to shave with</li>
            <li>When I take the head off to clean it, sometimes a blade pops off and falls into the sink.  </li>
            <li>A full charge takes 16 hours</li>
            <li>Gives a very clean shave, fast to use.</li>
            <li>Older one foil head models better to me</li>
            <li>The trimming feature which pops up is of exceptional quality and is perfect for bad eyebrow days and those places where stray hairs mock your groomed appearance.</li>
            <li>It is ergonomically designed, easy to use and charges fast.</li>
            <li>He was excited to try the first electric razor he&#x27;s had in 20+ years.</li>
            <li>That said, it really does give a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is located more toward the center (top to bottom) of the unit</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having a rechargeable portable shaver in such a low price point is attractive, but apparently a few more bucks are required to make this an effective razor.</li>
            <li>The Remington PF7300 offers a comfortable shave without irritating your skin, but isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li>Thus, if you have an important business meeting with a client, or if you have an important conference with a potential candidate to be mother of your children, then you may use this Remington electric razor, but be sure to supplement it with a high-quality blade razor, such as an eight dollar Gillette blade.</li>
            <li>First Foil shaver and works pretty well.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t quite as close as a Gillette Mach how ever many, but it also doesn&#x27;t require shaving cream---a big plus when traveling.</li>
            <li>This is the first Remington I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>The first time, nothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably better with short stubble, but it can&#x27;t handle anything longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ensure your skin is dry and free of oils.&amp;#34;  The first thing that the user will notice is the light weight of the unit.  </li>
            <li>That other model must sure have been loud!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only positive thing I can say about this razor is that it charges quickly.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband who uses a conventional safety razor to shave, thinking he might like this better.</li>
            <li>I know that electric shavers aren&#x27;t as good at the razors I normally use, but this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>My previous shaver was a rotary shaver, but I like the foil shavers better; this Remington Comfort Series shaver works satisfactorily.</li>
            <li>This charges quickly and stays charged a while through multiple shavings.</li>
            <li>This is a decent shaver, but:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the main reason for the stars</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>It claims to have a &amp;#34;flexing foil,&amp;#34; and I guess it does to a very limited degree, but there are many other shavers that are better at following the contours of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As a result, I&#x27;m frequently left with long hairs on my neck and over on the sides of my face below my ear, around the top of my jaw.</li>
            <li>Got very into the good old wet shaving, complete with various boar hair brushes and actual razor blades and the whole thing, to &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t have time for that&amp;#34; electric shaving to a dollar shave club membership to Harrys.</li>
            <li>The directions include the following writing:  &amp;#34;We recommend giving the battery a full charge prior to your first use.&amp;#34;  Also, the directions read, &amp;#34;Shaving tips.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty big --</li>
            <li>so it makes it a bit more difficult, but not impossible to use.  </li>
            <li>The unit is fine for everyday use, for example, if you are planning to spend the day on a hiking trip, or if you are planning to spend the day in an office.   </li>
            <li>It felt baby-soft in those areas - to me, but he said that using it that long trying to get a decent shave just really irritated his skin and he declared he wouldn&#x27;t be using this model again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old Norelco wasn&#x27;t working as well</li>
            <li>It takes you 20 minutes to do several passes and angles, but it gets the job done and you don&#x27;t really have to do anything except put this thing to your face (turn it on of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a big deal for me, really, but</li>
            <li>Also, please note that if you go without shaving for a couple of days, the Remington unit might not be as effective as expected, because the unit is not really configured to trim the longer whiskers that result from a few days of growth.  </li>
            <li>Does not shave as close as my previous electric razor, but is much quieter</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Does not shave as close as my previous electric razor, but is much quieter</li>
            <li> Seriously, does anyone really have the time to go over the same area at least seven times to get an almost clean shave?</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for at least 30 minutes and did not need to be recharged for a whole two week vacation!</li>
            <li> It charges overnight, it&#x27;s got a little handy stand, and it shaves, albeit not perfectly.</li>
            <li> It works very quickly in dry environments, not so much so in extra humid ones like here in SC</li>
            <li> The battery inside lasts for a very long shave without weakening noticeably.</li>
            <li> You have to be extra careful not to miss whiskers, because once they get a bit longer, it is even less likely that you will cut them.</li>
            <li> It is touted as being quieter than a previous model, but it isn&#x27;t really quiet.  </li>
            <li> Plus he complained that it’s loud, it pulls on the hairs and chafes the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too hard to put back on, but it&#x27;s kind of annoying.  </li>
            <li> (kinda excessive, if you ask me), but gives only 30 minutes of shaving time.  </li>
            <li> If you want to focus on the task, choose one of the other options.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have commented that.</li>
            <li> electric shaver is a perfectly average electric shaver experience.</li>
            <li> He does not have a thick beard at all - in fact, he only shaves his face once per week and never gets a visible 5 o&#x27;clock shadow - just some stubble to shave...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this particular razor is ineffective at reaching hard-to-get spots.</li>
            <li> This rechargeable electric razor gives a close shave like other electric razors I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Few electric razors shave as close as a blade, and the PF7300 is no exception.  </li>
            <li> He doesn’t have a heavy beard but this razor could not handle it.</li>
            <li> you want a mindless 20 minutes, use this.</li>
            <li> It also can catch any of those chronically missed spots.&lt;br /&gt;Also, because you don&#x27;t have all the mess of shaving cream and washing it off, you can use it with your shirt on without getting your shirt all messy!</li>
            <li> I had to dig it deep down to get a mediocre shave.  </li>
            <li> wish I could at least give this shaver a three-star rating.</li>
            <li> However, I did find that even running it over an area of my legs half a dozen times, it still failed to shave off all the hair.</li>
            <li> so this little Remington was not up to a monumental challenge - and it still failed.</li>
            <li> (blades were dull and it was irritating my skin).</li>
            <li> I’m not sure what’s wrong with the razor</li>
            <li> It does a poor job.</li>
            <li> I took this shaver to review, but after reading all the negative comments about it giving an uncomfortable shave, I was hesitant to let my son use it on his face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t require ridiculously over-priced blades!</li>
            <li> is the worst shaver I have ever used actually.  </li>
            <li> While I can utilize the flip up cutting blades to reach those, it&#x27;s not a great shave.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t find it uncomfortable on my legs.</li>

            <li> First Foil shaver and works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Did not like results I received.</li>
            <li> Good shave with good feel in the hand.  The trimmer is located more toward the center (top to bottom) of the unit so it makes it a bit more difficult, but not impossible to use.  Great price.  Some difficulty in locating replacement parts, but they are out there on the NET.</li>
            <li> Gives a very clean shave, fast to use. Very good razor. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Does not shave as close as my previous electric razor, but is much quieter</li>
            <li> My husband loves this item. He said that the mustache trimming feature is boss. This charges quickly and stays charged a while through multiple shavings. He says it is easy to clean also.&lt;br /&gt;This is something to give as a wonderful gift to a male in your life.</li>
            <li> Older one foil head models better to me</li>
            <li> This is better than the Braun cordless it replaced. It holds a charge for at least 30 minutes and did not need to be recharged for a whole two week vacation! It cuts a lot closer than my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t quite as close as a Gillette Mach how ever many, but it also doesn&#x27;t require shaving cream---a big plus when traveling. It also doesn&#x27;t require ridiculously over-priced blades! You have to be extra careful not to miss whiskers, because once they get a bit longer, it is even less likely that you will cut them. It works very quickly in dry environments, not so much so in extra humid ones like here in SC this summer.&lt;br /&gt;It took just a bit of doing to figure out how get the pop-up trimmer to work, but it is excellent for trimming all those longer hairs on places other than your cheeks--ahem! It also can catch any of those chronically missed spots.&lt;br /&gt;Also, because you don&#x27;t have all the mess of shaving cream and washing it off, you can use it with your shirt on without getting your shirt all messy!</li>
            <li> Hmmmm... Where do I start?&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst shaver I have ever used actually.  It does not  provide a close shave at all.  I had to dig it deep down to get a mediocre shave.  I would not recommend this product for shaving areas that you are looking for a smooth surface.</li>
            <li> This rechargeable electric razor gives a close shave like other electric razors I have used in the past. My previous shaver was a rotary shaver, but I like the foil shavers better; this Remington Comfort Series shaver works satisfactorily. It is ergonomically designed, easy to use and charges fast. One fully charged razor lasts for couple of shaves, and the motor operates quietly.</li>
            <li> The Remington PF7300 F3 gives a &amp;#34;close enough&amp;#34; shave.  Few electric razors shave as close as a blade, and the PF7300 is no exception.  That said, it really does give a comfortable shave.  A full charge takes 16 hours (kinda excessive, if you ask me), but gives only 30 minutes of shaving time.  However, if you prefer, you can use it plugged in.  It&#x27;s very easy to clean with the included brush.</li>
            <li> The Remington PF7300 offers a comfortable shave without irritating your skin, but isn&#x27;t perfect. An LED light lets you know when the shaver is fully charged, so you can take it with you on the go and use it without a cord. My old Norelco wasn&#x27;t working as well (blades were dull and it was irritating my skin). This is the first Remington I&#x27;ve owned. Unfortunately, this particular razor is ineffective at reaching hard-to-get spots. As a result, I&#x27;m frequently left with long hairs on my neck and over on the sides of my face below my ear, around the top of my jaw. Try and try, this razor routinely cannot get these spots. While I can utilize the flip up cutting blades to reach those, it&#x27;s not a great shave. Therefore, I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got this razor for my husband as an extra for traveling. He doesn’t have a heavy beard but this razor could not handle it. It does a poor job. Plus he complained that it’s loud, it pulls on the hairs and chafes the skin. So I tried it for shaving my legs. I’m not sure what’s wrong with the razor but it didn’t shave any hair on legs either. The only positive thing I can say about this razor is that it charges quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been all over the place on shaving. Got very into the good old wet shaving, complete with various boar hair brushes and actual razor blades and the whole thing, to &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t have time for that&amp;#34; electric shaving to a dollar shave club membership to Harrys. My commitment to each ebbs and flows along with my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, each method ends up taking me 20 minutes somehow. Any way I cut it, it&#x27;s always 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This electric shaver is a perfectly average electric shaver experience. It charges overnight, it&#x27;s got a little handy stand, and it shaves, albeit not perfectly. It takes you 20 minutes to do several passes and angles, but it gets the job done and you don&#x27;t really have to do anything except put this thing to your face (turn it on of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a mindless 20 minutes, use this. If you want to focus on the task, choose one of the other options.</li>

            <li> REMINGTON PF7300F3 is an electric razor that comes with a recharging unit and directions.  The razor manages to remove most of the whiskers, but it does not provide a super-close shave.  Other reviewers have commented that. This is an &amp;#34;entry level&amp;#34; electric shaver.  The directions include the following writing:  &amp;#34;We recommend giving the battery a full charge prior to your first use.&amp;#34;  Also, the directions read, &amp;#34;Shaving tips.  Ensure your skin is dry and free of oils.&amp;#34;  The first thing that the user will notice is the light weight of the unit.  The unit has a flip-out trimmer for use with sideburns.  The unit is fine for everyday use, for example, if you are planning to spend the day on a hiking trip, or if you are planning to spend the day in an office.   Also, please note that if you go without shaving for a couple of days, the Remington unit might not be as effective as expected, because the unit is not really configured to trim the longer whiskers that result from a few days of growth.  Thus, if you have an important business meeting with a client, or if you have an important conference with a potential candidate to be mother of your children, then you may use this Remington electric razor, but be sure to supplement it with a high-quality blade razor, such as an eight dollar Gillette blade.</li>
            <li> I took this shaver to review, but after reading all the negative comments about it giving an uncomfortable shave, I was hesitant to let my son use it on his face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I decided to test it on my legs. I didn&#x27;t find it uncomfortable. However, I did find that even running it over an area of my legs half a dozen times, it still failed to shave off all the hair. I know that electric shavers aren&#x27;t as good at the razors I normally use, but this is ridiculous. The first time, nothing. The second time, nothing. The third time, nothing. The fifth time, a bit. The sixth time, a bit more. Seriously, does anyone really have the time to go over the same area at least seven times to get an almost clean shave? It&#x27;s probably better with short stubble, but it can&#x27;t handle anything longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could at least give this shaver a three-star rating. It&#x27;s cheap. It does seem to hold a charge. It&#x27;s cordless. And I didn&#x27;t find it uncomfortable on my legs. That&#x27;s about all I can say that&#x27;s good about it. The box claims that it&#x27;s quiet, but I don&#x27;t think it is. It claims to have a &amp;#34;flexing foil,&amp;#34; and I guess it does to a very limited degree, but there are many other shavers that are better at following the contours of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who uses a conventional safety razor to shave, thinking he might like this better. He was excited to try the first electric razor he&#x27;s had in 20+ years. He does not have a thick beard at all - in fact, he only shaves his face once per week and never gets a visible 5 o&#x27;clock shadow - just some stubble to shave... so this little Remington was not up to a monumental challenge - and it still failed. He plugged it in and let it charge for 24 hours before using it. It gets 2 stars for convenience in being wireless and rechargeable. The battery inside lasts for a very long shave without weakening noticeably. The grill guard doubles as a stand for the razor as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband worked on one area of his face for 10 minutes and the razor only got 25% of the facial hair in that area. It felt baby-soft in those areas - to me, but he said that using it that long trying to get a decent shave just really irritated his skin and he declared he wouldn&#x27;t be using this model again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a rechargeable portable shaver in such a low price point is attractive, but apparently a few more bucks are required to make this an effective razor.</li>
            <li> This is a decent shaver, but:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is touted as being quieter than a previous model, but it isn&#x27;t really quiet.  Not a big deal for me, really, but from the way it was described I was expecting something quieter.  That other model must sure have been loud!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. As with all foil shavers, it seems to leave a lot of hairs -- it takes several passes, at different angles, to get everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. When I take the head off to clean it, sometimes a blade pops off and falls into the sink.  It&#x27;s not too hard to put back on, but it&#x27;s kind of annoying.  That&#x27;s the main reason for the stars off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems sturdy enough.  It&#x27;s pretty big -- I wouldn&#x27;t take this traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not my favorite shaver of all time, but it works.</li>
            <li> Its alright shaver just not as comfortable as I thought it would to shave with</li>
            <li> The Remington PF7300 F3 Comfort Series electric razor does a good job for a cordless electric razor in its price range. The shave isn&#x27;t quite as close as some of the more pricey models but the shave is more than good enough to get you off to the office looking good. I am a connoisseur of the hand razor, shaving brush and shaving cream but this takes time. On the many days when I am in a rush, this cordless razor has been a lifesaver and certainly is comfortable to use. It fits well in your hand and is easy to operate. The trimming feature which pops up is of exceptional quality and is perfect for bad eyebrow days and those places where stray hairs mock your groomed appearance.</li>
