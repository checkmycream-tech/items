    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

            <li>I took this with me on a 14 hour flight to Asia, and it was an excellent pick me up.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel wonderful</li>
            <li>As for the product, great!!</li>
            <li>Great for your skin and also a great relaxer.</li>
            <li>feels great on skin,very litttle bottle</li>
            <li>This smells great and makes your face feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>Wonderful and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I have skin disease and it doesn&#x27;t save me but it feels really good.</li>
            <li>Overpriced but loved as a cult-item, the ingredients are more astringent and stimulating, rather than calming and soothing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many &amp;#34;mists.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are so many better calming floral waters and tonic sprays that are alcohol-free which contain hydrosols (distilled floral extracts) that are much better for you than this much-hyped combination of water, alcohol, and oils.</li>
            <li>wish I had been able to sample the product before purchasing.</li>
            <li>I love to spray it on in the morning after I put on my makeup to feel more awake and set everything.</li>
            <li>The smell is fine for me; kind of reminds me of a spa smell... like fresh aloe and mint combined.</li>
            <li>For me, this is a great spray for occasional use; I mostly use it when I travel to freshen up from that dehydrating air on plane.  </li>
            <li>Purchased it after watching Lisa Eldrige YouTube video but it has strong alcohol smell and stings a bit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead I&#x27;ve been spraying Fresh Rose Toner on my face throughout the day to keep it hydrated and have been MUCH happier with it.  </li>
            <li>Just good for traveling or put it in your daily cosmetic pouch</li>
            <li>Fresh on the skin.</li>
            <li>This is the one that wins....</li>
            <li>so I figured it was worth giving it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This wasn&#x27;t the right product for me AT ALL.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and want to invest in a beauty spray, I recommend the Avene Thermal Spring water spray; it is a water spray instead of an elixir, but it is more gentle.</li>
            <li>Yes, I do think Caudalie products tend to be more fragranced overall, but I found this to be a lot even for this</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s still has a rose scent to it, but the scent is still much softer than the fragrance in this one and less overpowering.</li>
            <li>Beauty Elixir is not at all what I expected; the scent/fragrance is most unusual;&lt;br /&gt;not to my taste.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I leave it in my bag for when I&#x27;m going out after work and want my face to look a little more &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Works great but is just so expensive.</li>
            <li>Your ski feels soft.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>I specially like it in long plain flights to keep your skin moist.</li>

            <li> I specially like it in long plain flights to keep your skin moist.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin, this can potentially irritate and tingle due to the peppermint, mint leaf, and rosemary oils.</li>
            <li> I also think the price is not really justified for the Caudalie elixir; by nature of the product, some of it will be wasted in the mist, so you will go through it quickly if you use it daily</li>
            <li> However, I do find it to be a little drying for my sensitive skin; it does contain alcohol.</li>
            <li> It is so heavily scented that the experience is like spraying perfume directly on my face.  </li>
            <li> I do tend to gravitate towards less fragranced products for my face overall, but this is still one of the strongest smelling facial products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> This is a life saver on airplanes and in other dry</li>
            <li> Be careful not to apply around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I got this because in the wintertime my skin sometimes feels dry and tight during the day</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; sensation is due to the volatile alcohol and mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hands down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but&lt;br /&gt;worth</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge beauty/skin care person, so I don&#x27;t use this product that often.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Order this all the time. I have skin disease and it doesn&#x27;t save me but it feels really good.</li>
            <li> 3.5 stars. For me, this is a great spray for occasional use; I mostly use it when I travel to freshen up from that dehydrating air on plane.

            <li> Fresh on the skin. I also use it to hold make up</li>
            <li> I travel constantly.  This is a life saver on airplanes and in other dry environments.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many &amp;#34;mists.&amp;#34;  This is the one that wins....hands down.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but&lt;br /&gt;worth it.</li>
            <li> Works great but is just so expensive. I use it as a toner and to set my makeup and sometimes a midday spritz to wake me up. My pores actually look smaller when I use this.</li>
            <li> Purchased it after watching Lisa Eldrige YouTube video but it has strong alcohol smell and stings a bit. Be careful not to apply around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and refreshing. I took this with me on a 14 hour flight to Asia, and it was an excellent pick me up.</li>

            <li> Item is as described and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Great for your skin and also a great relaxer. Your ski feels soft. I specially like it in long plain flights to keep your skin moist.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel wonderful and it&#x27;s natural.  Also, I find that it&#x27;s cheaper here on Amazon than in Sephora stores.  I&#x27;ll be getting this product here.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I thought. Just good for traveling or put it in your daily cosmetic pouch but if you have a plan to use it daily, get bigger size.  As for the product, great!!</li>
            <li> Re: Caudalie Beauty Elixir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caudalie Beauty Elixir is not at all what I expected; the scent/fragrance is most unusual;&lt;br /&gt;not to my taste.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had been able to sample the product before purchasing. I definitely would not&lt;br /&gt;have purchased this item. Thank You</li>
            <li> feels great on skin,very litttle bottle</li>
            <li> This smells great and makes your face feel refreshed. I love to spray it on in the morning after I put on my makeup to feel more awake and set everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge beauty/skin care person, so I don&#x27;t use this product that often. I leave it in my bag for when I&#x27;m going out after work and want my face to look a little more &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;. I bought on recommendation of a girlfriend and I do like it. The smell is fine for me; kind of reminds me of a spa smell... like fresh aloe and mint combined.</li>
            <li> I got this because in the wintertime my skin sometimes feels dry and tight during the day and I needed something I could apply over my makeup to refresh my skin.  This came recommended by a lot of people and I like the Caudalie brand so I figured it was worth giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wasn&#x27;t the right product for me AT ALL.  It is so heavily scented that the experience is like spraying perfume directly on my face.  I do tend to gravitate towards less fragranced products for my face overall, but this is still one of the strongest smelling facial products I&#x27;ve tried.  Yes, I do think Caudalie products tend to be more fragranced overall, but I found this to be a lot even for this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead I&#x27;ve been spraying Fresh Rose Toner on my face throughout the day to keep it hydrated and have been MUCH happier with it.  Yes, it&#x27;s still has a rose scent to it, but the scent is still much softer than the fragrance in this one and less overpowering.</li>
