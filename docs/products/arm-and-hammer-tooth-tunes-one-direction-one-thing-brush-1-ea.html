    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>My daughter LOVES it and her oral hygiene regimen has greatly improved!</li>
            <li>It worked great for that purpose!  </li>
            <li>The music is great</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush it works to get my kids to brush longer until the music ends.  </li>
            <li>Which is great as they are in a habit to rush through brushing</li>
            <li>Toothbrush arrived on time as promised and it great condition.</li>
            <li>For what I paid I can honestly say it was five stars, very happy.</li>
            <li>He loves the music and has a great time brushing his teeth.</li>
            <li>They loved the music and the timer.</li>
            <li>Everything it professed to be really good deal</li>
            <li>my son loved it, while it worked (about one month)</li>
            <li>very pleased with this project.  </li>
            <li>She loves it, so I love it!</li>
            <li>Makes sure he brushes the  recommended two minutes.</li>
            <li>so I love tis brush.</li>
            <li>It was her favorite gift.</li>
            <li>My Son loves it and spends more time on his teeth.</li>
            <li>I got this as a Christmas gift for my 3 year old daughter and she LOVED it!</li>
            <li>Despite being called a spin brush on the packaging this doesn&#x27;t spin just plays sound.</li>
            <li>Now, this may arguably not be a good thing, but my 7 year old daughter loves it.  </li>
            <li>though I tend to go for the sonic care type, this tooth brush makes it fun for kids to brush and thats worth a lot more than this brush cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to remove the battery cover, replace the battery and reinsert the cover with the pin, but it would be so much easier if they just had a screw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spend a little money and get a great return.</li>
            <li>My son got this and now brushes his teeth with a smile.</li>
            <li>He is six and has a lot of fun with it.</li>
            <li>Well, I think she&#x27;s brushing her teeth more regularly...</li>
            <li>For the small investment, this has been a great purchase and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>She is a very stubborn almost 19-year-old.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It really does work like it says.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>They wear out quickly and it gets expensive to use them, better than having cavities though!</li>
            <li>Very garbled, not at all clear.  </li>
            <li>It is better than rushing through the process and missing a lot of debris.</li>
            <li>Also be aware that the music may be loud enough to wake younger sleeping siblings.</li>
            <li>It just barely vibrates with the music</li>
            <li>The music is not annoyingly loud, just loud enough to keep you entertained while you brush.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This toothbrush does what it&#x27;s intended to, it gets kids to actually brush their teeth for longer than 2 seconds. My only complain is that for the cost of the toothbrush I would have thought that you could buy replacement heads. They wear out quickly and it gets expensive to use them, better than having cavities though!</li>
            <li> Well, I think she&#x27;s brushing her teeth more regularly...maybe. She is a very stubborn almost 19-year-old. The music is not annoyingly loud, just loud enough to keep you entertained while you brush.</li>
            <li> My son loves these things. The local stores don&#x27;t carry a wide range of song titles so we go online to purchase. Makes sure he brushes the  recommended two minutes.</li>
            <li> At the beginning, I would have given this toothbrush 5 starts because it totally changed my children&#x27;s tooth brushing habits. They loved the music and the timer. After a couple weeks, however, the songs started to turn off only mid-way through. After a month, the music feature was completely dead. It is an expensive toothbrush for a month&#x27;s worth of brushing.</li>
            <li> Now, this may arguably not be a good thing, but my 7 year old daughter loves it.  Also, the batteries ARE replaceable, you just need to use a bit of brute force.  However, the toothbrush may need replacement anyway just because of wear and tear at that point.</li>
            <li> The music is great but I thought it was supposed to be an electric toothbrush and spin... It doesn&#x27;t... It just barely vibrates with the music</li>
            <li> Stopped working within a month because the battery died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did they use a pin instead of a screw?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to remove the battery cover, replace the battery and reinsert the cover with the pin, but it would be so much easier if they just had a screw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used a hammer to pound it back into position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an O ring on the cover.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B007A35OXI Tooth Tunes Musical Toothbrush - Black Eyed Peas]] My daughter had been giving me a hard time about brushing her teeth. But when she saw an ad for this product, she promised that if I got it for her that she would brush her teeth without me having to tell her. So I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, she LOVES to brush her teeth! She dances and hums and jumps around while brushing. For the small investment, this has been a great purchase and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Requested by my friend&#x27;s 5-year-old grandaughter and sent to her in Australia for a Christmas gift.  The music keeps her brushing longer.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush it works to get my kids to brush longer until the music ends.  Which is great as they are in a habit to rush through brushing so I love tis brush.</li>
            <li> very pleased with this project.  Everything it professed to be really good deal and I would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> my son loved it, while it worked (about one month)</li>
            <li> My son loves his toothbrush and it makes him brush his teeth for 2 minutes.  I can tell my son enjoys brushing now.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately The Tooth Tunes tooth brush I purchased as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter didn&#x27;t have a tune.  Is there anyway you can send a replacement to Avery Lee, 841 Mola Vista Way, Solana Beach CA 92075?  She flew home today.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my 3 year old daughter and she LOVED it! It was her favorite gift.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush arrived on time as promised and it great condition. My grandson loves it so it made me a hit at the holidays. It really does work like it says. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this toothbrush and enjoys brushing her teeth with it.</li>
            <li> Does not turn on won&#x27;t accept return very disappointed amazons partners so poor</li>
            <li> It helps my granddaughter spend time brushing her teeth.  It is better than rushing through the process and missing a lot of debris.</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES it and her oral hygiene regimen has greatly improved! Spend a little money and get a great return.</li>
            <li> My son got this and now brushes his teeth with a smile. I have been into fancy tooth brushes for years, though I tend to go for the sonic care type, this tooth brush makes it fun for kids to brush and thats worth a lot more than this brush cost.

            <li> My son loves this toothbrush. He loves the music and has a great time brushing his teeth. BUT THE BATTERIES ARE NOT REPLACEABLE! Very expensive toothbrush when you have to buy a new one every 2 months.</li>
            <li> My daughter is multihandicapped and this was an inovative way to get her to brush her teeth for a longer period of time.  It worked great for that purpose!  She loves it, so I love it!</li>
            <li> Received the wrong toothbrush 3 consecutive times!</li>
