            <li>So glad I purchased!!</li>
            <li>Very nice and convenient.</li>
            <li>The wax warmed up to a good temp.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased that I made the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased, but</li>
            <li>Why did I wait so many years to own one?!</li>
            <li>It melts the wax fast, keeps it perfect temperature.</li>
            <li>I use this to keep my brush and shaving cream warm.  </li>
            <li>Works fast and the size is perfect</li>
            <li>, I can turn it on when I get in the shower and it is melts and warm when I get done.</li>
            <li>Love this product, so easy to use and convenient!!</li>
            <li>This works great and will give you a safe wax temperature to apply to your skin comfortably.</li>
            <li>Heated up quickly and worked great.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my wife, she is using it nice more than 3 months now.</li>
            <li>I generally find that the wax is best on a medium heat.</li>
            <li>Great quick and easy.</li>
            <li>It melts the wax just fine!</li>
            <li>and I love the &#x27;wax&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I would like it better if the feet had rubber tips, and if there were four of them.  </li>
            <li>it is a safe way to use wax.</li>
            <li>Thus I don&#x27;t feel safe using it.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>While this wax warmer only holds about 1/2 cup, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>I have had it more than a year and would buy again if needed.</li>
            <li>I wish it had more power and am undecided on whether I should bother to return.  </li>
            <li>A friend of mine recommended this product and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very light weight and easily knocked over</li>
            <li>however it warms wax pretty good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and is easy to keep clean and tidy.  </li>
            <li>overall this was a good purchase at a good price.</li>
            <li>Warmer works great so far.</li>
            <li>It melts and keeps the wax melted and most important</li>
            <li>not much help for those seeking the perfect brizilian.</li>
            <li>Perfect for facial waxing... heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to store.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>It was also easy to clean up and store.        </li>
            <li>great for personal use</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive but nice quality.</li>
            <li>Product looks great but will not hold a standard size pot of wax or collars.</li>
            <li>Also make sure the light is illuminated the first go around- for some reason</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased, it melts the wax evenly and it is not too hot.  </li>
            <li>It certainly is much better than the old pans I used on top of the stove years ago.</li>
            <li>A bit slow to melt my wax but works perfectly</li>
            <li>Nothing like warm coconut oil to make your skin soft.</li>
            <li>But otherwise it&#x27;s a good match for my facial wax.</li>
            <li>I am pretty happy with it, it has a long cord and it heats things quickly.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, keeps an even temperature heat set up quickly!</li>
            <li>Lid to help heat evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased and would recommend.</li>
            <li>The wax in the warmer stayed at the right consistency, unlike the tubes of Zip wax which tended to cool and stiffen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing it takes about 15 mins to warm up enough, but I don&#x27;t keep it full either.  </li>
            <li>Just right for me.  </li>
            <li>I turned the dial all the way to the right, which turned the unit on again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fast.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described on-line and the price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I found the La Petite Wax Warmer performed exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Heats up well and fast!</li>
            <li>This warmer can get REALLY hot, but gives you a lot of control with it&#x27;s temp settings.  </li>
            <li>It heats up waxes exactly like you want it to.</li>
            <li>and did not get too hot</li>
            <li>it heats up the wax and keeps it hot</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get the melted on my stick and used it for my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>This is my first wax warmer</li>
            <li>It would be more stable on flat surfaces.</li>
            <li>judging off of the size and smell that i Have experienced already, it&#x27;s no good.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t put that much wax in the pot - the wax took up only about 15% of the available well volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This warmer works very well</li>
            <li>If you really want to be self indulgent, get this La Petite Wax Warmer, a #4 or #5 Omega brush, some Alpha shave oil, Taylor Sandalwood shave cream and a Gillette Fusion Power.</li>
            <li>I like the unit, it heats wax fast, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the wax that goes with this unit.  </li>
            <li>It has wierd smell on high temperature!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really warms and melt</li>
            <li>this product works very well</li>
            <li>Highly recommend both products!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much space and warms the wax with no problems.</li>
            <li>Holds 140 degrees for more than 2 hours with the control set just past 1/2 of full.</li>
            <li>Woodworker typically pay $100 or more for a hot glue pot.</li>
            <li>With small wax situations at home, this is a great warmer for occasional use.  </li>
            <li>if you purchase &amp;#34;Melting Pot Stripless Wax&amp;#34; the 4 oz container does not fit snugly in the pot, which is fine but be aware to not drip a ton of wax down in to the pot :-)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it better than the microwave because the Moom doesn&#x27;t overheat in a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this to use with the Cerepil Green wax I purchased.</li>
            <li>The other settings are fine for my product.  </li>
            <li>size is right for my needs (just facial).  </li>
            <li>-- it feels a little like some kind of plastic, but it removes the hair, is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make a big mess.</li>
            <li>Love this little wax warmer!</li>
            <li>Outside of warmer also got quite hot</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you are tired of getting waxing done outside, and having to pay and tip.&lt;br /&gt;You can do the same this in the comfort of your own home, its a little messy, and it gets pretty hot (duh!)</li>
            <li>Small enough to store easily.</li>
            <li>It does shut itself off on the &amp;#34;sugar&amp;#34; setting before the Moom is soft enough to use.</li>
            <li>I do wish that there were other options than the strapless wax but for waxing same areas such as eyebrows, chin and upper lip, this is just the right size for the task at hand.</li>
            <li>A wax fire is dangerous this product makes me feel a little more comfortable using wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the wax I bought with it or the smell of the burner on the pot, but it smells like fish and it&#x27;s super gross.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My only real issue is the little feet on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>It is a little top heavy, so be careful where you set it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> All the years I have been using wax remover, I had never had a wax warmer.  So glad I purchased, it melts the wax evenly and it is not too hot.  It certainly is much better than the old pans I used on top of the stove years ago.</li>
            <li> I found the La Petite Wax Warmer performed exactly as described.  As some said, the only problem was breaking the bar of Zip wax I bought to use with the warmer.    I&#x27;ve tried the room temperature products and was totally dissatisfied with the results.  The wax in the warmer stayed at the right consistency, unlike the tubes of Zip wax which tended to cool and stiffen.  It was easy to use.  Everything stayed neat.  It was also easy to clean up and store.        I&#x27;m very pleased that I made the purchase.  And yeh - it still hurts.  Nothing seems to change that.  But at least it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I love my warmer!! It&#x27;s tiny so I can take it with me when I travel and at home it&#x27;s easy to store. It melts the wax just fine! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised for paraffin wax. It does take approximately 30 min to melt a quarter cup of wax bits. Overall, very pleased and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this little wax warmer! Small enough to store easily. Heats up well and fast!</li>
            <li> A bit slow to melt my wax but works perfectly Price is great</li>
            <li> This warmer works very well and I love the &#x27;wax&#x27;. I don&#x27;t know what it actually is -- it feels a little like some kind of plastic, but it removes the hair, is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make a big mess.</li>
            <li> It warms the wax that rips out my hairs.  This is painful.  Occasionally there is blood but at least no more hair.  The bad stuff is not the product&#x27;s fault.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does it well.</li>
            <li> The only thing I hate about this warmer that it&#x27;s tooooo small. however it warms wax pretty good.</li>
            <li> This warmer can get REALLY hot, but gives you a lot of control with it&#x27;s temp settings.  I generally find that the wax is best on a medium heat.</li>
            <li> Outside of warmer also got quite hot so it was hard to move it once it was heated up.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in a timely manner.  It was exactly as described on-line and the price was very reasonable.  It is small but that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
            <li> great for personal use</li>
            <li> So convenient for facial waxing. Small, doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room but plenty big enough for regular waxing. Wish I had come across this years ago!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size for waxing at home. It melts the wax fast, keeps it perfect temperature. Should have bought one of these years ago.</li>
            <li> Great Wax Warmer for At Home Use.  I have had this product almost a year and it still works just as well.</li>
            <li> It heats up waxes exactly like you want it to. It&#x27;s very fast. It&#x27;s very good. Highly recommended to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;The size is also compact, which is great.</li>
            <li> I had gotten to a point where I was using the microwave only to soften Moom.  I just wasn&#x27;t using the microwave for cooking anymore.  Handing down my microwave and gaining some counter space?  Now, that&#x27;s a reason to try a product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I have not used it for wax.  It does shut itself off on the &amp;#34;sugar&amp;#34; setting before the Moom is soft enough to use. The other settings are fine for my product.  I am pretty happy with it, it has a long cord and it heats things quickly.  I like it better than the microwave because the Moom doesn&#x27;t overheat in a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real issue is the little feet on the bottom.  They are some sort of foam, and there are only three.  I would like it better if the feet had rubber tips, and if there were four of them.  It would be more stable on flat surfaces.</li>
            <li> I did not like the unit I received it was cracked plus a 140z can of wax does not fit in it so it was useless.</li>
            <li> Great quick and easy. Very inexpensive but nice quality. Works perfect for what I wanted it for. Heats up my wax in the time it takes me to set up!</li>
            <li> This works great and will give you a safe wax temperature to apply to your skin comfortably. I am glad I purchased this to use with the Cerepil Green wax I purchased. I definitely recommend the purchase to anyone who waxes themselves</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my brush and shaving cream warm.  Its small enough to travel with.  If you really want to be self indulgent, get this La Petite Wax Warmer, a #4 or #5 Omega brush, some Alpha shave oil, Taylor Sandalwood shave cream and a Gillette Fusion Power. Shaving Heaven!</li>
            <li> Perfect for facial waxing... heats up quickly.  Great purchase for me.</li>
            <li> Works fast and the size is perfect</li>
            <li> With small wax situations at home, this is a great warmer for occasional use.  It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and is easy to keep clean and tidy.  This was a replacement for an identical one purchased 2 years ago that broke from being dropped multiple times.</li>
            <li> Warmer works great so far.</li>
            <li> Like the size,  but can&#x27;t find a metal refill that size anywhere????</li>
            <li> I like the unit, it heats wax fast, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the wax that goes with this unit.  I would recommend this unit to a friend.</li>
            <li> Product looks great but will not hold a standard size pot of wax or collars. Even if you use wax beads what are you supposed to use to protect the pot from getting messy?</li>
            <li> I use this for hardwax and the size is ideal.</li>
            <li> I melt cheese wax in this and it works beautifully.  It melts and keeps the wax melted and most important it is a safe way to use wax. A wax fire is dangerous this product makes me feel a little more comfortable using wax.</li>
            <li> I bought this to heat my coconut oil. It works great, I can turn it on when I get in the shower and it is melts and warm when I get done. Nothing like warm coconut oil to make your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, keeps an even temperature heat set up quickly! Perfect for my beads of wax.</li>
            <li> It has wierd smell on high temperature! I don&#x27;t know if it is the plastic getting burned. Thus I don&#x27;t feel safe using it. But otherwise it&#x27;s a good match for my facial wax. I&#x27;ll see if it still have the smell next time...for now, two stars.</li>
            <li> Works fine. But I&#x27;ve stopped waxing.</li>
            <li> very low qoality product</li>
            <li> I like how small it is . Perfect for travel. The wax warmed up to a good temp. and did not get too hot</li>
            <li> Very nice and convenient. I just love it. I am extremely happy with the purchase.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> It is a Little smaller than I thought, but it Works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really warms and melt paraphine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to heat my shaving cream. It works absolutely great! Holds a 5 ounce bottle of premium cream with space to spare. Looking forward to shaving with heated cream!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small. The tank in this thing is hilariously small. Its just not what I was expecting at all. It can only be used for small areas such as eyebrow, lip, &amp; other facial feature services.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife, she is using it nice more than 3 months now. it warms up wax correctly but it is very small.</li>
            <li> Great size for storage, heats well.  I do wish that there were other options than the strapless wax but for waxing same areas such as eyebrows, chin and upper lip, this is just the right size for the task at hand.</li>
            <li> Woodworker typically pay $100 or more for a hot glue pot. While this wax warmer only holds about 1/2 cup, it works perfectly. Holds 140 degrees for more than 2 hours with the control set just past 1/2 of full. I am very pleased, but not much help for those seeking the perfect brizilian.</li>
            <li> Was not expecting it to be this small. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the wax I bought with it or the smell of the burner on the pot, but it smells like fish and it&#x27;s super gross. I read another comment saying something similes to that so it may be the wax pot. To be fair, I haven&#x27;t used it yet so I&#x27;m not sure of anything else but judging off of the size and smell that i Have experienced already, it&#x27;s no good.</li>
            <li> Love this product, so easy to use and convenient!! Use it at home and love it!! So glad I purchased!!</li>
            <li> this product works very well it heats up the wax and keeps it hot&lt;br /&gt;the size is perfect I would recommend it</li>
            <li> I like this but it&#x27;s very light weight and easily knocked over</li>
            <li> This was a great find and I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Heated up quickly and worked great. Sorry I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner. I was still using the over the stove method</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  I use it with Cirepil Blue.  I usually have it set between the Parafin and the Wax setting.  Just right for me.  I&#x27;m guessing it takes about 15 mins to warm up enough, but I don&#x27;t keep it full either.  I use it about every other week for a bit a facial waxing.  I have had it more than a year and would buy again if needed.</li>
            <li> I dropped zip wax into the well, and put the setting on medium.  The wax didn&#x27;t melt and auto shut off.  I turned the dial all the way to the right, which turned the unit on again.  The wax melted, but was still lumpy.  I didn&#x27;t put that much wax in the pot - the wax took up only about 15% of the available well volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get the melted on my stick and used it for my upper lip.  To that end, the pot worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is right for my needs (just facial).  I also like that the pot is the non-stick material (like teflon).  I wish it had more power and am undecided on whether I should bother to return.  This is my first wax warmer and I don&#x27;t know how it compares with others.  I bought it based on another reviewer who said it could be used with zip wax.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this product and I absolutely love it.  I use the Berodin Wax by Eva Esthetics with this warmer and it works incredible.  Highly recommend both products!</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly so be careful when warming the wax. Check on the wax texture about every 20 to 30 minutes. Also make sure the light is illuminated the first go around- for some reason mine would not light up and it took a few tweeks and turns to get it going... Also- if you purchase &amp;#34;Melting Pot Stripless Wax&amp;#34; the 4 oz container does not fit snugly in the pot, which is fine but be aware to not drip a ton of wax down in to the pot :-) I am giving it 4 stars because of the lighting problem and the diameter size in comparison to the 4 oz container. Otherwise- it was a great purchase for at home waxing.</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so many years to own one?! Perfect compact size. Temperature selections for variety fo uses: sugar, soft wax, hard wax. Variable control. Long power cord. Lid to help heat evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you are tired of getting waxing done outside, and having to pay and tip.&lt;br /&gt;You can do the same this in the comfort of your own home, its a little messy, and it gets pretty hot (duh!), so please BE CAREFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall this was a good purchase at a good price.</li>
            <li> This is perfect if you are doing in home waxing for yourself. It doesn&#x27;t take up much space and warms the wax with no problems. It is a little top heavy, so be careful where you set it.</li>
