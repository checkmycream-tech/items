            <li> i always love san francisco salt company products, epsom salt with lavender smell, very relaxing. Good texture, and dissolves nice, this is quality stuff, moisturizes skin&lt;br /&gt;helps with my sore muscles, i soak in this all the time, and add coconut oil to the bath also. I give this salt an a + and it shipped soo quickly too</li>
