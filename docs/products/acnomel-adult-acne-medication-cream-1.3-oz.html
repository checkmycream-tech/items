            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>I used it when I was a teenager many, many years ago and seems to work just as well as in 1952 !!!</li>
            <li>Very good product; at age 82, I most be having hormonal changes (yes, at my age) because I have been getting breakouts; I used this during the 1950&#x27;s..</li>
            <li>I bought this product when I saw all the good ratings, but it was a mistake.</li>
            <li>good color hiding.</li>
            <li>so it is also a good value.  </li>
            <li>After that, you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>so it is also a good value.  </li>
            <li>After that, you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>This his surprisingly worked for me.</li>
            <li>They say alcohol isn&#x27;t good for the skin</li>
            <li>,  people are saying  my skin looks  good ..</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be worn out by all skin tones but good when used at night or while in the house to get rid of break outs and even cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product is skin colored, helps hide the acne just as good as my makeup!</li>
            <li>I have recommended it many times and anyone I have told about it, loved it too !</li>
            <li>Was very pleased.</li>
            <li>So glad I did, It works great.</li>
            <li>This cream is great, I love that it&#x27;s tinted to act as a concealer as well.</li>
            <li>In the morning the skin feels much better and it looks great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad my doctor recommended it.</li>
            <li>I am happy :)</li>
            <li>I recommend having a good moisturizer handy after the product is wiped off.  </li>
            <li>i liked the product and  delivery service was good</li>
            <li>and i love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>So glad I found this product!</li>
            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>Amazing skin corrector.</li>
            <li>In a nutshell, it&#x27;s simply amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This is the best and I highly recommand it!</li>
            <li>and I think the products tint is for much more fair skinned people.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an issue of vanity, honestly.</li>
            <li>Okay, good start.  </li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>but I found it to be kind of soothing</li>
            <li>Effective.  </li>
            <li>Also, the tint is nice.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, so this shows up very conspicuously, and I have to wear makeup over it to blend it in during the day.</li>
            <li>It is, by far, the best acne product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I swear on everything I own, love, and cherish that my face started clearing up within 24hrs.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 30 years and in my opinion is the most effective for clearing up pimples.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best acne treatment I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve ever used on my sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>So far, this is the best product I have found for my acne.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for adult acne.</li>
            <li>This product worked GREAT at first - then I started getting rashes everywhere</li>
            <li>Benzoyl peroxide creams have worked better for my skin.</li>
            <li>While my acne does not disappear it is more under control with this product</li>
            <li>When I run out I will purchase more.</li>
            <li>thought it worked but ended up drying out the area and making it more irritated.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The product was okay, it did have a drying effect.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>literally overnight I looks so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there will be more improvements as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend :)</li>
            <li>What more could be said about a product like this?</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;ll burn your skin a bit, but this stuff is sulfur paste after all.</li>
            <li>I love the matte consistency and tint.</li>
            <li>I am now leaving the house with moisturizer and a dab of foundation, It really feels great to do so</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it was tinted, I actually love the fact that it is.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing more to it.</li>
            <li>The product is superb enough to where I don&#x27;t care that there is a tint.</li>
            <li>I tend to get mine mostly along my jawline.</li>
            <li>The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill.</li>
            <li>I have been struggling with clogged pores (sebum) mostly on my cheeks for over 25 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still going to use it wherever I have the blemishes in order to gain even more control if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still going to use it wherever I have the blemishes in order to gain even more control if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I gave it many weeks.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work better as an all over treatment and not as a spot treatment although I still use it both ways.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t love the texture or the tinted color, and I would never wear this during the day when I&#x27;m out and about.</li>
            <li>I love the tint it has, so I have been able to use it during the day than just nights.  </li>
            <li>But I simply follow up with some lotion before applying my makeup, and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li>I put cerave then 10% benzoyl and then suphur on top.</li>
            <li>Not a miracle but does work much better than the products made for teenagers.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>But ok</li>
            <li>I love the complements .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure how helpful it is to pre existing cystic acne pimples</li>
            <li>After 1 month of these spots not clearing up I needed something better.</li>
            <li>I have had acne for most of my life.  </li>
            <li>I honestly have to say that I have seen an improvement since I started using this product and most importantly my face is not as oily as it used to be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it most of my life.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to any more results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;like magic...  </li>
            <li>so it matches skin tone better...</li>
            <li>But so far, so good!</li>
            <li>I have not had a single breakout, and even more impressive my rosacea has not flared up either.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product until I started breaking out in hives.</li>
            <li>I have cystic acne and after just one use, the redness on my face reduced significantly!</li>
            <li>this product is great for newly emerging cystic pimples.</li>
            <li>Mild peel and antibiotic effective .  </li>
            <li>Super effective at reducing the size of cystic pimples.</li>
            <li>Great product for adult skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist most of my life, and have had the most wonderful results with this little cost-effective cream.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great for the adult break out.  </li>
            <li>A gentle cleanser is best, I would use something all natural that doesn&#x27;t have exfoliating particles in it, they can irritate your condition more.  </li>
            <li>Has always worked great for my adult skin troubles; product performs as it claims on packaging.</li>
            <li>I recommend this as the best product for adults to use if you have acne, cysts, and other chronic skin conditions like that.</li>
            <li>so one tube easily lasts for six months.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not always a big fan of benzoyl peroxide (too drying) or salicylic acid (not as effective), so this sulfur formula is a good alternative.</li>
            <li>The other excellent remark I wish to make is about the company (SUDOKU) who filled my order.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stop the breakouts, but it sure clears them up quickly when they happen.  </li>
            <li>I think it works better for mild cases of acne</li>
            <li>Not at all an easy product to find - the rare zit is gone in a day-and-a-half with this magic stuff.</li>
            <li>The Acnomel works great to get rid of acne fast when it appears so even if/when I do have a break out, Acnomel manages it and clears it up very thoroughly and very quickly.</li>
            <li>Wow, amazing, much better than hi end acne treatments.</li>
            <li>It is great for oily skin, covers occasional flareups and heals.  </li>
            <li>It is important to apply the cream while the face is still a bit damp or dewy, so that it will soak into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every product imaginable; proactive, acne free, clearasil, neutrogena, etc.</li>
            <li>wish this product was available in stores,..</li>
            <li>As an adult, I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>but it was so worth it!</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL 2013 REVIEW:</li>
            <li>Within a month my breakouts had diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li>It took about two weeks for me to see a significant difference in my skin but</li>
            <li>Try it in one spot first to see how your skin will react and be sure to moisturize.  </li>
            <li>For occasional adult acne this product is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful , i use it, the next day the acne bump was eaten alive</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the great low price</li>
            <li>I use this product as a primer during the day and love the results--it gives a nice flat finish.  </li>
            <li>Works fast - tendency to be drying but definitely great as a spot treatment - had to go to my dermatologist to be put on an oral medication but it does dry most cystic acne within a day or two</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I ordered it and paid what I paid, because it is the best and hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>it, you will no longer be insearch for another acne, i have tried a lot of acne products, and they did not work at all, amazon has great products that a lot of people really do not know.</li>
            <li>It gently dries up my acne as it covers up blemishes with a lightly tinted cover-up cream!</li>
            <li>Made me break out more but was shipped fast</li>
            <li>After trying it for more than 6 months straight</li>
            <li>This works by clearing off the scaly skin that comes from the condition, and leaves healthy skin, and the sulfur is antibacterial, so it really clears up the infections that come with acne.  </li>
            <li>keeps my skin condition under control, so I&#x27;m very happy, but of course, I would prefer to not have the condition at all - at least not the acne.  </li>
            <li>The only thing it might be good for is a camouflaging agent.</li>
            <li>I also use a good quality, oil-free facial moisturizer as well (it&#x27;s been forever since I&#x27;ve had to use that!).  </li>
            <li>Glad I tried and comes fast.</li>
            <li>Good for face, upper arms etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for the next 5 days.</li>
            <li>Not sure how much better this works than the Clearasil version, but it&#x27;s a good size tube for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li>I really just have great skin after all... or is this product working actually working?&amp;#34</li>
            <li>it clears them up quickly.</li>
            <li>I tend to have mild whiteheads and/or papules</li>
            <li>Keep in mind there are plenty of good acne treatment products out there that I&#x27;m sure would probably go well with Acnomel, but Clearzine just happens to be the only one I&#x27;ve ever found that completely eliminates breakouts for me.</li>
            <li>but it clears up new acne in a day and has helped prevent more.</li>
            <li>It has a strong sulfur smell and it looks very chalky and tan-colored on the skin.</li>
            <li>This was the first sulfur containing acne treatment I used, the other is Acnevir-- both worked great.</li>
            <li>I have used this product to spot treat during occasional breakouts and it&#x27;s done an amazing job.</li>
            <li>It also helps calm the redness/inflammation from the rosacea, even during the day when I don&#x27;t have this on.</li>
            <li>Costly but worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I guess it was better to use this as concealer than makeup to get some clearing action, but I eventually threw it out.  </li>
            <li>Since using this cream, my face has cleared up so much that people have actually made comments about how good I look.</li>
            <li>Again, still worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish they had a clear version, or more shades to make it easier to use during the day.</li>
            <li>Wow this works even better than salicylic acid and benzyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>It used to be a more natural color that suited skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent new breakouts, and it is pretty chalky, so I mostly use it at night.</li>
            <li>It drys them right up and also conceals them when working to eliminate them..</li>
            <li>I also use Cetophil Daily Facial Cleanser twice a day, in the morning to wash off the Acnomel (and its smell)-this version of Cetophil has a light pleasant scent to it.  </li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive to most chemicals, to the point that I can&#x27;t wear most commercial makeup.  </li>
            <li>, be warned: it has a very strong sulfur smell to it, so if that will bother you then I would definitely avoid purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>It will make skin more sensitive to certain ingredients if one is prone to it.  </li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is unique, however this product has really worked for me and I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>After it dries I lightly moisterze and put on my make up (usually only a light foundation).</li>
            <li>After it dries I lightly moisterze and put on my make up (usually only a light foundation).</li>
            <li>For me that isn&#x27;t a huge issue though, it&#x27;s worth it for clear</li>
            <li>, my skin is more sensitive, but that may be a factor of my particular problem rather than the medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After years of going to the dermatologist and getting prescription topical creams, I&#x27;m glad I found this product.  </li>
            <li>By the second day, more redness was gone, as well as the size of the nodule.</li>
            <li>and I made the mistake of applying it during the day when I first got it.</li>
            <li>I got it first</li>
            <li>That first night, my face felt like drying cement and it started to itch.  </li>
            <li>I believe my acne is more hormonal related.</li>
            <li>is really  help!</li>
            <li>I have conitued to buy since my first purchase.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this, I wasn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does smell pretty funky, but the smell fades after a while.</li>
            <li>Really need to exfoliate and moisturize!</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily skin, and this stuff keeps it matte.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many creams and facial cleansers with benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, etc</li>
            <li>I am very excited and have hope now that I may have close to normal skin in the near future :)</li>
            <li>I would lay a very warm washcloth on my face to try to draw whatever out and end up picking hole in a my skin trying to pop these suckers.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the dark tint, but it turns out it&#x27;s just the right shade for me, but i can see if you are fair skinned it would not work as well.</li>
            <li>Not looking good tho. :/</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t do any good to keep trying the same benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid preparations just by different brands.  </li>
            <li>I keep trying new and different remedies and nothing was even touching this evidently hormonal breakout.  </li>
            <li>Does dry the skin out but not terribly.</li>
            <li>So now I know for CERTAIN</li>
            <li>Just avoid spreading it on too large of an area.</li>
            <li>If you wear foundation, I would wait a few minutes before putting on makeup to make sure it&#x27;s absorbed first.  </li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this in my time of desperation, and true to the reviews, it works like no other.  </li>
            <li>BUT, I slather this all over my upper arms, shoulders and face too, go to sleep, and the little bumps are GREATLY minimized by morning.</li>
            <li>Fast</li>
            <li>I also use the Cetophil Gentle Skin Cleanser throughout the day which has a moisturizer in it and helps to combat any dryness from the Acnomel.  </li>
            <li>But doesnt really work on blemishes..</li>
            <li>and I do not scar or feel the need to pick at my face because the pimples go away much faster.</li>
            <li>you sine everyone&#x27;s skin is different but who knows, it&#x27;s cheap and it might cure your acne like it did mine.</li>
            <li>It really has helped cleared up my cystic acne on my chin though.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for</li>
            <li>product is tinted and it dries to a very matte finish and is noticeable on my medium complexion.</li>
            <li>product is tinted and it dries to a very matte finish and is noticeable on my medium complexion.</li>
            <li>nothing really ever works.</li>
            <li>so I do not apply to much in morning because It just looks like I have to much make up on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on differin, a sulphur wash, doxycyclin, benzaclin, etc from my derm over the years and nothing has helped as much as this for spots, paired with the tretinoin microsphere for all over.</li>
            <li>I really dislike the tint</li>
            <li>I REALLY like the results of this product.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is tinted and the tint is too light for my skin.</li>
            <li>#34;Wait, is this thing really working that fast?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;How</li>
            <li>Seems to really do the trick.  </li>
            <li>The tint is light enough that you can&#x27;t even see it&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any sort of improvement in my skin and am really unimpressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference for my acne.</li>
            <li>Smells a bit funky, but for the price you really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use too much product</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it really dries the acne bumps up fast</li>
            <li>It seems to really be working and clearing up my skin.</li>
            <li>It does reduce the redness but really did nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>&quot; I use it on my whole face</li>
            <li>It is very drying</li>
            <li>I found sulfur and sulfur/zinc soap, and this product, here at Amazon, and through combined use for about a month, my skin is SO much improved.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>in it really helps.  </li>
            <li>It is very drying.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve  spend  so much money  on acne products  over the years</li>
            <li>Also, the tinting is very tan, and so it may not work for all skin colors.</li>
            <li>but I have VERY finicky skin</li>
            <li>Nothing seems to really work.</li>
            <li>Works very well for problems with pimples etc would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>so u need to move fast here.</li>
            <li>Didnt really work for me</li>
            <li>very well and works overnight.</li>
            <li>As a teen, I got occasional whitehead pimples that a warm washcloth or oxypads would fix.</li>
            <li>Forget the name brand products you&#x27;ve probably used since you, too, were a teen and try out Adult Acnomel: you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>but of last they have been more frequent and concentrated around the area of my mouth and chin.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not bad at all and is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Has anyone had this issue and how do you clear up the rashes without a string of antibiotics from the derm!!!</li>
            <li>I find this product to be better than any other OTC medications that I have tried.</li>
            <li>, I tried it again on my forehead and temple later to make sure and got the exact same result.</li>
            <li>I made that mistake and it left me with some big red patches of skin that were super itchy, but they got better pretty fast</li>
            <li>So far I feel like its doing the job, but its only day 3.&lt;br /&gt;Concerning the smell, by howtthe reviews sound, I was expecting a huge waft of total stench to permeate the air...</li>
            <li>It has a high concentration of alcohol which dries out the skin too much</li>
            <li>This is the first time in years my face has looked this clear.</li>
            <li>Seems to be much better than your average acne med.</li>
            <li>That being said, this tint seems to be pretty close to matching for my natural skin color.</li>
            <li>I suffer from some pretty heinous adult acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s impossible to find this in stores, so very happy to happen upon it on amazon.</li>
            <li>so I mainly use it at night.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with adult acne for a while now and nothing really seems to help me much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this worked for someone, but only helped me moderately.</li>
            <li>Adult Acnomel has come in handy quite a few times.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aconmel really helps drying out current acnes real fast.</li>
            <li>Although the cream is tinted, I find that it blends into my very pale skin easily if I work quickly</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast, wow!</li>
            <li>It does a great job of knocking out cysts, but the hot and nasty summer gave me a nice set of whiteheads.  </li>
            <li>The cream works good but the new tinted shade is not good looking.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>B0009RFAOK Clean &amp; Clear Deep Cleaning Astringent, Oil Fighting 8 fl oz]], a product with 2% salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unfortunate because this stuff worked great for me, but I won&#x27;t use it anymore, or any sulfur based medications...</li>
            <li>Works really well for adult acne.</li>
            <li>I have a complicated skin condition that includes adult acne and rosacea, and this is the best topical product for my condition (and I have tried them all).  </li>
            <li>the tube should last me pretty much forever</li>
            <li>the tube should last me pretty much forever</li>
            <li>and so I tried it like normal</li>
            <li>I was on accutane as a teen and have recently noticed that it has been making a come back, though pretty mild right now..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thick skin colored cream that works great under makeup and doesn&#x27;t over dry.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin at all, I&#x27;ll be buying more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>A compromise I&#x27;ve found is to use Bare Escentuals or other mineral foundation, as it sits on top of the Acnomel as opposed to attempting to settle into the skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Several times now a new zit tried to pop up in an area I wasn&#x27;t treating, apply a dab of this 2-3 times a day and it never matured.</li>
            <li>I also use rx tretinoin microsphere .1%, but apply this when new cysts show up anyway.</li>
            <li>I immediately started FREAKIN&#x27; OUT and thought I would spend months embarrassed at the new scars about to form on my forehead.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>My doctor from New York&lt;br /&gt;recommended</li>
            <li>with daily use it fixed my problem and is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super strong, but then you also get used to it while maybe others would not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I&#x27;m a 25 your old white male with a history of acne and still today have some blemishes in certain places, though not nearly as bad as it use to be (thank GOD).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You might get a little over drying at first, but I usually do a moisturizer first, then put this over and it works amazing.</li>
            <li>I have generally been able to keep my extremely oily and acne-prone skin relatively clear</li>
            <li>If anyone has rosacea also known as adult acne, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and the next morning - a rash started and hasn&#x27;t stopped spreading in the EXACT locations I put it-</li>
            <li>I had tried the usual suspects (salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, glycolic acid, tea tree oil, antibiotic gels, clay masks) and was hoping this would work better, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It was first recommended to me by a local pharmacist when I was in my teens.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a gritty feel to it when you first put it on, but once it dries you don&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li>The first time i used this product, the very next morning i woke up with burns on my face.</li>
            <li>but it does the job to cover your pimples in front of your significant other.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day only at night and this seems to be ok.  </li>
            <li>It takes the swelling down overnight, and within a couple days the spot that would have been a huge mass is basically gone.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different acne creams even Pro Active,</li>
            <li>Six months later, I can confidently say that my skin lacks active infections 95% of the time.  </li>
            <li>Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque, 8 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]--a product that contains many of the same active ingredients as Acnomel--and</li>
            <li>, I really think they should offer a few different tints that worked with different skin tones (this is a little orange, so if you have a skin tone that is very fair, it may look funky).</li>
            <li>I noticed a big difference in 1 week and after 3 weeks my skin was pretty clear.  </li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t match skin well enough to go out with it on, it sure makes me feel better to have on around the house, as opposed to horrible bright blood red splotchy cysts.</li>
            <li>I used to love this product (because it actually worked) but now, it gives my face rash-like dark marks wherever it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li>It not only dries out the blemishes quickly but acts as a concealer at the same time.</li>
            <li>I expected it to clear my mild acne like nothing.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot of the cream at once and unless every inch of your face is covered in acne, you&#x27;ll only be applying it to certain areas.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin as badly as most other topical creams I have tried.</li>
            <li>Helps clear skin without over drying.</li>
            <li>It is no use to have clear skin if I have burns all over my face.</li>
            <li>If you have persistent adult acne, especially the cystic type.. try this product!It&#x27;s non-prescription and really works.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with a face wash and, together, they keep my face fairly clear.  </li>
            <li>I am 45 year old  female and really have never had an acne problem.</li>
            <li>I tried a mask that has sulfur in it, and noticed that it helped clear up my skin a lot.</li>
            <li>My face is almost completely clear.</li>
            <li>I have used Adult Acnomel for 10 years as needed.  </li>
            <li>I seemed to have developed cystic acne at this point in life.</li>
            <li>I used it at night when I was home for the evening, but it messed up a pillow case, so I started wrapping the pillow in an old towel.</li>
            <li>Got this for my twenty something year old son and he loves it</li>
            <li>They emerged near my menstrual cycle.</li>
            <li>old regimen: use a willowbark formula</li>
            <li>I saw this product and having adult breakout, wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 48 year young man</li>
            <li>Wow again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing Adult Acnomel for years</li>
            <li>You could smell it if you were near my bed.</li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t done a thing.</li>
            <li>i have had adult acne my whole adult life and this is the only thing has works for me.</li>
            <li>So, I am 38 years old and have struggled with acne ever since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li>WOW um</li>
            <li>All it really does is sort of lessen the red</li>
            <li>All it really does is sort of lessen the red</li>
            <li>Everything turned around after I began using Adult Acnomel.  </li>
            <li>Helps clear up blemishes without over drying my oily yet sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pleasantly surprised me.</li>
            <li>it totally seems to be clearing up my problem zones on my face, but it&#x27;s really drying.</li>
            <li>Not blending well into skin&#x27;s shade like the old tinted shade.</li>
            <li>After 6 months of increasingly out of control adult acne (and/or rosacea), I gave up on prescription meds and the products on store shelves.  </li>
            <li>Im 31 years old</li>
            <li>Used it on my 12 years old son.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dealing with adult acne.</li>
            <li>Worked well without burning or drying my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>this Acnomel for me when I was young for blemishes here and there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>old and still need it for one or two blemishes</li>
            <li>I use a very small amount, spreading a thin layer on my skin after I shower, when your skin is warm - it helps your skin absorb better.  </li>
            <li>I was having a first time ever bout with adult acne and between this and investing in a clarisonic, my skin has cleared up completely and now only experience an occasional pimple.  </li>
            <li>However, it does seem to calm the skin after using other products, like tea tree oil and salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li>As soon as a blemish appears I dab a very small amount over the area and most of the time it is gone my morning.</li>
            <li>This seemed to work okay at first, but then I started noticing a weird rash wherever I applied it.</li>
            <li>When it dries, it tends to look like dirt on my skin if not properly hidden.</li>
            <li>but this product doesn&#x27;t dry me out because I also use the proactive green tea moisturizer on top of the acnomel.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, and spreads easily, so it only takes a few seconds to apply.  </li>
            <li>Goes a long way, invisable, inexpensive, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>However, I can see it has the ability to dry out your skin if used too much.</li>
            <li>It seemed to dry my skin up too much.</li>
            <li>It can dry the skin more than usual</li>
            <li>My skin have always been clear until 2 months ago when I started breakout regularly.</li>
            <li>B0030HTXTY Acnevir Acne &amp; Redness Relief Gel-0.75, oz.]], a clear gel that contains a lower dose of sulfur than Acnomel, but has the same level of resorcinol as well as 2% salicylic acid, is another option if you are not allergic to aloe vera.</li>
            <li>I did later on in my adult life.</li>
            <li>but then it was too apparent that the redness was on the spots i was treating.</li>
            <li>(although he likely wouldn&#x27;t admit it out loud).  </li>
            <li>I discovered this product several years ago and it&#x27;s a must have for sufferers of adult acne.</li>
            <li>This did barely anything for my acne.  </li>
            <li>This product features resorcinol (a medication used in the treatment of cystic acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, and rosacea) and sulfur (a natural antibacterial) as opposed to the harsher aforementioned agents.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very pigmented and if you put too much on it can look chalky, so pat it on thoroughly so that it blends into the skin correctly.</li>
            <li>Acne medications seemed to make my skin worse as opposed to better.  </li>
            <li>A thin coat nightly over any blemishes is a sure cure for surface skin issues.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really made to cover anything up because if you use enough to cover up a blemish, it&#x27;s going to suck your face dry like a sponge.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really made to cover anything up because if you use enough to cover up a blemish, it&#x27;s going to suck your face dry like a sponge.  </li>
            <li>I have been putting on BB Cream a couple minutes after I apply the Acnomel, but don&#x27;t want to put make up on every day, so I am hoping I can find the product in an un-tinted version because, other than the ghost face, I really like the results I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
            <li>Just be careful to use this extremely sparingly and only at night until you get familiar with how it reacts on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful to use this extremely sparingly and only at night until you get familiar with how it reacts on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;ve tried all the other benzo products and are left in agony and embarrassment with adult acne.</li>
            <li>and it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>a weird way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve moved on to different products but still keep a bottle of this handy just in case something does come</li>
            <li>I had a major breakout on the left side of my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway it&#x27;s been about two weeks now, and I have been using only the slightest thin layer before bed over problem areas (while using other cleansers and more gentle creams at other various times) and this has absolutely gotten my severe breakout under control.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway it&#x27;s been about two weeks now, and I have been using only the slightest thin layer before bed over problem areas (while using other cleansers and more gentle creams at other various times) and this has absolutely gotten my severe breakout under control.  </li>
            <li>However, recently, I&#x27;m not sure if my hormones went wild or what, but my skin broke out more terribly than I&#x27;ve ever experienced before.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccommend those of you that have closed comedone acne to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>Def something new to try if your skin has stopped responding to the same old stuff that every other brand has.</li>
            <li>Other than that less than unique service, it does nothing to get rid of the zit</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now allergic to the bismuth in Bare Escentuals products, which were recommended in the review above.  </li>
            <li>cream looks a lot like my natural skin tone, and though it&#x27;s not seamless it does reduce the appearance of any pimples on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its tinted, so it offers a tiny amount of coverage or a great base for makeup.  </li>
            <li>I had gone several years wearing very little makeup, and just doing some mild tanning to keep the acne under control and regular creams and washes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and agree with the other 5 star reviewers...</li>
            <li>I definitely  recommend  it if you&#x27;ve  been  suffering  from adult acne for a long time .</li>
            <li>I recommend only using a thin layer and making sure to gently rub it into the pimple, don&#x27;t just dab some on then leave it because it&#x27;s going to smear and your skin is only going to absorb a small amount of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a ton of alcohol in this product which could be a good or a bad thing.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that it can be purchased on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have found, with rosacea, that it&#x27;s best to stay out of the sun when using this</li>
            <li> (a dab the size of two peas is perfect);</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li> absolutely love this product!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This had the best result for me.</li>
            <li> I cleanse with vinegar and wash and then apply this and that has given me the best results ever.</li>

            <li> This is and always has been the best and quickest working for pimples.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best to wear under makeup because it cakes</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best on the market for acne.  </li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned and it blends in almost perfectly.  </li>

            <li> Great product.  </li>

            <li> This stuff is quite amazing!  </li>
            <li> AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> I used it when I was a teenager many, many years ago and seems to work just as well as in 1952 !!!</li>
            <li> Very good product; at age 82, I most be having hormonal changes (yes, at my age) because I have been getting breakouts; I used this during the 1950&#x27;s..</li>
            <li> I bought this product when I saw all the good ratings, but it was a mistake.</li>
            <li> good color hiding.</li>
            <li> so it is also a good value.  </li>
            <li> After that, you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li> so it is also a good value.  </li>
            <li> After that, you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li> This his surprisingly worked for me.</li>
            <li> They say alcohol isn&#x27;t good for the skin</li>
            <li> ,  people are saying  my skin looks  good ..</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be worn out by all skin tones but good when used at night or while in the house to get rid of break outs and even cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> I love that this product is skin colored, helps hide the acne just as good as my makeup!</li>
            <li> I have recommended it many times and anyone I have told about it, loved it too !</li>
            <li> Was very pleased.</li>
            <li> So glad I did, It works great.</li>
            <li> This cream is great, I love that it&#x27;s tinted to act as a concealer as well.</li>
            <li> In the morning the skin feels much better and it looks great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad my doctor recommended it.</li>
            <li> I am happy :)</li>
            <li> I recommend having a good moisturizer handy after the product is wiped off.  </li>
            <li> i liked the product and  delivery service was good</li>
            <li> and i love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> So glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> Love the product!</li>
            <li> Amazing skin corrector.</li>
            <li> In a nutshell, it&#x27;s simply amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the best and I highly recommand it!</li>
            <li> and I think the products tint is for much more fair skinned people.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an issue of vanity, honestly.</li>
            <li> Okay, good start.  </li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> but I found it to be kind of soothing</li>
            <li> Effective.  </li>
            <li> Also, the tint is nice.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, so this shows up very conspicuously, and I have to wear makeup over it to blend it in during the day.</li>
            <li> It is, by far, the best acne product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I swear on everything I own, love, and cherish that my face started clearing up within 24hrs.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 30 years and in my opinion is the most effective for clearing up pimples.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best acne treatment I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used on my sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> So far, this is the best product I have found for my acne.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for adult acne.</li>
            <li> This product worked GREAT at first - then I started getting rashes everywhere</li>
            <li> Benzoyl peroxide creams have worked better for my skin.</li>
            <li> While my acne does not disappear it is more under control with this product</li>
            <li> When I run out I will purchase more.</li>
            <li> thought it worked but ended up drying out the area and making it more irritated.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> The product was okay, it did have a drying effect.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> literally overnight I looks so much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there will be more improvements as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend :)</li>
            <li> What more could be said about a product like this?</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;ll burn your skin a bit, but this stuff is sulfur paste after all.</li>
            <li> I love the matte consistency and tint.</li>
            <li> I am now leaving the house with moisturizer and a dab of foundation, It really feels great to do so</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was tinted, I actually love the fact that it is.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing more to it.</li>
            <li> The product is superb enough to where I don&#x27;t care that there is a tint.</li>
            <li> I tend to get mine mostly along my jawline.</li>
            <li> The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with clogged pores (sebum) mostly on my cheeks for over 25 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still going to use it wherever I have the blemishes in order to gain even more control if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still going to use it wherever I have the blemishes in order to gain even more control if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I gave it many weeks.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work better as an all over treatment and not as a spot treatment although I still use it both ways.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t love the texture or the tinted color, and I would never wear this during the day when I&#x27;m out and about.</li>
            <li> I love the tint it has, so I have been able to use it during the day than just nights.  </li>
            <li> But I simply follow up with some lotion before applying my makeup, and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> I put cerave then 10% benzoyl and then suphur on top.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle but does work much better than the products made for teenagers.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  </li>
            <li> But ok</li>
            <li> I love the complements .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure how helpful it is to pre existing cystic acne pimples</li>
            <li> After 1 month of these spots not clearing up I needed something better.</li>
            <li> I have had acne for most of my life.  </li>
            <li> I honestly have to say that I have seen an improvement since I started using this product and most importantly my face is not as oily as it used to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it most of my life.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to any more results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;like magic...  </li>
            <li> so it matches skin tone better...</li>
            <li> But so far, so good!</li>
            <li> I have not had a single breakout, and even more impressive my rosacea has not flared up either.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product until I started breaking out in hives.</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne and after just one use, the redness on my face reduced significantly!</li>
            <li> this product is great for newly emerging cystic pimples.</li>
            <li> Mild peel and antibiotic effective .  </li>
            <li> Super effective at reducing the size of cystic pimples.</li>
            <li> Great product for adult skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist most of my life, and have had the most wonderful results with this little cost-effective cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for the adult break out.  </li>
            <li> A gentle cleanser is best, I would use something all natural that doesn&#x27;t have exfoliating particles in it, they can irritate your condition more.  </li>
            <li> Has always worked great for my adult skin troubles; product performs as it claims on packaging.</li>
            <li> I recommend this as the best product for adults to use if you have acne, cysts, and other chronic skin conditions like that.</li>
            <li> so one tube easily lasts for six months.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not always a big fan of benzoyl peroxide (too drying) or salicylic acid (not as effective), so this sulfur formula is a good alternative.</li>
            <li> The other excellent remark I wish to make is about the company (SUDOKU) who filled my order.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stop the breakouts, but it sure clears them up quickly when they happen.  </li>
            <li> I think it works better for mild cases of acne</li>
            <li> Not at all an easy product to find - the rare zit is gone in a day-and-a-half with this magic stuff.</li>
            <li> The Acnomel works great to get rid of acne fast when it appears so even if/when I do have a break out, Acnomel manages it and clears it up very thoroughly and very quickly.</li>
            <li> Wow, amazing, much better than hi end acne treatments.</li>
            <li> It is great for oily skin, covers occasional flareups and heals.  </li>
            <li> It is important to apply the cream while the face is still a bit damp or dewy, so that it will soak into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every product imaginable; proactive, acne free, clearasil, neutrogena, etc.</li>
            <li> wish this product was available in stores,..</li>
            <li> As an adult, I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> but it was so worth it!</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL 2013 REVIEW:</li>
            <li> Within a month my breakouts had diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li> It took about two weeks for me to see a significant difference in my skin but</li>
            <li> Try it in one spot first to see how your skin will react and be sure to moisturize.  </li>
            <li> For occasional adult acne this product is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful , i use it, the next day the acne bump was eaten alive</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the great low price</li>
            <li> I use this product as a primer during the day and love the results--it gives a nice flat finish.  </li>
            <li> Works fast - tendency to be drying but definitely great as a spot treatment - had to go to my dermatologist to be put on an oral medication but it does dry most cystic acne within a day or two</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I ordered it and paid what I paid, because it is the best and hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> it, you will no longer be insearch for another acne, i have tried a lot of acne products, and they did not work at all, amazon has great products that a lot of people really do not know.</li>
            <li> It gently dries up my acne as it covers up blemishes with a lightly tinted cover-up cream!</li>
            <li> Made me break out more but was shipped fast</li>
            <li> After trying it for more than 6 months straight</li>
            <li> This works by clearing off the scaly skin that comes from the condition, and leaves healthy skin, and the sulfur is antibacterial, so it really clears up the infections that come with acne.  </li>
            <li> keeps my skin condition under control, so I&#x27;m very happy, but of course, I would prefer to not have the condition at all - at least not the acne.  </li>
            <li> The only thing it might be good for is a camouflaging agent.</li>
            <li> I also use a good quality, oil-free facial moisturizer as well (it&#x27;s been forever since I&#x27;ve had to use that!).  </li>
            <li> Glad I tried and comes fast.</li>
            <li> Good for face, upper arms etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good for the next 5 days.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much better this works than the Clearasil version, but it&#x27;s a good size tube for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I really just have great skin after all... or is this product working actually working?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> it clears them up quickly.</li>
            <li> I tend to have mild whiteheads and/or papules</li>
            <li> Keep in mind there are plenty of good acne treatment products out there that I&#x27;m sure would probably go well with Acnomel, but Clearzine just happens to be the only one I&#x27;ve ever found that completely eliminates breakouts for me.</li>
            <li> but it clears up new acne in a day and has helped prevent more.</li>
            <li> It has a strong sulfur smell and it looks very chalky and tan-colored on the skin.</li>
            <li> This was the first sulfur containing acne treatment I used, the other is Acnevir-- both worked great.</li>
            <li> I have used this product to spot treat during occasional breakouts and it&#x27;s done an amazing job.</li>
            <li> It also helps calm the redness/inflammation from the rosacea, even during the day when I don&#x27;t have this on.</li>
            <li> Costly but worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I guess it was better to use this as concealer than makeup to get some clearing action, but I eventually threw it out.  </li>
            <li> Since using this cream, my face has cleared up so much that people have actually made comments about how good I look.</li>
            <li> Again, still worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish they had a clear version, or more shades to make it easier to use during the day.</li>
            <li> Wow this works even better than salicylic acid and benzyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> It used to be a more natural color that suited skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent new breakouts, and it is pretty chalky, so I mostly use it at night.</li>
            <li> It drys them right up and also conceals them when working to eliminate them..</li>
            <li> I also use Cetophil Daily Facial Cleanser twice a day, in the morning to wash off the Acnomel (and its smell)-this version of Cetophil has a light pleasant scent to it.  </li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive to most chemicals, to the point that I can&#x27;t wear most commercial makeup.  </li>
            <li> , be warned: it has a very strong sulfur smell to it, so if that will bother you then I would definitely avoid purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> It will make skin more sensitive to certain ingredients if one is prone to it.  </li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is unique, however this product has really worked for me and I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> After it dries I lightly moisterze and put on my make up (usually only a light foundation).</li>
            <li> After it dries I lightly moisterze and put on my make up (usually only a light foundation).</li>
            <li> For me that isn&#x27;t a huge issue though, it&#x27;s worth it for clear</li>
            <li> , my skin is more sensitive, but that may be a factor of my particular problem rather than the medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After years of going to the dermatologist and getting prescription topical creams, I&#x27;m glad I found this product.  </li>
            <li> By the second day, more redness was gone, as well as the size of the nodule.</li>
            <li> and I made the mistake of applying it during the day when I first got it.</li>
            <li> I got it first</li>
            <li> That first night, my face felt like drying cement and it started to itch.  </li>
            <li> I believe my acne is more hormonal related.</li>
            <li> is really  help!</li>
            <li> I have conitued to buy since my first purchase.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this, I wasn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does smell pretty funky, but the smell fades after a while.</li>
            <li> Really need to exfoliate and moisturize!</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin, and this stuff keeps it matte.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many creams and facial cleansers with benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, etc</li>
            <li> I am very excited and have hope now that I may have close to normal skin in the near future :)</li>
            <li> I would lay a very warm washcloth on my face to try to draw whatever out and end up picking hole in a my skin trying to pop these suckers.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the dark tint, but it turns out it&#x27;s just the right shade for me, but i can see if you are fair skinned it would not work as well.</li>
            <li> Not looking good tho. :/</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t do any good to keep trying the same benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid preparations just by different brands.  </li>
            <li> I keep trying new and different remedies and nothing was even touching this evidently hormonal breakout.  </li>
            <li> Does dry the skin out but not terribly.</li>
            <li> So now I know for CERTAIN</li>
            <li> Just avoid spreading it on too large of an area.</li>
            <li> If you wear foundation, I would wait a few minutes before putting on makeup to make sure it&#x27;s absorbed first.  </li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this in my time of desperation, and true to the reviews, it works like no other.  </li>
            <li> BUT, I slather this all over my upper arms, shoulders and face too, go to sleep, and the little bumps are GREATLY minimized by morning.</li>
            <li> Fast</li>
            <li> I also use the Cetophil Gentle Skin Cleanser throughout the day which has a moisturizer in it and helps to combat any dryness from the Acnomel.  </li>
            <li> But doesnt really work on blemishes..</li>
            <li> and I do not scar or feel the need to pick at my face because the pimples go away much faster.</li>
            <li> you sine everyone&#x27;s skin is different but who knows, it&#x27;s cheap and it might cure your acne like it did mine.</li>
            <li> It really has helped cleared up my cystic acne on my chin though.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for</li>
            <li> product is tinted and it dries to a very matte finish and is noticeable on my medium complexion.</li>
            <li> product is tinted and it dries to a very matte finish and is noticeable on my medium complexion.</li>
            <li> nothing really ever works.</li>
            <li> so I do not apply to much in morning because It just looks like I have to much make up on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on differin, a sulphur wash, doxycyclin, benzaclin, etc from my derm over the years and nothing has helped as much as this for spots, paired with the tretinoin microsphere for all over.</li>
            <li> I really dislike the tint</li>
            <li> I REALLY like the results of this product.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is tinted and the tint is too light for my skin.</li>
            <li> #34;Wait, is this thing really working that fast?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;How</li>
            <li> Seems to really do the trick.  </li>
            <li> The tint is light enough that you can&#x27;t even see it&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any sort of improvement in my skin and am really unimpressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> haha.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference for my acne.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit funky, but for the price you really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use too much product</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it really dries the acne bumps up fast</li>
            <li> It seems to really be working and clearing up my skin.</li>
            <li> It does reduce the redness but really did nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> &quot; I use it on my whole face</li>
            <li> It is very drying</li>
            <li> I found sulfur and sulfur/zinc soap, and this product, here at Amazon, and through combined use for about a month, my skin is SO much improved.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> in it really helps.  </li>
            <li> It is very drying.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve  spend  so much money  on acne products  over the years</li>
            <li> Also, the tinting is very tan, and so it may not work for all skin colors.</li>
            <li> but I have VERY finicky skin</li>
            <li> Nothing seems to really work.</li>
            <li> Works very well for problems with pimples etc would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> so u need to move fast here.</li>
            <li> Didnt really work for me</li>
            <li> very well and works overnight.</li>
            <li> As a teen, I got occasional whitehead pimples that a warm washcloth or oxypads would fix.</li>
            <li> Forget the name brand products you&#x27;ve probably used since you, too, were a teen and try out Adult Acnomel: you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> but of last they have been more frequent and concentrated around the area of my mouth and chin.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not bad at all and is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Has anyone had this issue and how do you clear up the rashes without a string of antibiotics from the derm!!!</li>
            <li> I find this product to be better than any other OTC medications that I have tried.</li>
            <li> , I tried it again on my forehead and temple later to make sure and got the exact same result.</li>
            <li> I made that mistake and it left me with some big red patches of skin that were super itchy, but they got better pretty fast</li>
            <li> So far I feel like its doing the job, but its only day 3.&lt;br /&gt;Concerning the smell, by howtthe reviews sound, I was expecting a huge waft of total stench to permeate the air...</li>
            <li> It has a high concentration of alcohol which dries out the skin too much</li>
            <li> This is the first time in years my face has looked this clear.</li>
            <li> Seems to be much better than your average acne med.</li>
            <li> That being said, this tint seems to be pretty close to matching for my natural skin color.</li>
            <li> I suffer from some pretty heinous adult acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to find this in stores, so very happy to happen upon it on amazon.</li>
            <li> so I mainly use it at night.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with adult acne for a while now and nothing really seems to help me much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this worked for someone, but only helped me moderately.</li>
            <li> Adult Acnomel has come in handy quite a few times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aconmel really helps drying out current acnes real fast.</li>
            <li> Although the cream is tinted, I find that it blends into my very pale skin easily if I work quickly</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast, wow!</li>
            <li> It does a great job of knocking out cysts, but the hot and nasty summer gave me a nice set of whiteheads.  </li>
            <li> The cream works good but the new tinted shade is not good looking.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> B0009RFAOK Clean &amp; Clear Deep Cleaning Astringent, Oil Fighting 8 fl oz]], a product with 2% salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate because this stuff worked great for me, but I won&#x27;t use it anymore, or any sulfur based medications...</li>
            <li> Works really well for adult acne.</li>
            <li> I have a complicated skin condition that includes adult acne and rosacea, and this is the best topical product for my condition (and I have tried them all).  </li>
            <li> the tube should last me pretty much forever</li>
            <li> the tube should last me pretty much forever</li>
            <li> and so I tried it like normal</li>
            <li> I was on accutane as a teen and have recently noticed that it has been making a come back, though pretty mild right now..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick skin colored cream that works great under makeup and doesn&#x27;t over dry.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin at all, I&#x27;ll be buying more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> A compromise I&#x27;ve found is to use Bare Escentuals or other mineral foundation, as it sits on top of the Acnomel as opposed to attempting to settle into the skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Several times now a new zit tried to pop up in an area I wasn&#x27;t treating, apply a dab of this 2-3 times a day and it never matured.</li>
            <li> I also use rx tretinoin microsphere .1%, but apply this when new cysts show up anyway.</li>
            <li> I immediately started FREAKIN&#x27; OUT and thought I would spend months embarrassed at the new scars about to form on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> My doctor from New York&lt;br /&gt;recommended</li>
            <li> with daily use it fixed my problem and is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super strong, but then you also get used to it while maybe others would not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I&#x27;m a 25 your old white male with a history of acne and still today have some blemishes in certain places, though not nearly as bad as it use to be (thank GOD).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You might get a little over drying at first, but I usually do a moisturizer first, then put this over and it works amazing.</li>
            <li> I have generally been able to keep my extremely oily and acne-prone skin relatively clear</li>
            <li> If anyone has rosacea also known as adult acne, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and the next morning - a rash started and hasn&#x27;t stopped spreading in the EXACT locations I put it-</li>
            <li> I had tried the usual suspects (salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, glycolic acid, tea tree oil, antibiotic gels, clay masks) and was hoping this would work better, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It was first recommended to me by a local pharmacist when I was in my teens.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a gritty feel to it when you first put it on, but once it dries you don&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li> The first time i used this product, the very next morning i woke up with burns on my face.</li>
            <li> but it does the job to cover your pimples in front of your significant other.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day only at night and this seems to be ok.  </li>
            <li> It takes the swelling down overnight, and within a couple days the spot that would have been a huge mass is basically gone.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different acne creams even Pro Active,</li>
            <li> Six months later, I can confidently say that my skin lacks active infections 95% of the time.  </li>
            <li> Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque, 8 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]--a product that contains many of the same active ingredients as Acnomel--and</li>
            <li> , I really think they should offer a few different tints that worked with different skin tones (this is a little orange, so if you have a skin tone that is very fair, it may look funky).</li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference in 1 week and after 3 weeks my skin was pretty clear.  </li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t match skin well enough to go out with it on, it sure makes me feel better to have on around the house, as opposed to horrible bright blood red splotchy cysts.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product (because it actually worked) but now, it gives my face rash-like dark marks wherever it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> It not only dries out the blemishes quickly but acts as a concealer at the same time.</li>
            <li> I expected it to clear my mild acne like nothing.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of the cream at once and unless every inch of your face is covered in acne, you&#x27;ll only be applying it to certain areas.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin as badly as most other topical creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> Helps clear skin without over drying.</li>
            <li> It is no use to have clear skin if I have burns all over my face.</li>
            <li> If you have persistent adult acne, especially the cystic type.. try this product!It&#x27;s non-prescription and really works.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with a face wash and, together, they keep my face fairly clear.  </li>
            <li> I am 45 year old  female and really have never had an acne problem.</li>
            <li> I tried a mask that has sulfur in it, and noticed that it helped clear up my skin a lot.</li>
            <li> My face is almost completely clear.</li>
            <li> I have used Adult Acnomel for 10 years as needed.  </li>
            <li> I seemed to have developed cystic acne at this point in life.</li>
            <li> I used it at night when I was home for the evening, but it messed up a pillow case, so I started wrapping the pillow in an old towel.</li>
            <li> Got this for my twenty something year old son and he loves it</li>
            <li> They emerged near my menstrual cycle.</li>
            <li> old regimen: use a willowbark formula</li>
            <li> I saw this product and having adult breakout, wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 48 year young man</li>
            <li> Wow again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Adult Acnomel for years</li>
            <li> You could smell it if you were near my bed.</li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t done a thing.</li>
            <li> i have had adult acne my whole adult life and this is the only thing has works for me.</li>
            <li> So, I am 38 years old and have struggled with acne ever since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li> WOW um</li>
            <li> All it really does is sort of lessen the red</li>
            <li> All it really does is sort of lessen the red</li>
            <li> Everything turned around after I began using Adult Acnomel.  </li>
            <li> Helps clear up blemishes without over drying my oily yet sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pleasantly surprised me.</li>
            <li> it totally seems to be clearing up my problem zones on my face, but it&#x27;s really drying.</li>
            <li> Not blending well into skin&#x27;s shade like the old tinted shade.</li>
            <li> After 6 months of increasingly out of control adult acne (and/or rosacea), I gave up on prescription meds and the products on store shelves.  </li>
            <li> Im 31 years old</li>
            <li> Used it on my 12 years old son.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dealing with adult acne.</li>
            <li> Worked well without burning or drying my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> this Acnomel for me when I was young for blemishes here and there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> old and still need it for one or two blemishes</li>
            <li> I use a very small amount, spreading a thin layer on my skin after I shower, when your skin is warm - it helps your skin absorb better.  </li>
            <li> I was having a first time ever bout with adult acne and between this and investing in a clarisonic, my skin has cleared up completely and now only experience an occasional pimple.  </li>
            <li> However, it does seem to calm the skin after using other products, like tea tree oil and salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li> As soon as a blemish appears I dab a very small amount over the area and most of the time it is gone my morning.</li>
            <li> This seemed to work okay at first, but then I started noticing a weird rash wherever I applied it.</li>
            <li> When it dries, it tends to look like dirt on my skin if not properly hidden.</li>
            <li> but this product doesn&#x27;t dry me out because I also use the proactive green tea moisturizer on top of the acnomel.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, and spreads easily, so it only takes a few seconds to apply.  </li>
            <li> Goes a long way, invisable, inexpensive, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> However, I can see it has the ability to dry out your skin if used too much.</li>
            <li> It seemed to dry my skin up too much.</li>
            <li> It can dry the skin more than usual</li>
            <li> My skin have always been clear until 2 months ago when I started breakout regularly.</li>
            <li> B0030HTXTY Acnevir Acne &amp; Redness Relief Gel-0.75, oz.]], a clear gel that contains a lower dose of sulfur than Acnomel, but has the same level of resorcinol as well as 2% salicylic acid, is another option if you are not allergic to aloe vera.</li>
            <li> I did later on in my adult life.</li>
            <li> but then it was too apparent that the redness was on the spots i was treating.</li>
            <li> (although he likely wouldn&#x27;t admit it out loud).  </li>
            <li> I discovered this product several years ago and it&#x27;s a must have for sufferers of adult acne.</li>
            <li> This did barely anything for my acne.  </li>
            <li> This product features resorcinol (a medication used in the treatment of cystic acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, and rosacea) and sulfur (a natural antibacterial) as opposed to the harsher aforementioned agents.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very pigmented and if you put too much on it can look chalky, so pat it on thoroughly so that it blends into the skin correctly.</li>
            <li> Acne medications seemed to make my skin worse as opposed to better.  </li>
            <li> A thin coat nightly over any blemishes is a sure cure for surface skin issues.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really made to cover anything up because if you use enough to cover up a blemish, it&#x27;s going to suck your face dry like a sponge.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really made to cover anything up because if you use enough to cover up a blemish, it&#x27;s going to suck your face dry like a sponge.  </li>
            <li> I have been putting on BB Cream a couple minutes after I apply the Acnomel, but don&#x27;t want to put make up on every day, so I am hoping I can find the product in an un-tinted version because, other than the ghost face, I really like the results I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
            <li> Just be careful to use this extremely sparingly and only at night until you get familiar with how it reacts on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful to use this extremely sparingly and only at night until you get familiar with how it reacts on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;ve tried all the other benzo products and are left in agony and embarrassment with adult acne.</li>
            <li> and it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> a weird way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve moved on to different products but still keep a bottle of this handy just in case something does come</li>
            <li> I had a major breakout on the left side of my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway it&#x27;s been about two weeks now, and I have been using only the slightest thin layer before bed over problem areas (while using other cleansers and more gentle creams at other various times) and this has absolutely gotten my severe breakout under control.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway it&#x27;s been about two weeks now, and I have been using only the slightest thin layer before bed over problem areas (while using other cleansers and more gentle creams at other various times) and this has absolutely gotten my severe breakout under control.  </li>
            <li> However, recently, I&#x27;m not sure if my hormones went wild or what, but my skin broke out more terribly than I&#x27;ve ever experienced before.  </li>
            <li> I highly reccommend those of you that have closed comedone acne to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Def something new to try if your skin has stopped responding to the same old stuff that every other brand has.</li>
            <li> Other than that less than unique service, it does nothing to get rid of the zit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now allergic to the bismuth in Bare Escentuals products, which were recommended in the review above.  </li>
            <li> cream looks a lot like my natural skin tone, and though it&#x27;s not seamless it does reduce the appearance of any pimples on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its tinted, so it offers a tiny amount of coverage or a great base for makeup.  </li>
            <li> I had gone several years wearing very little makeup, and just doing some mild tanning to keep the acne under control and regular creams and washes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and agree with the other 5 star reviewers...</li>
            <li> I definitely  recommend  it if you&#x27;ve  been  suffering  from adult acne for a long time .</li>
            <li> I recommend only using a thin layer and making sure to gently rub it into the pimple, don&#x27;t just dab some on then leave it because it&#x27;s going to smear and your skin is only going to absorb a small amount of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a ton of alcohol in this product which could be a good or a bad thing.</li>
            <li> Even though I have extremely sensitive skin and develop reactions to topical products easily, I never had an issue with this product and the soft skin-colored tint helped any spots I had fade as it treated them.</li>
            <li> This product works great and doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the other reviewers say.  </li>
            <li> I have tried proactive among other things with only temporary clear ups of my acne.</li>
            <li> As I said I&#x27;ve been using other things for an entire month that didn&#x27;t clear this up.</li>
            <li> It can be a little irritating and drying at times and you definitely need to follow up with a good exfoliant after it starts to break the acne down.  </li>
            <li> I checked out other options to clear up my acne and started taking [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Took over seven days to clear up and left dark spots</li>
            <li> (I am used to having several blemishes at any given time, but as long as I can actually count them, it is what it is.)  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m quite happy with it, as it managed to clear up some nasty problem areas that just kept coming back.</li>
            <li> I tried again several times hoping it would work, but each time i got raised, red, itchy, dry skin where I had applied the cream, and it took about a week to go away.</li>
            <li> I love this product even if it&#x27;s tinted but it usually prevents my pimples from getting full blown and painful acne.</li>
            <li> I was only putting it on at night because of the strange smell</li>
            <li> And I believe this tube will last a long time and</li>
            <li> I finally got a handle on it with some salicylic acid products, but I still had some areas that just did not clear up.</li>
            <li> , I decided to stop using it for a few days and bang, a new volcano started growing.</li>
            <li> Although a few new break-outs still happen, I can apply this product and stop them in just a day.</li>
            <li> ugly having blemishes on your face, glad I have Adult Acnomel.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that help dry the weeping.</li>
            <li> This last month I have even slept with their mask on my face to dry out the acne spots and that didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced quick results using this cream.</li>
            <li> I live in Japan and it took only a few days!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all what attracted me was the fact the active ingredients are different than anything you can buy at the regular store.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, my acne is not even that bad.</li>
            <li> I am twenty one years old and have just recently (as in it started this past summer)</li>
            <li> If you catch them early when they are just small red bumps it can get rid of them within a day or 2.</li>
            <li> After two weeks now, the blemishes, small heads and red dots leftovers are now almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> eventually it caused rashes and swelling from minor spot treatment.</li>
            <li> Not only does the redness goes away but the area where the closed comedones were is basically gone.</li>
            <li> and this stuff seems to have helped reduce but not completely eliminate these.</li>
            <li> Long way to go.  </li>
            <li> you are struggling with adult acne, this is one of the few things that I still endorse and that works for me</li>
            <li> I have some rosacea and the occasional blemish and some rough patches.</li>
            <li> What else can I say except if it weren&#x27;t for this product I&#x27;d be wearing long sleeves all summer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> It did not clear up my pimple, let alone make it smaller or less red.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on recommendations I found online at various other sites.  </li>
            <li> But this works well overall when used in conjunction with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not make my skin dry and red like other products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to review acne products because everyone&#x27;s skin responds differently, but for me, Adult Acnomel works well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a very long time</li>
            <li> I use it at night after washing my face since it tends to dry my face out a bit under my makeup.</li>
            <li> Acnomel does help dry up existing pimples faster.</li>
            <li> However, I would not recommend using this product with makeup as it can cause foundation to dry out and cake up.  </li>
            <li> Use sparingly and after a moisturizer, as it will dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried and tried Proactive and all that seems to do is irritate and dry out my face.</li>
            <li> and it looks too dry (plus you need SPF)</li>
            <li> It does dry out the skin though.  </li>
            <li> I started using it and noticed a difference within a few days, my acne was starting to clear up, and the rosacea was lessened as well (perhaps because the acne wasn&#x27;t exacerbating it), and within a few weeks, the acne was under control.  </li>
            <li> I use this product a bit differently than the average user in that I use it as an acne preventative.  </li>
            <li> I use this daily to even out my skin and keep down the shine.</li>
            <li> I am gonna buy again before I am down to my last pea size.</li>
            <li> all the sudden, I started having multiple zit attacks on my forehead, in the middle, like angry red third eyes.</li>
            <li> I have white heads and black heads</li>
            <li> Less than that actually.</li>
            <li> This clearzine supplement actually prevents breakouts and after about a month and a half of taking it</li>
            <li> I only use the Acnomel at night, because it does have a slight sulfur odor.  </li>
            <li> I use this product every night to help with acne rosacea breakouts and to make my skin less oily the next day.  </li>
            <li> I dab a thin layer on a pimple and you can start seeing calm down in minutes.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing would be the sulfur smell but as long as you&#x27;re thoroughly cleaning your skin daily</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;It kind of dried my skin and definitely did not cure any of my acne.  :-(</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second tube and will stick with it a little longer to see if it continues to work.</li>
            <li> Salycilic acid treatments do little or nothing, but this actually seems to reduce the size of my pimples when I apply liberally.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> In any case, if you&#x27;ve tried every other product on the market without avail, there&#x27;s no harm in giving this one a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, October 2012:&lt;br /&gt;Having used this religiously for a year and a half, I&#x27;d like to add a few extra notes about Acnomel.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I was of course skeptical at first, but not for long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 years old and lately have started having an issue with acne</li>
            <li> and I thought I would just dab a tiny bit on a few places...</li>
            <li> I had closed comedones forming along my jaw line</li>
            <li> I have to be careful with wearing it to bed bc</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of days to get used to the smell of it, I overcame that by putting a dab of Vick&#x27;s Vapor Rub under my nose, the sulfur in it really made me nauseated.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s only been a few days, we&#x27;ll see....</li>
            <li> Minus one star because it could be smoother for application.</li>
            <li> after seeing a few different acne websites rate it as the #1 oral acne treatment product.</li>
            <li> After only a few days almost all of my problem areas have cleared up.</li>
            <li> IT works and also since its a pink cream.</li>
            <li> One of the FEW acne creams that actually work.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I&#x27;ve never written a review for this before considering I have used this for roughly 20 years.</li>
            <li> It does dry skin out a lot thought!!</li>
            <li> After the first day, the redness subsided and the nodules decreased in size slightly.</li>
            <li> I usually replace it only when it starts to dry out because it surpassed the expiration date on the tube.</li>
            <li> I have been using Acnomel Adult Acne Medication for the past 50 years on the occasions when I have a slight skin breakout.  </li>
            <li> They also address a specific type of acne that I get on my forehead--very small harder bumps.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> A single tube lasts me about a month and a half.  </li>
            <li> The other night I had layers of other stuff on</li>
            <li> I use it for prevention of breakouts every other night now.</li>
            <li> During the period I tried to use other products but there&#x27;s no any Acne medications in the world like Acnomel Medication Cream.</li>
            <li> tried OCM for 4 months, with tea tree oil which helped with other pimples but not the nodule things.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I suggest applying it to a small, tiny patch somewhere other than your face before trying it.</li>
            <li> but so do a million other things which are cheaper and don&#x27;t stain pillow sheets.</li>
            <li> I thought I was doomed to have acne forever because I have PCOS which, among other things, can cause oily skin and cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> In other words, your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Compared to any other pimple cream, this one works for her.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of over the counter sulfur-based acne medication</li>
            <li> These other commenters must have the smell sense of a dog to be so put off by it.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A VERY LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> I mean it was barely on there</li>
            <li> My skin is bad if I don&#x27;t use strong stuff</li>
            <li> and I also have other imperfections with my skin from previous outbreaks.  </li>
            <li> It costed $10 and so not worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not worth it to me, so</li>
            <li> It does indeed still get rid of the bumps but now, it leaves dark marks.</li>
            <li> For that reason, I can see this lasting at least a year.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the color.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne, and I noticed that any acne medication that I used with salicylic acid would make it worse.</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li> slightly tinted but not like makeup or anything</li>
            <li> Using these two products together has helped the rosacea, because I do not have acne causing me flare ups, and the redness is much less and continues to improve every week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s intended to replace foundation...just slightly reduce the pinkish tinge of an inflamed face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s intended to replace foundation...just slightly reduce the pinkish tinge of an inflamed face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less chemicals that the typical acne creams and washes you find in stores.</li>
            <li> I searched all over for it; checking with pharmacists at major chain stores as some nonprescription products are sold from behind the pharmacy counter, but had no luck finding it.</li>
            <li> but at least it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> After it dries a little, you can rub some of the makeup part off, but it still doesn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> At times a little too drying.  </li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a shade to the cream and a stronger smell that you get used to.</li>
            <li> I remember my dad using this when I was little.</li>
            <li> A little drying</li>
            <li> I use this cream at night, and in the morning after I wash off the cream my face gets a little peel-y.</li>
            <li> I put product on at night and not even a little shrinkage of the acne</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beware, it contains sulfer, and so it can be a little smelly.  </li>
            <li> It does look a little chalky, but it doesn&#x27;t break me out</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much and it STINKs</li>
            <li> a 30 something female, I have never experienced acne or pimples</li>
            <li> since it&#x27;s been almost 20 years I couldn&#x27;t leave my house without heavy foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I am not paid by anyone for this, I just have done it</li>
            <li> but after repurchasing it months later, my face reacted even worse.</li>
            <li> After that, I just used a THIN layer and ONLY over the actual broken out areas, before bed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen  results  after few days  </li>
            <li> It dried out my skin and didn&#x27;t heal anything.</li>
            <li> My acne dried after about 2 days of usage.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a product that works for adult acne.  </li>
            <li> This grey stuff sucks!  </li>
            <li> At night I put a thin layer all over, where in the morning I only dot a small amount on any nodules or tenderspots.</li>
            <li> At night I put a thin layer all over, where in the morning I only dot a small amount on any nodules or tenderspots.</li>
            <li> been suffering from some pretty bad acne.</li>
            <li> At any rate being perimenopausal-i usually get a few pimples a week</li>
            <li> A little drying, but no redness or irritation!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad acne on and off for 20+ years and this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Placing a small amount on the pimple does not prevent burning.  </li>
            <li> but if I use it every couple of days it does work well on small blemishes.</li>
            <li> Even when prescriptions and multiple trips to the dermatologist failed to provide results, this acne cream worked wonders.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for years until  I was unable to get it until recently.  </li>
            <li> When I do have a breakout, it consists of one or two small pustules that go away overnight.  </li>
            <li> Given that the medication is also appropriate for rosacea, this isn&#x27;t shocking.  </li>
            <li> I usually dab acne creams over the pimple, I&#x27;ve used this technique for BP creams</li>
            <li> It is not very tinting if a thin layer is applied and spread evenly over the affected area, then feathered into surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> This was going on for months and was becoming quite embarrassing and VERY annoying.</li>
            <li> So far it only dried out my skin, and it smells awful..</li>
            <li> Except both left all of my sheets smelling like sulfur, this one was the worst though, probably because of the high concentration of sulfur.</li>
            <li> It is an eEXCELLENT product but hard to find.    </li>
            <li> It is hard to wash off and burns your eyes.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I have combonation skin that has been hard to treat.</li>
            <li> Hard to find been using this since I was 16</li>
            <li> I also have changed my diet by eliminating sugar, increasing water, and walking at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Someone complained about the smell on another blog</li>
            <li> It really sucks.</li>
            <li> but then my acne flared up again and seems to linger for at least a week or two before even one pimple clears up.</li>
            <li> seems to help with coverage and at least its not just make up not doing anything&lt;</li>
            <li> but they dont stop the small redness from getting big and painful.</li>
            <li> basically I now apply a VERY small amount of this to my forehead in the morning, or wherever I suspect an incoming pimple, and again in the evening</li>
            <li> and this crap is hard to clear up.  </li>
            <li> I actually had to throw out my comforter, my pillow, the the sheets I used, because after washing multiple times the odor was still awful and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> a little expensive, though.</li>
            <li> I thought initially it was a bad batch</li>
            <li> Recently though, I&#x27;ve been having bad acne again</li>
            <li> After I wash my face my skin and acne is all red and bad looking.</li>
            <li> Not only that it smells really bad..</li>
            <li> and they way it looks like make up (not a good look for a guy).  </li>
            <li> When this hasn&#x27;t occurred, I merely keep applying for a few days until the blemish disappears.  </li>
            <li> Those stubborn, painful, red lumps would still be there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , not too long had passed before I had a horrible allergic reaction wherever I had applied it, similar to hives or poison ivy</li>
            <li> I had horrible, peeling itchy red dry skin wherever I had applied it</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit unpleasant due to the sulfer, so I often apply it before bed.</li>
            <li> face wash 2x a day, toner, thin layer of BP and moisturize in the A.M.</li>
            <li> Being bald, it made matters worse.</li>
            <li> You may also try Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay, it compliments this product well esp.</li>
            <li> I coat my face with a thin layer of this product immediately after washing and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Just make this condition worse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past when my acne morphed into the horrible, painful and impossible to cover cystic kind.</li>
            <li> I seriously regret buying it!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of getting another product that may not work.</li>
            <li> Sad to say this product didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> then I apply a very thin layer of Acnomel.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it stinks at all.</li>
            <li> Although, it does have that rather unpleasant smell of sulfur.</li>
            <li> They were bad before I had my son 5 years ago but still I deal with breakouts from stress, etc.</li>
            <li> my skin has healed from a bad break out in 2 days</li>
            <li> It works wonders and removes the painful acne that we are plagued with.  </li>
            <li> Once I hit 30, I get this painful nodules under my skin around my jawline and my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Nothing seemed to help these painful lumps.</li>
            <li> My forehead was nothing but a painful mass of bumps.  </li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t happen again. :(</li>
            <li> , i have very tough skin, this was just terrible.</li>
            <li> But lately I&#x27;ve had to cake that awful foundation on just to hide my disgusting breakout.  </li>
            <li> I must have an allergy to something, this was awful. :(</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE rash!</li>
            <li> The sides of my face were breaking out horribly as well.  </li>
            <li> Before discovering this product by chance six months ago, my skin was in terrible shape.  </li>
            <li> Awful don&#x27;t buy , Oder is awful</li>
            <li> Very awful product</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Yes, I have used this before and it works well. Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I have used this produt since 1960 and now my daughter and grandchild use it.  It is an eEXCELLENT product but hard to find.    The other excellent remark I wish to make is about the company (SUDOKU) who filled my order.  AMAZON gets 5 STARS for having SUDOKU as one of their vendors!</li>
            <li> I used it when I was a teenager many, many years ago and seems to work just as well as in 1952 !!!</li>
            <li> Amazing skin corrector. I use this daily to even out my skin and keep down the shine. The only negative thing would be the sulfur smell but as long as you&#x27;re thoroughly cleaning your skin daily it&#x27;s not noticeable</li>
            <li> I have used this product before so knew what to expect.  The delivery was prompt.  If anyone has rosacea also known as adult acne, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This seemed to work okay at first, but then I started noticing a weird rash wherever I applied it. I tried again several times hoping it would work, but each time i got raised, red, itchy, dry skin where I had applied the cream, and it took about a week to go away. I&#x27;m about to throw away the cream so it won&#x27;t happen again. :( Benzoyl peroxide creams have worked better for my skin.</li>
            <li> After years of going to the dermatologist and getting prescription topical creams, I&#x27;m glad I found this product.  It is very effective!  I noticed a big difference in 1 week and after 3 weeks my skin was pretty clear.  I was only putting it on at night because of the strange smell and they way it looks like make up (not a good look for a guy).  I think if I would have used it twice a day, my skin might have cleared up sooner.  However, I can see it has the ability to dry out your skin if used too much. I also use Cetophil Daily Facial Cleanser twice a day, in the morning to wash off the Acnomel (and its smell)-this version of Cetophil has a light pleasant scent to it.  I also use the Cetophil Gentle Skin Cleanser throughout the day which has a moisturizer in it and helps to combat any dryness from the Acnomel.  Overall, with this product, I don&#x27;t anticipate going back to the dermatologist any time soon.  I highly recommend it and agree with the other 5 star reviewers...IT Works Great!!</li>
            <li> I have used Adult Acnomel for 10 years as needed.  Although I never had acne as a kid I did later on in my adult life. I have used this product to spot treat during occasional breakouts and it&#x27;s done an amazing job. As soon as a blemish appears I dab a very small amount over the area and most of the time it is gone my morning. When this hasn&#x27;t occurred, I merely keep applying for a few days until the blemish disappears.  It does not dry out my skin as badly as most other topical creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> Helps clear skin without over drying. Great product for adult skin!</li>
            <li> This product is very good on pimples. But doesnt really work on blemishes..this cream is like a coverup makeup but isn&#x27;t makeup.. Is jux to wear around the house!</li>
            <li> I seemed to have developed cystic acne at this point in life. While my acne does not disappear it is more under control with this product and I do not scar or feel the need to pick at my face because the pimples go away much faster. When I run out I will purchase more.</li>
            <li> This product worked GREAT at first - then I started getting rashes everywhere I put it.  I stopped rashes went away.  The other night I had layers of other stuff on and I thought I would just dab a tiny bit on a few places... I mean it was barely on there and the next morning - a rash started and hasn&#x27;t stopped spreading in the EXACT locations I put it- and this crap is hard to clear up.  So now I know for CERTAIN it causes the rashes.  Has anyone had this issue and how do you clear up the rashes without a string of antibiotics from the derm!!!</li>
            <li> I had a major breakout on the left side of my face. It cleared up within three days.  I did, however, left the cream on overnight. There was some peeling but it was so worth it! I use it for prevention of breakouts every other night now.</li>
            <li> works as well as anything else i&#x27;ve tried, prescription or otherwise.  not over-drying.  slightly tinted but not like makeup or anything</li>
            <li> I bought this product when I saw all the good ratings, but it was a mistake. It did not clear up my pimple, let alone make it smaller or less red. It costed $10 and so not worth it. If I can give it 0 star, I would! I seriously regret buying it!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for the adult break out.  This product lives up to it&#x27;s claims.  For occasional adult acne this product is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I think it helps with the acne, it&#x27;s the tinting that I cannot tolerate! I&#x27;m a fairly white dude and the tinting looks like I&#x27;m wearing makeup. It doesn&#x27;t match my skin color, I should give it to my darker complected cousin and see how she likes it. After it dries a little, you can rub some of the makeup part off, but it still doesn&#x27;t work out for me. I used it at night when I was home for the evening, but it messed up a pillow case, so I started wrapping the pillow in an old towel. It&#x27;s just not worth it to me, so until they have an untinted version, no thank you.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product by chance and have now suggested it to my grown sons.  It works wonders and removes the painful acne that we are plagued with.  I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;ve tried all the other benzo products and are left in agony and embarrassment with adult acne.</li>
            <li> Great product works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that help dry the weeping. Wish it would go back on store shelves. I like this product.</li>
            <li> Works great as an acne spot treatment.</li>
            <li> thought it worked but ended up drying out the area and making it more irritated. eventually it caused rashes and swelling from minor spot treatment. mind you, i have very tough skin, this was just terrible. I initially assumed it was something i ate but then it was too apparent that the redness was on the spots i was treating. stay away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been useing this product for 20 years since when I was teenage. During the period I tried to use other products but there&#x27;s no any Acne medications in the world like Acnomel Medication Cream. This is the best and I highly recommand it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a very long time and I love it.  The company gave excellent service.</li>
            <li> The product was okay, it did have a drying effect.  At times a little too drying.  Nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li> Great at shrinking pimples, but my face is covered on burns every time I have used it.  Placing a small amount on the pimple does not prevent burning.  It is no use to have clear skin if I have burns all over my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is quite amazing!  I have been using it at night as a spot-treatment and it seems to help a lot.</li>
            <li> I swear this product works. My skin have always been clear until 2 months ago when I started breakout regularly.I had closed comedones forming along my jaw line and I literally tried everything from proactive to BP but nothing worked. I heard about aconomel through work. I decided to try it and I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 days now and I see a drastic improvement. Not only does the redness goes away but the area where the closed comedones were is basically gone. I have very sensitive skin but this product doesn&#x27;t dry me out because I also use the proactive green tea moisturizer on top of the acnomel. I highly reccommend those of you that have closed comedone acne to give this product a try. It might not work for you sine everyone&#x27;s skin is different but who knows, it&#x27;s cheap and it might cure your acne like it did mine.</li>
            <li> Got this for my twenty something year old son and he loves it (although he likely wouldn&#x27;t admit it out loud).  Not only does it work to fight acne, the tinted cream works (like male makeup) to cover acne.  Great product +  Great service &#x3D;  5 stars</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me from my Esthetician. It has a little bit of a shade to the cream and a stronger smell that you get used to. I use it at night after washing my face since it tends to dry my face out a bit under my makeup. It really has helped cleared up my cystic acne on my chin though.</li>
            <li> Have used for years, just more difficult to find.   Thanks goodness I can find on this site, order was done correctly, and shipped  and arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> Works fast - tendency to be drying but definitely great as a spot treatment - had to go to my dermatologist to be put on an oral medication but it does dry most cystic acne within a day or two</li>
            <li> Was very pleased. It arrived sooner than I thought it would. Have used them before and will use them again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me.&lt;br /&gt;It kind of dried my skin and definitely did not cure any of my acne.  :-(</li>
            <li> This may be TMI so read with caution!&lt;br /&gt;As a 30 something female, I have never experienced acne or pimples like I do now. As a teen, I got occasional whitehead pimples that a warm washcloth or oxypads would fix. Once I hit 30, I get this painful nodules under my skin around my jawline and my cheeks. They emerged near my menstrual cycle. Nothing seemed to help these painful lumps. They never came to a head and they took MONTHS to heal on their own.&lt;br /&gt;My old regimen: use a willowbark formula face wash 2x a day, toner, thin layer of BP and moisturize in the A.M. Those stubborn, painful, red lumps would still be there.&lt;br /&gt;I switched to Salicylic Acid instead of the BP which helped with smaller white/blackheads, but still nothing budged these nodules under my skin. I would lay a very warm washcloth on my face to try to draw whatever out and end up picking hole in a my skin trying to pop these suckers. That didn&#x27;t turn out well.&lt;br /&gt;I tried OCM for 4 months, with tea tree oil which helped with other pimples but not the nodule things.&lt;br /&gt;I gave up.&lt;br /&gt;Then as I searched Amazon, I found a sulphur based cream (I was reading that sulphur might help but I didn&#x27;t want to spend tons of money on the Salma Hayek line, without knowing if it would work.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Acnomel (tinted) and used it consecutively for 4 days, twice a day. After the first day, the redness subsided and the nodules decreased in size slightly. By the second day, more redness was gone, as well as the size of the nodule. By the 4 day, I noticed that some of the smaller nodules were almost gone. I continue to use it twice a day after washing with the willowbark face wash and notice the difference in the nodules. I felt one trying to come up on my chin, put a layer of Acnomel on it and by the next day the tenderness of where one of these beasts tried to emerge was gone. The day after, the bump never formed. I also have changed my diet by eliminating sugar, increasing water, and walking at least twice a day.  I think the combination of diet/Acnomel is working for me.&lt;br /&gt;The product is tinted and it dries to a very matte finish and is noticeable on my medium complexion. At night I put a thin layer all over, where in the morning I only dot a small amount on any nodules or tenderspots. After it dries I lightly moisterze and put on my make up (usually only a light foundation). It may or may not layer well under your makeup, it just depends. It is noticeable so you cant just wear it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to work for me but I still have to &amp;#34;extract&amp;#34; some smaller blackheads here and there but it helps in healing those spots as well.&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t had luck with BP and SA is not working anymore, try a sulphur based product like Acnomel and also consider diet and exercise.wice a day.

            <li> I discovered this product several years ago and it&#x27;s a must have for sufferers of adult acne. The smell is a bit unpleasant due to the sulfer, so I often apply it before bed. If you have persistent adult acne, especially the cystic type.. try this product!It&#x27;s non-prescription and really works. It&#x27;s also tinted, so you can use it as a coverup under foundation.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s tinted, didn&#x27;t know that before I purchased. Shipping was extremely fast, wow! I live in Japan and it took only a few days! Awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It gently dries up my acne as it covers up blemishes with a lightly tinted cover-up cream! Awesome combat for even severe acne!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE rash! Took over seven days to clear up and left dark spots</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different acne creams even Pro Active, nothing really ever works. I saw great reviews on this on amazon and figured why not try it. So glad I did, It works great. If I start to get a zip I apply and literally overnight I looks so much better. It does not make my skin dry and red like other products. The only thing is it is tinted so I do not apply to much in morning because It just looks like I have to much make up on. Its a great cream and I will definitely be buying again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Finally my acne is clearing up..and my face has stopped breaking out!! A little drying, but no redness or irritation!</li>
            <li> I saw this product and having adult breakout, wanted to try it.  Within 2 days my acne started clearing&lt;br /&gt;Up and was gone in a week and has helped also with Rosea.</li>
            <li> This cream is great, I love that it&#x27;s tinted to act as a concealer as well. After about three weeks, I do not have bulging cystic acne on my cheeks or chin anymore.... I do get one or two tiny zits but I notice my skin overall heals and gets rid of blemishes faster than before. I&#x27;m sure there will be more improvements as I continue to use it. I would reccomend :)</li>
            <li> It works. What more could be said about a product like this? Sure, it&#x27;ll burn your skin a bit, but this stuff is sulfur paste after all. Just avoid spreading it on too large of an area. I made that mistake and it left me with some big red patches of skin that were super itchy, but they got better pretty fast and I learned my lesson. Overall I&#x27;m quite happy with it, as it managed to clear up some nasty problem areas that just kept coming back.</li>
            <li> In a nutshell, it&#x27;s simply amazing. I&#x27;m a 48 year young man and I suffered from the occasional pimple, zit, volcano or whatever you want to call it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then all the sudden, I started having multiple zit attacks on my forehead, in the middle, like angry red third eyes. Being bald, it made matters worse. This was going on for months and was becoming quite embarrassing and VERY annoying. I had to find a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I read the reviews here and purchased Acnomel. I was of course skeptical at first, but not for long. This has stopped the acne, zits, volcanoes, pimples, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was working so well, I decided to stop using it for a few days and bang, a new volcano started growing. Applied Acnomel and the volcano subsided, it went away, wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several times now a new zit tried to pop up in an area I wasn&#x27;t treating, apply a dab of this 2-3 times a day and it never matured. You know how you can feel a zit growing and it hurts? You just know it&#x27;s going to get big and you can&#x27;t wait for it to be gone. This stopped those in their &amp;#34;tracks&amp;#34;, they thankfully never matured. Wow again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically I now apply a VERY small amount of this to my forehead in the morning, or wherever I suspect an incoming pimple, and again in the evening and I have NO pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what the H is in this, but it works.</li>
            <li> I used the product for a couple weeks and I wasn&#x27;t very impressed. It has a high concentration of alcohol which dries out the skin too much and I could only use this cream at night because the tint doesn&#x27;t match my brown skintone. It is hard to wash off and burns your eyes.</li>
            <li> So far it only dried out my skin, and it smells awful.. I have to be careful with wearing it to bed bc it gets all over my pillow and then my hair.. then I smell like this stuff all day. I havent seen any different at all, i feel like im just putting mud on my skin, its only dries it out!? ugh!</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with acne and even in my 40s, I still get blemishes. I have been purchasing Adult Acnomel for years but when I moved out west from the East Coast, I couldn&#x27;t find this product in the stores. I searched all over for it; checking with pharmacists at major chain stores as some nonprescription products are sold from behind the pharmacy counter, but had no luck finding it. I checked Amazon and voila! There is was. It is, by far, the best acne product I have ever used. It not only dries out the blemishes quickly but acts as a concealer at the same time. A little bit goes a long way so one tube easily lasts for six months. I usually replace it only when it starts to dry out because it surpassed the expiration date on the tube. Forget the name brand products you&#x27;ve probably used since you, too, were a teen and try out Adult Acnomel: you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past when my acne morphed into the horrible, painful and impossible to cover cystic kind. It&#x27;s been especially effective on my cheeks, jawline and temples. I also have rosacea. I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist most of my life, and have had the most wonderful results with this little cost-effective cream. I also use rx tretinoin microsphere .1%, but apply this when new cysts show up anyway. It takes the swelling down overnight, and within a couple days the spot that would have been a huge mass is basically gone. I love the matte consistency and tint. Although it doesn&#x27;t match skin well enough to go out with it on, it sure makes me feel better to have on around the house, as opposed to horrible bright blood red splotchy cysts. A dab at night over affected areas works wonders. It also helps calm the redness/inflammation from the rosacea, even during the day when I don&#x27;t have this on. I am allergic to benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid has never worked for me. I&#x27;ve been on differin, a sulphur wash, doxycyclin, benzaclin, etc from my derm over the years and nothing has helped as much as this for spots, paired with the tretinoin microsphere for all over. It&#x27;s impossible to find this in stores, so very happy to happen upon it on amazon. for the price, give it a try. If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ve probably tried everything else out there already anyway. Can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Shortens the life or a blemish, but isn&#x27;t a cure-all.</li>
            <li> I have white heads and black heads and this stuff seems to have helped reduce but not completely eliminate these. I really dislike the tint so I mainly use it at night.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of getting another product that may not work. I have dealt with acne since I was 12, I am 34 now. They were bad before I had my son 5 years ago but still I deal with breakouts from stress, etc. Then I stumbled upon acnomel on amazon. It was affordable and I decided to get it. I have started seeing results almost immediately. It took me a couple of days to get used to the smell of it, I overcame that by putting a dab of Vick&#x27;s Vapor Rub under my nose, the sulfur in it really made me nauseated. I have started noticing the different in my skin overall. I have a lot of redness underneath the skin surface that is from acne I had years ago and this cream really is starting to fade that redness out. My skin overall is smoother and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since I have started using it. I use it as soon as I get home from work, I use a deep cleanser then toner over it (cleans the makeup that may have been there after the actual cleanser) then I apply a very thin layer of Acnomel. A couple of minutes later I apply some moisturizer because I did notice my skin overdrying on one side. I follow up washing my face at bedtime and do it again. In the morning the skin feels much better and it looks great. I am now leaving the house with moisturizer and a dab of foundation, It really feels great to do so since it&#x27;s been almost 20 years I couldn&#x27;t leave my house without heavy foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I am not paid by anyone for this, I just have done it all- Accutane, Tazorac, Retin A, Proactiv, antibiotics, peels, etc. Nothing worked. I am using Acnomel in addition to taking Zinc for acne, also bought on amazon. It works for me.</li>
            <li> Very good product; at age 82, I most be having hormonal changes (yes, at my age) because I have been getting breakouts; I used this during the 1950&#x27;s..it worked, so I bought it for this problem now.</li>
            <li> Great product. I remember my dad using this when I was little. It is a great help when dealing with stubborn ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like the results of this product. I have cystic acne and after just one use, the redness on my face reduced significantly! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is tinted and the tint is too light for my skin. After I put it on I have ghost face! I have been putting on BB Cream a couple minutes after I apply the Acnomel, but don&#x27;t want to put make up on every day, so I am hoping I can find the product in an un-tinted version because, other than the ghost face, I really like the results I&#x27;m seeing. I am tan/olive completed and I think the products tint is for much more fair skinned people.</li>
            <li> Used for years. Mild peel and antibiotic effective .  Costly but worth it.  Hard to find in stores.  good color hiding.</li>
            <li> A little drying but if I use it every couple of days it does work well on small blemishes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was tinted, I actually love the fact that it is. Looks like you have cover up on! Someone complained about the smell on another blog but I don&#x27;t think it stinks at all. I just hope in time it helps my breakouts! The only downfall is it is a tiny tube so I will be buying another soon!</li>
            <li> What a nightmare. I used to love this product (because it actually worked) but now, it gives my face rash-like dark marks wherever it&#x27;s applied. I don&#x27;t understand. I thought initially it was a bad batch but after repurchasing it months later, my face reacted even worse. I think this product is 50/50. It may work fantastically, as it initially did with me, or it may be a nightmarish experience. I suggest applying it to a small, tiny patch somewhere other than your face before trying it. It does indeed still get rid of the bumps but now, it leaves dark marks. USE WITH CAUTION.  ORIGINAL 2013 REVIEW: Initial reactions: &amp;#34;This is MAGIC.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Wait, is this thing really working that fast?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;How did it diffuse this blackhead that looked as if it was about to be a scar?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Do I really just have great skin after all... or is this product working actually working?&amp;#34;  Nope, it&#x27;s Acnomel. I had a battlefield of blackheads on my forehead that I messed with which resulted in DOZENS of red bumps all over my forehead. I immediately started FREAKIN&#x27; OUT and thought I would spend months embarrassed at the new scars about to form on my forehead. I frantically searched for help and ordered this cream. I swear on everything I own, love, and cherish that my face started clearing up within 24hrs. Less than that actually. The point is that this cream goes to work immediately. I will never use another product. This is best acne product I&#x27;ve used. EVER.  Appearance As for the tint, chances are it won&#x27;t match your skin tone. I don&#x27;t like it at all and I made the mistake of applying it during the day when I first got it. It also can look chalky on your skin. But who cares - it&#x27;s an issue of vanity, honestly. My solution? Apply it on night, (see your miracle in the morning) and wash it off before you head out. There&#x27;s nothing more to it. The product is superb enough to where I don&#x27;t care that there is a tint. It works that well.  Quantity This tube will last forever.You don&#x27;t need a lot of the cream at once and unless every inch of your face is covered in acne, you&#x27;ll only be applying it to certain areas. For that reason, I can see this lasting at least a year.  Suggestion: You may also try Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay, it compliments this product well esp. for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This was the first sulfur containing acne treatment I used, the other is Acnevir-- both worked great. Except both left all of my sheets smelling like sulfur, this one was the worst though, probably because of the high concentration of sulfur. I actually had to throw out my comforter, my pillow, the the sheets I used, because after washing multiple times the odor was still awful and embarrassing. You could smell it if you were near my bed. It&#x27;s unfortunate because this stuff worked great for me, but I won&#x27;t use it anymore, or any sulfur based medications... anything you wash with the offending fabric will also smell like it too... so gross.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with adult acne for a while now and nothing really seems to help me much. I have tried proactive among other things with only temporary clear ups of my acne. I tend to get mine mostly along my jawline. Acnomel hasn&#x27;t completed gotten rid of all my acne, but it has definitely helped reduce it. I just ordered my second tube and will stick with it a little longer to see if it continues to work.</li>
            <li> Seems to really do the trick.  The tint is light enough that you can&#x27;t even see it&#x27;s there.  Seems to be much better than your average acne med.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this in my time of desperation, and true to the reviews, it works like no other.  Even when prescriptions and multiple trips to the dermatologist failed to provide results, this acne cream worked wonders.  It is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t done a thing. But it&#x27;s only been a few days, we&#x27;ll see.... Not looking good tho. :/</li>
            <li> I have used this for years until  I was unable to get it until recently.  It is great for oily skin, covers occasional flareups and heals.  Minus one star because it could be smoother for application.</li>
            <li> So far so good. It does dry skin out a lot thought!!</li>
            <li> Made me break out more but was shipped fast</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with a face wash and, together, they keep my face fairly clear.  I have some blemishes, but nothing too severe, and this helps keep it at bay.  I would recommend!</li>
            <li> It dries out zits a bit but so do a million other things which are cheaper and don&#x27;t stain pillow sheets. Other than that less than unique service, it does nothing to get rid of the zit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for close to 10 years now and i love it! I&#x27;m so happy that it can be purchased on Amazon! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Acnomel does help dry up existing pimples faster. It doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent new breakouts, and it is pretty chalky, so I mostly use it at night.</li>
            <li> Only thing I have found that works for me!</li>
            <li> This did barely anything for my acne.  I had tried the usual suspects (salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, glycolic acid, tea tree oil, antibiotic gels, clay masks) and was hoping this would work better, but it didn&#x27;t.  I guess it was better to use this as concealer than makeup to get some clearing action, but I eventually threw it out.  Didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference in my breakouts.</li>
            <li> i have had adult acne my whole adult life and this is the only thing has works for me. and it has a tint so you can only wear it. my skin has healed from a bad break out in 2 days&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> In my 50&#x27;s, but still will have an occasional pimple. This works great. Plus it works as a coverup. Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on recommendations I found online at various other sites.  After trying it for more than 6 months straight (nightly) I have not noticed any sort of improvement in my skin and am really unimpressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be warned: it has a very strong sulfur smell to it, so if that will bother you then I would definitely avoid purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I have a complicated skin condition that includes adult acne and rosacea, and this is the best topical product for my condition (and I have tried them all).  This works by clearing off the scaly skin that comes from the condition, and leaves healthy skin, and the sulfur is antibacterial, so it really clears up the infections that come with acne.  I recommend this as the best product for adults to use if you have acne, cysts, and other chronic skin conditions like that. This medication is tinted (so it&#x27;s supposed to match your skin tone), I really think they should offer a few different tints that worked with different skin tones (this is a little orange, so if you have a skin tone that is very fair, it may look funky). That being said, this tint seems to be pretty close to matching for my natural skin color. I started using it and noticed a difference within a few days, my acne was starting to clear up, and the rosacea was lessened as well (perhaps because the acne wasn&#x27;t exacerbating it), and within a few weeks, the acne was under control.  It doesn&#x27;t stop the breakouts, but it sure clears them up quickly when they happen.  The rosacea redness isn&#x27;t as pronounced either.  I use a very small amount, spreading a thin layer on my skin after I shower, when your skin is warm - it helps your skin absorb better.  A gentle cleanser is best, I would use something all natural that doesn&#x27;t have exfoliating particles in it, they can irritate your condition more.  It goes on easily, and spreads easily, so it only takes a few seconds to apply.  If you wear foundation, I would wait a few minutes before putting on makeup to make sure it&#x27;s absorbed first.  I have found, with rosacea, that it&#x27;s best to stay out of the sun when using this, my skin is more sensitive, but that may be a factor of my particular problem rather than the medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This keeps my skin condition under control, so I&#x27;m very happy, but of course, I would prefer to not have the condition at all - at least not the acne.  I checked out other options to clear up my acne and started taking [[ASIN:B004LJ0ZK6 ClearZine (2 Bottles) - The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill. Eliminates Blotchiness, Redness, Blackheads and Zits,Each bottle contains 60 capsules]] after seeing a few different acne websites rate it as the #1 oral acne treatment product. This clearzine supplement actually prevents breakouts and after about a month and a half of taking it I have not had a single breakout, and even more impressive my rosacea has not flared up either. Keep in mind there are plenty of good acne treatment products out there that I&#x27;m sure would probably go well with Acnomel, but Clearzine just happens to be the only one I&#x27;ve ever found that completely eliminates breakouts for me. The Acnomel works great to get rid of acne fast when it appears so even if/when I do have a break out, Acnomel manages it and clears it up very thoroughly and very quickly. Using these two products together has helped the rosacea, because I do not have acne causing me flare ups, and the redness is much less and continues to improve every week. I am very excited and have hope now that I may have close to normal skin in the near future :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 30 years and in my opinion is the most effective for clearing up pimples.  The tint of the cream also works as a great cover-up.</li>
            <li> I have been using Acnomel Adult Acne Medication for the past 50 years on the occasions when I have a slight skin breakout.  It was first recommended to me by a local pharmacist when I was in my teens.  I find this product to be better than any other OTC medications that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Took care of my white heads during pregnancy. Great product.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me because I have severe acne. I think it works better for mild cases of acne</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with clogged pores (sebum) mostly on my cheeks for over 25 years. I finally got a handle on it with some salicylic acid products, but I still had some areas that just did not clear up. I came across Acnomel and gave it a try since it had different ingredients. I was surprised by the dark tint, but it turns out it&#x27;s just the right shade for me, but i can see if you are fair skinned it would not work as well. I apply it at night only and it does not dry out my skin. After only a few days almost all of my problem areas have cleared up. AMAZING!</li>
            <li> We have always used this. We could not it locally.  Mary</li>
            <li> To be honest, my acne is not even that bad. I was on accutane as a teen and have recently noticed that it has been making a come back, though pretty mild right now.. I ordered this product because the great reviews it had. I expected it to clear my mild acne like nothing. Well it didn&#x27;t. I am very disappointed in this product. I could not see it clearing up cystic acne at all. It really sucks. The only thing it might be good for is a camouflaging agent.</li>
            <li> So, I am 38 years old and have struggled with acne ever since I was a teenager.  I have generally been able to keep my extremely oily and acne-prone skin relatively clear (I am used to having several blemishes at any given time, but as long as I can actually count them, it is what it is.)  However, recently, I&#x27;m not sure if my hormones went wild or what, but my skin broke out more terribly than I&#x27;ve ever experienced before.  My forehead was nothing but a painful mass of bumps.  The sides of my face were breaking out horribly as well.  I had gone several years wearing very little makeup, and just doing some mild tanning to keep the acne under control and regular creams and washes.  But lately I&#x27;ve had to cake that awful foundation on just to hide my disgusting breakout.  I keep trying new and different remedies and nothing was even touching this evidently hormonal breakout.  So I finally came across this cream on Amazon.  Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all what attracted me was the fact the active ingredients are different than anything you can buy at the regular store.  It really doesn&#x27;t do any good to keep trying the same benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid preparations just by different brands.  Second the great reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it first, I applied it like a regular cream, ignoring the instruction to &amp;#34;spread thinly&amp;#34; and also that it could cause drying.  NOTHING causes drying for this oily face, so I ignored it.  WOW um yeah, it causes drying.  haha.  That first night, my face felt like drying cement and it started to itch.  However, the next day, my acne, while severe, showed signs of drying up.  Hm.  Okay, good start.  Long way to go.  After that, I just used a THIN layer and ONLY over the actual broken out areas, before bed.  I also use a good quality, oil-free facial moisturizer as well (it&#x27;s been forever since I&#x27;ve had to use that!).  I only use the Acnomel at night, because it does have a slight sulfur odor.  It&#x27;s not super strong, but then you also get used to it while maybe others would not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it&#x27;s been about two weeks now, and I have been using only the slightest thin layer before bed over problem areas (while using other cleansers and more gentle creams at other various times) and this has absolutely gotten my severe breakout under control.  My face is back to sort of a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; state (still have some acne) but the mass breakout has finally almost healed up.  I&#x27;m still going to use it wherever I have the blemishes in order to gain even more control if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW the tint really isn&#x27;t a big deal...I just use it before bed.  All it really does is sort of lessen the red, inflamed look around acne...I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really made to cover anything up because if you use enough to cover up a blemish, it&#x27;s going to suck your face dry like a sponge.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s intended to replace foundation...just slightly reduce the pinkish tinge of an inflamed face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway...great purchase....the tube should last me pretty much forever so it is also a good value.  I would have paid twice the price, knowing what I know now about the product.  Just be careful to use this extremely sparingly and only at night until you get familiar with how it reacts on your skin.  After that, you&#x27;re good to go.  Thank you Acnomel!!!!also get used to it while maybe others would not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it&#x27;s been about two weeks now, and I have been using only the slightest thin layer before bed over problem areas (while using other cleansers and more gentle creams at other various times) and this has absolutely gotten my severe breakout under control.

            <li> I like this medication. IT works and also since its a pink cream. It acts almost like makeup and can help hide redness and blemishes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference for my acne. I believe my acne is more hormonal related. But it does keep it at bay during low weeks. Smells a bit funky, but for the price you really can&#x27;t complain. Less chemicals that the typical acne creams and washes you find in stores. Def something new to try if your skin has stopped responding to the same old stuff that every other brand has.</li>
            <li> is really  help! Nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to drying. I am 45 year old  female and really have never had an acne problem. When people see me with my 3 sons 25, 24, and 14. They think that i am their sister. At any rate being perimenopausal-i usually get a few pimples a week o so before my cycle. it clears them up quickly.</li>
            <li> Overly drying. Turns skin scale</li>
            <li> it works for three application after that burned  my skin</li>
            <li> great stuff.  a little expensive, though.</li>
            <li> I use this product a bit differently than the average user in that I use it as an acne preventative.  Before discovering this product by chance six months ago, my skin was in terrible shape.  My face is very sensitive to most chemicals, to the point that I can&#x27;t wear most commercial makeup.  Acne medications seemed to make my skin worse as opposed to better.  Benzoyl peroxide caused my face to peel constantly and salicylic acid seemed to make my face ruddy.  I thought I was doomed to have acne forever because I have PCOS which, among other things, can cause oily skin and cystic acne.  Everything turned around after I began using Adult Acnomel.  This product features resorcinol (a medication used in the treatment of cystic acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, and rosacea) and sulfur (a natural antibacterial) as opposed to the harsher aforementioned agents.  Within a month my breakouts had diminished significantly.  Six months later, I can confidently say that my skin lacks active infections 95% of the time.  When I do have a breakout, it consists of one or two small pustules that go away overnight.  I coat my face with a thin layer of this product immediately after washing and moisturizing.  It is important to apply the cream while the face is still a bit damp or dewy, so that it will soak into the skin.  Although the cream is tinted, I find that it blends into my very pale skin easily if I work quickly and I don&#x27;t use too much product (a dab the size of two peas is perfect); darker skin tones, however, may have some issues as the cream is tinted a very generic \\&quot;Caucasian orange\\&quot; color.  A single tube lasts me about a month and a half.  However, I would not recommend using this product with makeup as it can cause foundation to dry out and cake up.  A compromise I&#x27;ve found is to use Bare Escentuals or other mineral foundation, as it sits on top of the Acnomel as opposed to attempting to settle into the skin.  In any case, if you&#x27;ve tried every other product on the market without avail, there&#x27;s no harm in giving this one a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, October 2012:&lt;br /&gt;Having used this religiously for a year and a half, I&#x27;d like to add a few extra notes about Acnomel.&lt;br /&gt;- It helps reduce ruddiness.  Yes, the product is tinted, but I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is clearer when washing.  Given that the medication is also appropriate for rosacea, this isn&#x27;t shocking.  However, it is a very nice side effect!&lt;br /&gt;- It will make skin more sensitive to certain ingredients if one is prone to it.  I&#x27;m now allergic to the bismuth in Bare Escentuals products, which were recommended in the review above.  However, it does seem to calm the skin after using other products, like tea tree oil and salicylic acid.  In other words, your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;- It won&#x27;t treat blackheads or whiteheads.  It does a great job of knocking out cysts, but the hot and nasty summer gave me a nice set of whiteheads.  I&#x27;m zapping them with [[ASIN:B002LMD4XK Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque, 8 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]--a product that contains many of the same active ingredients as Acnomel--and [[ASIN:B0009RFAOK Clean &amp; Clear Deep Cleaning Astringent, Oil Fighting 8 fl oz]], a product with 2% salicylic acid.  [[ASIN:B0030HTXTY Acnevir Acne &amp; Redness Relief Gel-0.75, oz.]], a clear gel that contains a lower dose of sulfur than Acnomel, but has the same level of resorcinol as well as 2% salicylic acid, is another option if you are not allergic to aloe vera.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne, and I noticed that any acne medication that I used with salicylic acid would make it worse. I tried a mask that has sulfur in it, and noticed that it helped clear up my skin a lot. I don&#x27;t have time to have a mask on my face every night, though. I am so thankful I found this stuff! Since using this cream, my face has cleared up so much that people have actually made comments about how good I look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this worked for someone, but only helped me moderately. It seemed to dry my skin up too much.</li>
            <li> Super effective at reducing the size of cystic pimples. Does dry the skin out but not terribly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me and I gave it many weeks.  It was the summer though so maybe in the winter I&#x27;ll try it again.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time and has worked well. I have conitued to buy since my first purchase. Glad I tried and comes fast.</li>
            <li> Works really well for adult acne. Use sparingly and after a moisturizer, as it will dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  Would highly recommend it to anyone.  Great product.  Works after only one or two applications.  I&#x27;m very glad my doctor recommended it.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful , i use it, the next day the acne bump was eaten alive buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;it really dries the acne bumps up fast, no smell.&lt;br /&gt;try it, you will no longer be insearch for another acne, i have tried a lot of acne products, and they did not work at all, amazon has great products that a lot of people really do not know. try it , you will be amazed.</li>
            <li> Helps clear up blemishes without over drying my oily yet sensitive skin. I only use it as needed. Seems to work better as an all over treatment and not as a spot treatment although I still use it both ways.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this, I wasn&#x27;t a fan. It has a strong sulfur smell and it looks very chalky and tan-colored on the skin. Plus, it was a bit pricey. Recently though, I&#x27;ve been having bad acne again so I thought I&#x27;d give it another go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pleasantly surprised me. I&#x27;m not always a big fan of benzoyl peroxide (too drying) or salicylic acid (not as effective), so this sulfur formula is a good alternative. You only need a very small amount. Yes, it does smell pretty funky, but the smell fades after a while. I also don&#x27;t love the texture or the tinted color, and I would never wear this during the day when I&#x27;m out and about. But so far, so good! It seems to really be working and clearing up my skin.</li>
            <li> It does reduce the redness but really did nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li> I am twenty one years old and have just recently (as in it started this past summer) been suffering from some pretty bad acne. This product is amazing. It&#x27;s a thick skin colored cream that works great under makeup and doesn&#x27;t over dry. It took about two weeks for me to see a significant difference in my skin but with daily use it fixed my problem and is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Has always worked great for my adult skin troubles; product performs as it claims on packaging.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much and it STINKs</li>
            <li> it totally seems to be clearing up my problem zones on my face, but it&#x27;s really drying. Really need to exfoliate and moisturize!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39, and out of nowhere started getting breakouts.  I cannot use Benzoyl Peroxide because I am allergic to it.  I saw the reviews for this (and that it doesn&#x27;t contain Benzoyl Peroxide), and thought for the price, I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have been using it for about five days now and it&#x27;s great!  I love the tint it has, so I have been able to use it during the day than just nights.  I recommend having a good moisturizer handy after the product is wiped off.  It can dry the skin more than usual (I have not peeled at all, just tightening of the skin.  I highly recommend this product!  Years later, my daughter is now going through that time where pimples are life&#x27;s cruelest curse and everyone on Earth sees them on her from a mile away.  I stopped using the Acnomel cream since my break outs stopped, but she started using it.  Compared to any other pimple cream, this one works for her.  She puts it on before bed (after washing her face, of course) and washes it off before school.  When we ran out, she felt like the world had come to an end, so I will be reordering it.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product imaginable; proactive, acne free, clearasil, neutrogena, etc. Even prescription medications haven&#x27;t worked that well for me. After using acnomel for ONE week my skin is noticeably clearer and I have the pictures to prove it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the directions say it&#x27;s a \\&quot;spot treatment\\&quot; I use it on my whole face otherwise there&#x27;s a noticeable difference in the skin tone. For me that isn&#x27;t a huge issue though, it&#x27;s worth it for clear skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a gritty feel to it when you first put it on, but once it dries you don&#x27;t feel it. Again, still worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I&#x27;ve had bad acne on and off for 20+ years and this stuff really works. It is very drying but it clears up new acne in a day and has helped prevent more. Love it!</li>
            <li> This his surprisingly worked for me. I&#x27;ve tried couple different acne solutions - astringents, lemon, ointments, facewash. This had the best result for me. I cleanse with vinegar and wash and then apply this and that has given me the best results ever.</li>
            <li> The cream works good but the new tinted shade is not good looking. Not blending well into skin&#x27;s shade like the old tinted shade.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced quick results using this cream.</li>
            <li> Adult Acnomel has come in handy quite a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I&#x27;m a 25 your old white male with a history of acne and still today have some blemishes in certain places, though not nearly as bad as it use to be (thank GOD).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream looks a lot like my natural skin tone, and though it&#x27;s not seamless it does reduce the appearance of any pimples on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a ton of alcohol in this product which could be a good or a bad thing. They say alcohol isn&#x27;t good for the skin but I found it to be kind of soothing a weird way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve moved on to different products but still keep a bottle of this handy just in case something does come up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are struggling with adult acne, this is one of the few things that I still endorse and that works for me so give it a shot.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best acne treatment I have ever used. My face is almost completely clear. I am in my 20s and I have had persistent acne since about the age of 12. This is the first time in years my face has looked this clear. I use this cream at night, and in the morning after I wash off the cream my face gets a little peel-y. But I simply follow up with some lotion before applying my makeup, and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> Not sure how much better this works than the Clearasil version, but it&#x27;s a good size tube for a cheap price. I put cerave then 10% benzoyl and then suphur on top. My skin is bad if I don&#x27;t use strong stuff and this combo has worked best for reducing redness and shrinking zits.</li>
            <li> One of the FEW acne creams that actually work. Good for face, upper arms etc.&lt;br /&gt;I wish this product was available in stores,..but it seems like only Amazon sells it.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it never gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> Even though I have extremely sensitive skin and develop reactions to topical products easily, I never had an issue with this product and the soft skin-colored tint helped any spots I had fade as it treated them.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this product! After 6 months of increasingly out of control adult acne (and/or rosacea), I gave up on prescription meds and the products on store shelves.  I found sulfur and sulfur/zinc soap, and this product, here at Amazon, and through combined use for about a month, my skin is SO much improved. Although a few new break-outs still happen, I can apply this product and stop them in just a day. One advantage of this product is that it can be left on the skin all day and/or night so it continues working. (10% sulfur salve has also helped but has to be rinsed off after 5-10 min.) I did not think I would like the tint, but it has not been a problem. Everyone&#x27;s skin is unique, however this product has really worked for me and I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! I tried all the products in the stores ,this is the best. I will get somemore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 and have problems with cystic acne and I also have other imperfections with my skin from previous outbreaks.  I use this product as a primer during the day and love the results--it gives a nice flat finish.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup but instead, I use Clearasil Tinted Acne Treatment Cream over it similar to a foundation.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle but does work much better than the products made for teenagers.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. I am not a big fan and this product. It doesn&#x27;t work for me. I put product on at night and not even a little shrinkage of the acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of over the counter sulfur-based acne medication and this is the best one I&#x27;ve found. Definitely worth the great low price and then some!</li>
            <li> I usually dab acne creams over the pimple, I&#x27;ve used this technique for BP creams and so I tried it like normal, not too long had passed before I had a horrible allergic reaction wherever I had applied it, similar to hives or poison ivy I had horrible, peeling itchy red dry skin wherever I had applied it, I tried it again on my forehead and temple later to make sure and got the exact same result. I must have an allergy to something, this was awful. :(</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used on my sensitive skin...&amp; it was recommended by my doctor!</li>
            <li> Great product, have been using it for 25 years.  Tinted, helps skin rashes, acne, but, also found it has an effect on MRSA , the&lt;br /&gt;rescurinol in it really helps.  Can&#x27;t live without it.  Goes a long way, invisable, inexpensive, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  I wear it by itself and under makeup.  Its tinted, so it offers a tiny amount of coverage or a great base for makeup.  I have pretty oily skin, and this stuff keeps it matte.  You might get a little over drying at first, but I usually do a moisturizer first, then put this over and it works amazing.</li>
            <li> Used to work for me but this time around it is not work for me. It is very drying. But ok</li>
            <li> I was having a first time ever bout with adult acne and between this and investing in a clarisonic, my skin has cleared up completely and now only experience an occasional pimple.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent over the counter treatment.</li>
            <li> I love this product even if it&#x27;s tinted but it usually prevents my pimples from getting full blown and painful acne. It really works. I have tried so many creams and facial cleansers with benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, etc but they dont stop the small redness from getting big and painful. Saves me a lot of embarrassment and bandaids to my face when I come to work. And I believe this tube will last a long time and I am gonna buy again before I am down to my last pea size.</li>
            <li> Im 31 years old i never had acne as a kid , I&#x27;ve  spend  so much money  on acne products  over the years , you name it ,  I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;This product  is  brilliant I&#x27;ve seen  results  after few days  ,  people are saying  my skin looks  good .. I love the complements . I definitely  recommend  it if you&#x27;ve  been  suffering  from adult acne for a long time .</li>
            <li> Sad to say this product didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> this product is great for newly emerging cystic pimples. If you catch them early when they are just small red bumps it can get rid of them within a day or 2. I recommend only using a thin layer and making sure to gently rub it into the pimple, don&#x27;t just dab some on then leave it because it&#x27;s going to smear and your skin is only going to absorb a small amount of it. I&#x27;m not so sure how helpful it is to pre existing cystic acne pimples but at least it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Good product. Performed as stated. Used it on my 12 years old son. Forehead acnes subsided within a week. Happy with the purchase. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t work. It just heart my face.</li>
            <li> It dried out my skin and didn&#x27;t heal anything. But it hid it well like a concealer. That&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to review acne products because everyone&#x27;s skin responds differently, but for me, Adult Acnomel works well.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, although there was a span of about 8 years when I was seeing a dermatologist and receiving prescription level medication.  A recent healthcare plan change has me back to the over-the-counter products, and so it&#x27;s back to my old-standbys.  The ingredients in this product work to reduce redness and swelling.  They also address a specific type of acne that I get on my forehead--very small harder bumps.  For the larger, cystic lesions that I get elsewhere on my face, I must turn to a 10% benzyl peroxide product.  But this works well overall when used in conjunction with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware, it contains sulfer, and so it can be a little smelly.  Also, the tinting is very tan, and so it may not work for all skin colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 years old and lately have started having an issue with acne and I didn&#x27;t have this issue when I was younger. I have tried and tried Proactive and all that seems to do is irritate and dry out my face. This last month I have even slept with their mask on my face to dry out the acne spots and that didn&#x27;t work either. After 1 month of these spots not clearing up I needed something better. I started using this cream on a Thursday night and by that following Monday ALL of the spots were about 90% gone! As I said I&#x27;ve been using other things for an entire month that didn&#x27;t clear this up. I have also been taking zinc for acne for a couple of weeks. I&#x27;m thrilled to have my face cleared up!!</li>
            <li> I have had acne for most of my life.  I have periods of breakouts but of last they have been more frequent and concentrated around the area of my mouth and chin.  I tried several treatments including Proactiv but none seemed to work.  I honestly have to say that I have seen an improvement since I started using this product and most importantly my face is not as oily as it used to be.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I&#x27;ve never written a review for this before considering I have used this for roughly 20 years. I have some rosacea and the occasional blemish and some rough patches. It is not drying (to me) like benzoyl peroxide. My biggest problem is not my face, but my arms and back. I believe I have what is called Keratosis Pelaris. I&#x27;ve had it most of my life. Dermatologists told me to try exfoliants, salicylic acid, etc....etc....blah blah blah. Nothing worked. The only prescription that comes close is Aczone cream (which is close to $100 for the same size as this Acnomel!) loofahs, scrubs, etc... Just make this condition worse.  BUT, I slather this all over my upper arms, shoulders and face too, go to sleep, and the little bumps are GREATLY minimized by morning. I do this for two nights in a row probably once a week and I&#x27;m good for the next 5 days. What else can I say except if it weren&#x27;t for this product I&#x27;d be wearing long sleeves all summer. Amazing.</li>
            <li> I like acnomel and have used it for years. After I wash my face my skin and acne is all red and bad looking. I put acnomel over it and since its tinted it conceals the redness. It does look a little chalky, but it doesn&#x27;t break me out (I don&#x27;t know if it helps my acne) but I have VERY finicky skin and if it can conceal without making me breakout of clog my pores I am happy :)</li>
            <li> So far I feel like its doing the job, but its only day 3.&lt;br /&gt;Concerning the smell, by howtthe reviews sound, I was expecting a huge waft of total stench to permeate the air...but no. The only time I could smell the sulfur, is when I put the product on my hands, then up to my nose. These other commenters must have the smell sense of a dog to be so put off by it. I love that this product is skin colored, helps hide the acne just as good as my makeup! Looking forward to any more results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dealing with adult acne. Nothing seems to really work. This stuff got rid of my acne but where ever I put this cream I get a hive like rash. So it&#x27;s not worth it. lol</li>
            <li> Worked well without burning or drying my sensitive skin. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Acnomel for 55 years.  A thin coat nightly over any blemishes is a sure cure for surface skin issues.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my acne in about one week. I have tried almost every OTC acne treatment product out there, and this is one is the only one that works. I have even tried sulfur soaps, but for some reason they didn&#x27;t have any comparable effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is not very tinting if a thin layer is applied and spread evenly over the affected area, then feathered into surrounding skin. The smell is not bad at all and is barely noticeable. Aconmel really helps drying out current acnes real fast. My acne dried after about 2 days of usage. After two weeks now, the blemishes, small heads and red dots leftovers are now almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> The first time i used this product, the very next morning i woke up with burns on my face. I had to put coco butter on my face for a couple weeks to get rid of the burns on my face. Not only that it smells really bad..wouldnt recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is and always has been the best and quickest working for pimples. It drys them right up and also conceals them when working to eliminate them.. That&#x27;s why I ordered it and paid what I paid, because it is the best and hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product until I started breaking out in hives. I&#x27;ve never been allergic to sulfur, but I just don&#x27;t know what else it could be. It&#x27;s not the best to wear under makeup because it cakes and it looks too dry (plus you need SPF) but it does the job to cover your pimples in front of your significant other. Although, it does have that rather unpleasant smell of sulfur. A LITTLE GOES A VERY LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> I suffer from some pretty heinous adult acne. I have combonation skin that has been hard to treat. After reading the reviews here, and in desperation to find a product that works (I have tried everything short of chemical peels) I purchased this item. It seemed to work for about a week, maybe two but then my acne flared up again and seems to linger for at least a week or two before even one pimple clears up. This just doesn&#x27;t work if you have stubborn hormonal acne. It simply dries your skin. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Wow, amazing, much better than hi end acne treatments. Topical treatment, will cure cystic acne with a hour. Love the product!</li>
            <li> So far, this is the best product I have found for my acne. I tend to have mild whiteheads and/or papules (I have not seen a dermatologist to diagnose them), and relatively oily skin. When I would apply Benzoyl peroxide treatments, the zit would actually grow larger over night. Salycilic acid treatments do little or nothing, but this actually seems to reduce the size of my pimples when I apply liberally.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the color. I have very fair skin, so this shows up very conspicuously, and I have to wear makeup over it to blend it in during the day. When it dries, it tends to look like dirt on my skin if not properly hidden. I wish they had a clear version, or more shades to make it easier to use during the day.</li>
            <li> Effective.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Hard to find been using this since I was 16 and Im 38 now. Helps conceal a pimple without a ton of makeup and heal at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long period of time. My doctor from New York&lt;br /&gt;recommended this Acnomel for me when I was young for blemishes here and there.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am 72 yrs. old and still need it for one or two blemishes and it still works&lt;br /&gt;like magic...  I recommend this product to anyone that needs it, especially teenagers.&lt;br /&gt;Its ugly having blemishes on your face, glad I have Adult Acnomel.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julia&lt;br /&gt;cookie04@bellsouth.net</li>
            <li> I have used this for years &amp; now I can only find it here. Wonderful for adult acne. Does have a sulfur smell, but that&#x27;s what cures the acne.</li>
            <li> i liked the product and  delivery service was good</li>
            <li> Works very well for problems with pimples etc would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best on the market for acne.  Can&#x27;t be worn out by all skin tones but good when used at night or while in the house to get rid of break outs and even cystic acne.  It can be a little irritating and drying at times and you definitely need to follow up with a good exfoliant after it starts to break the acne down.  Try it in one spot first to see how your skin will react and be sure to moisturize.  I don&#x27;t moisturize while I&#x27;m using it but I exfoliate, then moisturize after I wash it off.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a product that works for adult acne.  I am a 31 y/o female that has intermittent problems with acne, not severe, just occasional breakouts.  This product works great and doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the other reviewers say.  Also, the tint is nice.  I am fair-skinned and it blends in almost perfectly.  It does dry out the skin though.  I use it every other day only at night and this seems to be ok.  I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Awful don&#x27;t buy , Oder is awful</li>
            <li> Wow this works even better than salicylic acid and benzyl peroxide. I dab a thin layer on a pimple and you can start seeing calm down in minutes. Put it on over night and the pimple is like 50% healed. This cream is tinted but don&#x27;t count on it as a concealer. It&#x27;s not very pigmented and if you put too much on it can look chalky, so pat it on thoroughly so that it blends into the skin correctly. It&#x27;s you rub it the cream starts to pill so pat it on.  This doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin at all, I&#x27;ll be buying more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> Very awful product, I have a oily skin prone to acne especially in the chin area, after using this product I suffered drying  itchiness and redness.Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> so it matches skin tone better...the smell....only i can detect if from time to time and i don&#x27;t care that it smells that way...seems to help with coverage and at least its not just make up not doing anything&lt;br /&gt;It needs to be mixed with a creamy/oily bb cream before applying to face (if using all over) since it doesn&#x27;t spread well.  It dries almost upon contact..so u need to move fast here. Or use as spot treatment.  Either way works well.</li>
            <li> Didnt really work for me</li>
            <li> I use this product every night to help with acne rosacea breakouts and to make my skin less oily the next day.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This grey stuff sucks!  It used to be a more natural color that suited skin tone.  Come on, Acnomel, get your act together!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Have used for years and now kids are using it.</li>
            <li> As an adult, I love love love this product. I have recommended it many times and anyone I have told about it, loved it too !&lt;br /&gt;Works very well and works overnight.</li>
            <li> Not at all an easy product to find - the rare zit is gone in a day-and-a-half with this magic stuff.</li>
