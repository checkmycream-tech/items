            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this marking my clothing, but I&#x27;ve also gotten good at putting on deodorant/clothing to avoid that problem.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Good to smell nice.  </li>
            <li>My guys love it!</li>
            <li>and it is effective.</li>
            <li>not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice.</li>
            <li>Perfect and fast shipping to Italy</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, for me, it was the best choice for me as I don&#x27;t sweat as much nor have no odor.</li>
            <li>Both my wife and I love the scent and are very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>This is my fiance&#x27;s favorite deodorant, and I sometimes use it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love Gillette&#x27;s products, but I won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product for the price.</li>
            <li>What you can ask for more?</li>
            <li>This is a top notch prodduct.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite anti-antiperspirant/deodorant combination, and the price, quantity and ease of ordering from Amazon</li>
            <li>They smell awesome and do a great job keeping me clean and fresh all day long</li>
            <li>Pretty sure all of Gillette clear gel deordorants work real great.</li>
            <li>The gel EASILY glides over the area and is applied evenly.</li>
            <li>With the Gillette gel, I could probably go 2-3 days without using it and be fine</li>
            <li>Great Product, highly recommended seller, many thanks</li>
            <li>Was cheap when i got it</li>
            <li>Works great, wish they sold in larger quantities.</li>
            <li>and it has never disappointed.  </li>
            <li>When I saw the many positive reviews on Amazon,  I decided to give it a try again.</li>
            <li>Last longest, smell good</li>
            <li>The scent has a sweet and almost fruit smell to it.</li>
            <li>I have finally found the deodorant that is perfect for me, and the price on amazon, especially through subscribe &amp; save, can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>Keeps me fresh.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like the feeling when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>I think most gel deodorants have this issue (not a big issue, just something to be aware of).</li>
            <li>So glad its not like the ones that leave obvious marks on shirts.</li>
            <li>I have just tossed so many in the trash, or those that don&#x27;t cause skin problems simply don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t burn and it lasts all day and sometimes part of the next day.</li>
            <li>and yes it is good as smell and it will last for long time.</li>
            <li>The Gillette gel offers a long lasting deodorant and anti-perspirant that smells great.</li>
            <li>My husband likes this deodorant and it is very affordable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You do have to be careful because if you squeeze it, you can push the gel up through the holes in the top.</li>
            <li>but this one is very acceptable...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>very bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to return this product</li>
            <li>Drys fast and works well.</li>
            <li>I do not sweat as much through my shirts when wearing this.</li>
            <li>This has never irritated my skin, and blocks sweat better than other anti-perspirants I&#x27;ve tried (Mitchum, RightGuard, Tom&#x27;s of Maine).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Very fresh/sporty, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overpowering, but if you are sensitive to smells, you might.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job at not causing hair to &amp;#34;cake.&amp;#34; It may be cold when you apply it at first as it has a cooling effect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed to see so many Positive reviews here, no one actually complained about this issue.</li>
            <li>and this is one of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts well throughout the day, no irritation (rash) or bad feeling under my arm that I sometimes get with others.&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice and not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and lasts long.  </li>
            <li>He also has somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin, and some deodorant gives me rashes under my arms, but this does</li>
            <li>: You have two in a single pack with a reasonable pricing.</li>
            <li>but I would go back to Old Spice.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and lasts all day long without burning or rashing up your armpits.</li>

            <li> if you need a heavy duty anti-perspirant, this is the product to use.</li>
            <li> mean I have one less reason to go to that unnamed department store chain that gave my credit card information to hackers (you know the one).</li>
            <li> the gel is what i need, for at least 2 decades now because of its virtual odourless quality quality quality</li>
            <li> Just cold and smooths out.</li>

            <li> Works. Sometimes the clear stuff pops out of the little holes. Goes on like, what I think jell-o would feel like. Just cold and smooths out. Works though. Keeps me fresh. Got a different brand though. I just don&#x27;t like the feeling when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever had...</li>
            <li> Have this on subscribe and save. Been ordering the 2 pack for almost a year now. This is my fiance&#x27;s favorite deodorant, and I sometimes use it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and some deodorant gives me rashes under my arms, but this does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice. Very fresh/sporty, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overpowering, but if you are sensitive to smells, you might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works like you&#x27;d expect and hope deodorant to.

            <li> My partner has used this deodorant for years now....I have to be careful of the perfumey smell but this one is very acceptable...he is a mason and perspires a lot when working so if it works....we keep it!</li>
            <li> The Gillette gel offers a long lasting deodorant and anti-perspirant that smells great. Both my wife and I love the scent and are very pleased with the results.</li>

            <li> Hubby says that this is the best deodorant out there for men...I believe him.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well.  It doesn&#x27;t keep me from sweating or smelling!  I don&#x27;t like the smell it has either.  It smells like apples to me!  Not that I have anything against apples, but it doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;sporty&amp;#34;.  I love Gillette&#x27;s products, but I won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> the gel is what i need, for at least 2 decades now because of its virtual odourless quality quality quality</li>
            <li> Great product, great protection, doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, great 2-pack pricing, I will re-order</li>
            <li> great product. So glad its not like the ones that leave obvious marks on shirts. will be buying again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the Gillette sports gels. They smell awesome and do a great job keeping me clean and fresh all day long</li>

            <li> Awesome deodorant! It goes on clear and lasts all day long without burning or rashing up your armpits.</li>
            <li> I used Brut for dozens of years until it just stopped working. Then I tried Gillette based on reviews I read on Amazon. It goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t burn and it lasts all day and sometimes part of the next day. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thank you! Everything is super!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t stink, Nuff said.</li>
            <li> Makes your axillary region greasy...</li>
            <li> Perfect and fast shipping to Italy</li>
            <li> Outstanding product for the price.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure all of Gillette clear gel deordorants work real great.</li>
            <li> great product. I like it</li>
            <li> Affordable &amp; works well.</li>
            <li> No more quick exhausting speed gels. This is the perfect fit size for a men of this age. Bonus: You have two in a single pack with a reasonable pricing. What you can ask for more?</li>
            <li> I have been using this over a year now and it has never disappointed.  Smells fresh and lasts long.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this product.</li>
            <li> I thought good brand will give good result and yes it is good as smell and it will last for long time. but this Item give you white mark on your cloths. If you are wearing dark clothes then your shirt will have white marks which look very bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to return this product don&#x27;t know I am eligible to return it or not.</li>
            <li> I bought this product initially at Target. It had problem with dispensing the gel while we turn the knob at the bottom. I returned and thought would be a one off case of defective product.  When I saw the many positive reviews on Amazon,  I decided to give it a try again. What an epic waste of time,  same issue again with the product. Not worth my time returning it. Just put it in trash. Decided not to buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed to see so many Positive reviews here, no one actually complained about this issue.</li>
            <li> I like the gel version and Gillette is great.</li>
            <li> This is a top notch prodduct. Drys fast and works well.</li>
            <li> The scent has a sweet and almost fruit smell to it. I wouldn&#x27;t call it girly but I guess it would be as borderline for a mens product as it can be. I like it though, it lasts a while.. I don&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite anti-antiperspirant/deodorant combination, and the price, quantity and ease of ordering from Amazon mean I have one less reason to go to that unnamed department store chain that gave my credit card information to hackers (you know the one).</li>
            <li> Good quality Thank you</li>
            <li> Great price for a good product....</li>
            <li> Good to smell nice.  Wish everyone on the subway would give it a try.... With summer coming I will  hand out a sample to those who offend</li>
            <li> strongest and longest lasting product that is currently on the market. leaves no stain on shirts. if you need a heavy duty anti-perspirant, this is the product to use.</li>
            <li> I almost feel as though I&#x27;m getting additional cleansing when applying this. The gel EASILY glides over the area and is applied evenly. It does a pretty good job at not causing hair to &amp;#34;cake.&amp;#34; It may be cold when you apply it at first as it has a cooling effect. As an active person all day, it seems to be one of the few antiperspirants/deodorants that actually cover all the bases. I do not sweat as much through my shirts when wearing this. I also have little to no odor during the day when this is applied (Did I mention that I am very active?). Nonetheless, for me, it was the best choice for me as I don&#x27;t sweat as much nor have no odor. It also does not stain your clothing either. A+</li>
            <li> scent isnt too good. Gillette makes good deodorant though just wont try this scent again</li>
