            <li>It still lights up beautifully, and you can see the water bubbling, but there is no mist coming out, no fragrance, nothing.</li>
            <li>When it did work, it worked beautifully though.</li>
            <li>My beautiful wife bought this for me.</li>

            <li>I also had to put electrical tape over the ON button because it glows too brightly when you&#x27;re trying to sleep.</li>
            <li>but I find them too bright.  </li>
            <li>cause is was too bright.</li>

            <li>Its really great and works well, I use it at work and have received many compliments on how great it smells and looks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no problems with it and the lights aren&#x27;t so bright that they disturb my sleep when I plug it up at night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bright to be used in the bedroom at night, which is what I had purchased it for.</li>
            <li>It was so bright I placed it in my bedroom floor at night.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;nightlight&#x27; feature is a bit too bright for me</li>
            <li>and they are good to go that night.</li>
            <li>good product</li>
            <li>It is a good looking unit, but why doesn&#x27;t it perform as well as cheaper ones?</li>
            <li>Good diffuser all around.</li>
            <li>Good diffuser.</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>Purchased this based on number of stars...thought it would be a good purchase</li>
            <li>Up to now, it still running good.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good at all.</li>
            <li>The room is filled with the wonderful aroma</li>
            <li>I loved this diffuser until it stopped diffusing after 3 months.</li>
            <li>My son loved it and always asked for it every evening.</li>
            <li>But otherwise, for the money, this is good.</li>
            <li>like it, defuser is working good at this time</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent if produces is good</li>
            <li>oil.&lt;br /&gt;This unit produces good scent using about 5-6 drops of oil in a 15x15 foot room.</li>
            <li>So good there is nothing to report because this is just one of those products you want no hassle with and it delivers.  </li>
            <li>It arrived as promised and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>I chose this product because of the price and the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Good design all around.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got good output..</li>
            <li>Good diffuser for the price</li>
            <li>The light show is soothing and the mist is wonderful.</li>
            <li>- maybe you get a good one, maybe you get a lemon.  </li>
            <li>GOOD BARGAIN</li>
            <li>and you should be good to</li>
            <li>I loved this unit, but when I ordered, I teetered between it, and the Smiley Daisy.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Wish it stayed on longer than 4 hours but puts out a good mist.  </li>
            <li>I have LOVED it . . .</li>
            <li>I still get a good 3 hours of aromatherapy,  however I wish it was longer for when I have it going at night.</li>
            <li>This seemed like the most simple, best size, best features, best price.</li>
            <li>I bought this diffuser for my wife&#x27;s birthday and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>I figured from good reviews and being name #1</li>
            <li>Works as advertised, looks nice and makes no noise, diffuses oils great.</li>
            <li>This thing is great for relaxing, meditation, purifying a room, aromatherapy of any kind.  </li>
            <li>for the price, it&#x27;s a good starter diffuser.</li>
            <li>All the more, the brilliant changing colors keep kids and adults attracted.</li>
            <li>They loved it too.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for $50, thinking I was getting a good deal given that the supposed list price is $100.</li>
            <li>So it does a good job all around - I have recommended to friends and recommend here.</li>
            <li>Like some others have stated, it was good while it lasted.  </li>
            <li>It is a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>or you want a bit of light, this will be perfect.</li>
            <li>Good value for my money.</li>
            <li>Good with just 3-5 drops of your preferred oil(s).</li>
            <li>I loved this diffuser while it lasted.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a week now and everyone that comes into the office comment about how good it smells in there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it did NOT smell good before.</li>
            <li>This diffuser creates a wonderful smelling, peaceful environment!!</li>
            <li>Dispels a perfect amount of &#x27;clean air, moist air and my oils.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, looks great, and diffuses well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use!!</li>
            <li>Looks cool and does the job perfectly!</li>
            <li>Even when it&#x27;s turned off it makes a nice conversation piece, the pyramid design is pleasantly eye-catching.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with it, and I feel I sleep better on the nights I sleep with it on.</li>

            <li>This one is awesome, happy so far.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed, mostly because you can&#x27;t turn the light all the way off</li>

            <li>Works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very nice, easy to use.</li>
            <li>this diffuser is amazing.</li>
            <li>This diffuser does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>Makes my house smell amazing, my daughter loves the changing colors.</li>
            <li>Great at what it does, wish there was an option to turn off the muti color light display for bedroom night use.  </li>
            <li>Also with the ability to turn the light off it is great for night time also.</li>
            <li>The price was amazing too.  </li>
            <li>and it fills my room with amazing sense</li>
            <li>The smell is great and the lightup color on the diffuser is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>More importantly, it does a great job diffusing the scent over a good area and runs for a nice amount of time.</li>
            <li>colors of the ZAQ Noor are great, as are the light setting options -- all colors, one color, and no color.</li>
            <li>Now Foods came out with their own model that is identical in price and function.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Prior to it stopping, I liked the machine.</li>
            <li>Nice mister.</li>
            <li>The colors are a nice touch.</li>
            <li>This diffuser works perfectly and really atomizes</li>
            <li>This is a nice diffuser.</li>
            <li>The colors are a nice touch on the unit as well.</li>
            <li>It works well and has a nice ambiance.  </li>
            <li>All my kids ended up loving it as well as me.</li>
            <li>Working great very happy after several months.</li>
            <li>The scent is stronger depending on how much oil you use, but the mist is wonderful.</li>
            <li>a nice serene feeling</li>
            <li>From the picture it looked kind of unattractive</li>
            <li>I really did my research on diffusers that were reliable and yet still would not break my pocketbook and can honestly say that I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It also puts out a nice mist.  </li>
            <li>but I have to perform my own repair.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I liked the automatic shut off after 4 hours&lt;br</li>
            <li>the fact that it&#x27;s shaped kind of like a space ship.</li>
            <li>Must be used on durable surface or with some kind of protective mat.</li>
            <li>I own two of them.</li>
            <li>It makes my whole house smell wonderful and lasts for about 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Do not expect it to do your whole house, just a room or two, but it does a great job!</li>
            <li>Would have been nice if it came with samples.</li>
            <li>They are nice, but I do get nervous over the flames burning in every room.</li>
            <li>My review is my honest opinion and experience with this item.</li>
            <li>Works for hours and shuts off on its own.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for the nightstand in a bedroom or office, fills the whole house.</li>
            <li>It has automatic shut off when the water runs out which is nice.</li>
            <li>Nice diffuser.  </li>
            <li>The changing colors is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>The color options are nice as well.</li>
            <li>works well and looks nice sitting out</li>
            <li>I have traveled with it so that is a nice selling point.</li>
            <li>Amazon says something about a warranty on the page for this product, but it did not come with any paperwork that indicated there was any kind of warranty.  </li>
            <li>There are 4 settings on this diffuser and I like that the on/off button is on the front of the unit as opposed to being on the bottom like another ZAQ diffuser I own.</li>
            <li>heck i even like the sounds of the bubbles it makes and the colors are nice to.</li>
            <li>We own 2, and I will pribably get another one.</li>
            <li>NICE.  </li>
            <li>NICE DESIGN.</li>
            <li>the color setting is nice.</li>
            <li>It is nice to put in your bedroom before you go to bed with calming scents like lavender.</li>
            <li>This one came recommended to me and from my research, it seemed like others liked it too.</li>
            <li>It just always smells nice.</li>
            <li>well the quality is nice,  </li>
            <li>Nice size.</li>
            <li>Guests have commented on how nice it smells</li>
            <li>Auto shut off is a nice safety feature.</li>
            <li>Kind of wish I would have ordered another ZAQ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colours change</li>
            <li>I think it diffuses well - I&#x27;m diffusing all types of oils in it and have had no problems in the two I own</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this diff-user at discount for an HONEST review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lights are nice.</li>
            <li>Still a nice diffuser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to turn off the lights if you want to.</li>
            <li>This diffuser is nice.</li>
            <li>Colors are a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I now own two of them.  </li>
            <li>Diffuses nicely for about 4 hours, then shuts off automatically when it runs out of water.</li>
            <li>I have one in each of my children&#x27;s rooms and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>This is a nice diffuser.</li>
            <li>I assume this is from some kind of leakage...</li>
            <li>The design is very nice and everything else was fine; but my purpose was to use this not to look at it.</li>
            <li>The Zaq Noor is a great price, very powerful, and works well as a diffuser.</li>
            <li>This always freshens it up and was especially handy on my recent trip to Washington state where I found its humidifier aspect very handy.</li>
            <li>The light settings are very nice</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use and makes everything smell wonderful.  </li>
            <li>rave about this thing and am SO happy that I now have a &#x27;clean&#x27; alternative to scenting my home without chemicals.</li>
            <li>So nice to curl up with a book (or Kindle!), relax and enjoy the oil scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re more concerned with the way it looks and modern design, this product may be perfect for you.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S VERY EASY TO USE</li>
            <li>It works well in my office, is very easy to use</li>
            <li>Compact and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and shuts off automatically.</li>
            <li>Very pretty works great</li>
            <li>I would love to give this more stars and one week ago I would have!</li>
            <li>I am completely in LOVE with this diffuser and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better choice!</li>
            <li>I am completely in LOVE with this diffuser and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better choice!</li>
            <li>The item arrived so quickly and was packaged very nicely.</li>
            <li>Great product exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>, I feel they should have mentioned in the instructions that many oils are hazardous to cats and dogs.</li>
            <li>I use it in my bedroom, and I love the kind of trickling waterfall noise that it makes.</li>
            <li>I have purchased a lot of diffusers and this one is by far the best that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>WOW, THIS IS THE BEST DIFFUSER</li>
            <li>So far, I have been using it for over a week and it works perfect.  </li>
            <li>So far this has been the best thing ever.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure we would like this, but ended up loving it.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s easier for you decide if this is the product is suitable for the job you need it to do or for what you&#x27;re wanting to give someone.</li>
            <li>The light on it to signify that it is on is fairly bright, I have to point it away from my face.</li>
            <li>I love making up my own EO blends to diffuse.</li>
            <li>Love using it to make my house smell nice.</li>
            <li>The power button light is a bit bright at night time</li>
            <li>It makes a nice night light for them, not to mention how helpful the diffused oils are!</li>
            <li>Light as bright as that disrupts sleep.</li>
            <li>Still a good product and kind of cool.</li>
            <li>The mist is very, very fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li>So easy!  </li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!  </li>
            <li>Love love love!  </li>
            <li>This diffuser has been going strong for over a year!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love, this diffuser!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this!  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it, was delivered fast, and works great, will have to order more for xmas..</li>
            <li>It makes the whole room smell good, though I wish it would extend throughout the house!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super easy to clean as well, I&#x27;ve found the best way to clean the oil residue out from the inside is by using a Magic Eraser.</li>
            <li>Adds a perfect amount of moisture into the air and delivers the essential oils effectively.</li>
            <li>The changing light colors is a joy for the kids to watch and serves as a night light as well.</li>
            <li>but it is more important to me that it is good quality</li>
            <li>runs great, easy to clean...</li>
            <li>Looks great, still working flawlessly after heavy usage.  </li>
            <li>Love the color changing option, and the light is not so bright.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to setup and love the versatility of colors and that it works with any oils (except citrus)</li>
            <li>and I think this one is better and much cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;Really, really happy and satisfied with this diffuser!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The diffuser cycles through bright LED light in a range of beautiful, vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>The diffuser worked great at first but the amount of mist it produces has dropped dramatically to almost nothing.</li>
            <li>This was great for the first month then started to turn off before all the water had been used.  </li>
            <li>I have tried 6 different diffusers and this is by far the best diffuser and best price!</li>
            <li>The packaging was very secure and the product came unscathed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Purchase this for myself for Christmas and so far am loving it!!  </li>
            <li>I have had visitors comment on how nice my house smells and when they see it, they comment on how cool it is!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone else who loves aromatherapy and surrounding yourself with the peace, benefits and good feelings of aromatherapy!</li>
            <li>The manufacturer says not to use it with strong oils, but I&#x27;ve used it with just about every kind of oil without any problems, including OnGuard from doTerra.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;The changing lights are nice and you can turn them off.</li>
            <li>Works well, nice lights, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Emits a nice fine mist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice fine vaporizer</li>
            <li>Great price, easy to transport, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Works great , just not meant for large rooms</li>
            <li>It makes the room smell great and the light show is so pretty!</li>
            <li>They work great and were a decent price!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love using this with peppermint oil.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I would find a better product/more reputable company.</li>
            <li>Love this, but you are not supposed to use citrus scents in it, so I grapefruit or lemon or orange</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>We love the product.</li>
            <li>but would be much better if it had a timer</li>
            <li>The different settings &amp; auto off its perfect for when you just need it before bed</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I love that it automatically shuts off.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it could run without a light.</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>My wife and I love the diffuser.</li>
            <li>I love doterra..</li>
            <li>Absolutely love thus diffuser.</li>
            <li>I love it though.</li>
            <li>I love the diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more of these soon, one for our bedroom and one for the kids room.</li>
            <li>I love the automatic cut off when it&#x27;s out of water.</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>Again, just make sure you&#x27;re cleaning it thoroughly after every use. :)</li>
            <li>and we LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Lovely flow, color changes, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love it for my bedside but the lights would not work when I&#x27;m trying to sleep.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>

            <li>Works wonderfully and is very simple to use.  </li>
            <li>Very quiet and does a great job!</li>
            <li>I find this diffuser works best in smaller rooms.</li>
            <li>I could afford a nebulizing diffuser, and this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>would be better product if top fastened, if tipped over water, oil spills out</li>
            <li>I love it, except for one thing.</li>
            <li>Diffusing is a wonderful way to use essential oils, we use them for immunity support, respitory issues, to help us sleep better...</li>
            <li>and I believe it is helping them breathe better</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>I scoured through many diffusers before making the decision to buy this one</li>
            <li>we love it and use it often.</li>
            <li>I have found it does produce more vapors as it reaches the end of the time period.  </li>
            <li>We love the design and the fact that it changes colors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>I want it more for the living room area.</li>
            <li>Appealing to look at.  </li>
            <li>Love this guy.</li>
            <li>Light never turns off!</li>
            <li>the one I use more often (in kids&#x27; room) is showing more wear and tear, for sure...  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the look.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise love it.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I use it every day, mostly during the night before bed to relax.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>So wonderful for essential oils</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>

            <li>I just make sure to rinse out the unit after using the cirtus</li>
            <li>the better you can smell it</li>
            <li>East to use with fantastic mist!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can choose it to \\&quot;freeze\\&quot; on a color that encourages the mood you are seeking.</li>
            <li>I have receivedm many compliments on not only how wonderful and inviting my home always smells now but also on the diffuser itself.</li>

            <li>This diffuser is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love the light changes!</li>

            <li>and I love to diffuse lavender.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Diffuser came in excellent shape, just wish there was a way to turn the light completely off.  </li>
            <li>but I would prefer if I could choose to not have the light running!</li>

            <li>Interesting volcano shape.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>The kids love watching the colors change as they go to bed.</li>
            <li>The trade off, pricing vs the inconvenience of refilling the ZAQ more often.</li>
            <li>emits a nice mist and my kids enjoy the color changing too.</li>
            <li>I love the ZAQ Noor Multi Color Litemist Diffuser does everything it says it does and everything I hoped it would.</li>
            <li>Love the changing lights.</li>
            <li>/&gt;we didn&#x27;t use the changing colors option, but it was cute</li>
            <li>I should have contacted Amazon and have them send a replacement but my curiosity got the better of me.</li>
            <li>I love the option to change the lighting also.</li>
            <li>This brand has survived many drops and tons of</li>
            <li>We want to make sure our customers receive the best value possible every time they make a purchase.</li>
            <li>You know, I wasn&#x27;t even sure I wanted any Diffuser at all--just seemed too....</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect size, very quiet and works well.</li>
            <li>I like the look of the diffuser too, somewhat stylish on top of the dresser.</li>
            <li>Please feel free to ask questions!</li>
            <li>If you are shopping for one, the similar-sized one from Doterra is better in this regard.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m  rarely going to give a perfectly polished review and very often I don’t spellcheck or my dyslexia takes over..</li>
            <li>I love the diffuser.</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>would give it 5 stars except for the fact that, even when the light feature is off, there still is a fair bit of light while it&#x27;s running.</li>
            <li>Any recommendations? :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an eye sore and is more of a piece of art.</li>
            <li>but after a week of using lavender oil and distiller water I have slept better</li>
            <li>This is just OK...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this diffuser.  </li>

            <li>I love this thing, use it almost every day.</li>
            <li>more fear of overheating or candle burning with the auto-shut off feature, so</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I&#x27;d love to like the product.  </li>
            <li>Love the automatic turn off system.</li>
            <li>My favorite is using it at night to diffuse oils for sleep.  </li>

            <li>My kids love the lights.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m not getting the benefits of the oils any more</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>I just wish it had a bit more capacity;  </li>
            <li>It is very quiet and does a great job!!</li>
            <li>I love some blends with citrus oils.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has numerous colors but the best part is the durability.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed it... while it lasted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Over all I would say that I am satisfied with the product, but that it does not meet all of the descriptions I read online.</li>
            <li>The kids love the colors at night, and it does its job.</li>
            <li>Great product that works very well with the oils</li>

            <li>My kids love that it changes colors.</li>
            <li>I will add my voice to the many reviews---</li>
            <li>My kids love that it changes colors.</li>
            <li>I love that you can pause it on a color or have no color at all.  </li>
            <li>I love the look and the simplicity of it.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I use it with my essential oils and my house smells great!</li>
            <li>This one has a much more aesthetic appeal.</li>
            <li>What it would&#x27;ve made it better: batteries</li>
            <li>Love.  </li>
            <li>and I think mine works better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning it to try something better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure not to exceed the water level or nothing will come out.  </li>
            <li>I love how it changes colors as well.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so pleased with this unit.  </li>
            <li>She mostly uses oils that are beneficial to allergy sufferers, as well as Lavender to help her</li>
            <li>EOs not included, of course :)</li>
            <li>we are glad we chose this one</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the most elegant or appealing to the eye diffuser but works well.</li>
            <li>I ordered two of these for my kids&#x27; rooms and they are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>however I am glad that I decided on this one.</li>
            <li>you work so well, i love you.</li>
            <li>My kids love to pick their favorite color to stop it on at night.</li>
            <li>Love these diffusers, have been using them for awhile.</li>
            <li>Much more inexpensive and work as well as pricey brands.</li>
            <li>Really impressed with the quality and style of this innovative essential oil aromatherapy device.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It lasts 4 hrs but it is no problem since you can keep adding more.</li>
            <li>If you happen to use citrus then just fill more water when it&#x27;s done with non citrus EO&#x27;s so that the citrus is diluted (just FYI).</li>
            <li>There are better options out there</li>

            <li>This is way better than the price implies.</li>
            <li>The changing LED lights are nice, but do note that a running light remains on when the LED is off.</li>

            <li>Good price, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>If it takes you more drops then you should probably purchase better quality oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this in my classroom for 2 months now and love it.</li>
            <li>So its ok</li>
            <li>Probably should have paid more attention to the description.</li>
            <li>The lights on it are ok...</li>

            <li>She loved it, it works right out of the box.</li>
            <li>It seems right now to be working good.</li>
            <li>Amazon provided awesome customer service in response to my issue, but I would like to warn potential buyers that this particular diffuser doesn&#x27;t seem to be of great quality.</li>
            <li>also like that its stylish and very clean looking.</li>
            <li>so very excited I ordered this aromatherapy Diff-user</li>
            <li>Works with every sort of oil (though they recommend avoiding citrus) and allows me to mix my own unique combinations.  </li>
            <li>I plugged this baby in and within one minute flat you could already smell the delicious scent of the lemon oil I put in there.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>It worked great the first day and now it doesn&#x27;t even light up or give any signs of life.</li>
            <li>Within minutes your home smells nice and clean</li>
            <li>Its a nice size - beautiful design and VERY quiet.</li>
            <li>I moved it to the living room with the sky high ceilings and still received great benefits.</li>
            <li>This diffuser is very easy to operate, works amazingly well, is very attractive and it is not as small as I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Very simple and easy to use and the multi color operation is very attractive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and the light changing effects make it pleasant to look at as well.</li>
            <li>The light feature has three settings: bright, bright alternating colors, and dim.</li>
            <li>The rotating colored lights are pretty, but are quite bright if you are trying to sleep.  </li>
            <li>The night mode is still pretty bright.</li>
            <li>The colors are so bright and pretty.</li>
            <li>stocked.the misting feature produces a nice amount of mist and the unit status cool to the touch.</li>
            <li>stocked.the misting feature produces a nice amount of mist and the unit status cool to the touch.</li>
            <li>it starts to mist and fill the room with wonderful scents that help me relax and unwind after a long day.</li>
            <li>At first I really loved this item...</li>
            <li>I loved this diffuser when I first got it.</li>
            <li>The plug-in cord is nice and long, and the color display is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>Love this fun, colorful and very effective vaporizer.</li>
            <li>Well worth the upgrade!!</li>
            <li>The diffuser started leaking after a month or two but the seller graciously replaced the unit for us and the new one is working great again.</li>
            <li>The light doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;turn-off&amp;#34; as much as it greatly diminishes it&#x27;s glow.</li>
            <li>I love the size of it, how easy it is to use, the amount of mist it makes, and even how it looks.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t tip it because the lid comes off easily</li>
            <li>While I love them both, this is SO easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to use, just remove top of cone to fill</li>
            <li>I get it ready before bed and then tuck everyone in, brush my teeth, and the room has a pleasant, relaxing scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>quiet and nice, great buy</li>
            <li>It will run for 4 hrs or longer, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and looks nice in any room.</li>

            <li>The diffuser is very easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully for a single room</li>
            <li>the changing light is very cool and calming (and of course, it is nice to have the option of turning the light off when sleeping).  </li>
            <li>The very dim light setting is great, but it&#x27;s still to bright once I&#x27;m trying to go to sleep, so I often turn the diffuser off right beforehand.</li>
            <li>it worked great, and although it didn&#x27;t spread the scent as much as I&#x27;d have liked, it did a good enough job.  </li>
            <li>Very cool how you can set it</li>
            <li>Diffuses the right amount for a very large great room.  </li>
            <li>This is a great diffuser, very cool looking and love to be able to have color changing or solid colors or none.</li>
            <li>it is still much too bright to be used in a bedroom at night.  </li>
            <li>I love that you can select light brightness and color as well.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser works incredibly well and is currently what we use in our bedroom at night.</li>
            <li>This unit can be used as a nightlight, which is good, but be aware that it does produce some light at every setting.</li>
            <li>Puts a nice calm in the air</li>
            <li>great product, easy to clean,  gentle mist</li>
            <li>I would love for the light to turn off completely but this diffuser does a great job.</li>
            <li>I love how it looks with the freaky changing light color and</li>
            <li>Working great so far.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love the light changing effect.  </li>
            <li>So far this has worked great for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>Sensitive to chemical smells so this is really great.</li>
            <li>These are great - love the color changing - actually the kids love it.  </li>
            <li>so the light changes or you can set it to one of your favorite colors.</li>
            <li>I love this product, even that we ordered another, it works great and love the different settings.</li>
            <li>i have been really happy with the diffuser so far.  </li>
            <li>so I feel more comfortable when needing to put it in the baby&#x27;s room at night.</li>
            <li>that when the top is lit, but still too much light to sleep for me.  </li>
            <li>The kids really love the changing color light to watch as they fall asleep.</li>
            <li>Love the look of the product and really enjoy the changing colors.</li>
            <li>I love the ability to change the light color (as this is in my children&#x27;s room); however even on the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it still works.</li>
            <li>the diffuser really makes my house smell good.</li>
            <li>I loved this diffuser the whole 13 days it lasted.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money-quiet and effective.</li>
            <li>I really loved this for a whole month.  </li>
            <li>The size is fairly compact so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decent product, the changing light feature is very nice</li>

            <li>This unit is easy to operate and to clean and the color changing top is very cool.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works great!</li>
            <li>My daughters think the changing colors are really cool!</li>
            <li>I have purchased other brands but ZAQ is my go to for the best diffusers, IMO!</li>
            <li>The first night with it went well, looking forward to more of them!</li>

            <li>Very quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I wish it could diffuse intermittently (why its 4 out of 5 stars), but priced competitively, easy for him to use and seems to be well made.</li>
            <li>Fills the room its in easily and the connected rooms after about an hour using about 5 drops of lavender oil per 100mL.</li>

            <li>Most recently I purchased one for my father to share the joy of diffusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need 7-8, also depends on how strong you want the scent to be.</li>
            <li>would agree that the scent is strong in the immediate area and spreads throughout a 300sf space (I even have vaulted ceilings).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Easy setup and one-button usage, cool features and appealing to the eye.</li>
            <li>In the yoga class, I really enjoyed how it filled the whole room with an amazing, relaxing scent</li>
            <li>Lavender is very relaxing and peppermint very refreshing.    </li>
            <li>Cool misted oils ejected from top.</li>
            <li>It is good to read about aromatherapy to better understand how essential oils can contribute to one&#x27;s health and well being ([...] ,[...]) to get the most out of this product.    </li>
            <li>overall very pleased and really love using this!</li>
            <li>This diffuser is BPA Free and is made of safe, health friendly materials.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful colors and such a heavenly mist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This diffuser is so quiet and the color changing lights are beautiful.</li>
            <li>and when I would take the top off diffuser was full of a cloud of mist which would then rush out.</li>
            <li>Also, I do leave that changing lights on (they are cool :)), but</li>
            <li>Even the packaging it came in was so cute and cool</li>
            <li>Easily and quickly diffuses my favorite EO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The light colors are nice, and just the right brightness for a night-time or evening light.  </li>
            <li>This adorable aromatherapy diffuser is a new favorite!</li>
            <li>, it works fine.  </li>
            <li>This diffuse works fine.  </li>
            <li>Everything was fine.</li>
            <li>The beautiful changing light is a visual bonus.</li>
            <li>After receiving this diffuser, we used it about a dozen times, and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the amount of mist, ease of use and the included measuring cup is convenient for knowing exactly how much water to put in.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I think it should work fine -</li>
            <li>This adorable little diffuser is amazing!!  </li>
            <li>I received this as a Christmas gift and it worked wonderfully the first day, but quit on the second day.</li>
            <li>The set up is quick, just plug it in, add water and your favorite oil, and turn the unit on.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to fill up, looks easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of parts to lose.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to refill, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but the dimmest light is still fine.</li>
            <li>use this in our large 2-story living room when I want the house to feel warm and inviting.  </li>
            <li>This is a perfect little diffuser.</li>
            <li>This little &amp;#34;volcano&amp;#34; as my kids call it is working wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This little diffuser is great!</li>
            <li>This little mister is awesome.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome little pod.</li>
            <li>Awesome little diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with this little unit.</li>
            <li>It is a little discolored after a year of use, but still works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Perfect little oil diffuser.  </li>
            <li>It has clean lines, pretty colors and an &amp;#34;UFO&amp;#34; kind of look.</li>
            <li>it probably would not be so great for a large living room, because it probably wouldn&#x27;t cover that much space.</li>
            <li>It looks nice and produces a nice fine mist of essential oils.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t a huge issue for me, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have kept it.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t turn off the light completely and it makes my room at night to bright for me.  </li>
            <li>You will be happy with this diffuser, the simple yet sleek design will fit in all decors.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t diffuse a huge space but it works well in a bedroom.</li>
            <li>Not only does it do a fantastic job of making your home smell great</li>
            <li>If you push the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;  button twice, a lower light comes on which is about like a nightlight.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to clean, I just wipe them out every morning</li>
            <li>Also, there is not an option to turn the light off as claimed.</li>
            <li>We use a variety of essential oils in it and it works great.</li>
            <li>You can turn off the ambient light or leave it on.  </li>
            <li>I very much enjoy that you can &#x27;pause&#x27; the colors to whatever you would like it to be.</li>
            <li>The unit just does not work at all, besides continuing to light up.</li>
            <li>I works great for a smaller space like a bedroom.</li>
            <li>This diffuser works great to distribute essential oils around our home.</li>
            <li>The light is always on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For some, this may not be a problem, but if light bothers you while you&#x27;re sleeping</li>
            <li>even tried covering it up with aluminum foil, and the light still shines through the hole where the vapors cone out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll end up looking for one that doesn&#x27;t emit any light.</li>
            <li>but I do wish I could turn the light off.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>I like the bubbling sound</li>
            <li>Fifty dollars is all with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap like some of the others.</li>
            <li>The dimmed light doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>The light change  </li>
            <li>Works great with our essential oils.</li>
            <li>Worked great for six months of use before suddenly dying.</li>
            <li>There is no way to run the diffuser without any light features but this dimmed</li>
            <li>I bought this product with information from Amazon saying you could turn off the light while it was running...</li>
            <li>The Q &amp; A area at the time I researched it on Amazon said that light could be turned off when running&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked hers so much I reseached them and bought this one.</li>
            <li>I like the light</li>
            <li>Great product; I just wish it had a bigger reservoir.</li>
            <li>I use the morphing color mode during the day but turn the light off for diffusing at bedtime (3 presses of the button).  </li>
            <li>and I also enjoy it for relaxing at night.</li>
            <li>As I primarily use this at night, the &amp;#34;no light&amp;#34; mode was a selling point.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Might not be good for light sleepers sensitive to light.</li>
            <li>Experienced aromatherapy users combine different oils to help relax, stimulate or set a tone in the environment.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy if you are hypersensitive to light and expect to use it when you sleep or if you are looking to diffuse citrus (orange/lemon) oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>three light setting controls (changing, any in the range, or off) are nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It works well at its primary function:</li>
            <li>I wish I could run it without the light.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much, I ordered another one.  </li>
            <li>Not one of the ZAQ diffusers has a light off function.</li>
            <li>Fantastic addition to an office  - relaxing and soothing through the hectic day.</li>
            <li>Even on the &amp;#34;lowest&amp;#34; light setting -</li>
            <li>It has three light</li>
            <li>These work great in combination with essential oils to prevent illnesses.</li>
            <li>It is extremely easy to clean and manage - like the apple version of atomizers.</li>
            <li>Works well and easy to clean</li>
            <li>I like the colors of light, and the idea I can choose the color.</li>
            <li>I filled this diffuser to the fill line, plugged it in and went about my business.</li>
            <li>I would prefer to not have a light in my diffuser.  </li>
            <li>and it has a auto shut off feature which I think is important because I like to run my diffuser while I am sleeping.  </li>
            <li>I think this diffuser would make a great gift for anyone that is a essential oil user.</li>
            <li>It worked great until it died suddenly only after 4 months.</li>
            <li>few drops of oil in the water, and the room smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit does a great job of distilling essential oil into the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and everyone comments on how attractive it is when it goes through its color changes.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Sold just as it is described, works great and is quiet.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy how the colors change -for the light.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it; it works great.</li>
            <li>but it would be nice if the water feature lifted out instead of having to bring the whole thing to the sink.</li>
            <li>The light settings are relaxing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean just wipe with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Using YL Abundance and makes the entire downstairs spell great.</li>
            <li>so doesn&#x27;t take a lot of space, is very quiet and works great.</li>
            <li>I have had a few diffusers and this is the best.</li>
            <li>And she loves the light setting options as well.</li>
            <li>so I decided to buy a cheap one.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like the fact that it still emits light even tho</li>
            <li>you turn off the light features.</li>
            <li>It works well with any oils and you can choose to just have the mister, or have one glowing light or have it change to a rainbow of colors.</li>
            <li>It serves as a night light while running.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>and you can press the power button again to hold it on a colour you like or press again to turn off the light while the diffuser continues to run.</li>
            <li>I use Eden&#x27;s Garden oils in here( fantastic company)</li>
            <li>Enjoy all the settings and the longevity (3hrs) of mist it pumps out.</li>
            <li>I like the light options.</li>
            <li>to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li>So calming, wish the light could be turned off when in use.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this diffuser.</li>
            <li>I like the option of the color changing light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to clean and operate.</li>
            <li>Within 20 minutes, my room smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>The days of lighting candles are over; welcome to the era of essential oils.</li>
            <li>I doubles as a night light</li>
            <li>Keeps my house smelling great with my essential oils.  </li>
            <li>This product was great for my room getting ZAQ Noor Air Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser</li>
            <li>I like the brand and will try another style that says the light can be turned off</li>
            <li>but light disturbs sleep quality.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is so stinkn&#x27; bright that the shadows it casts throughout my 22 month old son&#x27;s bedroom (about 12&#x27;x14&#x27;) frighten him.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I got it at a great sale price and only wish I bought two instead of one!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the light</li>
            <li>but you can have the light off yet still</li>
            <li>It seems like it burned out (when I turn it on, the light flashes and then goes out...</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and fill.  </li>
            <li>Light mist.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The kids (and I) also like the light feature on this.</li>
            <li>Press it yet again to turn the light off if you want to go to sleep.</li>
            <li>Has variable selection for light control and auto shut off.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is great in theory, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to stand up so well.</li>
            <li>One push of the button and it is in multi-color light mode</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and to clean, and it never mixes scents.  </li>
            <li>I was especially impressed by how much longer this ones runs on the same amount of water and oils.  </li>
            <li>and I have been using tap water to diffuse the oils in, so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Working good so far.</li>
            <li>So far, so good</li>
            <li>Just as good as the Young Living diffuser that costs you 100 bucks.</li>
            <li>I bought this with my birthday money and it is by far one of my favorite items I own.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had this for about a month and so far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good no problems yet.</li>
            <li>The top comes right off</li>
            <li>Love it, works right away &amp; spreads smells of oil throughout the house.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was happy and excited to find the same product on Amazon</li>
            <li>Luckily return was easy.</li>
            <li>This is the best little diffuser!</li>
            <li>The mister is very easy and fast to use.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves the light changing mode, although I don&#x27;t really see any other benefit to that besides entertaining your children :)  Works great and always shuts itself off when it supposed to.  </li>
            <li>This is such a good, easy to use unit.</li>
            <li>If I were going for medicinal purposes I might use something more powerful, but I&#x27;ve tried it in my downstairs and it quickly scents up a 300 sq ft area as well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t over feed it with your essential oil as this gives off a great amount of steam and quickly fills the rooms.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean and can really pump out some vapor.  </li>
            <li>Still worth the money!</li>
            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>The room is fairly small, and this diffuser seems to be the perfect size.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed NONE of the issues I had with the original.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>First diffuser and I am in love.</li>
            <li>I love mine so much that I&#x27;ve purchased multiples for gifts!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I set it up on top of my desk and used it the first time at night before going to sleep.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to receive this item.</li>
            <li>Just perfect size for a small room.</li>
            <li>I wish that I had originally purchased the Daisy.</li>
            <li>Simple to use and your water and essential oils give you a wonderful and healthy scent.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this product is the multi color changing top along with the dancing sound of water ever so softly while diffusing.</li>
            <li>Love it so much I plan to order one for my office!  </li>
            <li>Love it much!</li>
            <li>Love the different scents the wife uses, eucalyptus is our favorite!  </li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>:) thanks !</li>
            <li>It does allow the oils to become airborn, but it&#x27;s not an atomizing diffuser which will give a greater healthful effect, but at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>I loved the first one, which I was using in our bedroom, that I bought another one to use on our main floor.  </li>
            <li>great little machine love it</li>
            <li>I clean it out after every use with a paper towel or tissue and it has been running</li>
            <li>THAT YOU CLEAN IT AFTER EVERY USE TO ENSURE LONGEVITY OF THE DIFFUSER.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve mostly use citrus and so far have no issues, but I&#x27;ll be sure to clean out the bowl after using citrus.</li>
            <li>So far, we have only diffused Orange EO&#x27;s in it, but it leaves the house smelling great!  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s bright enough to be used as a night light.</li>
            <li>Clean look too.</li>
            <li>When the light is off there is still a bright blue glow from the diffuser.  </li>
            <li>It makes a whisper soft sound which I can sleep with and the auto off when water is out feature is nice.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know about the light that changes color - but love it - very soothing.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t clean it with anything, just use the leftover oils.</li>
            <li>and I have had to clean it yet!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love to put lavender essential oil in it and make my kitchen smell amazing and calming.</li>
            <li>Works ok but would recommend paying more and getting a Doterra or Young Living diffuser.</li>
            <li>The colors are pleasant and it is quiet.</li>
            <li>The price was fair and I love that this cold air diffuser fills the room with beautiful scents for hours after its been turned off.</li>
            <li>Its been running for 2 hours now, and loving it so far!</li>
            <li>and it filled up my classroom pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size, easy to fill with the supplied measuring cup and</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not something to use in a large room, but I love it for my bedroom.</li>
            <li>I put in on with lavender oil right when my kids are going to bed and it soothes them right to sleep every night. :)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not like a humidifier, it is just right!</li>
            <li>For a first time user of essential oils this diffuser has been great.</li>
            <li>First of all, I think this is a great product (4 stars), but I&#x27;m wondering why the price doubled in the last two months.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively quiet, but a bit bright at night.</li>
            <li>This has been a great value for the money spent.</li>
            <li>The glow, even when low, is bright.  </li>
            <li>It smells so good to me-and I am usually pretty sensitive to perfumes/colognes or air fresheners</li>
            <li>It still has an LED for the on/off button that is entirely too bright for use in a bedroom at night.</li>
            <li>I love this so much</li>
            <li>This is a cool air diffuser which protects the integrity of your oil.  </li>
            <li>- my boys thought it was cool.  </li>
            <li>I did receive mine free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experienceb and honest opinions of this ZAQ Noor Essential Oil Diffuser.no way to run the diffuser without any light features</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about aromatherapy  the last year</li>
            <li>Very relaxing and even cute on your nightstand.  </li>
            <li>Love these diffuses,,  wrapped really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went with this option, it works very well.</li>
            <li>Cool</li>
            <li>I laughed when I read the following on the ZAQ website:</li>
            <li>I really like this one better than the one I got from the company</li>
            <li>the diffuser looks nice, and work great, everybody at home feels the aroma, very quiet and the color changing  lights are an extra</li>
            <li>It is cool looking.</li>
            <li>I think I may get another one to avoid having to do this, because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>A full resevoir lasts around 3+ hours.  </li>
            <li>,the auto shut off is cool though cause sometimes I forget.</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser it works very well</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I do not have much to compare to, but I love my ZAQ Noor Litemist Diffuser.</li>
            <li>The one thing I really like about it is it shuts off after all the water is gone :)</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it so much I sent one to my mother for her birthday over the summer.</li>
            <li>Very quiet, puts out good amount of smell, cool changing lights.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t nearly as strong a diffusion as in our smaller bedroom, but it still is nice to freshen or enhance the living room air.  </li>
            <li>Choice of varying color or single color lighting or nightlight modes while running, but the night light is rather bright.</li>
            <li>Super cool..</li>
            <li>Easy to use, pretty to look at</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and it&#x27;s so pretty.  </li>
            <li>It works great at diffusing essential oils into a large family sized room.</li>
            <li>This is a great product- small, cute, colorful and</li>
            <li>This is a great unit, small and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it is a great diffuser.</li>
            <li>- many small ones have a light that is so bright.</li>
            <li>The Noor Litemist works great, we have a large open room/area and it starts working quickly.</li>
            <li>I wish it covered a little more square footage, but it runs great, is quiet &amp; very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The DoTerra diffuser is huge and frankly I really didnt want to have this HUGE thing in my room.</li>
            <li>House smells fresh and clean without chemicals.</li>
            <li>With my favorite oils it changes the entire mood of my house :)</li>
            <li>It is light weight, quiet, and looks nice to have on a shelf or a side table.</li>
            <li>Then dump out the vinegar and water and it&#x27;ll be all super.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and performs well.</li>
            <li>I did receive mine free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experienceb and honest opinions of this ZAQ Noor Essential Oil Diffuser.</li>
            <li>The contemporary design looks fabulous anywhere!</li>
            <li>(I&amp;#34;M really much more main stream.)  </li>
            <li>Awesome product and much better than the taller version of the Essential Oil Diffuser which I previously bought from ZAQ</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 40 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly &amp; as described.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll say no closer than two feet as the mist dissipates quickly...</li>
            <li>He loves the changes in color (his artistic side).</li>
            <li>Really like this product: compact, easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li>looks super</li>
            <li>This is also the better model of the 2 main types of ZAQ diffusers.  </li>
            <li>With just a few drops of fragrance, it does a great job of making you feel light and comforting.</li>
            <li>It runs very quietly and the light setting are a nice feature.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not messy and the kids love the light aspect of it - I like that the settings</li>
            <li>This is my fourth diffuser and finally found one that is perfect.</li>
            <li>When I have it in the kitchen-the scent of the oil is not so strong-but mildly noticeable.</li>
            <li>but I love the soft light emitted and the look of the vapor coming out of it.</li>
            <li>You might need more than one for a big room, but you can always add more drops if you want the aroma stronger.</li>
            <li>If the light was able to be turned off completely then it would be a 5 star item.</li>
            <li>It works super well and fills the house with oils.</li>
            <li>I do wish that the light off function really did turn the light off.</li>
            <li>So far... it is very easy to use</li>
            <li>The first few uses were very good, a lot of mist, scent was perfect the same as the essential oil itself.</li>
            <li>The first press of the power button turns it on, as well as the color changing LED light.</li>
            <li>The light is really pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this item after using it several months.</li>
            <li>There are 4 settings, mist with changing light color, mist with set light color, mist with dim light and off.</li>
            <li>Generally, I like it and it makes the room smell nice.</li>
            <li>things considered, I&#x27;m very pleased with the overall quality and function of the Zaq Noor Litemist Diffuser.</li>
            <li>The button options don&#x27;t work consistently, and it does emit light when your are sleeping.</li>
            <li>I love the attractive visual it creates while it operates &amp; also it works so well with how it gently mists out the natural fragrance</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite thing.</li>
            <li>The oil diffusing is new to my wife and I and we are both enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>However, we love EVERYTHING else about it, so we just buy a new one when it stops working.</li>
            <li>I bought this slightly over a year ago and it worked great.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t fully turn off the LED on/off switch light, which is bright in a dark room.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This diffuser does a great job of filling a room 24&#x27;X24&#x27; or less in size.</li>
            <li>It works well although the blue, non-light is still pretty bright and keeps me awake.</li>
            <li>Diffuser worked great for 2 and a half months.</li>
            <li>: Whisper Quiet, very attractive clean lines, the lights are very soothing and you can turn them off entirely, so portable</li>
            <li>We have used it on a daily basis and love it!</li>
            <li>We love how it is easy to use, simple to look at and has the option of being one color instead of changing.  </li>
            <li>, it is quiet and easy to add more water and EO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>this little diffuser works great</li>
            <li>This is a great little unit.</li>
            <li>Just a great little thing.</li>
            <li>Great little diffuser.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little thang.  </li>
            <li>but this little buddy does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great little item.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is a great little diffuser.</li>
            <li>Great little diffuser.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little diffuser.  </li>
            <li>It is tough to get five stars out of me, but I&#x27;m quite impressed with the Zaq.</li>
            <li>It works fine, but you CANNOT turn off the light completely like the posted information says.  </li>
            <li>But honestly super cute with the different colors you can choose from and does a wonderful job of filling my downstairs with different essential oils!</li>
            <li>I really like the option to turn the light function off but still diffuse.</li>
            <li>there was an option to run it without any light which is what I really wanted</li>
            <li>What I wound up with with is an aroma dribble that I had to be very close to enjoy.</li>
            <li>Use it everyday and appreciate the great workmanship.</li>
            <li>You can adjust it to run without the colored lights but the blue &amp;#34;power on&amp;#34; light still shines and you can hear it quietly and happily bubbling away as you drift off.  </li>
            <li>We use it everyday and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>It is very quite and the changing light colors are soothing.</li>
            <li>Quiet fan and the light on it is soft without being too bright.</li>
            <li>I use peppermint essential oil and my home smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>Product produces the desired results and gives a very calming effect with the light and aroma.  </li>
            <li>This works really well, and I enjoy the spa like atmosphere it causes in my room.  </li>
            <li>but recently I am missing a working diffuser greatly which reminded me to write a review.</li>
            <li>I use it with some essential oils for aromatherapy, and it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing to be in bed with the light.</li>
            <li>I like this product except I don&#x27;t really like the light being on.  </li>
            <li>meditating and calm to purifying the air.  </li>
            <li>This one is far better.  </li>
            <li>(just a very low humming, I&#x27;m a light sleeper and was able to fall asleep with this running).</li>
            <li>I love it and have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I ordered a second one.  </li>
            <li>I love that you can dim it for night use.</li>
            <li>I received one for Christmas and loved it so much I bought a second to use in my daughter&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked at several diffusers and this one is the best priced for the money spent.</li>
            <li>co worker has a different brand diffuser and it smells up her office so nicely...</li>
            <li>The changing colors could be fun for a child&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li>This is our second purchase of this kind.</li>
            <li>Aromatherapy is a fantastic practice when you have someone with health issues in your home or around flu season because of the immune support so many of the essential oils give off.</li>
            <li>I enjoy trying different blends and plan on buy more diffusers from Zaq.</li>
            <li>This is a natural and healthy way to fresh up the smell of your house.  </li>
            <li>Find something that&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>On smaller side but puts out nice mist.</li>
            <li>Note that even turning the light off, it emits a slightly blue glow on the top and on/off button.  </li>
            <li>Powerful aroma.</li>
            <li>overall thought is that yes, it does indeed function, but not as effectively as others.</li>
            <li>I love the multiple LED light settings.</li>
            <li>One water fill-up will last 3-4 hours then shuts off on its own.</li>
            <li>Only con is that you don&#x27;t have the option to choose your diffuse times but you could just shut it off on your own.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s been working great and you can dim it sufficiently enough that it doesn&#x27;t interrupt your sleep.</li>
            <li>The top point glows with soft LED lights.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant buying this because of the price, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Someone else wrote that this is the APPLE of diffusers, I agree COMPLETELY, I absolutely love this, and the different light settings.</li>
            <li>and I love it so far.</li>
            <li>only design improvement I can recommend is that even in the no-light mode, the top part of the diffuser is still illuminated, probably from the power switch light, and we have to be strategic where it is in the bedroom</li>
            <li>Effectively distributes over multiple rooms.  </li>
            <li>~ I used this for several months and then it just kind of collected dust</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very quiet and looks nice in the room.</li>
            <li>use citrus kind of essential oils.</li>
            <li>It also looks nice and have gotten compliments several times.  </li>
            <li>But, my impatience for delicious aromatherapy mist made me plug it in before it was thoroughly dried and it short-circuited as far as I knew.</li>
            <li>Got this product only yesterday and loving it.</li>
            <li>It seems to last about 4 or 5 hours and turns off on its own.</li>
            <li>Liked it enough to buy another.</li>
            <li>Just got it but love it so far.</li>
            <li>Very simple to use and haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with it so far.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully and is small enough that it&#x27;s easy to move around my house if need be.</li>
            <li>The directions were somewhat confusing for someone who has never used a diffuser before, and it would be nice if it came with something suggesting which oils to diffuse, but other than that it is perfect.  </li>
            <li>They run for about two hours and then turn themselves off, which is just right to diffuse the lavender oil and calm the room without overpowering it or making the room too moist.  </li>
            <li>I really like it can change different color light while operation, and most important it really perform its function!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned a diffuser, so I can&#x27;t compare to other items, but as it sits next to my bed, I&#x27;m very impressed.  </li>
            <li>Arrived at my door super fast!</li>
            <li>It does go through water pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I received my shipment quickly and my oil diffuser was packed very well too!  </li>
            <li>this is ok, only runs for about an hour or 2 at the most but is good for small area or office</li>
            <li>Simple and easy to use, easy to clean, all the necessary options, will be ordering more for office and friends.  </li>
            <li>and it fills the room with just the right amount of scent.  </li>
            <li>but I cannot even smell the oils when its diffusing unless i am standing right by it with my nose basically in the mist.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of the aroma hits the patients that come to office right away..</li>
            <li>...just need the right diffuser.</li>
            <li>I received the item right on time.</li>
            <li>the price right</li>
            <li>It puts out just the right amount of mist.</li>
            <li>Received it today and plugged it right in.  </li>
            <li>It puts out the right amount of vapor.</li>
            <li>As soon as you turn this on, you see the mist right away.  </li>
            <li>it never worked right</li>
            <li>My husband and I turn it one right before we go to bed</li>
            <li>That makes it easy to smell whatever new oil</li>
            <li>I love the colors that it changes to and the 3 modes but honestly its just to small for the price unless you are putting it in like a bathroom.</li>
            <li>There is a dim switch that makes it a soft blue glow, but If you could turn the light off completely, this thing would be perfect.</li>
            <li>Nice for a first time use of essential oils.</li>
            <li>I like the modern, clean look.</li>
            <li>The pretty plumes of essential oil &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; is a nice sign its diffusing.</li>
            <li>Great little defuser!</li>
            <li>A little more expensive than i would have liked to pay, but i am nothing but happy with the product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to set-up and to switch from one oil to the next.</li>
            <li>This little guy is just amazing!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for light sleepers (like me).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover a very large area - the living room we have it in is about square feet and connected to our kitchen/dining room (about square feet) by a breezeway.</li>
            <li>The perks are, that it is easy to clean and refill; however it doesn&#x27;t emit as large of a mist as my Young Living one does.</li>
            <li>My children also love that it has a little light, (the light can be turned off).  </li>
            <li>This diffuser works very well and puts out a fine mist which is dispersed over a large area.  </li>
            <li>Colorful, and really spreads the scent throughout my room!</li>
            <li>A gentle, fresh, natural smell wafts around the house - relaxing and even safe for an asthmatic cat.  </li>
            <li>It is a great size for a small bedroom.  </li>
            <li>I only have one issue with it - it would be nice to turn off the light completely while having it still run.</li>
            <li>normally use the tea light candle ones.</li>
            <li>Since I can&#x27;t tolerate any light when I&#x27;m trying to sleep, I was looking for a diffuser with either no light or the ability to shut the light off, which this one is supposedly able to do.  </li>
            <li>Wish it had about more natural of an appearance versus being a hunk of plastic, but it definitely does the trick to diffuse oils :)</li>
            <li>Vapor is nice flow and lasts long...</li>
            <li>I put 2x as many drops and it doesn&#x27;t make the room smell even a quarter as much as the young living diffuser!</li>
            <li>The sound is pleasant though and it producing a lot of mist, though not sure if it really permeates the room.</li>
            <li>Had it been a little larger, it would be perfect.  </li>
            <li>This little machine is very simple to use and works great!</li>
            <li>Even on the least light setting its too bright for my sleeping preference.</li>
            <li>The lamp does get somewhat dim but even then the blue power button is quite bright.</li>
            <li>I clean the top as well by rinsing it with water and letting it dry.</li>
            <li>I liked this so much, I bought a 2nd one for my office.</li>
            <li>Only bummer is that I wish you could operate this without even the &amp;#34;dimmer&amp;#34; light on; I&#x27;m a light sleeper.</li>
            <li>My sister has a Young Living diffuser that seems to really PUSH the vapors out into the air, and the smell circulates better.</li>
            <li>The only thing I do not like is the &amp;#34;no light&amp;#34; feature is still blue lol.</li>
            <li>I had considered buying something more expensive, but so happy I went with this 1st.</li>
            <li>even with the light off option there is still light from the blue power button.</li>
            <li>I have several different experensive doterra models but this one is my favorite because it is very easy to refill and diffusers all the liquid.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s small, but very effective.</li>
            <li>I have bought two of these, not because one broke, but because I liked my first one so much, I bought a second to place elsewhere in my house.  </li>
            <li>The mister comes with a small measuring-type cup to easily fill the mister which means that both my children (ages 12 and 14) can refill it on their own.  </li>
            <li>I love the last light setting,  just a hint of blue light.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I love that I can adjust the light so that one room can have it changing colors and the other room can have it turned off.  </li>
            <li>My children love the cool colors, but we like its quiet and gentle dispersement of our favorite essential oils.</li>
            <li>Feels like a good quality and due to its construction its very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Good little humidifier/oil diffuser.</li>
            <li>Over all a good little diffuser.</li>
            <li>My kids loved the colors changing in the dark!</li>
            <li>Easy to load, easy to use, turns off when empty.</li>
            <li>Super Quiet and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with the ability of this tiny little thing!  </li>
            <li>Pretty good little machine.</li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that when you click 2 times for the light to go &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, it still glows and the power button glows very brightly.  </li>
            <li>we live on an AFB, need to clean out all those toxic chemicals, first.</li>
            <li>There are three light settings -- rotating light color, one light color of your choice, or no light.</li>
            <li>And it operates in complete silence, which is a HUGE bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After almost exactly 6 months, this item stopped working.</li>
            <li>Quiet, efficient, lovely.  </li>
            <li>My only dislike is that the diffuser doesn&#x27;t run more than 2 hours max on one fill.</li>
            <li>Love it and totally recommend.</li>
            <li>I used it once the first week and</li>
            <li>I have been using this diffuser for several months, and I&#x27;ve been pleased with how it works.</li>
            <li>it turns off on its own when empty.</li>
            <li>The 5 droops that is recommended for the ZAQ Noor Milti Color Litemist Aromatherapy looks pretty</li>
            <li>We really like this diffuser!</li>
            <li>I am only able to dim the light.  </li>
            <li>The directions say pretty explicitly not to use citrus blends, but I have been for almost a year with no issues.</li>
            <li>I received this diffuser for Christmas and have used it daily (some days 2-3 times during the course of the day) and love it.  </li>
            <li>Works great but does not last too long.</li>
            <li>We have been using it daily for many months.  </li>
            <li>I have had this diffuser for exactly one year now</li>
            <li>I was in love with this product when I first received it and for a short while thereafter.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t even power on anymore after that first use.</li>
            <li>I prefer stopping it at the red setting when trying to fall asleep as this color is more conducive to sleeping.</li>
            <li>Took a star off because there&#x27;s no option to turn off the light completely.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>When I first opened the box</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t even tell I have animals anymore thanks to this miracle worker!</li>
            <li>Maybe this could be aided with a fan or more circulation but its in the same room as our wood stove</li>
            <li>and I absolutely Love the health benefits you get by diffusing essential oils in your home.</li>
            <li>I love all the benefits you get from essential oils with diffusers.</li>
            <li>I have owned 4 different types of diffusers and this one has been my favorite.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I ended up buying 3 more for different rooms of the house.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first one 2 years ago</li>
            <li>(However, if it had a larger tank that would run for a longer period of time it would be better).</li>
            <li>This was my first diffuser</li>
            <li>Worked ok for a short time.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this diffuser until last night when it stopped working.</li>
            <li>It diffuses the essential oils I love, and the scent carries throughout the room.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why we only carry reliable, energy efficient diffusers that include many convenient features.</li>
            <li>This is the first diffuser I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Exactly what anyone would want in an EO diffuser.</li>
            <li>It has options for different colored lights at the top or rotating colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>WORKS EXACTLY</li>
            <li>THIS IS MY FIRST DIFFUSER...</li>
            <li>Be aware that even with the &amp;#34;no light&amp;#34; option there is a bit of a glow, so if using this while trying to sleep, that might be an issue for you.</li>
            <li>You fill to the line and put the top back on.  </li>
            <li>and it starts the ultrasonic engine which vibrates the oil and water resulting in a refreshing plume of vapor that carries the essential oil scent throughout the room.  </li>
            <li>When it starts it lights the top changing into different colors as it works.  </li>
            <li>Also definitely more appropriate for small room.</li>
            <li>Want stronger diffusion, more drops of oil,  i do want a bigger ML.</li>
            <li>This is our first Diffuser.</li>
            <li>It feels and looks like a higher quality item than others I have seen on the market.  </li>
            <li>The unit itself is very visually pleasing to the eye, so a bit more in line with &amp;</li>
            <li>And it does throw scent, you just will have to actually use more oil.</li>
            <li>This is my first trying a diffuser like this.</li>
            <li>and my kids love the different color settings.</li>
            <li>I have this on my desk at work with my favorite doTERRA essential oil in it.</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant because it suggested not using any citrus oils in it</li>
            <li>Wish there was a function to turn off light completely</li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser purchase, I like it, it works well</li>
            <li>Got this one as a gift for someone and they gave me same gift:)</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty and stays on until it runs out of water.</li>
            <li>when I purchased this product I was under the assumption that the light on it would go out completely as I was placing in my bedroom.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the changing colors in the light-</li>
            <li>I diffuse essential oils all day long and it has been working great, no issues.</li>
            <li>I shut the door to the room I am using it after doubly making sure no cat or dog is in there.</li>
            <li>I like the changing colored lights and use it in my 3 year old&#x27;s room as a night light before bed at times.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Attractive and silent diffuser for permeating your entire house with gentle fragrances that will enhance the mood.  </li>
            <li>Only the top part changes color.</li>
            <li>I love using Essential Oil Diffusers in my home.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li>I was sure to take care of it, didn&#x27;t use any citrus oils, and then it just died suddenly.</li>
            <li>Their moms say they sleep much better with the &amp;#34;breathing&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34; essential oil in the diffuser and go to sleep watching it change colors.</li>
            <li>Do be aware that you can&#x27;t turn all the lights off.  </li>
            <li>The first day I used it, it seemed to work</li>
            <li>But I just personally think that their has to be a much better product on the market than this one.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love turning it on with some lavender essential oil when I come home from work.</li>
            <li>I love that it is so quiet.  </li>
            <li>I only wish that it would cover more area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit larger than I thought it would be, but I really love it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased another diffuser that is more esthetically pleasing for the master bedroom for the same cost</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this diffuser!!</li>
            <li>I purchased two of these diffusers and will purchase more in the future for gifts!</li>
            <li>love your changing colours and simple technology.</li>
            <li>Way better than paying for generic deodorizers like glade plug ins or something.  </li>
            <li>, its modern design and soothing colors make it fun for everyone, kids and adults.  </li>
            <li>but I figured I could just purchase another inthe near future since I loved it that much.</li>
            <li>It seems relatively cheaply made, does not hold much water at all, and has to be filled a bit below the fill line to actually start emitting.</li>
            <li>the first time I turned it on.  </li>
            <li>I agree that it works better in smaller rooms/areas.</li>
            <li>We mostly use it in our room (larger, master bedroom).</li>
            <li>Had it exactly 1 day.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product with amazon prime and it came in exactly when they said it would.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised to say the least--that this cheap plastic diffuser resurrected itself.</li>
            <li>The ZAQ Litemist Aromatherapy works very well!</li>
            <li>And very affordable!</li>
            <li>AND I have no problem with citrus oils;)</li>
            <li>The only thing I noticed is that it is more fragrant the first hour that it is used than the rest of the time it runs.</li>
            <li>Also, shipping was amazingly fast!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is too noisy, but it does have a soft whirring sound...</li>
            <li>and I actually did love them while they worked.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd one :)  </li>
            <li>and I really like it!  </li>
            <li>We used it almost every day for the first couple weeks we had it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still working like the first day I bought it.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time buying a diffuser.</li>
            <li>The first time I had it on with some lavender oil for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Since most people don&#x27;t actually read the instructions/fine print, I want to help by letting you know it will ruin your diffuser!</li>
            <li>I use this adorable diffuser nearly daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine that most people are ok with this light near them, but for those that prefer the dark, it would be nice to not have false advertising.</li>
            <li>This does exactly what is says it will - except the &#x27;typical&#x27; run time when filled is even better than listed in the write up.  </li>
            <li>light function, a mild blue glow is still quite visible from the cone.  </li>
            <li>; however, when the &amp;#34;light off&amp;#34; is activated it is still quite bright as the light does not really go &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; ... it is much brighter than your average night light.</li>
            <li>Although there is a setting to turn off the light, that only applies to main light.  </li>
            <li>but I have used them lightly and as long as I clean it well after use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to clean it with vinegar once every two weeks -- empty it and clean it like normal, then dry it.</li>
            <li>As long as it is below the line you are fine!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the new diffuser and will update after a few more months of use.</li>
            <li>Really gives off for a large room!</li>
            <li>The light puts out a gentle, soft, soothing glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found wiping the inside and top clean after every use removes the smell of the previous oil.  </li>
            <li>It works really well, is quiet and looks better than in the picture.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, and you really do feel relaxed with the lavender (my favorite).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d purchased one as a gift last year and the recipient enjoyed it so much</li>
            <li>It is small but does a pretty good job getting our EO&#x27;s spread into our living room.  </li>
            <li>My first one was defective &amp; I missed return due date by a few days, but excellent customer service took care of that for me!!!</li>
            <li>This is actually the second one of these that I purchased because I loved the first one so much.</li>
            <li>Super small and light and easy to transport.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly to me, there was very little circuitry going on inside.</li>
            <li>3rd press turns the LED light off (the top part of the cone), but the blue power button remains lit.</li>
            <li>It also has a much lower vapor output than the other 2 diffusers I own.</li>
            <li>The sound is barely audible, but calming.</li>
            <li>At first I was very pleased with the diffuser, but after only two months of receiving, it suddenly stopped working.</li>
            <li>Great way to have natural fragrance by simply adding essential oil.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that when the light is supposed to be off, it still emits a bright blue light that lights up a dark room.</li>
            <li>Even when the light is supposed to be turned off, the light around the power switch is illuminated and shines up through the cone making it have a soft blue glow.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, works well, and I love how it has different color for the LED light.</li>
            <li>I have been using this diffuser pretty much non-stop since the minute it arrived.</li>
            <li>did have to adjust the oil as the first night I put way too much in...</li>
            <li>I wish it had a stronger stream, but for a small room, it does a good job.</li>
            <li>This is good for a small area.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 3 days straight now and the ZAQ is super easy to use, easy maintenance, and last as long as the description says!  </li>
            <li>The entire will smell fresh and the air Will be clean within minutes!Forget famil chemical like Lysol and Febreeze have</li>
            <li>I looked through many different misters listed on amazon and decided on the ZAQ Noor mainly because of the appearance, the reviews, and the cost.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased with how quiet the unit it and how steady the mist diffuses through out the room.  </li>
            <li>travel on business frequently and sometimes find myself staying in a less than pleasant smelling motel/inn.</li>
            <li>I just got into essential oils and searched MANY websites to find a diffuser that was rated high and priced pretty reasonably.</li>
            <li>I will say I would have to use more than one in my living room since it&#x27;s very open with high ceilings, so the smell doesn&#x27;t disperse as well.</li>
            <li>Another thing I absolutely love is that it shoots the mist high enough into the air that the area surrounding the unit isn&#x27;t saturated with water.</li>
            <li>My wife originally bought this for herself, and i have actually ended up using it more than her, It has become a nightly regime to do my 3 drops of lavender oil and pass out to the 5 hours of constant relaxing lavender smell in the air</li>
            <li>This is such a cool diffuser!</li>
            <li>Other than my personal preferences, the unit is really very nice and works well.</li>
            <li>Aside from the loose wire, this is a pretty good essential oil diffuser.</li>
            <li>REALLY SPREADS THE SCENT AROUND THE WHOLE FIRST FLOOR.</li>
            <li>Clients and I enjoy the uncompromised properties of the essential oils in the aiv.it works very well!</li>
            <li>The blue light is pretty while I am reading</li>
            <li>The unit is easy to operate and very quiet.</li>
            <li>it is quiet and easy to fill.  </li>
            <li>Easy to add essential oils, just drop them in!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, quiet, seems to do its job well.</li>
            <li>The diffuser easily covers the entire area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, just fill up to the line and drop 4-6 drops of essential oils and let it sooth your worries away!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and almost instantly fills the room with fragrance.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and the kids like seeing the different colors progress.</li>
            <li>I have purchased a couple of these for multiple rooms in my house, and they have been running strong for over 2 months without any loss of vapor production.  </li>
            <li>one has been going strong for a solid two months, twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the changing colors and the option to hold one certain color if desired.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t smell it in a large room.</li>
            <li>I placed it in my family room which is medium to large in size.  </li>
            <li>I by no means have a large apartment and</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy this brand again.</li>
            <li>Fills a large room with scent.  </li>
            <li>Seems like it&#x27;s pure chance</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t used pure citrus oils</li>
            <li>does not provide aroma for large room.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product for a large room.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a diffuser that covers large areas and runs all night, then you should probably look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Pretty shape, nice color changing , functions well , just lasts such a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>use everyday and LOVE!</li>
            <li>Further, it functions very reliably, with easy to understand directions.</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot because it is quiet and easy to use</li>
            <li>Thats why it cost half of what the good diffuser from Young Living costs</li>
            <li>My 20-year-old son already wants this one for his room, so I will be buying him one as well as purchasing a few more for each room of the house!</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s fine, but I was hoping for it to last longer</li>
            <li>This product really works great...pumps out a large amount of  aromatherapy mist literally for hours upon hours without refilling.</li>
            <li>This little mister is amazing...</li>
            <li>This little guy is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Wish this had a little fan in it or something; works well for diffusing oils, but the vapors just kind of drift out and fall.</li>
            <li>Smells nice with the oils- which depending on the quality can use as little as 4-5 drops.</li>
            <li>There is a little pouring cup to brinn water to the diffuser which is nice.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Nice little product.  </li>
            <li>But with this great little product, she can use some essential oils in her room.</li>
            <li>They look the same and better yet, they both do the same exact thing!</li>
            <li>The large led light turns off, however the power switch emits a bright blue light, not good for a bedroom!!</li>
            <li>I do put the diffuser on the floor as the soft blue light is just a little bit more light</li>
            <li>I like this quite a bit - my only complaint is that even when the illumination is off a very bright blue light emits from the power button.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have it above my bed and when filled to the max, it lasts a whole night&#x27;s sleep and doesn&#x27;t turn off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my&lt;br /&gt;Purposes and only uses a few drops of oil.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s fantastic and I use it daily!</li>
            <li>This mister works very well</li>
            <li>2nd power button press holds the color light (doesn&#x27;t change).</li>
            <li>They couldn&#x27;t even bother to get the logo straight.</li>
            <li>I am hopeful that this will be much appreciated.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish I could change, is that I could shut the light off at night.</li>
            <li>It has been working very well</li>
            <li>and no as to whether or not you&#x27;re really supposed to,</li>
            <li>Really helps with sleeping with the lavender oil.</li>
            <li>I think the modern shape.  </li>
            <li>fantastic water diffuser for essential oils.</li>
            <li>Colors changing as mist comes out and makes it really mistic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stinks up the house real good.</li>
            <li>whatever color it&#x27;s on, and the third time turns the light off whike still diffusing.</li>
            <li>I really like this item.  </li>
            <li>Very bummed.</li>
            <li>The mist is an even one and the light show is definitely a plus.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>A very diluted vinegar wash would work too.</li>
            <li>Really it had been turned on maybe 8-10 times.</li>
            <li>I.e. It won&#x27;t work as a real humidifier.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>I really feel like this device should have lasted longer.</li>
            <li>and I much prefer this one going until it runs out.</li>
            <li>It is more aesthetically pleasing than I expected.</li>
            <li>Provides scent through my whole house.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very relaxing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important not to exceed the fill line or the unit will not work properly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a simple one button control for the misting, light, and power functions.</li>
            <li>Off you tap the button a third time the light goes out and</li>
            <li>I really like this unit...</li>
            <li>She loves putting her essential oils in each night and watching it light up.  </li>
            <li>Just fill it up with 80 ml of water (using the measuring cup it comes with), a few splashes of your favorite essential oil and then enjoy hours of fresh smells.  </li>
            <li>We like the simple look and options for light/no light.</li>
            <li>It fills a bedroom with aroma very well.</li>
            <li>Beyond that point, it works very well and we like it during the day.</li>
            <li>Thanks Mubashir.</li>
            <li>At $49.99, I expected more from this diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed</li>
            <li>That blue light can be quite distracting if you are trying to relax/mediate, etc.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this diffuser with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>I really like the color changing feature.</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>While I am not pleased with the manufacturing country, I am very pleased with the way this inexpensive aromatherapy diffuser works.  </li>
            <li>Seems like it runs out too fast for me.</li>
            <li>I really like this, but, wish it operated longer on the amount of water it will hold.  </li>
            <li>and it is very soothing.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>The ZAQ diffuser has been very reliable for us.  </li>
            <li>Much nicer than a candle or Glade Plug-In, as you can change it and use high-quality oils to fill your space.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m in my 20s, and ultrasonic diffusion makes me feel like I&#x27;m living in the future.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It just stays a blue light.</li>
            <li>For me, it is very distracting when trying to sleep.</li>
            <li>They has been putting a different oil up free every week.</li>
            <li>I have money to buy the things I really need.</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser -</li>
            <li>and she uses any oil she wants in it</li>
            <li>but I have used blends and it works very well.</li>
            <li>It works very well and lasts four to five hours.</li>
            <li>: even when the light is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; it&#x27;s still very obvious.</li>
            <li>Similar to that of a night light.</li>
            <li>We seem to get rid of colds much faster now.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it especially when using my oils at night.  </li>
            <li>It is very quiet and really does a nice job of getting the essential oils into the air.  </li>
            <li>I like the shape and it doesn&#x27;t make much noise.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that there is an option to have the light on or off.  </li>
            <li>It really works well</li>
            <li>Definitely for a smaller space, but great just the same.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>It operated very well for 5 days, then the button got stuck in the depressed position and would no longer work.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>for $40, i expected better.</li>
            <li>This diffuser can also gently change pastel colors to add an additional ambiance experiences.</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The design looks sleek and modern.</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>and she also said she cannot really feel it.</li>
            <li>It is very quiet and when it consumes the available water with the oils, it turns itself off, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it.  </li>
            <li>I really suspect something.</li>
            <li>Very calming.</li>
            <li>I also love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about water levels because it automatically shuts off when empty.</li>
            <li>is that if I want to switch the oil that is being diffused I have to unplug the whole thing to dump it over the sink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very portable</li>
            <li>This unit is very efficient and mists well.</li>
            <li>For a dimmer night light (larger foot print) order their DEW model.</li>
            <li>The ZAQ returned much of the moisture to the air.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I know its not going to fill up my whole house</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re one who needs darkness to sleep and wants to use this at bedtime this might not be the one for you.</li>
            <li>I bought this diffuser 3 days ago and have used it very often.  </li>
            <li>But I do really like the system.</li>
            <li>The unit is petite enough to fit on her nightstand.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it came with a measuring cup for the water which is very convenient.</li>
            <li>I have been using this diffuser for a couple months and it works very well.</li>
            <li>The kids enjoy the lights and how they can change color or be one solid color.  </li>
            <li>It holds so much water that it lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li>There are multiple settings based on your desired light effect.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Appears to be very well made too.</li>
            <li>I love the different colors it puts off , but the green is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Very quite also</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser</li>
            <li>and I really like.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s quiet which is really important to me -</li>
            <li>There is also a blue glow even when the light is off which I can not handle while sleeping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whenever someone is looking for a diffuser for their home, i always send them straight to this very one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I like that there is an option to not only turn the light off, but you can also set it so that one color stays on.</li>
            <li>Used it every night and it works really well for about 8 months.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and the change of lights very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest investing in this diffuser!  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It changes between multiple colors with a light steam-like mist.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I do not get the color options or how to really change it up at all.</li>
            <li>I put a couple of drops of oil in before bed and it turns off after we are fast asleep.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s modern design and the lights that change color.  </li>
            <li>Diffusing helps me so much with mood and energy.</li>
            <li>Not as much now.</li>
            <li>It runs for about 4 hours straight.</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li>; push it another time and the colored light isn&#x27;t displayed; a third time turns it off.</li>
            <li>Although the light does dim, it will not turn off without turning the diffuser completely off.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser prior I had a young living diffuser and it had stopped working</li>
            <li>Buy if you want an effective diffuser with almost no sound.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an essential oil enthusiast and own multiple diffusers.</li>
            <li>After a few flick/taps of my finger on the side of the diffuser to get the fan going since it seemed to stop on its own</li>
            <li>Bought this as an early Christmas present and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quiet and love the soft lights.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this little diffuser as we love it!</li>
            <li>Quite amazed at this small product, it more than adequately diffuses any scent you insert.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to transport and the water lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The other thing I love about it is the modern look and the rainbow changing colors.</li>
            <li>Put more VERY few drops or you will be overwhelmed quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love pygmy a little lavandar and rose oil in the diffuser in the evenings for a teaching scent that helps me destress and wind down after my day.</li>
            <li>(A more subtle light) for sleeping.</li>
            <li>As I stated in my original post, I only used the unit twice before it stopped working.</li>
            <li>But other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li>As for me, if it did a bigger area I would LOVE it, if I wanted it for a small area I would LOVE it, but I wanted it for my bedroom which is 22 X 26</li>
            <li>Purchasing more for other spaces.</li>
            <li>I researched many diffusers for my 1st purchase and I chose this one due to the ratings and cost.</li>
            <li>Most of my other diffusers hold about 200ml of water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be adding a couple more of them to other rooms in the house soon.</li>
            <li>Its ok, but if you are looking for a efficient diffuser that disperses the oil/water into the air I would look at other options.</li>
            <li>It only dims the initial light and leaves a very dim light.</li>
            <li>It is a great size, not too big or small.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean, small, works great,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ZAQ Noor Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser has a cool , modern look to it.  </li>
            <li>Loving this little thing!</li>
            <li>I guess the only thing is the button to turn it on is a little on a bright side comparing to the light element above it.</li>
            <li>This will not work for anyone who is sensitive to light when trying to fall asleep, and blue light especially is not helpful-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too big, has a quiet, soothing sound and does exactly what it needs to do!</li>
            <li>It also works as a good spot to diffuse throughout the whole downstairs and even a little bit upstairs (open floorplan, highceilings/catwalk ).</li>
            <li>I use mine frequently and it is still going strong 9 months later.</li>
            <li>So although it doesn&#x27;t have a super long range for the scent, it does still freshen the whole house!</li>
            <li>The light is never completely off.</li>
            <li>I do however recommend that when the unit shuts off automatically because its empty, make sure you use a towel or rag to completely clean it out and dry it.</li>
            <li>We have run two of these every day for almost a year and they have functioned perfectly every time which is a lot more than can be said about the various other diffusers we have tried, including some two to three times as expensive.</li>
            <li>It diffuses oils nicely and fills a small bedroom with scent.</li>
            <li>So far I really like it!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind them, but usually turn them off (which is a nice option).</li>
            <li>The top cone glows blue, not as blue as the other setting, but brighter than many night lights for children&#x27;s rooms.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;Put a few drops of oil in, depending on the fragrance, and fill with water to line/groove and just push power button on, it&#x27;s that easy!</li>
            <li>It even comes with a little measuring cup that makes adding the appropriate amount of water much easier.  </li>
            <li>Only thing is you can&#x27;t use citrus scents, but there are plenty of other great essential oils out there!</li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy - damp cloth/paper towel and a Q-Tip for the ceramic disc in the center.</li>
            <li>Also, if you do purchase make sure to save the box they arrive in because it&#x27;s an odd sized box</li>
            <li>It arrived as expected and was easy to set up.</li>
            <li>Automatically shuts off and super quiet.</li>
            <li>In the last 2 years I have been pleased with the results with using essential oils.</li>
            <li>One reviewer in particular said they could &amp;</li>
            <li>It is quiet making at most a very low hum, but nothing that we have found to be of any consequence.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for something that doesn&#x27;t shut off at night and is able to continue to the next day, you may want to consider something larger.  </li>
            <li>The Zaq Noor Multicolor Diffuser holds 80ml of water and is on the smaller side of my diffuser collection, but puts off more mist than some of my much larger models.</li>
            <li>This particular seller does NOT accept returns</li>
            <li>The only way to not have light coming from the diffuser is to turn it completely off.</li>
            <li>The unit is mostly whisper quiet and you won&#x27;t hear it running except for a very occasional water trickle.</li>
            <li>It is now the unit we use for the main area of the house.</li>
            <li>I wanted it mainly for my baby room at night while she sleeps</li>
            <li>(there is an option to have no colorful lights) and the sound of the thing working is peaceful to me.</li>
            <li>Instead it is a dim blue light.</li>
            <li>I think this particular design is space-efficient and almost tip-proof.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised that it puts out as much mist as it does.</li>
            <li>feature- light can be on (single color), changing colors, or off.</li>
            <li>I will say that in the future I will be looking for a bigger size diffuser from this brand because other than the size its very nice</li>
            <li>Just started using essential oils, and this is a great small atomizer!</li>
            <li>The night setting, which I thought meant it didn&#x27;t have any light at all is actually a really dark blue light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sending it back because it is very pretty.</li>
            <li>She normally is not bothered by light when sleeping...</li>
            <li>The white one is very pretty with the lights gradually changing</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t travel far but it&#x27;s good enough for an average sized bedroom.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil diffuser, i just received my ZAQ today and its been on for 4 hours.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and I have even given some as gifts.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I bought it because of all the really high ratings on the product.  </li>
            <li>and I have tall ceilings in the kitchen and sky high in he living room.</li>
            <li>I thought it was high time</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>As described, highly recommended .</li>
            <li>It can be set to nightlight mode which is a pleasant dark blue light, or you can hold it on any of the other colors, however there is not a setting to turn the lights off completely, which I would like for nighttime use.</li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be, and even though it is a pleasant little product, it does not live up to the advertised claim.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pro&#x27;s are that its small, the colors are vivid and fade really nicely</li>
            <li>I think the oil floats at the top, gets used in the first hour or two, and then in the second half it runs without diffusing much scent at all.</li>
            <li>I wish it held a little more water</li>
            <li>It lasts a little more than an hour.</li>
            <li>faf14f6c9f38b2234b586025537e1553]]This is a cute little diffuser.</li>
            <li>this is a lovely little machine -</li>
            <li>I fits pretty much any décor and I particularly like the alternating colors displayed while it is running (there are options to display only one color or no color at all as well).</li>
            <li>It does not seem to put out as strong of an aroma as my other diffusers, but it is satisfactory.</li>
            <li>the other one is still going strong.</li>
            <li>However, the light never really turns off.</li>
            <li>I can turn it on at night (and use it as a night light) and it automatically shuts off when it is empty.</li>
            <li>Great value and works just as well as expensive ones.</li>
            <li>So far it is working really well.</li>
            <li>But if you plan to use it when you sleep and if you really need complete darkness to sleep, this is not the diffuser for you.</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll need to diffuse a few more &amp;#34;tranquility&amp;#34; oils with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a powerful yet silent diffuser that works.</li>
            <li>I put in a few drops of oil &amp; water and once it is turned on, you can see the vapor coming out of the top immediately.  </li>
            <li>It amplifies  the scent by blowing out belong the normal range...</li>
            <li>Cheaper ones have worked better for me than this on, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li>thats normal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every night for the last few weeks now and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Quiet and fun</li>
            <li>This was my first time dealing with the whole Essential Oil thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot of fun choosing which essential oils to use each time you fire it up.  </li>
            <li>While I get a good whiff of my oils in my small bedroom, I doubt it would work as well in a larger setting.  </li>
            <li>i would like two more for around my house, but i think i am going to get a few himalayan salt lamps-</li>
            <li>So technically I cannot write any useful review on it</li>
            <li>Overall I feel this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I could use lemon in the evening and lavender the next morning and each scent would be distinct.  </li>
            <li>And now Amazon is saying it can&#x27;t be returned, which is frustrating for a Prime Member who expects good service.</li>
            <li>Fills the room with a nice and refreshing scent that really clears my sinuses when I&#x27;m sick.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this may be one of my all time favorite gifts that I have ever received!</li>
            <li>and the nice small size!</li>
            <li>It holds 80ml and is plenty large enough for my large living room or could even go well in my office or bedroom.</li>
            <li>Everytime it is turned on, it immediately turns itself right back off.</li>
            <li>I am using a stress reliever essential oil blend right now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right next to my bed</li>
            <li>perhaps ours is defective, perhaps we&#x27;re not following the directions right</li>
            <li>You get a high quality product that will make your home more comfortable for years without expensive part</li>
            <li>Running this long, the diffuser becomes very hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Have just gotten into the young living essential oils and was really anxious to fill the house with some healing, feel good scents.  </li>
            <li>It is a little noisy, so not great at night, but otherwise, works just perfectly!</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter is LOVING this little diffuser we bought her.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it, especially considering the economic price!</li>
            <li>I am ordering a new diffuser tonight.</li>
            <li>They immediately allowed for me to receive a new one and return the defective one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the new one for a while now</li>
            <li>New Age for me.  </li>
            <li>I think it was used and abused and sent as new................</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>so I will have to live with it as it is.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t compare with other diffusers as this is our first essential oil diffuser, but this one seems to be doing just fine - and it is used every day.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it just keeps running and running for many many hours despite the fact that the chamber is empty of water and it is just filled with steam, quite scary!</li>
            <li>I had filled it with the pitcher that came with it and was very careful not to overfill and it still stopped working.</li>
            <li>I can see mist coming out of the diffuser and can smell the oil if my nose is right above the diffuser or very close but can barely feel any smell in the room.</li>
            <li>Turning the light off just changes the color to a different shade of blue.  </li>
            <li>Entire room filled with essential oil with mood lighting based on preference.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this diffuser and changing the different oils around to obtain different results.</li>
            <li>I like to set the color on red at night so that the blue light doesn&#x27;t keep us awake.  </li>
            <li>Quiet enough to use while kids are sleeping and the dimming light feature is a plus.</li>
            <li>, the only thing I dislike about it, is that the light stays on the entire time.  </li>
            <li>(I had to have the heat on constantly to keep my room warm but that dried my throat out.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;ll primarily be using this in a smaller space and don&#x27;t mind it running several hours, then this is the diffuser for you.</li>
            <li>Overall it seems like cheap chinese made piece that although works for now, I have doubts it will stay in working condition.    </li>
            <li>Love this little think!</li>
            <li>I still love this little diffuser!</li>
            <li>Love this little thing!</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the setting for &#x27;no light&#x27; really stays a dim blue, which is fine if you want a night light, but I find it distracting.  </li>
            <li>My only wish is that it had a &amp;#34;no light&amp;#34; option, as even the dark blue light is too much light for my bedroom at night</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  </li>
            <li>The first diffuser I&#x27;ve ever purchased, as I&#x27;m new to the world of essential oils.</li>
            <li>It works well, is easy to use and will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>The unit is small and easy to operate, and gives scent to my whole bedroom (about 12x12).  </li>
            <li>However, it needs to be cleaned after each use since most of the oil stays in the machine even after the water is diffused out (and yes, I used the recommended amount and not more).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this if you need the light to turn off completely, but other than that</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first diffuser, so I would definitely recommend it for a first-timer.</li>
            <li>We used it for the FIRST time last night...and the wifey had to get up and turn it off</li>
            <li>and it is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>I just bought and am using my 2nd if this exact model.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We use it in our small living room to add a more zen like feel to our room.</li>
            <li>First time ever using such a thing.</li>
            <li>So when I diffuse as I am falling asleep in a dark room, there is still some light.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with an essential oil diffuser</li>
            <li>And love how small and portable it is</li>
            <li>My son loves it, so far!</li>
            <li>It only goes for 4 hours before it automatically shuts off, but the oil you put in it really makes a difference!</li>
            <li>It needs to be a small room for you to be able to smell the oils diffusing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually going to return that one and purchase this one for the master bedroom as well because it is so much easier to use!  </li>
            <li>works great just as expected and fun to watch when bored</li>
            <li>I even said &#x27;wow!&#x27;</li>
            <li>The only thing you should be aware of before you purchase this item is that you can&#x27;t (not recommended to)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alive!</li>
            <li>Love how small and compact it is, wish it had a feature to not use lights.</li>
            <li>OK for a small rooom.  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, I cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>Use high quality essential oil and it&#x27;ll make a big difference in bringing some calm to a high stress work environment.</li>
            <li>But a month ago, I decided to deep clean it and left it drying.</li>
            <li>This little machine puts out a powerful, consistent steam.</li>
            <li>My little 3 year old has been having sleeping problems, and this mixed with a little Woolzies Lavender essential oil is a perfect combo we&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>It does go through the water pretty quickly, but since I have never owned another diffuser, I am not sure if this is normal</li>
            <li>One of them works great and the other one died, which I only had a few months.</li>
            <li>It was brand new in box and sealed so it is clearly a manufacturing defect.  </li>
            <li>The strength of the scent is great; it may seem subtle if you turn it on and stay in the room, but the minute you walk out and come back in, you will definitely notice the smell.</li>
            <li>the dim is still too light for me to use at night in a dark room to sleep.</li>
            <li>It has a cool &amp;#34;light changing&amp;#34; feature that allows it to rotate through several different colors.</li>
            <li>There is no way to completely turn off the light without shutting down the unit.  </li>
            <li>This little diffuser works just fine</li>
            <li>and I love how simple it is to clean it (both the base and top).  </li>
            <li>It is extremely quiet and the light settings has s very pleasing setting for a dark room.</li>
            <li>Soooo if you want to use this in an area bigger than 8 X 10 I would say don&#x27;t bother... good for a small bathroom but not anything bigger...</li>
            <li>blue light won&#x27;t disturb your sleep, or if you are using it other than bedtime, I highly recommend this diffuser.</li>
            <li>The diffuser gets very hot on the outside which makes me worry about the potential for fire</li>
            <li>I taped a piece of heavy cardstock over the button and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>If you need a diffuser for a living room or large area I would get a larger sized diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Works very quietly, and oil Is well spread throughout even large rooms.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know these types of oil diffusers existed and was just using the little oil burner with a tea light.  </li>
            <li>I thought it might look a little cheap &amp; clunky, it doesn&#x27;t, at all.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d recommend placing it on a hard surface or on top of a cloth.</li>
            <li>I love this little dude!!</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT WITH A COLD, FLU SEASON,</li>
            <li>This cold water diffuser is great.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is the on and off button continually glows a bright blue.  </li>
            <li>It has helped greatly in our overall health as well as helping get our difficult sleepers to bed.</li>
            <li>Clearly there is a problem with this machine, but the manufactur does nothing to improve the quality.  </li>
            <li>I put Frankincense in mine to clear my thinking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using Young Living Oils and although I received a diffuser from them in my initial order I don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li>Very calming and quiet.</li>
            <li>I use this with either Doterra or Young Living oils.</li>
            <li>and so I expected a better performance out of this more expensive diffuser.</li>
            <li>Like this diffuser so much, bought a second one.</li>
            <li>I have a Spa Vapor and this product does not perform nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>It does not distribute the scents nearly the distance or for the lenght of time as the Spa Vapor.</li>
            <li>It fills my office with the essential oil scent, but if I use it in my family room or bedroom, it has to be very close to where I&#x27;m sitting for me to notice the scent.</li>
            <li>I really like the automatic shutoff when the water level gets low, which means I can turn this on and fall asleep and it will shut off for me.</li>
            <li>But when I turn it on now it makes a really loud noise and no longer diffuses and releases the particles.</li>
            <li>There was a very helpful site that did comparisons of various aromatic diffusers and the ZAQ Noor brand</li>
            <li>and you have a choice of having the light change colors or leave on one color or have no light at all.  </li>
            <li>We got this for our daughter for Christmas, and she used it ONCE before it completely quit working.</li>
            <li>I debated purchasing it, wondering if I really needed such an item.</li>
            <li>So far it is working well.</li>
            <li>That one did not produce as much scent using the same amount of</li>
            <li>There is a dim setting</li>
            <li>and here&#x27;s the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s thus far:</li>
            <li>but I was actually pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This diffuser has a clearly marked fill line.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and my whole family loves the way the house smells now.</li>
            <li>So far no problems.</li>
            <li>I really like the sleek design and the fact that it is low maintenance.  </li>
            <li>Changes colors &amp; turns off to dim.</li>
            <li>We use this in a massage setting in a professional office.</li>
            <li>You can essentially dim it, but you cant get rid of it all together.</li>
            <li>But it works well and runs completely silent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>do find that the scent doesn&#x27;t last the whole time the diffuser is running.</li>
            <li>The diffusing mechanism appeared to be working (the water at the bottom was being agitated), but no mist developed.  </li>
            <li>Two oils we use frequently are lavender and peppermint.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and is relatively quiet.</li>
            <li>Not silent, but very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use citrus frequently and have had no issues.</li>
            <li>But now it has stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li>So far (used about a month)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that 80ml of water lasts for about 4 hours.  </li>
            <li>I hope the product continues to work as well as it has so far.  </li>
            <li>Considering ordering an additional one if it continues to hold up well to frequent use.</li>
            <li>So far no issues.  </li>
            <li>It used to run completely out between 4-6 hours.  </li>
            <li>Mist goes directly into the air</li>
            <li>I tried contacting th company, Zaq directly, but never received a response.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old loves the changing color feature.  </li>
            <li>Simple modern design.  </li>
            <li>The colors change very gradually, and when you find a color you like you can just press and hold the power button for a second to have it stay on that</li>
            <li>It has one speed, holds nearly 10oz of water and will run for about 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My friend has the Young Living version</li>
            <li>I have young living oil.</li>
            <li>I was used to the young living diffuser</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase a diffuser because of so many negative reviews...</li>
            <li>Balance by Doterra and Acceptance by Young living.  </li>
            <li>simple and modern.</li>
            <li>one stopped working/not evaporating the water completely.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really sensitive to noise when sleeping.</li>
            <li>If you want complete darkness, this is not for you...</li>
            <li>It diffuses our essential oils into the whole room and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait before writing a review until I had used it frequently.</li>
            <li>but you can turn it off completely.</li>
            <li>No problems with it so far.</li>
            <li>It has optional alternating lights, light selection, and no light options.  </li>
            <li>And my 7 month old grandson loves the changing colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an OLD trailer.</li>
            <li>Now I had read a few reviews saying people had problems with this unit, but overall people were satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really disappointing because I loved it so much and even bought another as a gift and now every time I use it</li>
            <li>After trying every kind of freshener out there, and tired of chemically odor, I tried this.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item and loved it -- for 4 months of periodic use -- but then it randomly quit working.  </li>
            <li>I have Fibromyalgia and aromatherapy is helpful with the symptoms and this diffuser is as good as the expensive brands.</li>
            <li>Small, compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I only gave two stars due to the fact that the light does not turn off as the description states.</li>
            <li>It always leaked, even when it was half full, but I just put it on a plate and kept using it.  </li>
            <li>like someone else said, about the size of a large toilet paper roll.</li>
            <li>I purchased mainly based on price and average reviews for my first diffuser, and the ZAQ Noor 80ML did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>Other than that, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>so there is no mess.</li>
            <li>I had this on 24 hrs a day when I first bought it for a few months and now use it only at night until I purchase more for other rooms.</li>
            <li>Wish there was a way to have it run with a more subtle power indicator.</li>
            <li>However, there is a slight blue light so it may disturb some individuals&#x27; sleep if they are sensitive.</li>
            <li>We rinse it after every use, and about once a week let some vinegar sit in it for a few hours to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors are cool, it shuts itself off when it&#x27;s empty, no white residue on surroundings, and it makes the room</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a small, simple diffuser it is ok.</li>
            <li>I will leave more feedback (if I remember) in a few months to see how it holds up long term</li>
            <li>I ended up setting the color to red and then wrapping a small towel around it leaving a hole on the top for the goodies to escape.</li>
            <li>It comes with a top which lifts off exposing a small reservoir into which go the water and the drops of essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Its shape is reminiscent of a small volcano with the vapors rising from the top.</li>
            <li>Even when you turn them &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; the cone glows a dark blue and the button puts out a LOT of light in darkness.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quiet when it runs and the steam covers a decent area.  </li>
            <li>A little bit of water, a few drops of essential oil... and my entire living room smells great.</li>
            <li>The lights can be a nice effect and there is the option of turning them off as well (although the little blue light behind the button never turns off unless the machine is off)</li>
            <li>What I love about it is that ALL the oil (floating on top) is gone after a while, leaving only clear water behind, whereas with other white plastic diffusers, this is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;i also like how the button controls are all on the front.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disagreeing with the other commentators, but essentially, it&#x27;s pretty much the same thing as a humidifier.</li>
            <li>I use this in my high school math classroom with peppermint essential oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted an Essential Oil Diffuser and highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a low or high setting instead of just one.</li>
            <li>quiet with a slight, comforting sound.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve run it at least once everyday for a few weeks now and its working perfect for me</li>
            <li>I thought and doesn&#x27;t hold that much water which means it wont run long</li>
            <li>Last several horrs and covers a large area.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my saks and is small enough that is not noticeable enough but it fills up my entire office of a nice scent.</li>
            <li>It actually LOOKS like apple came and designed a pretty little spherical pyramid with soft pretty lights, with multiple color options.</li>
            <li>I am new to essential oils and didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton on a diffuser.</li>
            <li>But there isn&#x27;t really a setting where you can have it on without a light which was frustrating with my newborn.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly easy to use and even held up well to a clumsy handed drop.</li>
            <li>I should emphasize that even when you select no light, there is a dimmed blue light so some may find this distracting in a bedroom at night when sleeping.</li>
            <li>I have it in a 600 sq ft apartment, fills the living room area very well, doesn&#x27;t reach the bedroom so much, faintly, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It offers an array of lights, 3 modes (i.e. rotate color, fixed color, low-light), and there is only one piece or &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; to remove when you add oil.  </li>
            <li>It quiet, you can hear a little motor sound, but I sleep with it by my head, so it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Although this is a Christmas gift, so has not been put to the real test, I love the many benefits of these cold air diffusers!!</li>
            <li>students are obsessed with it and love the way it smells and looks!</li>
            <li>Is a little loud but the sound is similar to a white noise machine which I sleep with every night so the noise is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li>It is about the height and diameter of a large double sized toilet paper roll.  </li>
            <li>first one is strictly white, the second goes through an array of colors and the third is a soft dimmed blue.  </li>
            <li>Cheap diffuser that hardly fills the room with any smell.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s small and can go anywhere from a small spot on the floor to a large desk.  </li>
            <li>I do wish the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button didn&#x27;t have such a blinding blue light on it; it detracts from the color changing a little bit.</li>
            <li>The sage essential oil I put (high quality, Aura Cacia) is barely noticeable and doesn&#x27;t have that same pureness to</li>
            <li>will most likely buy another one from this same company if it is as quiet and a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li>Being able to turn the light off is why I chose this one, so I am disappointed with the product.  </li>
            <li>It also only has the one color in the form of 2 led&#x27;s that clearly show through the plastic.  </li>
            <li>(I usually turn the light off on mine when I sleep, although it does have a tiny glow still.)</li>
            <li>My husband surprised me with this last year for Christmas.</li>
            <li>It also apparently does not have the ability to change the color as well.  </li>
            <li>We had a Young Living diffuser for several years and were used to having a two to three hour diffuse time.</li>
            <li>It was just barely hanging on.</li>
            <li>I feel like it doesn&#x27;t push the steam/oil out far enough</li>
            <li>After reading all of the reviews I decided to purchase this diffuser to use in my bedroom with my Young Living essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Barely noticeable at during the day,  but glowing at night.  </li>
            <li>It does give off a soft blue glow in &amp;#34;night mode&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not bothersome to me.</li>
            <li>I felt like I had to move it a bit closer to me than the Young Living diffuser to have the same effect.  </li>
            <li>Early Christmas present for my wife.</li>
            <li>We have purchased two of these for our two young granddaughters who seem to have numerous colds.  </li>
            <li>It also arrived much quicker than expected and got here in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A couple of cons for now:&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;light off&amp;#34; function doesn&#x27;t shut completely, there is still a blue glow and illuminates part of the area.&lt;br /&gt;No battery option, you need to plug it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use my Young Living essential oils with them and it works well, haven&#x27;t had any issues with it yet.</li>
            <li>It is small, cool shaped, and diffuses the smell well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>The essential oils are very well defused, and also it add some humidity to a dry room.</li>
            <li>I love that you can have your choice of white, green, red, pink, purple, yellow, or blue light or all of the lights cycling through, OR NO LIGHT</li>
            <li>This was my first aromatherapy diffuser, and I&#x27;ve had it since July 2014 (about half a year as of this writing).  </li>
            <li>From red to blue or green or purple or orange and even yellow, there is a corresponding light tone for any mood.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, the aroma is not very strong (just right).</li>
            <li>After reading some reviews about this diffuser I was skeptical , but this is a great little diffuser.</li>
            <li>so much so that I have purchased three of them, either for myself or as gifts for other people.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that there is always a light emitted.  </li>
            <li>It knocks the socks off of my more expensive Young Living diffuser.</li>
            <li>No complaints and it&#x27;s been run nearly every day, sometimes multiple times daily.</li>
            <li>A second time to hold on the color of my preference, a 3rd time to dim the lights and a 4th time to turn the unit off.</li>
            <li>I have a well known more expensive brand (Young Living) and this is quite comparable in getting the job done.  </li>
            <li>The aromatherapy aspect is nice, but, given its small size, does nothing to add moisture to even a small room.</li>
            <li>Too bad because other than that, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>This would be a great machine for a small room like a bedroom but not great for larger living spaces unless you have a fan running constantly.</li>
            <li>Not really meant for such a large room, but students can smell the scent when they enter the room through the door in the opposite corner.</li>
            <li>i keep it right next to my bed and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that you cannot actually turn the light off and if you&#x27;re using it at night it will still illuminate the room.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that even with the lights off, there is still a noticeable blue light when I use this at night.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that even with the &amp;#34;lights off&amp;#34; option, there is still quite a lot of blue light coming from the power button.</li>
            <li>only problem is that, the &amp;#34;lights off&amp;#34; option does not actually turn the light off... at least not all the way.</li>
            <li>The only other diffuser I can compare it to is one I saw in Whole Foods which was basically a squat cylinder.</li>
            <li>It will also start to mold if not aired out frequently</li>
            <li>This has been run daily  (some days multiple times a day) with Young Living Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely quiet and you barely can hear it running.</li>
            <li>It is extremely quiet and you barely can hear it running.</li>
            <li>you could smell the scents, then I did the second time again and it  barely mist, Then it just doesn&#x27;t mist out.</li>
            <li>Diffuses well, however the mist is pretty heavy</li>
            <li>I had this downstairs in the kitchen for the first few months</li>
            <li>I had problems with this the first few times I had it and put it away......</li>
            <li>which can be very hazardous especially if anyone in your home suffers from asthma (I recommend wiping out the unit with a paper towel and leaving open to dry after every use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other issue I have had is that it&#x27;s hard to clean out one scent before putting in a new one.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day to diffuse mainly doTerra lavender oil.</li>
            <li>of warning: if you are lucky enough to find blends that aren&#x27;t selling their specific company oils remember this is a small unit.</li>
            <li>with the decor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong the unit does indeed work, but I found out after actually going out on a limb and buying the smaller Daisy that it does not throw scent very well(my primary reason for purchase) and hence my three star.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s much easier to take care of than previous diffusers.</li>
            <li>Area around it stayed dry so far.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it uses water to diffuse the oils rather than felt pads like my previous diffuser.</li>
            <li>it is supposed to go into a no-light mode,  What really happens is that the dark blue lights are on.  </li>
            <li>I actually like it better than my other one that costed at least double.</li>
            <li>and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It seems to be the right size for the room, not sure how it would do in a larger space.</li>
            <li>When I tried a less expensive oil it was not as good.</li>
            <li>Had a little trouble with the adapter, but is working fine now.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t get too little or too much.</li>
            <li>Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;But a little noise.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price (I paid a little under $40).</li>
            <li>I really like this little diffuser.</li>
            <li>the essential oils that I have purchased from Amazon, work really well in this little device, just set it up at bed time and forget it, has auto shut off</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It still lights up beautifully, and you can see the water bubbling, but there is no mist coming out, no fragrance, nothing.</li>
            <li> When it did work, it worked beautifully though.</li>
            <li> My beautiful wife bought this for me.</li>

            <li> So good there is nothing to report because this is just one of those products you want no hassle with and it delivers.  </li>
            <li> It arrived as promised and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> I chose this product because of the price and the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Good design all around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got good output..</li>
            <li> Good diffuser for the price</li>
            <li> The light show is soothing and the mist is wonderful.</li>
            <li> - maybe you get a good one, maybe you get a lemon.  </li>
            <li> GOOD BARGAIN</li>
            <li> and you should be good to</li>
            <li> I loved this unit, but when I ordered, I teetered between it, and the Smiley Daisy.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Wish it stayed on longer than 4 hours but puts out a good mist.  </li>
            <li> I have LOVED it . . .</li>
            <li> I still get a good 3 hours of aromatherapy,  however I wish it was longer for when I have it going at night.</li>
            <li> This seemed like the most simple, best size, best features, best price.</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser for my wife&#x27;s birthday and she loved it.  </li>
            <li> I figured from good reviews and being name #1</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, looks nice and makes no noise, diffuses oils great.</li>
            <li> This thing is great for relaxing, meditation, purifying a room, aromatherapy of any kind.  </li>
            <li> for the price, it&#x27;s a good starter diffuser.</li>
            <li> All the more, the brilliant changing colors keep kids and adults attracted.</li>
            <li> They loved it too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for $50, thinking I was getting a good deal given that the supposed list price is $100.</li>
            <li> So it does a good job all around - I have recommended to friends and recommend here.</li>
            <li> Like some others have stated, it was good while it lasted.  </li>
            <li> It is a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> or you want a bit of light, this will be perfect.</li>
            <li> Good value for my money.</li>
            <li> Good with just 3-5 drops of your preferred oil(s).</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser while it lasted.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week now and everyone that comes into the office comment about how good it smells in there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it did NOT smell good before.</li>
            <li> This diffuser creates a wonderful smelling, peaceful environment!!</li>
            <li> Dispels a perfect amount of &#x27;clean air, moist air and my oils.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, looks great, and diffuses well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use!!</li>
            <li> Looks cool and does the job perfectly!</li>
            <li> Even when it&#x27;s turned off it makes a nice conversation piece, the pyramid design is pleasantly eye-catching.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with it, and I feel I sleep better on the nights I sleep with it on.</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed, mostly because you can&#x27;t turn the light all the way off</li>

            <li> I will be purchasing more for the rest of my house!</li>
            <li> Press it again to stop it on your favorite color!</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser!</li>
            <li> Great size, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I use it just about every day.i&#x27;m happy with it, it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to use</li>
            <li> Works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very nice, easy to use.</li>
            <li> this diffuser is amazing.</li>
            <li> This diffuser does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> Makes my house smell amazing, my daughter loves the changing colors.</li>
            <li> Great at what it does, wish there was an option to turn off the muti color light display for bedroom night use.  </li>
            <li> Also with the ability to turn the light off it is great for night time also.</li>
            <li> The price was amazing too.  </li>
            <li> and it fills my room with amazing sense</li>
            <li> The smell is great and the lightup color on the diffuser is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> More importantly, it does a great job diffusing the scent over a good area and runs for a nice amount of time.</li>
            <li> colors of the ZAQ Noor are great, as are the light setting options -- all colors, one color, and no color.</li>
            <li> Now Foods came out with their own model that is identical in price and function.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior to it stopping, I liked the machine.</li>
            <li> Nice mister.</li>
            <li> The colors are a nice touch.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works perfectly and really atomizes</li>
            <li> This is a nice diffuser.</li>
            <li> The colors are a nice touch on the unit as well.</li>
            <li> It works well and has a nice ambiance.  </li>
            <li> All my kids ended up loving it as well as me.</li>
            <li> Working great very happy after several months.</li>
            <li> The scent is stronger depending on how much oil you use, but the mist is wonderful.</li>
            <li> a nice serene feeling</li>
            <li> From the picture it looked kind of unattractive</li>
            <li> I really did my research on diffusers that were reliable and yet still would not break my pocketbook and can honestly say that I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It also puts out a nice mist.  </li>
            <li> but I have to perform my own repair.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I liked the automatic shut off after 4 hours&lt;br</li>
            <li> the fact that it&#x27;s shaped kind of like a space ship.</li>
            <li> Must be used on durable surface or with some kind of protective mat.</li>
            <li> I own two of them.</li>
            <li> It makes my whole house smell wonderful and lasts for about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Do not expect it to do your whole house, just a room or two, but it does a great job!</li>
            <li> Would have been nice if it came with samples.</li>
            <li> They are nice, but I do get nervous over the flames burning in every room.</li>
            <li> My review is my honest opinion and experience with this item.</li>
            <li> Works for hours and shuts off on its own.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for the nightstand in a bedroom or office, fills the whole house.</li>
            <li> It has automatic shut off when the water runs out which is nice.</li>
            <li> Nice diffuser.  </li>
            <li> The changing colors is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> The color options are nice as well.</li>
            <li> works well and looks nice sitting out</li>
            <li> I have traveled with it so that is a nice selling point.</li>
            <li> Amazon says something about a warranty on the page for this product, but it did not come with any paperwork that indicated there was any kind of warranty.  </li>
            <li> There are 4 settings on this diffuser and I like that the on/off button is on the front of the unit as opposed to being on the bottom like another ZAQ diffuser I own.</li>
            <li> heck i even like the sounds of the bubbles it makes and the colors are nice to.</li>
            <li> We own 2, and I will pribably get another one.</li>
            <li> NICE.  </li>
            <li> NICE DESIGN.</li>
            <li> the color setting is nice.</li>
            <li> It is nice to put in your bedroom before you go to bed with calming scents like lavender.</li>
            <li> This one came recommended to me and from my research, it seemed like others liked it too.</li>
            <li> It just always smells nice.</li>
            <li> well the quality is nice,  </li>
            <li> Nice size.</li>
            <li> Guests have commented on how nice it smells</li>
            <li> Auto shut off is a nice safety feature.</li>
            <li> Kind of wish I would have ordered another ZAQ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colours change</li>
            <li> I think it diffuses well - I&#x27;m diffusing all types of oils in it and have had no problems in the two I own</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received this diff-user at discount for an HONEST review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lights are nice.</li>
            <li> Still a nice diffuser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to turn off the lights if you want to.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is nice.</li>
            <li> Colors are a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I now own two of them.  </li>
            <li> Diffuses nicely for about 4 hours, then shuts off automatically when it runs out of water.</li>
            <li> I have one in each of my children&#x27;s rooms and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice diffuser.</li>
            <li> I assume this is from some kind of leakage...</li>
            <li> The design is very nice and everything else was fine; but my purpose was to use this not to look at it.</li>
            <li> The Zaq Noor is a great price, very powerful, and works well as a diffuser.</li>
            <li> This always freshens it up and was especially handy on my recent trip to Washington state where I found its humidifier aspect very handy.</li>
            <li> The light settings are very nice</li>
            <li> It is super easy to use and makes everything smell wonderful.  </li>
            <li> rave about this thing and am SO happy that I now have a &#x27;clean&#x27; alternative to scenting my home without chemicals.</li>
            <li> So nice to curl up with a book (or Kindle!), relax and enjoy the oil scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re more concerned with the way it looks and modern design, this product may be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S VERY EASY TO USE</li>
            <li> It works well in my office, is very easy to use</li>
            <li> Compact and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and shuts off automatically.</li>
            <li> Very pretty works great</li>
            <li> I would love to give this more stars and one week ago I would have!</li>
            <li> I am completely in LOVE with this diffuser and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better choice!</li>
            <li> I am completely in LOVE with this diffuser and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better choice!</li>
            <li> The item arrived so quickly and was packaged very nicely.</li>
            <li> Great product exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> , I feel they should have mentioned in the instructions that many oils are hazardous to cats and dogs.</li>
            <li> I use it in my bedroom, and I love the kind of trickling waterfall noise that it makes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a lot of diffusers and this one is by far the best that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> WOW, THIS IS THE BEST DIFFUSER</li>
            <li> So far, I have been using it for over a week and it works perfect.  </li>
            <li> So far this has been the best thing ever.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure we would like this, but ended up loving it.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s easier for you decide if this is the product is suitable for the job you need it to do or for what you&#x27;re wanting to give someone.</li>
            <li> The light on it to signify that it is on is fairly bright, I have to point it away from my face.</li>
            <li> I love making up my own EO blends to diffuse.</li>
            <li> Love using it to make my house smell nice.</li>
            <li> The power button light is a bit bright at night time</li>
            <li> It makes a nice night light for them, not to mention how helpful the diffused oils are!</li>
            <li> Light as bright as that disrupts sleep.</li>
            <li> Still a good product and kind of cool.</li>
            <li> The mist is very, very fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li> So easy!  </li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!  </li>
            <li> Love love love!  </li>
            <li> This diffuser has been going strong for over a year!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, this diffuser!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this!  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it, was delivered fast, and works great, will have to order more for xmas..</li>
            <li> It makes the whole room smell good, though I wish it would extend throughout the house!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super easy to clean as well, I&#x27;ve found the best way to clean the oil residue out from the inside is by using a Magic Eraser.</li>
            <li> Adds a perfect amount of moisture into the air and delivers the essential oils effectively.</li>
            <li> The changing light colors is a joy for the kids to watch and serves as a night light as well.</li>
            <li> but it is more important to me that it is good quality</li>
            <li> runs great, easy to clean...</li>
            <li> Looks great, still working flawlessly after heavy usage.  </li>
            <li> Love the color changing option, and the light is not so bright.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to setup and love the versatility of colors and that it works with any oils (except citrus)</li>
            <li> and I think this one is better and much cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;Really, really happy and satisfied with this diffuser!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The diffuser cycles through bright LED light in a range of beautiful, vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> The diffuser worked great at first but the amount of mist it produces has dropped dramatically to almost nothing.</li>
            <li> This was great for the first month then started to turn off before all the water had been used.  </li>
            <li> I have tried 6 different diffusers and this is by far the best diffuser and best price!</li>
            <li> The packaging was very secure and the product came unscathed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Purchase this for myself for Christmas and so far am loving it!!  </li>
            <li> I have had visitors comment on how nice my house smells and when they see it, they comment on how cool it is!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone else who loves aromatherapy and surrounding yourself with the peace, benefits and good feelings of aromatherapy!</li>
            <li> The manufacturer says not to use it with strong oils, but I&#x27;ve used it with just about every kind of oil without any problems, including OnGuard from doTerra.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;The changing lights are nice and you can turn them off.</li>
            <li> Works well, nice lights, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Emits a nice fine mist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice fine vaporizer</li>
            <li> Great price, easy to transport, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Works great , just not meant for large rooms</li>
            <li> It makes the room smell great and the light show is so pretty!</li>
            <li> They work great and were a decent price!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love using this with peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I would find a better product/more reputable company.</li>
            <li> Love this, but you are not supposed to use citrus scents in it, so I grapefruit or lemon or orange</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> We love the product.</li>
            <li> but would be much better if it had a timer</li>
            <li> The different settings &amp; auto off its perfect for when you just need it before bed</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I love that it automatically shuts off.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it could run without a light.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I love doterra..</li>
            <li> Absolutely love thus diffuser.</li>
            <li> I love it though.</li>
            <li> I love the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I plan to purchase more of these soon, one for our bedroom and one for the kids room.</li>
            <li> I love the automatic cut off when it&#x27;s out of water.</li>
            <li> MAKE SURE</li>
            <li> Again, just make sure you&#x27;re cleaning it thoroughly after every use. :)</li>
            <li> and we LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Lovely flow, color changes, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love it for my bedside but the lights would not work when I&#x27;m trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Works great and fast.</li>
            <li> We all love it</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully and is very simple to use.  </li>
            <li> Very quiet and does a great job!</li>
            <li> I find this diffuser works best in smaller rooms.</li>
            <li> I could afford a nebulizing diffuser, and this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> would be better product if top fastened, if tipped over water, oil spills out</li>
            <li> I love it, except for one thing.</li>
            <li> Diffusing is a wonderful way to use essential oils, we use them for immunity support, respitory issues, to help us sleep better...</li>
            <li> and I believe it is helping them breathe better</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> I scoured through many diffusers before making the decision to buy this one</li>
            <li> we love it and use it often.</li>
            <li> I have found it does produce more vapors as it reaches the end of the time period.  </li>
            <li> We love the design and the fact that it changes colors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li> I want it more for the living room area.</li>
            <li> Appealing to look at.  </li>
            <li> Love this guy.</li>
            <li> Light never turns off!</li>
            <li> the one I use more often (in kids&#x27; room) is showing more wear and tear, for sure...  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the look.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise love it.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I use it every day, mostly during the night before bed to relax.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> So wonderful for essential oils</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this.</li>
            <li> Product returned for one of better quality</li>
            <li> Buy a better brand.</li>
            <li> I just make sure to rinse out the unit after using the cirtus</li>
            <li> the better you can smell it</li>
            <li> East to use with fantastic mist!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can choose it to \\&quot;freeze\\&quot; on a color that encourages the mood you are seeking.</li>
            <li> I have receivedm many compliments on not only how wonderful and inviting my home always smells now but also on the diffuser itself.</li>
            <li> I have receivedm many compliments on not only how wonderful and inviting my home always smells now but also on the diffuser itself.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Overall great!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try more.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> and that was in the light off setting!</li>
            <li> Anyone one know a better one?</li>
            <li> This diffuser is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love the light changes!</li>
            <li> There is even a nighttime light setting for diffusing my lavender while I sleep!</li>
            <li> and I love to diffuse lavender.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Diffuser came in excellent shape, just wish there was a way to turn the light completely off.  </li>
            <li> but I would prefer if I could choose to not have the light running!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Essential Oil Diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I really love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Interesting volcano shape.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> The kids love watching the colors change as they go to bed.</li>
            <li> The trade off, pricing vs the inconvenience of refilling the ZAQ more often.</li>
            <li> emits a nice mist and my kids enjoy the color changing too.</li>
            <li> I love the ZAQ Noor Multi Color Litemist Diffuser does everything it says it does and everything I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> Love the changing lights.</li>
            <li> /&gt;we didn&#x27;t use the changing colors option, but it was cute</li>
            <li> I should have contacted Amazon and have them send a replacement but my curiosity got the better of me.</li>
            <li> I love the option to change the lighting also.</li>
            <li> This brand has survived many drops and tons of</li>
            <li> We want to make sure our customers receive the best value possible every time they make a purchase.</li>
            <li> You know, I wasn&#x27;t even sure I wanted any Diffuser at all--just seemed too....</li>
            <li> But my kids love it that my PJ&#x27;s always smell like lavender</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS diffuser.</li>
            <li> I love how it changes colors softening the room.</li>
            <li> I like the diffuser, but wish it held more water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and the price was reasonable 😊</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect size, very quiet and works well.</li>
            <li> I like the look of the diffuser too, somewhat stylish on top of the dresser.</li>
            <li> Please feel free to ask questions!</li>
            <li> If you are shopping for one, the similar-sized one from Doterra is better in this regard.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I really am enjoying my Zaq Diffuser.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m  rarely going to give a perfectly polished review and very often I don’t spellcheck or my dyslexia takes over..</li>
            <li> I love the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> would give it 5 stars except for the fact that, even when the light feature is off, there still is a fair bit of light while it&#x27;s running.</li>
            <li> Any recommendations? :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an eye sore and is more of a piece of art.</li>
            <li> but after a week of using lavender oil and distiller water I have slept better</li>
            <li> This is just OK...</li>

            <li> I am so glad I chose this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> more fear of overheating or candle burning with the auto-shut off feature, so</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I&#x27;d love to like the product.  </li>
            <li> Love the automatic turn off system.</li>
            <li> My favorite is using it at night to diffuse oils for sleep.  </li>

            <li> Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Most diffusers do not have a built-in timer to handle this.  </li>

            <li> My kids love the lights.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m not getting the benefits of the oils any more</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had a bit more capacity;  </li>
            <li> It is very quiet and does a great job!!</li>
            <li> I love some blends with citrus oils.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has numerous colors but the best part is the durability.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed it... while it lasted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Over all I would say that I am satisfied with the product, but that it does not meet all of the descriptions I read online.</li>
            <li> The kids love the colors at night, and it does its job.</li>
            <li> Great product that works very well with the oils</li>

            <li> I will add my voice to the many reviews---</li>
            <li> My kids love that it changes colors.</li>
            <li> I love that you can pause it on a color or have no color at all.  </li>
            <li> I love the look and the simplicity of it.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> I use it with my essential oils and my house smells great!</li>
            <li> This one has a much more aesthetic appeal.</li>
            <li> What it would&#x27;ve made it better: batteries</li>
            <li> Love.  </li>
            <li> and I think mine works better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning it to try something better.</li>

            <li> Just make sure not to exceed the water level or nothing will come out.  </li>
            <li> I love how it changes colors as well.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so pleased with this unit.  </li>
            <li> She mostly uses oils that are beneficial to allergy sufferers, as well as Lavender to help her</li>
            <li> EOs not included, of course :)</li>
            <li> we are glad we chose this one</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the most elegant or appealing to the eye diffuser but works well.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these for my kids&#x27; rooms and they are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> however I am glad that I decided on this one.</li>
            <li> you work so well, i love you.</li>
            <li> My kids love to pick their favorite color to stop it on at night.</li>
            <li> Love these diffusers, have been using them for awhile.</li>
            <li> Much more inexpensive and work as well as pricey brands.</li>
            <li> Really impressed with the quality and style of this innovative essential oil aromatherapy device.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It lasts 4 hrs but it is no problem since you can keep adding more.</li>
            <li> If you happen to use citrus then just fill more water when it&#x27;s done with non citrus EO&#x27;s so that the citrus is diluted (just FYI).</li>
            <li> There are better options out there</li>
            <li> so o researched and researched and after seeing the reviews for this one compared to the YL one I am so glad o didn&#x27;t splurge.</li>
            <li> This is way better than the price implies.</li>
            <li> The changing LED lights are nice, but do note that a running light remains on when the LED is off.</li>
            <li> My home is now smelling phenomenal and by way of aromatherapy helping with my mood, and anxiety and helping me relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how it changes colors</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> It has given me hours of enjoyment and I love that it turns off when out of water.</li>

            <li> Let me begin by saying that I absolutely LOVE amazons costumer service.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> and it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> All in all, I still love it.</li>
            <li> Good price, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> If it takes you more drops then you should probably purchase better quality oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in my classroom for 2 months now and love it.</li>
            <li> So its ok</li>
            <li> Probably should have paid more attention to the description.</li>
            <li> The lights on it are ok...</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser</li>
            <li> Much better quality.</li>

            <li> Love the way it made my room smell -</li>
            <li> Love it, was one of the aromatherapy diffusers that was on a cheaper side on the Amazon search.</li>

            <li> She loved it, it works right out of the box.</li>
            <li> It seems right now to be working good.</li>
            <li> Amazon provided awesome customer service in response to my issue, but I would like to warn potential buyers that this particular diffuser doesn&#x27;t seem to be of great quality.</li>
            <li> also like that its stylish and very clean looking.</li>
            <li> so very excited I ordered this aromatherapy Diff-user</li>
            <li> Works with every sort of oil (though they recommend avoiding citrus) and allows me to mix my own unique combinations.  </li>
            <li> I plugged this baby in and within one minute flat you could already smell the delicious scent of the lemon oil I put in there.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> It worked great the first day and now it doesn&#x27;t even light up or give any signs of life.</li>
            <li> Within minutes your home smells nice and clean</li>
            <li> Its a nice size - beautiful design and VERY quiet.</li>
            <li> I moved it to the living room with the sky high ceilings and still received great benefits.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is very easy to operate, works amazingly well, is very attractive and it is not as small as I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> Very simple and easy to use and the multi color operation is very attractive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and the light changing effects make it pleasant to look at as well.</li>
            <li> The light feature has three settings: bright, bright alternating colors, and dim.</li>
            <li> The rotating colored lights are pretty, but are quite bright if you are trying to sleep.  </li>
            <li> The night mode is still pretty bright.</li>
            <li> The colors are so bright and pretty.</li>

            <li> I loved this diffuser when I first got it.</li>
            <li> The plug-in cord is nice and long, and the color display is gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Love this fun, colorful and very effective vaporizer.</li>
            <li> Well worth the upgrade!!</li>
            <li> The diffuser started leaking after a month or two but the seller graciously replaced the unit for us and the new one is working great again.</li>
            <li> The light doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;turn-off&amp;#34; as much as it greatly diminishes it&#x27;s glow.</li>
            <li> I love the size of it, how easy it is to use, the amount of mist it makes, and even how it looks.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t tip it because the lid comes off easily</li>
            <li> While I love them both, this is SO easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to use, just remove top of cone to fill</li>
            <li> I get it ready before bed and then tuck everyone in, brush my teeth, and the room has a pleasant, relaxing scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> quiet and nice, great buy</li>
            <li> It will run for 4 hrs or longer, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and looks nice in any room.</li>
            <li> Nice size and changing colors loved by my 12 year old.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to get started and to clean.</li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s very easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is very easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully for a single room</li>
            <li> the changing light is very cool and calming (and of course, it is nice to have the option of turning the light off when sleeping).  </li>
            <li> The very dim light setting is great, but it&#x27;s still to bright once I&#x27;m trying to go to sleep, so I often turn the diffuser off right beforehand.</li>
            <li> it worked great, and although it didn&#x27;t spread the scent as much as I&#x27;d have liked, it did a good enough job.  </li>
            <li> Very cool how you can set it</li>
            <li> Diffuses the right amount for a very large great room.  </li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser, very cool looking and love to be able to have color changing or solid colors or none.</li>
            <li> it is still much too bright to be used in a bedroom at night.  </li>
            <li> I love that you can select light brightness and color as well.  </li>
            <li> This diffuser works incredibly well and is currently what we use in our bedroom at night.</li>
            <li> This unit can be used as a nightlight, which is good, but be aware that it does produce some light at every setting.</li>
            <li> Puts a nice calm in the air</li>
            <li> great product, easy to clean,  gentle mist</li>
            <li> I would love for the light to turn off completely but this diffuser does a great job.</li>
            <li> I love how it looks with the freaky changing light color and</li>
            <li> Working great so far.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I love the light changing effect.  </li>
            <li> So far this has worked great for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Sensitive to chemical smells so this is really great.</li>
            <li> These are great - love the color changing - actually the kids love it.  </li>
            <li> so the light changes or you can set it to one of your favorite colors.</li>
            <li> I love this product, even that we ordered another, it works great and love the different settings.</li>
            <li> i have been really happy with the diffuser so far.  </li>
            <li> so I feel more comfortable when needing to put it in the baby&#x27;s room at night.</li>
            <li> that when the top is lit, but still too much light to sleep for me.  </li>
            <li> The kids really love the changing color light to watch as they fall asleep.</li>
            <li> Love the look of the product and really enjoy the changing colors.</li>
            <li> I love the ability to change the light color (as this is in my children&#x27;s room); however even on the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it still works.</li>
            <li> the diffuser really makes my house smell good.</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser the whole 13 days it lasted.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money-quiet and effective.</li>
            <li> I really loved this for a whole month.  </li>
            <li> The size is fairly compact so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Decent product, the changing light feature is very nice</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and gets the job done at an affordable price!</li>

            <li> I clean it and take good care of it exactly as I am supposed to.</li>
            <li> This unit is easy to operate and to clean and the color changing top is very cool.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works great!</li>
            <li> My daughters think the changing colors are really cool!</li>
            <li> I have purchased other brands but ZAQ is my go to for the best diffusers, IMO!</li>
            <li> The first night with it went well, looking forward to more of them!</li>

            <li> This diffuser is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I wish it could diffuse intermittently (why its 4 out of 5 stars), but priced competitively, easy for him to use and seems to be well made.</li>
            <li> Fills the room its in easily and the connected rooms after about an hour using about 5 drops of lavender oil per 100mL.</li>

            <li> Most recently I purchased one for my father to share the joy of diffusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need 7-8, also depends on how strong you want the scent to be.</li>
            <li> would agree that the scent is strong in the immediate area and spreads throughout a 300sf space (I even have vaulted ceilings).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Easy setup and one-button usage, cool features and appealing to the eye.</li>
            <li> In the yoga class, I really enjoyed how it filled the whole room with an amazing, relaxing scent</li>
            <li> Lavender is very relaxing and peppermint very refreshing.    </li>
            <li> Cool misted oils ejected from top.</li>
            <li> It is good to read about aromatherapy to better understand how essential oils can contribute to one&#x27;s health and well being ([...] ,[...]) to get the most out of this product.    </li>
            <li> overall very pleased and really love using this!</li>
            <li> This diffuser is BPA Free and is made of safe, health friendly materials.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and such a heavenly mist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This diffuser is so quiet and the color changing lights are beautiful.</li>
            <li> and when I would take the top off diffuser was full of a cloud of mist which would then rush out.</li>
            <li> Also, I do leave that changing lights on (they are cool :)), but</li>
            <li> Even the packaging it came in was so cute and cool</li>
            <li> Easily and quickly diffuses my favorite EO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The light colors are nice, and just the right brightness for a night-time or evening light.  </li>
            <li> This adorable aromatherapy diffuser is a new favorite!</li>
            <li> , it works fine.  </li>
            <li> This diffuse works fine.  </li>
            <li> Everything was fine.</li>
            <li> The beautiful changing light is a visual bonus.</li>
            <li> After receiving this diffuser, we used it about a dozen times, and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the amount of mist, ease of use and the included measuring cup is convenient for knowing exactly how much water to put in.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I think it should work fine -</li>
            <li> This adorable little diffuser is amazing!!  </li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift and it worked wonderfully the first day, but quit on the second day.</li>
            <li> The set up is quick, just plug it in, add water and your favorite oil, and turn the unit on.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to fill up, looks easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of parts to lose.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to refill, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> but the dimmest light is still fine.</li>
            <li> use this in our large 2-story living room when I want the house to feel warm and inviting.  </li>
            <li> This is a perfect little diffuser.</li>
            <li> This little &amp;#34;volcano&amp;#34; as my kids call it is working wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This little diffuser is great!</li>
            <li> This little mister is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome little pod.</li>
            <li> Awesome little diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this little unit.</li>
            <li> It is a little discolored after a year of use, but still works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Perfect little oil diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It has clean lines, pretty colors and an &amp;#34;UFO&amp;#34; kind of look.</li>
            <li> it probably would not be so great for a large living room, because it probably wouldn&#x27;t cover that much space.</li>
            <li> It looks nice and produces a nice fine mist of essential oils.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t a huge issue for me, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have kept it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t turn off the light completely and it makes my room at night to bright for me.  </li>
            <li> You will be happy with this diffuser, the simple yet sleek design will fit in all decors.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t diffuse a huge space but it works well in a bedroom.</li>
            <li> Not only does it do a fantastic job of making your home smell great</li>
            <li> If you push the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;  button twice, a lower light comes on which is about like a nightlight.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to clean, I just wipe them out every morning</li>
            <li> Also, there is not an option to turn the light off as claimed.</li>
            <li> We use a variety of essential oils in it and it works great.</li>
            <li> You can turn off the ambient light or leave it on.  </li>
            <li> I very much enjoy that you can &#x27;pause&#x27; the colors to whatever you would like it to be.</li>
            <li> The unit just does not work at all, besides continuing to light up.</li>
            <li> I works great for a smaller space like a bedroom.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works great to distribute essential oils around our home.</li>
            <li> The light is always on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For some, this may not be a problem, but if light bothers you while you&#x27;re sleeping</li>
            <li> even tried covering it up with aluminum foil, and the light still shines through the hole where the vapors cone out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll end up looking for one that doesn&#x27;t emit any light.</li>
            <li> but I do wish I could turn the light off.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> I like the bubbling sound</li>
            <li> Fifty dollars is all with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap like some of the others.</li>
            <li> The dimmed light doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> The light change  </li>
            <li> Works great with our essential oils.</li>
            <li> Worked great for six months of use before suddenly dying.</li>
            <li> There is no way to run the diffuser without any light features but this dimmed</li>
            <li> I bought this product with information from Amazon saying you could turn off the light while it was running...</li>
            <li> The Q &amp; A area at the time I researched it on Amazon said that light could be turned off when running&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked hers so much I reseached them and bought this one.</li>
            <li> I like the light</li>
            <li> Great product; I just wish it had a bigger reservoir.</li>
            <li> I use the morphing color mode during the day but turn the light off for diffusing at bedtime (3 presses of the button).  </li>
            <li> and I also enjoy it for relaxing at night.</li>
            <li> As I primarily use this at night, the &amp;#34;no light&amp;#34; mode was a selling point.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Might not be good for light sleepers sensitive to light.</li>
            <li> Experienced aromatherapy users combine different oils to help relax, stimulate or set a tone in the environment.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you are hypersensitive to light and expect to use it when you sleep or if you are looking to diffuse citrus (orange/lemon) oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> three light setting controls (changing, any in the range, or off) are nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It works well at its primary function:</li>
            <li> I wish I could run it without the light.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much, I ordered another one.  </li>
            <li> Not one of the ZAQ diffusers has a light off function.</li>
            <li> Fantastic addition to an office  - relaxing and soothing through the hectic day.</li>
            <li> Even on the &amp;#34;lowest&amp;#34; light setting -</li>
            <li> It has three light</li>
            <li> These work great in combination with essential oils to prevent illnesses.</li>
            <li> It is extremely easy to clean and manage - like the apple version of atomizers.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to clean</li>
            <li> I like the colors of light, and the idea I can choose the color.</li>
            <li> I filled this diffuser to the fill line, plugged it in and went about my business.</li>
            <li> I would prefer to not have a light in my diffuser.  </li>
            <li> and it has a auto shut off feature which I think is important because I like to run my diffuser while I am sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I think this diffuser would make a great gift for anyone that is a essential oil user.</li>
            <li> It worked great until it died suddenly only after 4 months.</li>
            <li> few drops of oil in the water, and the room smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit does a great job of distilling essential oil into the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and everyone comments on how attractive it is when it goes through its color changes.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Sold just as it is described, works great and is quiet.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy how the colors change -for the light.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it; it works great.</li>
            <li> but it would be nice if the water feature lifted out instead of having to bring the whole thing to the sink.</li>
            <li> The light settings are relaxing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean just wipe with a paper towel.</li>
            <li> Using YL Abundance and makes the entire downstairs spell great.</li>
            <li> so doesn&#x27;t take a lot of space, is very quiet and works great.</li>
            <li> I have had a few diffusers and this is the best.</li>
            <li> And she loves the light setting options as well.</li>
            <li> so I decided to buy a cheap one.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the fact that it still emits light even tho</li>
            <li> you turn off the light features.</li>
            <li> It works well with any oils and you can choose to just have the mister, or have one glowing light or have it change to a rainbow of colors.</li>
            <li> It serves as a night light while running.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> and you can press the power button again to hold it on a colour you like or press again to turn off the light while the diffuser continues to run.</li>
            <li> I use Eden&#x27;s Garden oils in here( fantastic company)</li>
            <li> Enjoy all the settings and the longevity (3hrs) of mist it pumps out.</li>
            <li> I like the light options.</li>
            <li> to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> So calming, wish the light could be turned off when in use.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I like the option of the color changing light</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to clean and operate.</li>
            <li> Within 20 minutes, my room smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> The days of lighting candles are over; welcome to the era of essential oils.</li>
            <li> I doubles as a night light</li>
            <li> Keeps my house smelling great with my essential oils.  </li>
            <li> This product was great for my room getting ZAQ Noor Air Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser</li>
            <li> I like the brand and will try another style that says the light can be turned off</li>
            <li> but light disturbs sleep quality.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is so stinkn&#x27; bright that the shadows it casts throughout my 22 month old son&#x27;s bedroom (about 12&#x27;x14&#x27;) frighten him.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I got it at a great sale price and only wish I bought two instead of one!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the light</li>
            <li> but you can have the light off yet still</li>
            <li> It seems like it burned out (when I turn it on, the light flashes and then goes out...</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and fill.  </li>
            <li> Light mist.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The kids (and I) also like the light feature on this.</li>
            <li> Press it yet again to turn the light off if you want to go to sleep.</li>
            <li> Has variable selection for light control and auto shut off.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is great in theory, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to stand up so well.</li>
            <li> One push of the button and it is in multi-color light mode</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and to clean, and it never mixes scents.  </li>
            <li> I was especially impressed by how much longer this ones runs on the same amount of water and oils.  </li>
            <li> and I have been using tap water to diffuse the oils in, so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Working good so far.</li>
            <li> So far, so good</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Young Living diffuser that costs you 100 bucks.</li>
            <li> I bought this with my birthday money and it is by far one of my favorite items I own.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this for about a month and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good no problems yet.</li>
            <li> The top comes right off</li>
            <li> Love it, works right away &amp; spreads smells of oil throughout the house.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was happy and excited to find the same product on Amazon</li>
            <li> Luckily return was easy.</li>
            <li> This is the best little diffuser!</li>
            <li> The mister is very easy and fast to use.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the light changing mode, although I don&#x27;t really see any other benefit to that besides entertaining your children :)  Works great and always shuts itself off when it supposed to.  </li>
            <li> This is such a good, easy to use unit.</li>
            <li> If I were going for medicinal purposes I might use something more powerful, but I&#x27;ve tried it in my downstairs and it quickly scents up a 300 sq ft area as well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t over feed it with your essential oil as this gives off a great amount of steam and quickly fills the rooms.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean and can really pump out some vapor.  </li>
            <li> Still worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love this so much!</li>
            <li> The room is fairly small, and this diffuser seems to be the perfect size.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed NONE of the issues I had with the original.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> First diffuser and I am in love.</li>
            <li> I love mine so much that I&#x27;ve purchased multiples for gifts!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I set it up on top of my desk and used it the first time at night before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to receive this item.</li>
            <li> Just perfect size for a small room.</li>
            <li> I wish that I had originally purchased the Daisy.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and your water and essential oils give you a wonderful and healthy scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this product is the multi color changing top along with the dancing sound of water ever so softly while diffusing.</li>
            <li> Love it so much I plan to order one for my office!  </li>
            <li> Love it much!</li>
            <li> Love the different scents the wife uses, eucalyptus is our favorite!  </li>
            <li> I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> :) thanks !</li>
            <li> It does allow the oils to become airborn, but it&#x27;s not an atomizing diffuser which will give a greater healthful effect, but at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> I loved the first one, which I was using in our bedroom, that I bought another one to use on our main floor.  </li>
            <li> great little machine love it</li>
            <li> I clean it out after every use with a paper towel or tissue and it has been running</li>
            <li> THAT YOU CLEAN IT AFTER EVERY USE TO ENSURE LONGEVITY OF THE DIFFUSER.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve mostly use citrus and so far have no issues, but I&#x27;ll be sure to clean out the bowl after using citrus.</li>
            <li> So far, we have only diffused Orange EO&#x27;s in it, but it leaves the house smelling great!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s bright enough to be used as a night light.</li>
            <li> Clean look too.</li>
            <li> When the light is off there is still a bright blue glow from the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It makes a whisper soft sound which I can sleep with and the auto off when water is out feature is nice.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know about the light that changes color - but love it - very soothing.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t clean it with anything, just use the leftover oils.</li>
            <li> and I have had to clean it yet!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love to put lavender essential oil in it and make my kitchen smell amazing and calming.</li>
            <li> Works ok but would recommend paying more and getting a Doterra or Young Living diffuser.</li>
            <li> The colors are pleasant and it is quiet.</li>
            <li> The price was fair and I love that this cold air diffuser fills the room with beautiful scents for hours after its been turned off.</li>
            <li> Its been running for 2 hours now, and loving it so far!</li>
            <li> and it filled up my classroom pretty easily.  </li>
            <li> Just the right size, easy to fill with the supplied measuring cup and</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not something to use in a large room, but I love it for my bedroom.</li>
            <li> I put in on with lavender oil right when my kids are going to bed and it soothes them right to sleep every night. :)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not like a humidifier, it is just right!</li>
            <li> For a first time user of essential oils this diffuser has been great.</li>
            <li> First of all, I think this is a great product (4 stars), but I&#x27;m wondering why the price doubled in the last two months.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively quiet, but a bit bright at night.</li>
            <li> This has been a great value for the money spent.</li>
            <li> The glow, even when low, is bright.  </li>
            <li> It smells so good to me-and I am usually pretty sensitive to perfumes/colognes or air fresheners</li>
            <li> It still has an LED for the on/off button that is entirely too bright for use in a bedroom at night.</li>
            <li> I love this so much</li>
            <li> This is a cool air diffuser which protects the integrity of your oil.  </li>
            <li> - my boys thought it was cool.  </li>
            <li> I did receive mine free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experienceb and honest opinions of this ZAQ Noor Essential Oil Diffuser.no way to run the diffuser without any light features</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about aromatherapy  the last year</li>
            <li> Very relaxing and even cute on your nightstand.  </li>
            <li> Love these diffuses,,  wrapped really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went with this option, it works very well.</li>
            <li> Cool</li>
            <li> I laughed when I read the following on the ZAQ website:</li>
            <li> I really like this one better than the one I got from the company</li>
            <li> the diffuser looks nice, and work great, everybody at home feels the aroma, very quiet and the color changing  lights are an extra</li>
            <li> It is cool looking.</li>
            <li> I think I may get another one to avoid having to do this, because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> A full resevoir lasts around 3+ hours.  </li>
            <li> ,the auto shut off is cool though cause sometimes I forget.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser it works very well</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I do not have much to compare to, but I love my ZAQ Noor Litemist Diffuser.</li>
            <li> The one thing I really like about it is it shuts off after all the water is gone :)</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it so much I sent one to my mother for her birthday over the summer.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, puts out good amount of smell, cool changing lights.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t nearly as strong a diffusion as in our smaller bedroom, but it still is nice to freshen or enhance the living room air.  </li>
            <li> Choice of varying color or single color lighting or nightlight modes while running, but the night light is rather bright.</li>
            <li> Super cool..</li>
            <li> Easy to use, pretty to look at</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and it&#x27;s so pretty.  </li>
            <li> It works great at diffusing essential oils into a large family sized room.</li>
            <li> This is a great product- small, cute, colorful and</li>
            <li> This is a great unit, small and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it is a great diffuser.</li>
            <li> - many small ones have a light that is so bright.</li>
            <li> The Noor Litemist works great, we have a large open room/area and it starts working quickly.</li>
            <li> I wish it covered a little more square footage, but it runs great, is quiet &amp; very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The DoTerra diffuser is huge and frankly I really didnt want to have this HUGE thing in my room.</li>
            <li> House smells fresh and clean without chemicals.</li>
            <li> With my favorite oils it changes the entire mood of my house :)</li>
            <li> It is light weight, quiet, and looks nice to have on a shelf or a side table.</li>
            <li> Then dump out the vinegar and water and it&#x27;ll be all super.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and performs well.</li>
            <li> I did receive mine free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experienceb and honest opinions of this ZAQ Noor Essential Oil Diffuser.</li>
            <li> The contemporary design looks fabulous anywhere!</li>
            <li> (I&amp;#34;M really much more main stream.)  </li>
            <li> Awesome product and much better than the taller version of the Essential Oil Diffuser which I previously bought from ZAQ</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly &amp; as described.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll say no closer than two feet as the mist dissipates quickly...</li>
            <li> He loves the changes in color (his artistic side).</li>
            <li> Really like this product: compact, easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li> looks super</li>
            <li> This is also the better model of the 2 main types of ZAQ diffusers.  </li>
            <li> With just a few drops of fragrance, it does a great job of making you feel light and comforting.</li>
            <li> It runs very quietly and the light setting are a nice feature.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy and the kids love the light aspect of it - I like that the settings</li>
            <li> This is my fourth diffuser and finally found one that is perfect.</li>
            <li> When I have it in the kitchen-the scent of the oil is not so strong-but mildly noticeable.</li>
            <li> but I love the soft light emitted and the look of the vapor coming out of it.</li>
            <li> You might need more than one for a big room, but you can always add more drops if you want the aroma stronger.</li>
            <li> If the light was able to be turned off completely then it would be a 5 star item.</li>
            <li> It works super well and fills the house with oils.</li>
            <li> I do wish that the light off function really did turn the light off.</li>
            <li> So far... it is very easy to use</li>
            <li> The first few uses were very good, a lot of mist, scent was perfect the same as the essential oil itself.</li>
            <li> The first press of the power button turns it on, as well as the color changing LED light.</li>
            <li> The light is really pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this item after using it several months.</li>
            <li> There are 4 settings, mist with changing light color, mist with set light color, mist with dim light and off.</li>
            <li> Generally, I like it and it makes the room smell nice.</li>
            <li> things considered, I&#x27;m very pleased with the overall quality and function of the Zaq Noor Litemist Diffuser.</li>
            <li> The button options don&#x27;t work consistently, and it does emit light when your are sleeping.</li>
            <li> I love the attractive visual it creates while it operates &amp; also it works so well with how it gently mists out the natural fragrance</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite thing.</li>
            <li> The oil diffusing is new to my wife and I and we are both enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> However, we love EVERYTHING else about it, so we just buy a new one when it stops working.</li>
            <li> I bought this slightly over a year ago and it worked great.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t fully turn off the LED on/off switch light, which is bright in a dark room.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This diffuser does a great job of filling a room 24&#x27;X24&#x27; or less in size.</li>
            <li> It works well although the blue, non-light is still pretty bright and keeps me awake.</li>
            <li> Diffuser worked great for 2 and a half months.</li>
            <li> : Whisper Quiet, very attractive clean lines, the lights are very soothing and you can turn them off entirely, so portable</li>
            <li> We have used it on a daily basis and love it!</li>
            <li> We love how it is easy to use, simple to look at and has the option of being one color instead of changing.  </li>
            <li> , it is quiet and easy to add more water and EO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> this little diffuser works great</li>
            <li> This is a great little unit.</li>
            <li> Just a great little thing.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little thang.  </li>
            <li> but this little buddy does a great job.</li>
            <li> Great little item.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is a great little diffuser.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It is tough to get five stars out of me, but I&#x27;m quite impressed with the Zaq.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but you CANNOT turn off the light completely like the posted information says.  </li>
            <li> But honestly super cute with the different colors you can choose from and does a wonderful job of filling my downstairs with different essential oils!</li>
            <li> I really like the option to turn the light function off but still diffuse.</li>
            <li> there was an option to run it without any light which is what I really wanted</li>
            <li> What I wound up with with is an aroma dribble that I had to be very close to enjoy.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday and appreciate the great workmanship.</li>
            <li> You can adjust it to run without the colored lights but the blue &amp;#34;power on&amp;#34; light still shines and you can hear it quietly and happily bubbling away as you drift off.  </li>
            <li> We use it everyday and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> It is very quite and the changing light colors are soothing.</li>
            <li> Quiet fan and the light on it is soft without being too bright.</li>
            <li> I use peppermint essential oil and my home smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> Product produces the desired results and gives a very calming effect with the light and aroma.  </li>
            <li> This works really well, and I enjoy the spa like atmosphere it causes in my room.  </li>
            <li> but recently I am missing a working diffuser greatly which reminded me to write a review.</li>
            <li> I use it with some essential oils for aromatherapy, and it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing to be in bed with the light.</li>
            <li> I like this product except I don&#x27;t really like the light being on.  </li>
            <li> meditating and calm to purifying the air.  </li>
            <li> This one is far better.  </li>
            <li> (just a very low humming, I&#x27;m a light sleeper and was able to fall asleep with this running).</li>
            <li> I love it and have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I ordered a second one.  </li>
            <li> I love that you can dim it for night use.</li>
            <li> I received one for Christmas and loved it so much I bought a second to use in my daughter&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked at several diffusers and this one is the best priced for the money spent.</li>
            <li> co worker has a different brand diffuser and it smells up her office so nicely...</li>
            <li> The changing colors could be fun for a child&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li> This is our second purchase of this kind.</li>
            <li> Aromatherapy is a fantastic practice when you have someone with health issues in your home or around flu season because of the immune support so many of the essential oils give off.</li>
            <li> I enjoy trying different blends and plan on buy more diffusers from Zaq.</li>
            <li> This is a natural and healthy way to fresh up the smell of your house.  </li>
            <li> Find something that&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> On smaller side but puts out nice mist.</li>
            <li> Note that even turning the light off, it emits a slightly blue glow on the top and on/off button.  </li>
            <li> Powerful aroma.</li>
            <li> overall thought is that yes, it does indeed function, but not as effectively as others.</li>
            <li> I love the multiple LED light settings.</li>
            <li> One water fill-up will last 3-4 hours then shuts off on its own.</li>
            <li> Only con is that you don&#x27;t have the option to choose your diffuse times but you could just shut it off on your own.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s been working great and you can dim it sufficiently enough that it doesn&#x27;t interrupt your sleep.</li>
            <li> The top point glows with soft LED lights.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant buying this because of the price, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Someone else wrote that this is the APPLE of diffusers, I agree COMPLETELY, I absolutely love this, and the different light settings.</li>
            <li> and I love it so far.</li>
            <li> only design improvement I can recommend is that even in the no-light mode, the top part of the diffuser is still illuminated, probably from the power switch light, and we have to be strategic where it is in the bedroom</li>
            <li> Effectively distributes over multiple rooms.  </li>
            <li> ~ I used this for several months and then it just kind of collected dust</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very quiet and looks nice in the room.</li>
            <li> use citrus kind of essential oils.</li>
            <li> It also looks nice and have gotten compliments several times.  </li>
            <li> But, my impatience for delicious aromatherapy mist made me plug it in before it was thoroughly dried and it short-circuited as far as I knew.</li>
            <li> Got this product only yesterday and loving it.</li>
            <li> It seems to last about 4 or 5 hours and turns off on its own.</li>
            <li> Liked it enough to buy another.</li>
            <li> Just got it but love it so far.</li>
            <li> Very simple to use and haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully and is small enough that it&#x27;s easy to move around my house if need be.</li>
            <li> The directions were somewhat confusing for someone who has never used a diffuser before, and it would be nice if it came with something suggesting which oils to diffuse, but other than that it is perfect.  </li>
            <li> They run for about two hours and then turn themselves off, which is just right to diffuse the lavender oil and calm the room without overpowering it or making the room too moist.  </li>
            <li> I really like it can change different color light while operation, and most important it really perform its function!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a diffuser, so I can&#x27;t compare to other items, but as it sits next to my bed, I&#x27;m very impressed.  </li>
            <li> Arrived at my door super fast!</li>
            <li> It does go through water pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment quickly and my oil diffuser was packed very well too!  </li>
            <li> this is ok, only runs for about an hour or 2 at the most but is good for small area or office</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use, easy to clean, all the necessary options, will be ordering more for office and friends.  </li>
            <li> and it fills the room with just the right amount of scent.  </li>
            <li> but I cannot even smell the oils when its diffusing unless i am standing right by it with my nose basically in the mist.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of the aroma hits the patients that come to office right away..</li>
            <li> ...just need the right diffuser.</li>
            <li> I received the item right on time.</li>
            <li> the price right</li>
            <li> It puts out just the right amount of mist.</li>
            <li> Received it today and plugged it right in.  </li>
            <li> It puts out the right amount of vapor.</li>
            <li> As soon as you turn this on, you see the mist right away.  </li>
            <li> it never worked right</li>
            <li> My husband and I turn it one right before we go to bed</li>
            <li> That makes it easy to smell whatever new oil</li>
            <li> I love the colors that it changes to and the 3 modes but honestly its just to small for the price unless you are putting it in like a bathroom.</li>
            <li> There is a dim switch that makes it a soft blue glow, but If you could turn the light off completely, this thing would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Nice for a first time use of essential oils.</li>
            <li> I like the modern, clean look.</li>
            <li> The pretty plumes of essential oil &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; is a nice sign its diffusing.</li>
            <li> Great little defuser!</li>
            <li> A little more expensive than i would have liked to pay, but i am nothing but happy with the product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to set-up and to switch from one oil to the next.</li>
            <li> This little guy is just amazing!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for light sleepers (like me).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover a very large area - the living room we have it in is about square feet and connected to our kitchen/dining room (about square feet) by a breezeway.</li>
            <li> The perks are, that it is easy to clean and refill; however it doesn&#x27;t emit as large of a mist as my Young Living one does.</li>
            <li> My children also love that it has a little light, (the light can be turned off).  </li>
            <li> This diffuser works very well and puts out a fine mist which is dispersed over a large area.  </li>
            <li> Colorful, and really spreads the scent throughout my room!</li>
            <li> A gentle, fresh, natural smell wafts around the house - relaxing and even safe for an asthmatic cat.  </li>
            <li> It is a great size for a small bedroom.  </li>
            <li> I only have one issue with it - it would be nice to turn off the light completely while having it still run.</li>
            <li> normally use the tea light candle ones.</li>
            <li> Since I can&#x27;t tolerate any light when I&#x27;m trying to sleep, I was looking for a diffuser with either no light or the ability to shut the light off, which this one is supposedly able to do.  </li>
            <li> Wish it had about more natural of an appearance versus being a hunk of plastic, but it definitely does the trick to diffuse oils :)</li>
            <li> Vapor is nice flow and lasts long...</li>
            <li> I put 2x as many drops and it doesn&#x27;t make the room smell even a quarter as much as the young living diffuser!</li>
            <li> The sound is pleasant though and it producing a lot of mist, though not sure if it really permeates the room.</li>
            <li> Had it been a little larger, it would be perfect.  </li>
            <li> This little machine is very simple to use and works great!</li>
            <li> Even on the least light setting its too bright for my sleeping preference.</li>
            <li> The lamp does get somewhat dim but even then the blue power button is quite bright.</li>
            <li> I clean the top as well by rinsing it with water and letting it dry.</li>
            <li> I liked this so much, I bought a 2nd one for my office.</li>
            <li> Only bummer is that I wish you could operate this without even the &amp;#34;dimmer&amp;#34; light on; I&#x27;m a light sleeper.</li>
            <li> My sister has a Young Living diffuser that seems to really PUSH the vapors out into the air, and the smell circulates better.</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like is the &amp;#34;no light&amp;#34; feature is still blue lol.</li>
            <li> I had considered buying something more expensive, but so happy I went with this 1st.</li>
            <li> even with the light off option there is still light from the blue power button.</li>
            <li> I have several different experensive doterra models but this one is my favorite because it is very easy to refill and diffusers all the liquid.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small, but very effective.</li>
            <li> I have bought two of these, not because one broke, but because I liked my first one so much, I bought a second to place elsewhere in my house.  </li>
            <li> The mister comes with a small measuring-type cup to easily fill the mister which means that both my children (ages 12 and 14) can refill it on their own.  </li>
            <li> I love the last light setting,  just a hint of blue light.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love that I can adjust the light so that one room can have it changing colors and the other room can have it turned off.  </li>
            <li> My children love the cool colors, but we like its quiet and gentle dispersement of our favorite essential oils.</li>
            <li> Feels like a good quality and due to its construction its very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Good little humidifier/oil diffuser.</li>
            <li> Over all a good little diffuser.</li>
            <li> My kids loved the colors changing in the dark!</li>
            <li> Easy to load, easy to use, turns off when empty.</li>
            <li> Super Quiet and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the ability of this tiny little thing!  </li>
            <li> Pretty good little machine.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that when you click 2 times for the light to go &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, it still glows and the power button glows very brightly.  </li>
            <li> we live on an AFB, need to clean out all those toxic chemicals, first.</li>
            <li> There are three light settings -- rotating light color, one light color of your choice, or no light.</li>
            <li> And it operates in complete silence, which is a HUGE bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After almost exactly 6 months, this item stopped working.</li>
            <li> Quiet, efficient, lovely.  </li>
            <li> My only dislike is that the diffuser doesn&#x27;t run more than 2 hours max on one fill.</li>
            <li> Love it and totally recommend.</li>
            <li> I used it once the first week and</li>
            <li> I have been using this diffuser for several months, and I&#x27;ve been pleased with how it works.</li>
            <li> it turns off on its own when empty.</li>
            <li> The 5 droops that is recommended for the ZAQ Noor Milti Color Litemist Aromatherapy looks pretty</li>
            <li> We really like this diffuser!</li>
            <li> I am only able to dim the light.  </li>
            <li> The directions say pretty explicitly not to use citrus blends, but I have been for almost a year with no issues.</li>
            <li> I received this diffuser for Christmas and have used it daily (some days 2-3 times during the course of the day) and love it.  </li>
            <li> Works great but does not last too long.</li>
            <li> We have been using it daily for many months.  </li>
            <li> I have had this diffuser for exactly one year now</li>
            <li> I was in love with this product when I first received it and for a short while thereafter.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t even power on anymore after that first use.</li>
            <li> I prefer stopping it at the red setting when trying to fall asleep as this color is more conducive to sleeping.</li>
            <li> Took a star off because there&#x27;s no option to turn off the light completely.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> When I first opened the box</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even tell I have animals anymore thanks to this miracle worker!</li>
            <li> Maybe this could be aided with a fan or more circulation but its in the same room as our wood stove</li>
            <li> and I absolutely Love the health benefits you get by diffusing essential oils in your home.</li>
            <li> I love all the benefits you get from essential oils with diffusers.</li>
            <li> I have owned 4 different types of diffusers and this one has been my favorite.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I ended up buying 3 more for different rooms of the house.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first one 2 years ago</li>
            <li> (However, if it had a larger tank that would run for a longer period of time it would be better).</li>
            <li> This was my first diffuser</li>
            <li> Worked ok for a short time.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this diffuser until last night when it stopped working.</li>
            <li> It diffuses the essential oils I love, and the scent carries throughout the room.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why we only carry reliable, energy efficient diffusers that include many convenient features.</li>
            <li> This is the first diffuser I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Exactly what anyone would want in an EO diffuser.</li>
            <li> It has options for different colored lights at the top or rotating colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> WORKS EXACTLY</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FIRST DIFFUSER...</li>
            <li> Be aware that even with the &amp;#34;no light&amp;#34; option there is a bit of a glow, so if using this while trying to sleep, that might be an issue for you.</li>
            <li> You fill to the line and put the top back on.  </li>
            <li> and it starts the ultrasonic engine which vibrates the oil and water resulting in a refreshing plume of vapor that carries the essential oil scent throughout the room.  </li>
            <li> When it starts it lights the top changing into different colors as it works.  </li>
            <li> Also definitely more appropriate for small room.</li>
            <li> Want stronger diffusion, more drops of oil,  i do want a bigger ML.</li>
            <li> This is our first Diffuser.</li>
            <li> It feels and looks like a higher quality item than others I have seen on the market.  </li>
            <li> The unit itself is very visually pleasing to the eye, so a bit more in line with &amp;</li>
            <li> And it does throw scent, you just will have to actually use more oil.</li>
            <li> This is my first trying a diffuser like this.</li>
            <li> and my kids love the different color settings.</li>
            <li> I have this on my desk at work with my favorite doTERRA essential oil in it.</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant because it suggested not using any citrus oils in it</li>
            <li> Wish there was a function to turn off light completely</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser purchase, I like it, it works well</li>
            <li> Got this one as a gift for someone and they gave me same gift:)</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty and stays on until it runs out of water.</li>
            <li> when I purchased this product I was under the assumption that the light on it would go out completely as I was placing in my bedroom.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the changing colors in the light-</li>
            <li> I diffuse essential oils all day long and it has been working great, no issues.</li>
            <li> I shut the door to the room I am using it after doubly making sure no cat or dog is in there.</li>
            <li> I like the changing colored lights and use it in my 3 year old&#x27;s room as a night light before bed at times.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Attractive and silent diffuser for permeating your entire house with gentle fragrances that will enhance the mood.  </li>
            <li> Only the top part changes color.</li>
            <li> I love using Essential Oil Diffusers in my home.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li> I was sure to take care of it, didn&#x27;t use any citrus oils, and then it just died suddenly.</li>
            <li> Their moms say they sleep much better with the &amp;#34;breathing&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34; essential oil in the diffuser and go to sleep watching it change colors.</li>
            <li> Do be aware that you can&#x27;t turn all the lights off.  </li>
            <li> The first day I used it, it seemed to work</li>
            <li> But I just personally think that their has to be a much better product on the market than this one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love turning it on with some lavender essential oil when I come home from work.</li>
            <li> I love that it is so quiet.  </li>
            <li> I only wish that it would cover more area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit larger than I thought it would be, but I really love it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased another diffuser that is more esthetically pleasing for the master bedroom for the same cost</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this diffuser!!</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these diffusers and will purchase more in the future for gifts!</li>
            <li> love your changing colours and simple technology.</li>
            <li> Way better than paying for generic deodorizers like glade plug ins or something.  </li>
            <li> , its modern design and soothing colors make it fun for everyone, kids and adults.  </li>
            <li> but I figured I could just purchase another inthe near future since I loved it that much.</li>
            <li> It seems relatively cheaply made, does not hold much water at all, and has to be filled a bit below the fill line to actually start emitting.</li>
            <li> the first time I turned it on.  </li>
            <li> I agree that it works better in smaller rooms/areas.</li>
            <li> We mostly use it in our room (larger, master bedroom).</li>
            <li> Had it exactly 1 day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with amazon prime and it came in exactly when they said it would.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised to say the least--that this cheap plastic diffuser resurrected itself.</li>
            <li> The ZAQ Litemist Aromatherapy works very well!</li>
            <li> And very affordable!</li>
            <li> AND I have no problem with citrus oils;)</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed is that it is more fragrant the first hour that it is used than the rest of the time it runs.</li>
            <li> Also, shipping was amazingly fast!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is too noisy, but it does have a soft whirring sound...</li>
            <li> and I actually did love them while they worked.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd one :)  </li>
            <li> and I really like it!  </li>
            <li> We used it almost every day for the first couple weeks we had it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still working like the first day I bought it.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time buying a diffuser.</li>
            <li> The first time I had it on with some lavender oil for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Since most people don&#x27;t actually read the instructions/fine print, I want to help by letting you know it will ruin your diffuser!</li>
            <li> I use this adorable diffuser nearly daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine that most people are ok with this light near them, but for those that prefer the dark, it would be nice to not have false advertising.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what is says it will - except the &#x27;typical&#x27; run time when filled is even better than listed in the write up.  </li>
            <li> light function, a mild blue glow is still quite visible from the cone.  </li>
            <li> ; however, when the &amp;#34;light off&amp;#34; is activated it is still quite bright as the light does not really go &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; ... it is much brighter than your average night light.</li>
            <li> Although there is a setting to turn off the light, that only applies to main light.  </li>
            <li> but I have used them lightly and as long as I clean it well after use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea to clean it with vinegar once every two weeks -- empty it and clean it like normal, then dry it.</li>
            <li> As long as it is below the line you are fine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the new diffuser and will update after a few more months of use.</li>
            <li> Really gives off for a large room!</li>
            <li> The light puts out a gentle, soft, soothing glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found wiping the inside and top clean after every use removes the smell of the previous oil.  </li>
            <li> It works really well, is quiet and looks better than in the picture.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, and you really do feel relaxed with the lavender (my favorite).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d purchased one as a gift last year and the recipient enjoyed it so much</li>
            <li> It is small but does a pretty good job getting our EO&#x27;s spread into our living room.  </li>
            <li> My first one was defective &amp; I missed return due date by a few days, but excellent customer service took care of that for me!!!</li>
            <li> This is actually the second one of these that I purchased because I loved the first one so much.</li>
            <li> Super small and light and easy to transport.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly to me, there was very little circuitry going on inside.</li>
            <li> 3rd press turns the LED light off (the top part of the cone), but the blue power button remains lit.</li>
            <li> It also has a much lower vapor output than the other 2 diffusers I own.</li>
            <li> The sound is barely audible, but calming.</li>
            <li> At first I was very pleased with the diffuser, but after only two months of receiving, it suddenly stopped working.</li>
            <li> Great way to have natural fragrance by simply adding essential oil.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that when the light is supposed to be off, it still emits a bright blue light that lights up a dark room.</li>
            <li> Even when the light is supposed to be turned off, the light around the power switch is illuminated and shines up through the cone making it have a soft blue glow.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, works well, and I love how it has different color for the LED light.</li>
            <li> I have been using this diffuser pretty much non-stop since the minute it arrived.</li>
            <li> did have to adjust the oil as the first night I put way too much in...</li>
            <li> I wish it had a stronger stream, but for a small room, it does a good job.</li>
            <li> This is good for a small area.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 days straight now and the ZAQ is super easy to use, easy maintenance, and last as long as the description says!  </li>
            <li> The entire will smell fresh and the air Will be clean within minutes!Forget famil chemical like Lysol and Febreeze have</li>
            <li> I looked through many different misters listed on amazon and decided on the ZAQ Noor mainly because of the appearance, the reviews, and the cost.  </li>
            <li> I am really pleased with how quiet the unit it and how steady the mist diffuses through out the room.  </li>
            <li> travel on business frequently and sometimes find myself staying in a less than pleasant smelling motel/inn.</li>
            <li> I just got into essential oils and searched MANY websites to find a diffuser that was rated high and priced pretty reasonably.</li>
            <li> I will say I would have to use more than one in my living room since it&#x27;s very open with high ceilings, so the smell doesn&#x27;t disperse as well.</li>
            <li> Another thing I absolutely love is that it shoots the mist high enough into the air that the area surrounding the unit isn&#x27;t saturated with water.</li>
            <li> My wife originally bought this for herself, and i have actually ended up using it more than her, It has become a nightly regime to do my 3 drops of lavender oil and pass out to the 5 hours of constant relaxing lavender smell in the air</li>
            <li> This is such a cool diffuser!</li>
            <li> Other than my personal preferences, the unit is really very nice and works well.</li>
            <li> Aside from the loose wire, this is a pretty good essential oil diffuser.</li>
            <li> REALLY SPREADS THE SCENT AROUND THE WHOLE FIRST FLOOR.</li>
            <li> Clients and I enjoy the uncompromised properties of the essential oils in the aiv.it works very well!</li>
            <li> The blue light is pretty while I am reading</li>
            <li> The unit is easy to operate and very quiet.</li>
            <li> it is quiet and easy to fill.  </li>
            <li> Easy to add essential oils, just drop them in!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, quiet, seems to do its job well.</li>
            <li> The diffuser easily covers the entire area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, just fill up to the line and drop 4-6 drops of essential oils and let it sooth your worries away!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and almost instantly fills the room with fragrance.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and the kids like seeing the different colors progress.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a couple of these for multiple rooms in my house, and they have been running strong for over 2 months without any loss of vapor production.  </li>
            <li> one has been going strong for a solid two months, twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the changing colors and the option to hold one certain color if desired.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t smell it in a large room.</li>
            <li> I placed it in my family room which is medium to large in size.  </li>
            <li> I by no means have a large apartment and</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Fills a large room with scent.  </li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s pure chance</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t used pure citrus oils</li>
            <li> does not provide aroma for large room.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for a large room.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a diffuser that covers large areas and runs all night, then you should probably look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Pretty shape, nice color changing , functions well , just lasts such a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> use everyday and LOVE!</li>
            <li> Further, it functions very reliably, with easy to understand directions.</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot because it is quiet and easy to use</li>
            <li> Thats why it cost half of what the good diffuser from Young Living costs</li>
            <li> My 20-year-old son already wants this one for his room, so I will be buying him one as well as purchasing a few more for each room of the house!</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s fine, but I was hoping for it to last longer</li>
            <li> This product really works great...pumps out a large amount of  aromatherapy mist literally for hours upon hours without refilling.</li>
            <li> This little mister is amazing...</li>
            <li> This little guy is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Wish this had a little fan in it or something; works well for diffusing oils, but the vapors just kind of drift out and fall.</li>
            <li> Smells nice with the oils- which depending on the quality can use as little as 4-5 drops.</li>
            <li> There is a little pouring cup to brinn water to the diffuser which is nice.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Nice little product.  </li>
            <li> But with this great little product, she can use some essential oils in her room.</li>
            <li> They look the same and better yet, they both do the same exact thing!</li>
            <li> The large led light turns off, however the power switch emits a bright blue light, not good for a bedroom!!</li>
            <li> I do put the diffuser on the floor as the soft blue light is just a little bit more light</li>
            <li> I like this quite a bit - my only complaint is that even when the illumination is off a very bright blue light emits from the power button.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have it above my bed and when filled to the max, it lasts a whole night&#x27;s sleep and doesn&#x27;t turn off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my&lt;br /&gt;Purposes and only uses a few drops of oil.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s fantastic and I use it daily!</li>
            <li> This mister works very well</li>
            <li> 2nd power button press holds the color light (doesn&#x27;t change).</li>
            <li> They couldn&#x27;t even bother to get the logo straight.</li>
            <li> I am hopeful that this will be much appreciated.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish I could change, is that I could shut the light off at night.</li>
            <li> It has been working very well</li>
            <li> and no as to whether or not you&#x27;re really supposed to,</li>
            <li> Really helps with sleeping with the lavender oil.</li>
            <li> I think the modern shape.  </li>
            <li> fantastic water diffuser for essential oils.</li>
            <li> Colors changing as mist comes out and makes it really mistic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stinks up the house real good.</li>
            <li> whatever color it&#x27;s on, and the third time turns the light off whike still diffusing.</li>
            <li> I really like this item.  </li>
            <li> Very bummed.</li>
            <li> The mist is an even one and the light show is definitely a plus.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> A very diluted vinegar wash would work too.</li>
            <li> Really it had been turned on maybe 8-10 times.</li>
            <li> I.e. It won&#x27;t work as a real humidifier.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> I really feel like this device should have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> and I much prefer this one going until it runs out.</li>
            <li> It is more aesthetically pleasing than I expected.</li>
            <li> Provides scent through my whole house.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very relaxing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important not to exceed the fill line or the unit will not work properly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a simple one button control for the misting, light, and power functions.</li>
            <li> Off you tap the button a third time the light goes out and</li>
            <li> I really like this unit...</li>
            <li> She loves putting her essential oils in each night and watching it light up.  </li>
            <li> Just fill it up with 80 ml of water (using the measuring cup it comes with), a few splashes of your favorite essential oil and then enjoy hours of fresh smells.  </li>
            <li> We like the simple look and options for light/no light.</li>
            <li> It fills a bedroom with aroma very well.</li>
            <li> Beyond that point, it works very well and we like it during the day.</li>
            <li> Thanks Mubashir.</li>
            <li> At $49.99, I expected more from this diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed</li>
            <li> That blue light can be quite distracting if you are trying to relax/mediate, etc.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this diffuser with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I really like the color changing feature.</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> While I am not pleased with the manufacturing country, I am very pleased with the way this inexpensive aromatherapy diffuser works.  </li>
            <li> Seems like it runs out too fast for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this, but, wish it operated longer on the amount of water it will hold.  </li>
            <li> and it is very soothing.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> The ZAQ diffuser has been very reliable for us.  </li>
            <li> Much nicer than a candle or Glade Plug-In, as you can change it and use high-quality oils to fill your space.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m in my 20s, and ultrasonic diffusion makes me feel like I&#x27;m living in the future.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It just stays a blue light.</li>
            <li> For me, it is very distracting when trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> They has been putting a different oil up free every week.</li>
            <li> I have money to buy the things I really need.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser -</li>
            <li> and she uses any oil she wants in it</li>
            <li> but I have used blends and it works very well.</li>
            <li> It works very well and lasts four to five hours.</li>
            <li> : even when the light is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; it&#x27;s still very obvious.</li>
            <li> Similar to that of a night light.</li>
            <li> We seem to get rid of colds much faster now.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy it especially when using my oils at night.  </li>
            <li> It is very quiet and really does a nice job of getting the essential oils into the air.  </li>
            <li> I like the shape and it doesn&#x27;t make much noise.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that there is an option to have the light on or off.  </li>
            <li> It really works well</li>
            <li> Definitely for a smaller space, but great just the same.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> It operated very well for 5 days, then the button got stuck in the depressed position and would no longer work.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> for $40, i expected better.</li>
            <li> This diffuser can also gently change pastel colors to add an additional ambiance experiences.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The design looks sleek and modern.</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> and she also said she cannot really feel it.</li>
            <li> It is very quiet and when it consumes the available water with the oils, it turns itself off, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it.  </li>
            <li> I really suspect something.</li>
            <li> Very calming.</li>
            <li> I also love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about water levels because it automatically shuts off when empty.</li>
            <li> is that if I want to switch the oil that is being diffused I have to unplug the whole thing to dump it over the sink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very portable</li>
            <li> This unit is very efficient and mists well.</li>
            <li> For a dimmer night light (larger foot print) order their DEW model.</li>
            <li> The ZAQ returned much of the moisture to the air.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I know its not going to fill up my whole house</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re one who needs darkness to sleep and wants to use this at bedtime this might not be the one for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser 3 days ago and have used it very often.  </li>
            <li> But I do really like the system.</li>
            <li> The unit is petite enough to fit on her nightstand.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it came with a measuring cup for the water which is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I have been using this diffuser for a couple months and it works very well.</li>
            <li> The kids enjoy the lights and how they can change color or be one solid color.  </li>
            <li> It holds so much water that it lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li> There are multiple settings based on your desired light effect.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Appears to be very well made too.</li>
            <li> I love the different colors it puts off , but the green is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Very quite also</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser</li>
            <li> and I really like.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s quiet which is really important to me -</li>
            <li> There is also a blue glow even when the light is off which I can not handle while sleeping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whenever someone is looking for a diffuser for their home, i always send them straight to this very one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I like that there is an option to not only turn the light off, but you can also set it so that one color stays on.</li>
            <li> Used it every night and it works really well for about 8 months.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and the change of lights very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest investing in this diffuser!  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It changes between multiple colors with a light steam-like mist.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I do not get the color options or how to really change it up at all.</li>
            <li> I put a couple of drops of oil in before bed and it turns off after we are fast asleep.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s modern design and the lights that change color.  </li>
            <li> Diffusing helps me so much with mood and energy.</li>
            <li> Not as much now.</li>
            <li> It runs for about 4 hours straight.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li> ; push it another time and the colored light isn&#x27;t displayed; a third time turns it off.</li>
            <li> Although the light does dim, it will not turn off without turning the diffuser completely off.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser prior I had a young living diffuser and it had stopped working</li>
            <li> Buy if you want an effective diffuser with almost no sound.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an essential oil enthusiast and own multiple diffusers.</li>
            <li> After a few flick/taps of my finger on the side of the diffuser to get the fan going since it seemed to stop on its own</li>
            <li> Bought this as an early Christmas present and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quiet and love the soft lights.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this little diffuser as we love it!</li>
            <li> Quite amazed at this small product, it more than adequately diffuses any scent you insert.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to transport and the water lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The other thing I love about it is the modern look and the rainbow changing colors.</li>
            <li> Put more VERY few drops or you will be overwhelmed quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love pygmy a little lavandar and rose oil in the diffuser in the evenings for a teaching scent that helps me destress and wind down after my day.</li>
            <li> (A more subtle light) for sleeping.</li>
            <li> As I stated in my original post, I only used the unit twice before it stopped working.</li>
            <li> But other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li> As for me, if it did a bigger area I would LOVE it, if I wanted it for a small area I would LOVE it, but I wanted it for my bedroom which is 22 X 26</li>
            <li> Purchasing more for other spaces.</li>
            <li> I researched many diffusers for my 1st purchase and I chose this one due to the ratings and cost.</li>
            <li> Most of my other diffusers hold about 200ml of water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be adding a couple more of them to other rooms in the house soon.</li>
            <li> Its ok, but if you are looking for a efficient diffuser that disperses the oil/water into the air I would look at other options.</li>
            <li> It only dims the initial light and leaves a very dim light.</li>
            <li> It is a great size, not too big or small.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean, small, works great,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ZAQ Noor Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser has a cool , modern look to it.  </li>
            <li> Loving this little thing!</li>
            <li> I guess the only thing is the button to turn it on is a little on a bright side comparing to the light element above it.</li>
            <li> This will not work for anyone who is sensitive to light when trying to fall asleep, and blue light especially is not helpful-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too big, has a quiet, soothing sound and does exactly what it needs to do!</li>
            <li> It also works as a good spot to diffuse throughout the whole downstairs and even a little bit upstairs (open floorplan, highceilings/catwalk ).</li>
            <li> I use mine frequently and it is still going strong 9 months later.</li>
            <li> So although it doesn&#x27;t have a super long range for the scent, it does still freshen the whole house!</li>
            <li> The light is never completely off.</li>
            <li> I do however recommend that when the unit shuts off automatically because its empty, make sure you use a towel or rag to completely clean it out and dry it.</li>
            <li> We have run two of these every day for almost a year and they have functioned perfectly every time which is a lot more than can be said about the various other diffusers we have tried, including some two to three times as expensive.</li>
            <li> It diffuses oils nicely and fills a small bedroom with scent.</li>
            <li> So far I really like it!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind them, but usually turn them off (which is a nice option).</li>
            <li> The top cone glows blue, not as blue as the other setting, but brighter than many night lights for children&#x27;s rooms.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Put a few drops of oil in, depending on the fragrance, and fill with water to line/groove and just push power button on, it&#x27;s that easy!</li>
            <li> It even comes with a little measuring cup that makes adding the appropriate amount of water much easier.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is you can&#x27;t use citrus scents, but there are plenty of other great essential oils out there!</li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy - damp cloth/paper towel and a Q-Tip for the ceramic disc in the center.</li>
            <li> Also, if you do purchase make sure to save the box they arrive in because it&#x27;s an odd sized box</li>
            <li> It arrived as expected and was easy to set up.</li>
            <li> Automatically shuts off and super quiet.</li>
            <li> In the last 2 years I have been pleased with the results with using essential oils.</li>
            <li> One reviewer in particular said they could &amp;</li>
            <li> It is quiet making at most a very low hum, but nothing that we have found to be of any consequence.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that doesn&#x27;t shut off at night and is able to continue to the next day, you may want to consider something larger.  </li>
            <li> The Zaq Noor Multicolor Diffuser holds 80ml of water and is on the smaller side of my diffuser collection, but puts off more mist than some of my much larger models.</li>
            <li> This particular seller does NOT accept returns</li>
            <li> The only way to not have light coming from the diffuser is to turn it completely off.</li>
            <li> The unit is mostly whisper quiet and you won&#x27;t hear it running except for a very occasional water trickle.</li>
            <li> It is now the unit we use for the main area of the house.</li>
            <li> I wanted it mainly for my baby room at night while she sleeps</li>
            <li> (there is an option to have no colorful lights) and the sound of the thing working is peaceful to me.</li>
            <li> Instead it is a dim blue light.</li>
            <li> I think this particular design is space-efficient and almost tip-proof.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that it puts out as much mist as it does.</li>
            <li> feature- light can be on (single color), changing colors, or off.</li>
            <li> I will say that in the future I will be looking for a bigger size diffuser from this brand because other than the size its very nice</li>
            <li> Just started using essential oils, and this is a great small atomizer!</li>
            <li> The night setting, which I thought meant it didn&#x27;t have any light at all is actually a really dark blue light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sending it back because it is very pretty.</li>
            <li> She normally is not bothered by light when sleeping...</li>
            <li> The white one is very pretty with the lights gradually changing</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t travel far but it&#x27;s good enough for an average sized bedroom.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil diffuser, i just received my ZAQ today and its been on for 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and I have even given some as gifts.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of all the really high ratings on the product.  </li>
            <li> and I have tall ceilings in the kitchen and sky high in he living room.</li>
            <li> I thought it was high time</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> As described, highly recommended .</li>
            <li> It can be set to nightlight mode which is a pleasant dark blue light, or you can hold it on any of the other colors, however there is not a setting to turn the lights off completely, which I would like for nighttime use.</li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be, and even though it is a pleasant little product, it does not live up to the advertised claim.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pro&#x27;s are that its small, the colors are vivid and fade really nicely</li>
            <li> I think the oil floats at the top, gets used in the first hour or two, and then in the second half it runs without diffusing much scent at all.</li>
            <li> I wish it held a little more water</li>
            <li> It lasts a little more than an hour.</li>
            <li> faf14f6c9f38b2234b586025537e1553]]This is a cute little diffuser.</li>
            <li> this is a lovely little machine -</li>
            <li> I fits pretty much any décor and I particularly like the alternating colors displayed while it is running (there are options to display only one color or no color at all as well).</li>
            <li> It does not seem to put out as strong of an aroma as my other diffusers, but it is satisfactory.</li>
            <li> the other one is still going strong.</li>
            <li> However, the light never really turns off.</li>
            <li> I can turn it on at night (and use it as a night light) and it automatically shuts off when it is empty.</li>
            <li> Great value and works just as well as expensive ones.</li>
            <li> So far it is working really well.</li>
            <li> But if you plan to use it when you sleep and if you really need complete darkness to sleep, this is not the diffuser for you.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll need to diffuse a few more &amp;#34;tranquility&amp;#34; oils with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a powerful yet silent diffuser that works.</li>
            <li> I put in a few drops of oil &amp; water and once it is turned on, you can see the vapor coming out of the top immediately.  </li>
            <li> It amplifies  the scent by blowing out belong the normal range...</li>
            <li> Cheaper ones have worked better for me than this on, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> thats normal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every night for the last few weeks now and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Quiet and fun</li>
            <li> This was my first time dealing with the whole Essential Oil thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of fun choosing which essential oils to use each time you fire it up.  </li>
            <li> While I get a good whiff of my oils in my small bedroom, I doubt it would work as well in a larger setting.  </li>
            <li> i would like two more for around my house, but i think i am going to get a few himalayan salt lamps-</li>
            <li> So technically I cannot write any useful review on it</li>
            <li> Overall I feel this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I could use lemon in the evening and lavender the next morning and each scent would be distinct.  </li>
            <li> And now Amazon is saying it can&#x27;t be returned, which is frustrating for a Prime Member who expects good service.</li>
            <li> Fills the room with a nice and refreshing scent that really clears my sinuses when I&#x27;m sick.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this may be one of my all time favorite gifts that I have ever received!</li>
            <li> and the nice small size!</li>
            <li> It holds 80ml and is plenty large enough for my large living room or could even go well in my office or bedroom.</li>
            <li> Everytime it is turned on, it immediately turns itself right back off.</li>
            <li> I am using a stress reliever essential oil blend right now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s right next to my bed</li>
            <li> perhaps ours is defective, perhaps we&#x27;re not following the directions right</li>
            <li> You get a high quality product that will make your home more comfortable for years without expensive part</li>
            <li> Running this long, the diffuser becomes very hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Have just gotten into the young living essential oils and was really anxious to fill the house with some healing, feel good scents.  </li>
            <li> It is a little noisy, so not great at night, but otherwise, works just perfectly!</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter is LOVING this little diffuser we bought her.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it, especially considering the economic price!</li>
            <li> I am ordering a new diffuser tonight.</li>
            <li> They immediately allowed for me to receive a new one and return the defective one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the new one for a while now</li>
            <li> New Age for me.  </li>
            <li> I think it was used and abused and sent as new................</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> so I will have to live with it as it is.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t compare with other diffusers as this is our first essential oil diffuser, but this one seems to be doing just fine - and it is used every day.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it just keeps running and running for many many hours despite the fact that the chamber is empty of water and it is just filled with steam, quite scary!</li>
            <li> I had filled it with the pitcher that came with it and was very careful not to overfill and it still stopped working.</li>
            <li> I can see mist coming out of the diffuser and can smell the oil if my nose is right above the diffuser or very close but can barely feel any smell in the room.</li>
            <li> Turning the light off just changes the color to a different shade of blue.  </li>
            <li> Entire room filled with essential oil with mood lighting based on preference.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this diffuser and changing the different oils around to obtain different results.</li>
            <li> I like to set the color on red at night so that the blue light doesn&#x27;t keep us awake.  </li>
            <li> Quiet enough to use while kids are sleeping and the dimming light feature is a plus.</li>
            <li> , the only thing I dislike about it, is that the light stays on the entire time.  </li>
            <li> (I had to have the heat on constantly to keep my room warm but that dried my throat out.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;ll primarily be using this in a smaller space and don&#x27;t mind it running several hours, then this is the diffuser for you.</li>
            <li> Overall it seems like cheap chinese made piece that although works for now, I have doubts it will stay in working condition.    </li>
            <li> Love this little think!</li>
            <li> I still love this little diffuser!</li>
            <li> Love this little thing!</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the setting for &#x27;no light&#x27; really stays a dim blue, which is fine if you want a night light, but I find it distracting.  </li>
            <li> My only wish is that it had a &amp;#34;no light&amp;#34; option, as even the dark blue light is too much light for my bedroom at night</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  </li>
            <li> The first diffuser I&#x27;ve ever purchased, as I&#x27;m new to the world of essential oils.</li>
            <li> It works well, is easy to use and will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> The unit is small and easy to operate, and gives scent to my whole bedroom (about 12x12).  </li>
            <li> However, it needs to be cleaned after each use since most of the oil stays in the machine even after the water is diffused out (and yes, I used the recommended amount and not more).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you need the light to turn off completely, but other than that</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first diffuser, so I would definitely recommend it for a first-timer.</li>
            <li> We used it for the FIRST time last night...and the wifey had to get up and turn it off</li>
            <li> and it is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> I just bought and am using my 2nd if this exact model.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We use it in our small living room to add a more zen like feel to our room.</li>
            <li> First time ever using such a thing.</li>
            <li> So when I diffuse as I am falling asleep in a dark room, there is still some light.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an essential oil diffuser</li>
            <li> And love how small and portable it is</li>
            <li> My son loves it, so far!</li>
            <li> It only goes for 4 hours before it automatically shuts off, but the oil you put in it really makes a difference!</li>
            <li> It needs to be a small room for you to be able to smell the oils diffusing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually going to return that one and purchase this one for the master bedroom as well because it is so much easier to use!  </li>
            <li> works great just as expected and fun to watch when bored</li>
            <li> I even said &#x27;wow!&#x27;</li>
            <li> The only thing you should be aware of before you purchase this item is that you can&#x27;t (not recommended to)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alive!</li>
            <li> Love how small and compact it is, wish it had a feature to not use lights.</li>
            <li> OK for a small rooom.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, I cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> Use high quality essential oil and it&#x27;ll make a big difference in bringing some calm to a high stress work environment.</li>
            <li> But a month ago, I decided to deep clean it and left it drying.</li>
            <li> This little machine puts out a powerful, consistent steam.</li>
            <li> My little 3 year old has been having sleeping problems, and this mixed with a little Woolzies Lavender essential oil is a perfect combo we&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> It does go through the water pretty quickly, but since I have never owned another diffuser, I am not sure if this is normal</li>
            <li> One of them works great and the other one died, which I only had a few months.</li>
            <li> It was brand new in box and sealed so it is clearly a manufacturing defect.  </li>
            <li> The strength of the scent is great; it may seem subtle if you turn it on and stay in the room, but the minute you walk out and come back in, you will definitely notice the smell.</li>
            <li> the dim is still too light for me to use at night in a dark room to sleep.</li>
            <li> It has a cool &amp;#34;light changing&amp;#34; feature that allows it to rotate through several different colors.</li>
            <li> There is no way to completely turn off the light without shutting down the unit.  </li>
            <li> This little diffuser works just fine</li>
            <li> and I love how simple it is to clean it (both the base and top).  </li>
            <li> It is extremely quiet and the light settings has s very pleasing setting for a dark room.</li>
            <li> Soooo if you want to use this in an area bigger than 8 X 10 I would say don&#x27;t bother... good for a small bathroom but not anything bigger...</li>
            <li> blue light won&#x27;t disturb your sleep, or if you are using it other than bedtime, I highly recommend this diffuser.</li>
            <li> The diffuser gets very hot on the outside which makes me worry about the potential for fire</li>
            <li> I taped a piece of heavy cardstock over the button and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> If you need a diffuser for a living room or large area I would get a larger sized diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Works very quietly, and oil Is well spread throughout even large rooms.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know these types of oil diffusers existed and was just using the little oil burner with a tea light.  </li>
            <li> I thought it might look a little cheap &amp; clunky, it doesn&#x27;t, at all.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d recommend placing it on a hard surface or on top of a cloth.</li>
            <li> I love this little dude!!</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT WITH A COLD, FLU SEASON,</li>
            <li> This cold water diffuser is great.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the on and off button continually glows a bright blue.  </li>
            <li> It has helped greatly in our overall health as well as helping get our difficult sleepers to bed.</li>
            <li> Clearly there is a problem with this machine, but the manufactur does nothing to improve the quality.  </li>
            <li> I put Frankincense in mine to clear my thinking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Young Living Oils and although I received a diffuser from them in my initial order I don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li> Very calming and quiet.</li>
            <li> I use this with either Doterra or Young Living oils.</li>
            <li> and so I expected a better performance out of this more expensive diffuser.</li>
            <li> Like this diffuser so much, bought a second one.</li>
            <li> I have a Spa Vapor and this product does not perform nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> It does not distribute the scents nearly the distance or for the lenght of time as the Spa Vapor.</li>
            <li> It fills my office with the essential oil scent, but if I use it in my family room or bedroom, it has to be very close to where I&#x27;m sitting for me to notice the scent.</li>
            <li> I really like the automatic shutoff when the water level gets low, which means I can turn this on and fall asleep and it will shut off for me.</li>
            <li> But when I turn it on now it makes a really loud noise and no longer diffuses and releases the particles.</li>
            <li> There was a very helpful site that did comparisons of various aromatic diffusers and the ZAQ Noor brand</li>
            <li> and you have a choice of having the light change colors or leave on one color or have no light at all.  </li>
            <li> We got this for our daughter for Christmas, and she used it ONCE before it completely quit working.</li>
            <li> I debated purchasing it, wondering if I really needed such an item.</li>
            <li> So far it is working well.</li>
            <li> That one did not produce as much scent using the same amount of</li>
            <li> There is a dim setting</li>
            <li> and here&#x27;s the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s thus far:</li>
            <li> but I was actually pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This diffuser has a clearly marked fill line.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and my whole family loves the way the house smells now.</li>
            <li> So far no problems.</li>
            <li> I really like the sleek design and the fact that it is low maintenance.  </li>
            <li> Changes colors &amp; turns off to dim.</li>
            <li> We use this in a massage setting in a professional office.</li>
            <li> You can essentially dim it, but you cant get rid of it all together.</li>
            <li> But it works well and runs completely silent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> do find that the scent doesn&#x27;t last the whole time the diffuser is running.</li>
            <li> The diffusing mechanism appeared to be working (the water at the bottom was being agitated), but no mist developed.  </li>
            <li> Two oils we use frequently are lavender and peppermint.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and is relatively quiet.</li>
            <li> Not silent, but very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use citrus frequently and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> But now it has stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li> So far (used about a month)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that 80ml of water lasts for about 4 hours.  </li>
            <li> I hope the product continues to work as well as it has so far.  </li>
            <li> Considering ordering an additional one if it continues to hold up well to frequent use.</li>
            <li> So far no issues.  </li>
            <li> It used to run completely out between 4-6 hours.  </li>
            <li> Mist goes directly into the air</li>
            <li> I tried contacting th company, Zaq directly, but never received a response.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old loves the changing color feature.  </li>
            <li> Simple modern design.  </li>
            <li> The colors change very gradually, and when you find a color you like you can just press and hold the power button for a second to have it stay on that</li>
            <li> It has one speed, holds nearly 10oz of water and will run for about 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My friend has the Young Living version</li>
            <li> I have young living oil.</li>
            <li> I was used to the young living diffuser</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase a diffuser because of so many negative reviews...</li>
            <li> Balance by Doterra and Acceptance by Young living.  </li>
            <li> simple and modern.</li>
            <li> one stopped working/not evaporating the water completely.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really sensitive to noise when sleeping.</li>
            <li> If you want complete darkness, this is not for you...</li>
            <li> It diffuses our essential oils into the whole room and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait before writing a review until I had used it frequently.</li>
            <li> but you can turn it off completely.</li>
            <li> No problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> It has optional alternating lights, light selection, and no light options.  </li>
            <li> And my 7 month old grandson loves the changing colors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is an OLD trailer.</li>
            <li> Now I had read a few reviews saying people had problems with this unit, but overall people were satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really disappointing because I loved it so much and even bought another as a gift and now every time I use it</li>
            <li> After trying every kind of freshener out there, and tired of chemically odor, I tried this.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item and loved it -- for 4 months of periodic use -- but then it randomly quit working.  </li>
            <li> I have Fibromyalgia and aromatherapy is helpful with the symptoms and this diffuser is as good as the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Small, compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I only gave two stars due to the fact that the light does not turn off as the description states.</li>
            <li> It always leaked, even when it was half full, but I just put it on a plate and kept using it.  </li>
            <li> like someone else said, about the size of a large toilet paper roll.</li>
            <li> I purchased mainly based on price and average reviews for my first diffuser, and the ZAQ Noor 80ML did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Other than that, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> so there is no mess.</li>
            <li> I had this on 24 hrs a day when I first bought it for a few months and now use it only at night until I purchase more for other rooms.</li>
            <li> Wish there was a way to have it run with a more subtle power indicator.</li>
            <li> However, there is a slight blue light so it may disturb some individuals&#x27; sleep if they are sensitive.</li>
            <li> We rinse it after every use, and about once a week let some vinegar sit in it for a few hours to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors are cool, it shuts itself off when it&#x27;s empty, no white residue on surroundings, and it makes the room</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a small, simple diffuser it is ok.</li>
            <li> I will leave more feedback (if I remember) in a few months to see how it holds up long term</li>
            <li> I ended up setting the color to red and then wrapping a small towel around it leaving a hole on the top for the goodies to escape.</li>
            <li> It comes with a top which lifts off exposing a small reservoir into which go the water and the drops of essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Its shape is reminiscent of a small volcano with the vapors rising from the top.</li>
            <li> Even when you turn them &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; the cone glows a dark blue and the button puts out a LOT of light in darkness.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quiet when it runs and the steam covers a decent area.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of water, a few drops of essential oil... and my entire living room smells great.</li>
            <li> The lights can be a nice effect and there is the option of turning them off as well (although the little blue light behind the button never turns off unless the machine is off)</li>
            <li> What I love about it is that ALL the oil (floating on top) is gone after a while, leaving only clear water behind, whereas with other white plastic diffusers, this is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;i also like how the button controls are all on the front.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disagreeing with the other commentators, but essentially, it&#x27;s pretty much the same thing as a humidifier.</li>
            <li> I use this in my high school math classroom with peppermint essential oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted an Essential Oil Diffuser and highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a low or high setting instead of just one.</li>
            <li> quiet with a slight, comforting sound.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve run it at least once everyday for a few weeks now and its working perfect for me</li>
            <li> I thought and doesn&#x27;t hold that much water which means it wont run long</li>
            <li> Last several horrs and covers a large area.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my saks and is small enough that is not noticeable enough but it fills up my entire office of a nice scent.</li>
            <li> It actually LOOKS like apple came and designed a pretty little spherical pyramid with soft pretty lights, with multiple color options.</li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils and didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton on a diffuser.</li>
            <li> But there isn&#x27;t really a setting where you can have it on without a light which was frustrating with my newborn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly easy to use and even held up well to a clumsy handed drop.</li>
            <li> I should emphasize that even when you select no light, there is a dimmed blue light so some may find this distracting in a bedroom at night when sleeping.</li>
            <li> I have it in a 600 sq ft apartment, fills the living room area very well, doesn&#x27;t reach the bedroom so much, faintly, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> It offers an array of lights, 3 modes (i.e. rotate color, fixed color, low-light), and there is only one piece or &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; to remove when you add oil.  </li>
            <li> It quiet, you can hear a little motor sound, but I sleep with it by my head, so it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Although this is a Christmas gift, so has not been put to the real test, I love the many benefits of these cold air diffusers!!</li>
            <li> students are obsessed with it and love the way it smells and looks!</li>
            <li> Is a little loud but the sound is similar to a white noise machine which I sleep with every night so the noise is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> It is about the height and diameter of a large double sized toilet paper roll.  </li>
            <li> first one is strictly white, the second goes through an array of colors and the third is a soft dimmed blue.  </li>
            <li> Cheap diffuser that hardly fills the room with any smell.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s small and can go anywhere from a small spot on the floor to a large desk.  </li>
            <li> I do wish the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button didn&#x27;t have such a blinding blue light on it; it detracts from the color changing a little bit.</li>
            <li> The sage essential oil I put (high quality, Aura Cacia) is barely noticeable and doesn&#x27;t have that same pureness to</li>
            <li> will most likely buy another one from this same company if it is as quiet and a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> Being able to turn the light off is why I chose this one, so I am disappointed with the product.  </li>
            <li> It also only has the one color in the form of 2 led&#x27;s that clearly show through the plastic.  </li>
            <li> (I usually turn the light off on mine when I sleep, although it does have a tiny glow still.)</li>
            <li> My husband surprised me with this last year for Christmas.</li>
            <li> It also apparently does not have the ability to change the color as well.  </li>
            <li> We had a Young Living diffuser for several years and were used to having a two to three hour diffuse time.</li>
            <li> It was just barely hanging on.</li>
            <li> I feel like it doesn&#x27;t push the steam/oil out far enough</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews I decided to purchase this diffuser to use in my bedroom with my Young Living essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Barely noticeable at during the day,  but glowing at night.  </li>
            <li> It does give off a soft blue glow in &amp;#34;night mode&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not bothersome to me.</li>
            <li> I felt like I had to move it a bit closer to me than the Young Living diffuser to have the same effect.  </li>
            <li> Early Christmas present for my wife.</li>
            <li> We have purchased two of these for our two young granddaughters who seem to have numerous colds.  </li>
            <li> It also arrived much quicker than expected and got here in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A couple of cons for now:&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;light off&amp;#34; function doesn&#x27;t shut completely, there is still a blue glow and illuminates part of the area.&lt;br /&gt;No battery option, you need to plug it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use my Young Living essential oils with them and it works well, haven&#x27;t had any issues with it yet.</li>
            <li> It is small, cool shaped, and diffuses the smell well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> The essential oils are very well defused, and also it add some humidity to a dry room.</li>
            <li> I love that you can have your choice of white, green, red, pink, purple, yellow, or blue light or all of the lights cycling through, OR NO LIGHT</li>
            <li> This was my first aromatherapy diffuser, and I&#x27;ve had it since July 2014 (about half a year as of this writing).  </li>
            <li> From red to blue or green or purple or orange and even yellow, there is a corresponding light tone for any mood.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, the aroma is not very strong (just right).</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews about this diffuser I was skeptical , but this is a great little diffuser.</li>
            <li> so much so that I have purchased three of them, either for myself or as gifts for other people.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that there is always a light emitted.  </li>
            <li> It knocks the socks off of my more expensive Young Living diffuser.</li>
            <li> No complaints and it&#x27;s been run nearly every day, sometimes multiple times daily.</li>
            <li> A second time to hold on the color of my preference, a 3rd time to dim the lights and a 4th time to turn the unit off.</li>
            <li> I have a well known more expensive brand (Young Living) and this is quite comparable in getting the job done.  </li>
            <li> The aromatherapy aspect is nice, but, given its small size, does nothing to add moisture to even a small room.</li>
            <li> Too bad because other than that, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> This would be a great machine for a small room like a bedroom but not great for larger living spaces unless you have a fan running constantly.</li>
            <li> Not really meant for such a large room, but students can smell the scent when they enter the room through the door in the opposite corner.</li>
            <li> i keep it right next to my bed and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that you cannot actually turn the light off and if you&#x27;re using it at night it will still illuminate the room.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that even with the lights off, there is still a noticeable blue light when I use this at night.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that even with the &amp;#34;lights off&amp;#34; option, there is still quite a lot of blue light coming from the power button.</li>
            <li> only problem is that, the &amp;#34;lights off&amp;#34; option does not actually turn the light off... at least not all the way.</li>
            <li> The only other diffuser I can compare it to is one I saw in Whole Foods which was basically a squat cylinder.</li>
            <li> It will also start to mold if not aired out frequently</li>
            <li> This has been run daily  (some days multiple times a day) with Young Living Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely quiet and you barely can hear it running.</li>
            <li> It is extremely quiet and you barely can hear it running.</li>
            <li> you could smell the scents, then I did the second time again and it  barely mist, Then it just doesn&#x27;t mist out.</li>
            <li> Diffuses well, however the mist is pretty heavy</li>
            <li> I had this downstairs in the kitchen for the first few months</li>
            <li> I had problems with this the first few times I had it and put it away......</li>
            <li> which can be very hazardous especially if anyone in your home suffers from asthma (I recommend wiping out the unit with a paper towel and leaving open to dry after every use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other issue I have had is that it&#x27;s hard to clean out one scent before putting in a new one.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day to diffuse mainly doTerra lavender oil.</li>
            <li> of warning: if you are lucky enough to find blends that aren&#x27;t selling their specific company oils remember this is a small unit.</li>
            <li> with the decor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong the unit does indeed work, but I found out after actually going out on a limb and buying the smaller Daisy that it does not throw scent very well(my primary reason for purchase) and hence my three star.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s much easier to take care of than previous diffusers.</li>
            <li> Area around it stayed dry so far.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it uses water to diffuse the oils rather than felt pads like my previous diffuser.</li>
            <li> it is supposed to go into a no-light mode,  What really happens is that the dark blue lights are on.  </li>
            <li> I actually like it better than my other one that costed at least double.</li>
            <li> and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It seems to be the right size for the room, not sure how it would do in a larger space.</li>
            <li> When I tried a less expensive oil it was not as good.</li>
            <li> Had a little trouble with the adapter, but is working fine now.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t get too little or too much.</li>
            <li> Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;But a little noise.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price (I paid a little under $40).</li>
            <li> I really like this little diffuser.</li>
            <li> the essential oils that I have purchased from Amazon, work really well in this little device, just set it up at bed time and forget it, has auto shut off</li>
            <li> Loved having this next to me with some eucalyptus oil when I was sick.</li>
            <li> My wife only uses distilled water in the units and no citrus essential oils, so we&#x27;re a bit disappointed that while trying to take good care of the unit, it simply decided one day to not work.</li>
            <li> main critique, is that you can&#x27;t turn the lights completely off at night (at least that&#x27;s what my wife told me).</li>
            <li> place near paper or other items that might suffer humidity damage</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see other people state that it is overpriced.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is pretty quiet other then a little bit of bubbling from the water being diffused.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect to put next to the bed when someone is sick with a little eucalyptus or on a shelf for any room that could use a little freshening or if you need a perk.</li>
            <li> The diffuser has been used in both large and small rooms and has done well.  </li>
            <li> but I have tried it in three separate rooms and its just to small for anything other than the bathroom to really make a difference as far as aromatherapy goes.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as small as it looks either, it is the size of a large roll of toilet paper, like the jumbo size.  </li>
            <li> The benefit of diffusing eucalyptus and peppermint oil in the wintertime along with it putting a small amount of moisture in the air makes breathing through your nose in the morning much easier.</li>
            <li> so it sits flat on surface).</li>
            <li> and hopefully it will be last long</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> then I have in a long time, definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I do use it with those blends knowing that my diffuser may not last as long as it should.  </li>
            <li> so the device does not sit flat on my table, it&#x27;s tilted because of the connector.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to give this 5 stars because it only does a very small area, however it does exactly as I was told it would do.</li>
            <li> I hope it will last a LONG time!</li>
            <li> I have only used pure essential oils in it and followed all other directions (used filtered water, I avoided citrus essential oils, and I never filled it with water past the line,) yet still, my power button got completely stuck one day.</li>
            <li> It is easy to fill and add oils to, and has worked without fail.  </li>
            <li> My husband, who is quite handy with electronics and fixing circuit boards, said it was impossible to fix.  </li>
            <li> the water seems to dry up within a very short period of time.</li>
            <li> At the same time I spent LOTS of money on essential oils too.</li>
            <li> This is a diffuser for essential oils however the directions clearly state do not use citrus oils as it will destroy the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> The led lamp will glow and slowly change cycling thru the different colors.it&#x27;s very calming and lights the room with a relaxing glow.</li>
            <li> The two downfalls are not being able to use citrus oils in it due to the possibility of negatively affecting the functionality of the unit and the unit only holding a small amount of fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a single issue and I&#x27;ve been using mine daily for 5 months.</li>
            <li> I do not use this everyday, but after I bad week of pollen and then rain, it was nice to diffuse some respire from Sparks Natural to help with my wheezing from the pollen!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both much less expensive more generic diffusers</li>
            <li> I am pretty seriously considering buying another, though, in case this was a fluke.</li>
            <li> , I am a little leary about citrus because of all the reviews, but so far I haven not had any problems with diffusing citrus.  </li>
            <li> I like the way this diffuses, but I wish they didn&#x27;t blatantly lie about the light off function.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually darker if I stop it on the dark red color than if I run it on the lights off mode.</li>
            <li> My only tiny complaint is that I wish it had a &amp;#34;light completely off&amp;#34; setting.</li>
            <li> This works for as long as the reservoir of water lasts, maybe 2 hours?</li>
            <li> AND IT DOESN&#x27;T TAKE LONG TO FRAGRANCE THE ROOM.</li>
            <li> We use this all day long.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t run for as long as you would like for it to.</li>
            <li> Throwing the entire thing away seems like such a waste to me... low-quality electronic gadgets is a big pet peeve of mine!</li>
            <li> It does turn off automatically after a few hours of use and complete evaporation of the water and EO mixture.</li>
            <li> It swirls a continuous stream of fragrant air and lasts a long time before needing to be refilled.</li>
            <li> It runs for for several hours &amp; has an auto shut off when it gets empty.</li>
            <li> and I want to see how long it lasts</li>
            <li> it would but still runs for a few hours giving of a soft scent.</li>
            <li> It will stay on as long as it has water</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems so far and have been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> We will see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday for at least 2 full cycles.</li>
            <li> I find that useful for cleaning so that I don&#x27;t have to reach behind my night stand and unplug from the wall every time.</li>
            <li> It puts out way too much mist and almost makes my bedroom look like it&#x27;s thick with smoke.  </li>
            <li> It typically lasts about 3-4 hours and we use it multiple times daily.</li>
            <li> I spent a fortune on Young Living and it broke in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> Their diffusers are much more expensive and less</li>
            <li> Prior to it&#x27;s demise, even with the adequate water and oil ratio, it would randomly stop emitting mist with the motor still running.</li>
            <li> We live in a small place.</li>
            <li> I bought some Clementine essential oil on Barefut the other day.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is the size (I&#x27;d like it a little bit bigger) and</li>
            <li> It is only a little larger than my hand.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is you can&#x27;t put it on wood due to the nature of this product.</li>
            <li> (The other brand is NOW which I bought on impulse locally.</li>
            <li> I notice that it isnt as efficient as my other diffuser from an essential oil company, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Small, modern works well, been using it every night for the last few months.</li>
            <li> I was very careful not to use citrus essential oils which the instructions say is a no</li>
            <li> but I feel like 5-6 months isn&#x27;t very long for it to already need replacing.</li>
            <li> Seriously, who wants to breathe candle wick smoke anyway?</li>
            <li> The light on the &amp;#34;on-off&amp;#34; switch is also visable through the light dome and is VERY annoying when trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> I unplugged it and let it dry out over night and</li>
            <li> I only wipe it out when I&#x27;m changing scents, or about every 3rd use, or if it&#x27;s been sitting for a few days with stagnant water in it.</li>
            <li> I made the decision to start using it daily, especially when I&#x27;m working (I am a Life Coach, so there can tend to be a lot of heavy energy; I thought the diffuser would help me with that,)</li>
            <li> I like that you have the options of changing colors, a single color, or no color at all.  </li>
            <li> There are settings that allow for the user to set a single color or to turn off the lights altogether.  </li>
            <li> I can push the single button to turn it on and begin this cycle.</li>
            <li> It works but it is not powerful enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> One recent review complained it didn&#x27;t smell either didn&#x27;t put any essential oil (EO) in it, not enough or not quality EO.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small water reservoir does require frequent refilling....</li>
            <li> The wire that was soldered onto the power supply circuit board was extremely loose.</li>
            <li> like the way that with just a little water and some oil, it seems to last for a long time and that it shuts off when it&#x27;s out.</li>
            <li> It is small, quiet and simple to use.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for but sadly after only using it for a month it stopped working.</li>
            <li> (cinnamon essential oil at the holidays, other blends for other occasions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Small, so for me it only lasts about 3 hours before I have to refill with water, as I said it is smaller which I wanted</li>
            <li> the scented mist is relaxing and less abrasive that a wall plugin, for example - but my machine broke after only several uses in less than a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the ZAQ Noor for a little over a week every night at bedtime to diffuse doTERRA essential oils.</li>
            <li> Would like the product to have a little larger reservoir so it can run all night, but it does work well.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> It makes just enough &amp;#34;white noise&amp;#34; to soothe little ones to sleep.</li>
            <li> Well we&#x27;ve had this little guy running off and on for several days now</li>
            <li> ;  Based on that review I was expecting a teeny tiny little thing.  </li>
            <li> I think the area was just too big for this little device.  </li>
            <li> I went and found this little gem which we&#x27;ve had now for several months</li>
            <li> A solid little unit that works like a champ.</li>
            <li> However, in December of this year, just a little over a year after it was purchased (and of course when the warranty no longer applies) it stopped working entirely.</li>
            <li> #2 Hard to get an old scent out.</li>
            <li> I feel like the current oil has notes of all the other oils I have previously used in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> You can get the same diffuser for half this price by going to ZAq.com website and checking out other dealers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible I got a bad model, so far my mother&#x27;s is fine, but I&#x27;m very sad that it only lasted a year, and I can&#x27;t trust the brand now that I need to start shopping for a new one.</li>
            <li> We like our room dark and in the middle of the night it can be quite dark.</li>
            <li> It works well and turns itself off when the reservoir is empty.</li>
            <li> shuts off when empty.</li>
            <li> Trying to return currently, through a few hoops.  </li>
            <li> It works as expected..</li>
            <li> but I expected it to work longer then that.</li>
            <li> back to messy wax.  </li>
            <li> However, after having it for only a few months it has just stopped working.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to drag this one from room to room.</li>
            <li> The product is as expected.  </li>
            <li> Hope I can find one that has NO light option while running..and might have a longer running time (bigger water tank).  </li>
            <li> I use it every day and it is working baetter than expected.  </li>
            <li> a few seconds later she said &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so I closed my eyes and picked this one.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful using this if you have animals.</li>
            <li> I like the changing colors and the options to have no light or a solid color.</li>
            <li> so now I just let each oil run threw till empty.</li>
            <li> It shuts itself off when its empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably use it from time to time, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> but it does hold enough water to keep it going for few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been running it constantly for a few weeks with no problems.</li>
            <li> but only a few drops</li>
            <li> the center of our house.</li>
            <li> Turns off when empty.  </li>
            <li> Put a few drops of your desired essential oil and let your Aroma Therapy begin!</li>
            <li> Shuts off automatically when empty.</li>
            <li> (I hate most air fresheners actually).</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of putting some really nasty &amp;#34;jasmine&amp;#34; scented oil in that wasn&#x27;t a pure essential oil and even after rinsing a couple times with hot water there is a hint of it still in the air after running the machine with a different oil.</li>
            <li> In my experience using it, it tends to leave a VERY slight condensation film when it&#x27;s been running, but I just put a hand towel underneath it to help, since we have it sitting on a wooden surface and don&#x27;t want it to warp.</li>
            <li> You can really tell the oil is getting broken down and disperses throughout the air.</li>
            <li> My big complaint is that the base light can&#x27;t be turned completely off.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint (and it&#x27;s very minor)</li>
            <li> O.k  for small rooms, quiet and but not very powerful to fill the room up.</li>
            <li> The diffuser emits an alternating glow that sets a nice ambient mood, and it also produces a slight bubbling noise which isn&#x27;t at all annoying; I would describe it as therapeutic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, but it broke after using it once a day (or less)  for only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it almost daily for the past year and it works just as well as it did on day one.</li>
            <li> The other teachers seem to like it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just need to branch out on other oils.</li>
            <li> I read this on other reviews and gave it the benefit of the doubt.  </li>
            <li> The mist is cool but does not get the room cold (i.e in the winter).  </li>
            <li> i shut off the doors to all the other rooms</li>
            <li> It takes a small amount of water to run for several hours.</li>
            <li> Distributes scent well, and inexpensive compared to other diffusers.</li>
            <li> The heat doesn&#x27;t seem to have any problem circulating to the other room.</li>
            <li> We just have to be careful when using peppermint oil in it because it is almost like catnip to our cats!</li>
            <li> All of the other ones I ordered from Amazon had issues.</li>
            <li> I will give the other one a try</li>
            <li> I usually set it either once or two times a day to run with 3-4 drops of one of my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I sent it back for a refund, and I&#x27;m not sure about trying another one.</li>
            <li> One in my bedroom and the other in my office.  </li>
            <li> My husband was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> As it is currently sized, it is prefect for a small office or home room.  </li>
            <li> Its not too small or too big.</li>
            <li> and I prefer this ZAQ Noor over my other one.</li>
            <li> This one goes for 3-4 hours but ZAQ makes other diffusers that go up to 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I have also used citrus oils although it says not to due to corrosion</li>
            <li> Small &amp; simple design blends into surroundings.  </li>
            <li> I deal with a lot of anxiety issues so like to use Lavendar Essential Oil in my diffuser at night when I am anxious.  </li>
            <li> I am thinking about purchasing another for the other side of the house.</li>
            <li> I bought another brand after I bought this and the other diffuser has already stopped working.</li>
            <li> The other unit has 2 pieces so if you&#x27;re holding oil in one hand you can&#x27;t just pop off the cap and add it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of space</li>
            <li> but I needed other diffusers for the kids rooms and my room and didn&#x27;t want to buy the YL one again so onto Amazon</li>
            <li> This is disappointing to spend $40 and not receive what was advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the company directly through their website about this problem, but I have not heard back four weeks later.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough for any room in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works under the same concept, but obviously, due to the small reservoir it won&#x27;t humidify a room.</li>
            <li> I use the other one in my room during flu season to diffuse some thieves.  </li>
            <li> All other EO&#x27;s that are at the bottom diluted with water I never clean out and sometimes have left it in there for a few days without cleaning it.</li>
            <li> Leaves surface around it very wet.</li>
            <li> Maybe a couple times a week unless someone is sick, then it&#x27;s a little more.</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser when it worked, but now I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only noticeable in a small room with less ventilation.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, if I press really hard on the button, it&#x27;ll turn on (other times, it just flashes or doesn&#x27;t turn on at all).</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few months now and use it every single day!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first</li>
            <li> It seems to last at least 3 hours when I fill it up with water and oils.</li>
            <li> It runs for a long time with a small amount of water.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost the equivalent of having a cell phone or computer lit up in a completely dark room.</li>
            <li> one is definitely the least noticible.</li>
            <li> one is definitely the least noticible.</li>
            <li> wife has a &amp;#34;MUJI&amp;#34; brand unit for her side of the bed that has 4 settings and DOES go completely dark while running.</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you can not diffuse citrus oils because they are to acidic for the machine.</li>
            <li> third item of contention is one common to almost all low-priced diffusers.  </li>
            <li> If it is not going to be in a dark room</li>
            <li> When I walk down the hall towards my room, I can smell the peppermint from about 20 feet from my door.</li>
            <li> Amazon needs to bring the price down.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try some other EO scents!</li>
            <li> careful not to use citrus oils!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had one before and was worried from other reviews it would break within a few uses.</li>
            <li> Hoping also that it won&#x27;t die after a few months, as per other reviews.</li>
            <li> And just to be specific, I tested it in a very small room.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviews about the diffuser dying out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed that I&#x27;ve literally only used this thing twice, and it&#x27;s no longer functioning.</li>
            <li> (less coughing), too.</li>
            <li> And it takes less</li>
            <li> You cannot change the mist amount, but I don&#x27;t know why you would want to, just use less oil if you want a lighter scent.</li>
            <li> This is my first amazon review ever and only because I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for about 6 months, not well made :(</li>
            <li> (I wrap a hand towel around it to black it out).  </li>
            <li> The steam is subtle, and I still like it enough to keep it.</li>
            <li> but I like my room pitch black.</li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing what to expect from previous reviews.  </li>
            <li> we noticed that if you overfill the unit, even slightly, it doesn&#x27;t want to diffuse.</li>
            <li> When you want black out in a bedroom (in this case a nursery)  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t even used it that much, less than 20x.</li>
            <li> However it could be easily hidden.</li>
            <li> Bought this device less than 2 months ago and it has already died.</li>
            <li> I may have had it slightly overfilled that time.  </li>
            <li> Purchased item less than two months ago and it no longer works.</li>
            <li> and I was using it less and less or infrequently.</li>
            <li> There is NO way this product can be sold for $100, and I am embarrassed that I paid half that.</li>
            <li> I had previously owned the taller one</li>
            <li> It takes less water than I imagined</li>
            <li> so I would start with less and then add drop by drop.</li>
            <li> Used them 3 times - for a half hour</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed though that my diffuser does not have the option to turn off the light.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but for those who want to use it at night and like a dark room, it may not fit your needs.  </li>
            <li> That does me no good as it is not filling the area with the essential oils I need.</li>
            <li> No splatter or mess.</li>
            <li> it is supposed to have a mode with no light - so at night, we could run it and the room would still be dark.  </li>
            <li> I have two diffusers and I use this one everyday over my other one because it doesn&#x27;t have a timer, it just runs until the water runs out!</li>
            <li> the unit produces a dim blueish light, very subtle, from the base of the lamp section.</li>
            <li> A few months after i bought this, The &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; changed to a visible little line of mist that looked like a line of smoke coming up a few inches out of the diffuser then goes down.</li>
            <li> I like this little defuser.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a little cup to measure the water</li>
            <li> Diffuses for a little over two hours at a time.  </li>
            <li> I have used lemon a little, I&#x27;m hoping it won&#x27;t ruin it.</li>
            <li> and with so little water required, using distilled water is feasible.</li>
            <li> Wish it lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> Just about 4 small circuit boards connected to each other.</li>
            <li> and this little guy is lost in it....</li>
            <li> I bought this little diffuser about 2 months ago.</li>
            <li> Just wish it would diffuse a little longer.  </li>
            <li> AS INDICATED ON THE DIRECTIONS AND A LITTLE BIT OF THERAPEUTIC OIL</li>
            <li> Do they realize how little 80ml is?  </li>
            <li> Wish it was a little bit quieter though.</li>
            <li> The unit is a little noisy for me at night.</li>
            <li> so we keep a little washcloth in front of the power</li>
            <li> but if you like your room to be very dark at night there is not an option where no light shines.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews about how small it was, but it is actually a normal size diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It worked well for a few weeks then died.</li>
            <li> I forgot to turn it off a few times and it must have an auto off feature (I think 4 hr).</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;ve just wasted some valuable oils.</li>
            <li> Had been using this for a few month now</li>
            <li> This product works, but i wish there was a no light function as well, and that it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy this again as a gift for a few friends.</li>
            <li> There is a setting for no light while the diffuser is running&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> every few minutes get it to produce through the hole.  </li>
            <li> broke after a few months</li>
            <li> Broke after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> to fill every few hours.</li>
            <li> The Body Electric in St. Pete uses this in their lobby and I decided to order it after seeing it in operation a few times.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday with peppermint oil for my migraines.</li>
            <li> but I would like he option of no light for night time</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind having to refill it every few hours, because I like a scent change.</li>
            <li> Device stopped working completely a few days after purchase.</li>
            <li> but this one didn&#x27;t work for me after a few months.</li>
            <li> but the light is really annoying.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this item a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months now</li>
            <li> The colors are soothing and I like to have them cycle though, although you can set it to one color or even no light.  </li>
            <li> It can fade through colors, hold on one color or diffuse with no light.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> and it does not have a &#x27;no light&#x27; mode.  </li>
            <li> I read through all the trouble shooting ideas and this was not mentioned.</li>
            <li> , didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing</li>
            <li> (the baby loves to look at that) or a set color or no light at all.</li>
            <li> and i gave it up for dead :,(</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work with no light like it states.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now</li>
            <li> Remember, a few drops will suffice.  </li>
            <li> I put my unit through heavy use and it holds up.</li>
            <li> Just put the water into the holder and add a few drops of the desired oils and turn it on.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal because I can turn the power button away from me at night, but it still glows.</li>
            <li> This mister works just as well, if not better than the one I previously had.</li>
            <li> I am super disappointed.</li>
            <li> No more sticky mess from oil burners!&lt;br /&gt;Jacqueline Organics, Nelson NZ.</li>
            <li> This little diffuser works fantastically for a small to medium sized room.</li>
            <li> It is quite small and takes up little room.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the small size bring you down!</li>
            <li> A bit expensive in my opinion but no regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Our bedroom is small and it fills it with scent within a few minutes...</li>
            <li> Wish the base came in  a different color other than white though.  </li>
            <li> 3 - 5 drops of oil and a little water is all this needs!</li>
            <li> I cannot use any candles in the house because the elderlies I am taking care of , are very sensitive to artificial scents/perfumes.</li>
            <li> I am looking at other ZAQ diffusers to put around my house!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put bad oils in it, and you will have a long lasting product.</li>
            <li> Small and efficient.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased that it stopped working after 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Unit plugs into a wall and comes with a small container to measure water for filling the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Not pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Also, the therapist where I go for Pilates classes has used this brand for the past 2 years in our Pilates room and it&#x27;s on all the time, every day.</li>
            <li> I use it in my elderly parents room usually diffusing oils to help them relax.  </li>
            <li> It does not fill even a small room with fragrance even when you are close to it.</li>
            <li> (if you think of it as a con) is that the volume of water it can hold is fairly small</li>
            <li> I thought it was bigger (reading comprehension fail)</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a small fan running on that.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because the size of the liquid containment area is too small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I contacted Noor about the warranty and they gave me some basic troubleshooting information that was useless.</li>
            <li> I decided to open up the device and see whats wrong.</li>
            <li> #34;not believe how small it was.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> 80 is for a small room.</li>
            <li> reservoir is a bit small (usually lasts a couple of hours).&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li> Runs for an extended period of time on a small amount of water and oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively small</li>
            <li> Also, the ZAQ diffuser shuts itself off when there is no more water...</li>
            <li> so if you forget to turn it off, it will turn off when there is no more</li>
            <li> Was not able to return it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m unable to get my money back.</li>
            <li> It is small, sleek, and</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, about a month ago, it stopped working properly.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for a small room.</li>
            <li> Sounds like a small gurgling creek.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there is no obvious way to take it apart and fix the issue.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could use my essential oils instead of paying for expensive candles all the time.  </li>
            <li> It is small</li>
            <li> Takes up a small footprint</li>
            <li> So I guess I&#x27;m buying another YL diffuser :/</li>
            <li> At that time it stopped turning off automatically, leaving a small amount of water inside</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and not cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> We have a small one level home and place the diffuser in the living room-</li>
            <li> From the moment I plugged it in the power button does not work, but if left plugged in the lights randomly come on.</li>
            <li> I literally use this thing everyday!</li>
            <li> I usually leave this in the downstairs bathroom where the cats have their stinky box and guests relieve themselves.</li>
            <li> May run a tad longer not sure as I use it with lavender oil when I go to bed at night.</li>
            <li> I have it in the bathroom and it fills that small room with scent.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how to go about returning it.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product to anyone. :-/</li>
            <li> Use this every day for past 6mo.</li>
            <li> The area to fill with water and your oil is small but should give you about 3 or so hours of aroma.</li>
            <li> But it works well for a small office.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too lazy</li>
            <li> It only gets used when a member of my household is sick, which is not often, and has now begun to leak most of the water from the base.</li>
            <li> In reality very few items exceed advertised claims and expectations.</li>
            <li> It does look a lot nicer than similar products, but I HATE that they&#x27;ve screen-printed their logo CROOKED across the front.</li>
            <li> After being shocked by the price of diffusers, I decided to go &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34;, yet highly rated.</li>
            <li> My husband thought it was a stupid idea at first and now loves it.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;ll be forced to purchase another one; not sure, after this experience, that I&#x27;ll repurchase ZAQ.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that if I use my cheaper local health store oils, it starts to smell bad after about half an hour</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that hard to take it apart.</li>
            <li> just not what its advertise to be hardly any vapor come out of cone just a subpar piece of eqipment</li>
            <li> like to diffuse at bedtime and the glow makes it hard to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> The lights were hard to get used to at night</li>
            <li> the price has jacked up and I feel it is NOT worth that price tag!!!</li>
            <li> This diffuser sucks...</li>
            <li> I diffuse my oils at least 4 hours each day, and during the winter months, I diffused at least 8 hours a day continuously.  </li>
            <li> Despite some negative reviews I ordered and could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 5 weeks to late to return to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I would have given it at least 4 stars.</li>
            <li> A total disappointment</li>
            <li> (perhaps 1/2 a day at least), but</li>
            <li> Did they upgrade it at least?</li>
            <li> So I got this quite a while ago, over 6 months at least.</li>
            <li> I run it continuously to rid the air of the icky germs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy and poorly made for the price.</li>
            <li> Do not like that it is unable to diffuse citrus oils due to it damaging the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I just received this essential oil diffuser and frankly I am shocked how small the unit is.  </li>
            <li> I thought it will be very small</li>
            <li> Very small.</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> And the one I previously had was twice as expensive.</li>
            <li> Now I seriously am wondering about the ratings.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> It is an expensive little device</li>
            <li> After the disappointment of my expensive diffuser breaking down I opted for this diffuser based on other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Not good quality</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on all the positive reviews, and I have not been disappointed!</li>
            <li> However, there are times when I have had difficult time reading or watching a no nonsense plain laymen&#x27;s description.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is only August. :(</li>
            <li> That, and the fan unit seems a bit on the weak side compared to the Daisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this one SUCKS!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it only worked three times and I had to return it. :(</li>
            <li> However, I was so disappointed that the third setting &amp;#34;no light&amp;#34; is indeed false advertising.</li>
            <li> And because it&#x27;s cold air, the oils aren&#x27;t broken down.  </li>
            <li> It runs for approximately 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> No heat is generated or used; it is all ultrasonically broken into suspension sized droplets which stay in the air - not on the desktop or floor.</li>
            <li> the product stopped working after 1 month and is now sitting broken on my son&#x27;s nightstand&lt;</li>
            <li> Already broken after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with this part.</li>
            <li> POOR</li>
            <li> I have a different brand unit and when I run it the table around it is covered with water which I hate...</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing another to replace my broken diffuser.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering this item after I read some of the negative feedback.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced a problem with the product.  </li>
            <li> This fills up the living room and the kitchen with a very subtle sent.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that this diffuser stopped working after less than a month.</li>
            <li> I hate that the other brands I tried seem disposable.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that it only lasted for 4 months.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed and will look for a different brand to purchase.</li>
            <li> It is crooked and this drives me insane.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was under the impression</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the wrong choice and as a college student lost $50...</li>
            <li> I bought a unit on a &#x27;deal-pon&#x27; website and that one was completely useless compared to this one.</li>
            <li> So frustrating!  </li>
            <li> This started making a horrible buzzing noise on the second use.</li>
            <li> it fails to deliver on an advertised promise: no-light mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I just missed my 30 day window to return.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Just shy of two months and now this ZAQ diffuser is headed for the recycling bin.</li>
            <li> It has yet to fail me.</li>
            <li> and I am sorry I put it away............</li>
            <li> I am sorry I ever bought the thing.</li>
            <li> So sad it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have read articles in the newspaper about how to identify false ratings on products and frankly I am very skeptical of the ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased the $100 going living diffuser and one month late my husband dropped it and broke it! :(</li>
            <li> Worst little machine ever.</li>
            <li> Do not recommend wasting expensive oils in this bad diffuser.</li>
            <li> I have been using it to diffuse oils in my home as we all battle a season-change cold.</li>
            <li> Terrible product and waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It is disappointing it states not to use citrus, lemon or citronella.  </li>
            <li> and I am out cold.</li>
            <li> A tad dangerous.</li>
            <li> I started diffusing this winter to help keep the cold and flu season at bay.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> and we cannot use any artificial fragrances in our home.</li>
            <li> so I can turn the crazy lights off and put it into what I have deemed &amp;#34;night mode&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am afraid to sleep with this on as it could cause a fire.</li>
            <li> I like that it is a cold air diffuser so as not to compromise the integrity of the oils.  </li>
            <li> I am just disappointed and angry.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad apple though?    </li>
            <li> Bad luck.</li>
            <li> I was looking at some prettier designs, but they had bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m frustrated that I got a bum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sick of paying money for items like this.</li>
            <li> I leo diffuse Thieves oil if anyone in my house is sick.</li>
            <li> Too bad because I just bought a ton of synergy blends that contain citrus :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed and would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> disappointed with the manual,  should come with cleaning instructions and blend recipes.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I was so disappointed in this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed because of the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Soooo disappointed because I put a LOT of research into this</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Not recommended for citrus oils which is annoying.</li>
            <li> Also plug the adapter wire to the diffuser before you fill it with water( You have to tip the diffuser to plug the wire into the base)  </li>
            <li> I would say the base is about 5-1/2 to 6 inches in diameter, and it fits on my nightstand without being obstructive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I truly recommend thiws product, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed!  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am returning it immediately very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it. As a massage therapist use it for aromatherapy  and as a mom use it to relieve my children from colds.</li>
            <li> I have had to this for almost 6 months and haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> I love using this with peppermint oil. Fills the room with a nice and refreshing scent that really clears my sinuses when I&#x27;m sick.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  For the price it is excellent.  Now Foods came out with their own model that is identical in price and function.  Well, desired function anyway.  This one is far better.  It even comes with a little measuring cup that makes adding the appropriate amount of water much easier.  I was especially impressed by how much longer this ones runs on the same amount of water and oils.  I highly recommend it.  :)</li>
            <li> After almost exactly 6 months, this item stopped working. Now I had read a few reviews saying people had problems with this unit, but overall people were satisfied. In the end, I should have listened to the reviews. So I contacted the company because they had a warranty. And even though the product is defective, I must pay all postage to get this unit fixed/replaced. They are blaming me, saying water must have gotten inside (which it didn&#x27;t). I would find a better product/more reputable company. Be weary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the ZAQ Noor for a little over a week every night at bedtime to diffuse doTERRA essential oils. It is very quiet (just a very low humming, I&#x27;m a light sleeper and was able to fall asleep with this running). It is extremely easy to use and I have been using tap water to diffuse the oils in, so far so good. The ZAQ Noor sits perfectly on my nightstand and does not take up a lot of space. I love it and have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Love this, but you are not supposed to use citrus scents in it, so I grapefruit or lemon or orange are your desires scenes/oils.--not a product for you</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this diffuser.  Will be buying another for my office</li>
            <li> Diffuses well, however the mist is pretty heavy so it creates wetness on and around whatever it is sitting on.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this item! I am new to essential oils and didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton on a diffuser. I bought this one to test the waters and I love it. Very happy!</li>
            <li> The diffuser worked great at first but the amount of mist it produces has dropped dramatically to almost nothing. I&#x27;ve only had the product for two days.</li>
            <li> It works really well, is quiet and looks better than in the picture.  The rotating colored lights are pretty, but are quite bright if you are trying to sleep.  If you push the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;  button twice, a lower light comes on which is about like a nightlight.  I wish there was a way to turn off the lights for sleeping.</li>
            <li> Very pretty works great</li>
            <li> I have been using it to diffuse oils in my home as we all battle a season-change cold. It works great!</li>
            <li> I have two diffusers, one for each of the kids&#x27; bedrooms.  I love that I can adjust the light so that one room can have it changing colors and the other room can have it turned off.  They run for about two hours and then turn themselves off, which is just right to diffuse the lavender oil and calm the room without overpowering it or making the room too moist.  They are easy to clean, I just wipe them out every morning and they are good to go that night.</li>
            <li> I love this so much I bought one for my mom and plan to get one for my sister as well. Small and efficient.</li>
            <li> Easy to use!! Has an automatic shut off after 4 hrs</li>
            <li> I would have given this 5 stars, but it lost a star since you can&#x27;t use any citrus oils in this diffuser. Otherwise, it&#x27;s fantastic and I use it daily!</li>
            <li> The diffuser gets very hot on the outside which makes me worry about the potential for fire so it cannot be left on at night. Also, there is not an option to turn the light off as claimed.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for citrus oils which is annoying.</li>
            <li> Got it two days ago. It worked great the first day and now it doesn&#x27;t even light up or give any signs of life. Seriously? Worst little machine ever.</li>
            <li> Service was great.  Would like the product to have a little larger reservoir so it can run all night, but it does work well.</li>
            <li> Easy setup and one-button usage, cool features and appealing to the eye. We use a variety of essential oils in it and it works great. It typically lasts about 3-4 hours and we use it multiple times daily.</li>
            <li> The diffuser started leaking after a month or two but the seller graciously replaced the unit for us and the new one is working great again. We love the product.</li>
            <li> good product but would be much better if it had a timer</li>
            <li> This diffuser has been excellent.  We love how it is easy to use, simple to look at and has the option of being one color instead of changing.  I would highly recommend it, especially considering the economic price!</li>
            <li> This is the best little diffuser! I have several different experensive doterra models but this one is my favorite because it is very easy to refill and diffusers all the liquid. No pouring out water and oil.</li>
            <li> flawless transaction. great product.</li>
            <li> have 3 now they work great.</li>
            <li> Very calming and quiet.</li>
            <li> We have run two of these every day for almost a year and they have functioned perfectly every time which is a lot more than can be said about the various other diffusers we have tried, including some two to three times as expensive. My kids especially love the rotating colors- it&#x27;s the perfect night light!</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a diffuser but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100+. This diffuser performs perfectly. Helping with my oils for sleep. It is extremely quiet and the light settings has s very pleasing setting for a dark room.</li>
            <li> This worked well for 5 months and then stopped (would flash the lights and then die when I tried to use it), then it started working again but leaks the water out the bottom faster than it can diffuse anything. I contacted ZAQ through their website to get a replacement because they promise a 1 year warranty, but they simply did not respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to it stopping, I liked the machine. It does distribute the scent. However, it needs to be cleaned after each use since most of the oil stays in the machine even after the water is diffused out (and yes, I used the recommended amount and not more). It will also start to mold if not aired out frequently which can be very hazardous especially if anyone in your home suffers from asthma (I recommend wiping out the unit with a paper towel and leaving open to dry after every use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I feel they should have mentioned in the instructions that many oils are hazardous to cats and dogs. Please do your research before using this around pets!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome diffuser. It knocks the socks off of my more expensive Young Living diffuser. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this fun, colorful and very effective vaporizer. With my favorite oils it changes the entire mood of my house :)</li>
            <li> Has been working since my purchase! I clean it out after every use with a paper towel or tissue and it has been running fine.&lt;br /&gt;My students are obsessed with it and love the way it smells and looks!</li>
            <li> I loved this product! It helped us with our sinus problems.  I am not pleased that it stopped working after 3 months.  The button won&#x27;t keep diffuser on.  I can&#x27;t return it? Very disappointing.  I was planning on buying some for Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I ordered a second one.  The different settings &amp; auto off its perfect for when you just need it before bed</li>
            <li> This mister works very well and I have had no issues with it what-so-ever. I use it often and purchased it months ago. Love it.</li>
            <li> Works great and I love that it automatically shuts off. The night mode is still pretty bright. It would be nice if it could run without a light.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. Emits a nice fine mist.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love the diffuser. It lasts about 3 to 4 hours.  It is easy to fill and add oils to, and has worked without fail.  As soon as it is powered on it begins diffusing the oils.  I love that you can select light brightness and color as well.  We have since bought another one for our boys room to aid in there sleeping.  The diffuser has been used in both large and small rooms and has done well.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great compact unit. Had a little trouble with the adapter, but is working fine now. This unit puts out quite a lot of vapor so I&#x27;d recommend placing it on a hard surface or on top of a cloth. This unit is easy to operate and to clean and the color changing top is very cool. I love that you can dim it for night use. Adds a perfect amount of moisture into the air and delivers the essential oils effectively.</li>
            <li> It worked well for a few weeks then died.</li>
            <li> Works marvelously, I love it!!  Excellent product. Very easy to get started and to clean.</li>
            <li> Very nice, easy to use. Very safe, turns itself off. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I love doterra..but this one is way cheaper ..works well with all my oils...in love!</li>
            <li> This has been run daily  (some days multiple times a day) with Young Living Essential Oils.  Diffuse great.  This is a cool air diffuser which protects the integrity of your oil.  You can turn off the ambient light or leave it on.  Unit runs continuously and will auto shut off when water is gone.  Unit is quiet enough to run on a night stand (during the night).  Cleans easily.  Unit plugs into a wall and comes with a small container to measure water for filling the diffuser.  Works great after about 6 months of continual use</li>
            <li> Absolutely love thus diffuser. I received one for Christmas and loved it so much I bought a second to use in my daughter&#x27;s room. I really like the option to turn the light function off but still diffuse. We have had no problems.</li>
            <li> quiet and nice, great buy</li>
            <li> It works fine, but you CANNOT turn off the light completely like the posted information says.  Turning the light off just changes the color to a different shade of blue.  Being able to turn the light off is why I chose this one, so I am disappointed with the product.  Don&#x27;t buy this if you need the light to turn off completely, but other than that, it works fine.  Though, the instructions do recommend against citrus scents.  That could be a problem for others as well.</li>
            <li> I use this with either Doterra or Young Living oils. I&#x27;ve found that if I use my cheaper local health store oils, it starts to smell bad after about half an hour (peppermint started to smell like sweat or something nasty). I use it in my bedroom, and I love the kind of trickling waterfall noise that it makes. It is louder than my humidifier, but I like the &amp;#34;spa sound&amp;#34;. I forgot to turn it off a few times and it must have an auto off feature (I think 4 hr). The first press of the power button turns it on, as well as the color changing LED light. 2nd power button press holds the color light (doesn&#x27;t change). 3rd press turns the LED light off (the top part of the cone), but the blue power button remains lit. Next press turns the unit off. The power cord attaches underneath the unit (mine has L shaped plug in so it sits flat on surface). I find that useful for cleaning so that I don&#x27;t have to reach behind my night stand and unplug from the wall every time. I only wipe it out when I&#x27;m changing scents, or about every 3rd use, or if it&#x27;s been sitting for a few days with stagnant water in it. I will consider buying another one as a gift!</li>
            <li> I am not overly impressed with this diffuser. It has a low reservoir capacity at 80 ML (this should be added to the product description and specifications). It also has a much lower vapor output than the other 2 diffusers I own. They&#x27;re both much less expensive more generic diffusers and so I expected a better performance out of this more expensive diffuser. If you&#x27;re more concerned with the way it looks and modern design, this product may be perfect for you. It does look a lot nicer than similar products, but I HATE that they&#x27;ve screen-printed their logo CROOKED across the front. They couldn&#x27;t even bother to get the logo straight. It is crooked and this drives me insane. Guess I&#x27;ll need to diffuse a few more &amp;#34;tranquility&amp;#34; oils with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not purchase again for the same price. It is a good looking unit, but why doesn&#x27;t it perform as well as cheaper ones?</li>
            <li> Just wish  the tank were larger.  I love it though.</li>
            <li> My wife originally bought this for herself, and i have actually ended up using it more than her, It has become a nightly regime to do my 3 drops of lavender oil and pass out to the 5 hours of constant relaxing lavender smell in the air</li>
            <li> I love the diffuser.  I&#x27;ve recently become a big fan of DoTerra Essential oils - I use the diffuser in my office every day, and it is the perfect size for my office space.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill, and easy to clean. Do not like that it is unable to diffuse citrus oils due to it damaging the diffuser. Also do not like that it shuts off after 4 hours of diffusing. Would like the diffuser to be larger in order to last all night. The benefit of diffusing eucalyptus and peppermint oil in the wintertime along with it putting a small amount of moisture in the air makes breathing through your nose in the morning much easier.</li>
            <li> this little diffuser works great, it goes off after 4 hours</li>
            <li> Great price, great product.</li>
            <li> Although this is a Christmas gift, so has not been put to the real test, I love the many benefits of these cold air diffusers!! I am hopeful that this will be much appreciated. It would be wonderful if citrus oils could be used in these diffusers...I did read one review that stated that a citrus oil WAS used, and there was no harm to the diffuser, so I am hopeful....</li>
            <li> Been using it for years and love it still! Would have one in every room if I could afford it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish I could change, is that I could shut the light off at night. Other than that, it works great!</li>
            <li> I have purchased a lot of diffusers and this one is by far the best that I have ever used.  Quiet, efficient, lovely.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Has worked perfectly for over a year now!</li>
            <li> I like this little defuser.  It was a great price and does the job.  I fire it up an hour before bedtime and it fills the room with just the right amount of scent.  I like the changing colors and the option to hold one certain color if desired.  My only complaint is the on and off button continually glows a bright blue.  I wish it did not glow at all...I find it distracting but that is just me.  Overall I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well. I like it. Time will tell if it lasts.</li>
            <li> I LOOOOVE this diffuser! Seriously, this may be one of my all time favorite gifts that I have ever received! My husband surprised me with this last year for Christmas. I&#x27;ve been using it almost daily for the past year and it works just as well as it did on day one. I plan to purchase more of these soon, one for our bedroom and one for the kids room. I have used multiple brands of essential oils in this diffuser and it seems to work well with all of them. We keep this diffuser in our living room area, but I can smell the oils all throughout our house when it&#x27;s on. It seems to last at least 3 hours when I fill it up with water and oils. The other thing I love about it is the modern look and the rainbow changing colors. I bought one for my mother-in-law for Christmas this year, but I think she&#x27;ll like the settings that you can turn off the lights or leave it on one solid color. This product is one of my favorite things in my home!!!</li>
            <li> I looked through many diffusers to find the best one and I am very happy with this purchase. It is light weight, quiet, and looks nice to have on a shelf or a side table. It diffuses oils nicely and fills a small bedroom with scent.</li>
            <li> I use this in my high school math classroom with peppermint essential oil. The kids love it! They call it a volcano of smells. When I walk down the hall towards my room, I can smell the peppermint from about 20 feet from my door. The other teachers seem to like it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first diffuser, so I would definitely recommend it for a first-timer.</li>
            <li> Could put out more mist, otherwise works great! Like the look</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my wife.  She&#x27;s very pleased with it. It works well and turns itself off when the reservoir is empty.</li>
            <li> It works well but I can&#x27;t smell it in a large room. It&#x27;s only noticeable in a small room with less ventilation. I wish I could give it 3.5 stars.</li>
            <li> It is a great aromatherapy machine. I love the automatic cut off when it&#x27;s out of water. Wish it was a little bigger. Would buy another one</li>
            <li> Good diffuser all around. I wish it had a stronger stream, but for a small room, it does a good job.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! The first diffuser I&#x27;ve ever purchased, as I&#x27;m new to the world of essential oils. I very much enjoy that you can &#x27;pause&#x27; the colors to whatever you would like it to be. It has been working very well and I&#x27;ve had it for three months. No complaints and it&#x27;s been run nearly every day, sometimes multiple times daily.In my experience using it, it tends to leave a VERY slight condensation film when it&#x27;s been running, but I just put a hand towel underneath it to help, since we have it sitting on a wooden surface and don&#x27;t want it to warp. MAKE SURE THAT YOU CLEAN IT AFTER EVERY USE TO ENSURE LONGEVITY OF THE DIFFUSER. It&#x27;s a good idea to clean it with vinegar once every two weeks -- empty it and clean it like normal, then dry it. Fill it halfway up to the fill line and add about 5 drops of vinegar. Then let it run for about five minutes (don&#x27;t forget that it will smell like vinegar so diffuse in a well-ventilated place). Then dump out the vinegar and water and it&#x27;ll be all super. Loving this little thing! I have used citrus oils in it, which I hear yes and no as to whether or not you&#x27;re really supposed to, but I personally haven&#x27;t had any damage to the unit. Again, just make sure you&#x27;re cleaning it thoroughly after every use. :)</li>
            <li> So far I really like it!  My daughters think the changing colors are really cool!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked at several diffusers and this one is the best priced for the money spent. I bought one for my daughter six months ago and we LOVE it. I&#x27;m now buying one for my sister and soon will buy one for me. Seriously, who wants to breathe candle wick smoke anyway? I just learned about the citrus issue (not recommended by the manufacturer) but I&#x27;ve mostly use citrus and so far have no issues, but I&#x27;ll be sure to clean out the bowl after using citrus.</li>
            <li> Nice mister. Lovely flow, color changes, and shuts off when empty. I&#x27;m really enjoying it.</li>
            <li> This is a great little unit. It looks nice and produces a nice fine mist of essential oils. We have used it on a daily basis and love it!</li>
            <li> This little machine puts out a powerful, consistent steam. It&#x27;s quiet &amp; subtlety designed. My only beef; you can&#x27;t turn off the lights. I&#x27;d love it for my bedside but the lights would not work when I&#x27;m trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> Good diffuser. Does everything like it should and looks great. My only dislike is that the diffuser doesn&#x27;t run more than 2 hours max on one fill. Still worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love! would definitely recommend. I love the colors! I&#x27;ve run it at least once everyday for a few weeks now and its working perfect for me</li>
            <li> I spent a fortune on Young Living and it broke in less than a week.  I have had this for quite some time now and it works great.  The colors are a nice touch.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works perfectly and really atomizes the liquid well.  Hopefully it will hold up with repeated use, we have had it for about 6 months.</li>
            <li> Worked for 2 months then stopped working???</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality. Product was as described</li>
            <li> I use this atleast twice a day!!! Love it and totally recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  Bought for my kid&#x27;s room. Want to buy another for our room.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this diffuser for about 6 months now, and have only used it twice. I made the decision to start using it daily, especially when I&#x27;m working (I am a Life Coach, so there can tend to be a lot of heavy energy; I thought the diffuser would help me with that,) so I plugged it in, mixed Palo Santo Essential Oil with an apricot carrier oil, plugged it in and... NOTHING. It still lights up beautifully, and you can see the water bubbling, but there is no mist coming out, no fragrance, nothing. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed that I&#x27;ve literally only used this thing twice, and it&#x27;s no longer functioning. When it did work, it worked beautifully though. I&#x27;m going to dump the water and oil out of it, and try again to see if it works. If it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;ll be forced to purchase another one; not sure, after this experience, that I&#x27;ll repurchase ZAQ. I&#x27;ll update later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE 01-07-15 *** I emptied the unit, cleaned it out, and added vanilla essential oil (using almond oil as the carrier oil) plugged the machine in and still nothing. The unit just does not work at all, besides continuing to light up. As I stated in my original post, I only used the unit twice before it stopped working. Very, very disappointed. I am ordering a new diffuser tonight.</li>
            <li> this diffuser is amazing. My grandkids can&#x27;t wait to take a turn at &amp;#34;which aroma&amp;#34; they get to put in. It&#x27;s quiet, and you really do feel relaxed with the lavender (my favorite). I just need to branch out on other oils.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Really helps with sleeping with the lavender oil.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sons room. They use it every night and have been very happy with it. I works great for a smaller space like a bedroom.</li>
            <li> Purchased and doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Trying to return currently, through a few hoops.  Still pending.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this item!!!  I used it once the first week and after that it would turn on and auto shut off!!  Terrible product and waste of money.  I read this on other reviews and gave it the benefit of the doubt.  Big mistake.  And you only get 30 days to return it!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice diffuser. Easy to use. The light is really pretty. Works great and fast. It fills my house with the smell of whatever oil scent I drop in.</li>
            <li> Does not disperse the aroma.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what is says it will - except the &#x27;typical&#x27; run time when filled is even better than listed in the write up.  The light colors are nice, and just the right brightness for a night-time or evening light.  It&#x27;s unobtrusive and solid.  Can&#x27;t compare with other diffusers as this is our first essential oil diffuser, but this one seems to be doing just fine - and it is used every day.</li>
            <li> I purchased the diffuser about four months ago. It is great.  I placed it in my family room which is medium to large in size.  I could smell the fragrance from the diffuser in the entire room as well as in part of the dining room.  The mist is cool but does not get the room cold (i.e in the winter).  The two downfalls are not being able to use citrus oils in it due to the possibility of negatively affecting the functionality of the unit and the unit only holding a small amount of fragrance.  So you have to refill it from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the two above concerns, I paid $44 for the white unit and I like it.</li>
            <li> Works good. Will probably buy another</li>
            <li> This is a perfect little diffuser. My only complaint would be that you cannot actually turn the light off and if you&#x27;re using it at night it will still illuminate the room. Otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on number of stars...thought it would be a good purchase but I cannot even smell the oils when its diffusing unless i am standing right by it with my nose basically in the mist.  I am hoping i can return it. I co worker has a different brand diffuser and it smells up her office so nicely...that is what i was expecting. I by no means have a large apartment and whatever room i am using it in i shut off the doors to all the other rooms and I still cannot smell it. I even started putting 10 drops of oil in instead of the recommended 2-5...still nothing..so i&#x27;ve just wasted some valuable oils.</li>
            <li> I think the modern shape.  It diffuses in our bedroom well.  It runs for a long time with a small amount of water.</li>
            <li> Very good diffuser to have at home.  Up to now, it still running good.  We all love it and hopefully it will be last long</li>
            <li> This diffuser sucks...it quit after 2 months of use...and I only ran it at night....I&#x27;m so sick of paying money for items like this.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully and is very simple to use.  Very quiet and does a great job!</li>
            <li> I diffuse my oils at least 4 hours each day, and during the winter months, I diffused at least 8 hours a day continuously.  This diffuser has stood up to all that without signs of degradation.  I will be purchasing another one for our master&#x27;s bedroom.</li>
            <li> Like this diffuser so much, bought a second one.</li>
            <li> Love this! Bought one for my kitchen and one for my bedroom.</li>
            <li> This works great. I do wish the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button didn&#x27;t have such a blinding blue light on it; it detracts from the color changing a little bit. But other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this based off of the reviews I read online.  I have a Spa Vapor and this product does not perform nearly as well.  It does not distribute the scents nearly the distance or for the lenght of time as the Spa Vapor.</li>
            <li> I have been using this diffuser for several months, and I&#x27;ve been pleased with how it works. It takes a small amount of water to run for several hours. I find this diffuser works best in smaller rooms. It fills my office with the essential oil scent, but if I use it in my family room or bedroom, it has to be very close to where I&#x27;m sitting for me to notice the scent. I personally don&#x27;t use the different lights, I turn the lights off. My only complaint is that even with the lights off, there is still a noticeable blue light when I use this at night.</li>
            <li> This is the second diffuser I&#x27;ve purchased in this brand.  I loved the first one, which I was using in our bedroom, that I bought another one to use on our main floor.  I like the fact that I can turn the colors off if I choose to and that it shuts off automatically.</li>
            <li> I love this so much! quiet with a slight, comforting sound. I especially love the color changing lights. Great it turns off on its own when empty.</li>
            <li> We managed to catch an awesome deal on this defuser before Christmas and my wife has used it practically every day since. It&#x27;s incredibly easy to use and even held up well to a clumsy handed drop. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This little &amp;#34;volcano&amp;#34; as my kids call it is working wonderfully. It makes just enough &amp;#34;white noise&amp;#34; to soothe little ones to sleep. The changing light colors is a joy for the kids to watch and serves as a night light as well. It works great at diffusing essential oils into a large family sized room. It has helped greatly in our overall health as well as helping get our difficult sleepers to bed.</li>
            <li> I contemplated over which diffuser to buy for quite some time. This one works great in my son&#x27;s room, I diffuse Breathe almost every night for him. I love the last light setting,  just a hint of blue light. I will say I would have to use more than one in my living room since it&#x27;s very open with high ceilings, so the smell doesn&#x27;t disperse as well. But this one works great for bedrooms! I plan on getting another one for my bedroom next.</li>
            <li> fantastic water diffuser for essential oils.</li>
            <li> Had been using this for a few month now and it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li> This is a WONDERFUL product! I could afford a nebulizing diffuser, and this is the next best thing. Being Ultrasonic, it does use water, but the moisture is so low, it&#x27;s not like a humidifier, it is just right! You can really tell the oil is getting broken down and disperses throughout the air. I find myself standing over the stream of steam and inhale it deeply. The colors are a nice touch on the unit as well. I truly recommend thiws product, you will not be disappointed! 3 - 5 drops of oil and a little water is all this needs!</li>
            <li> The Lavender 100% Therapeutic does not smell.  It does not have the scent of Lavender at all.  The 5 droops that is recommended for the ZAQ Noor Milti Color Litemist Aromatherapy looks pretty but I would not recommend anyone to purchase this item, unless you only want it for the color of the lights.  When used as it is intended the aroma is not there.  After all the water is gone the oil smells like burnt oil.  It doesn&#x27;t smell good at all.</li>
            <li> We really like this diffuser! It&#x27;s not too big, has a quiet, soothing sound and does exactly what it needs to do! We put some doTerra Serenity oil in it at night and it may or may not be helping us sleep.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works great to distribute essential oils around our home. The price was awesome too! It comes with a little cup to measure the water so you don&#x27;t get too little or too much. The top comes right off and you put your water in the open compartment, followed by your essential oil(s). It has an automatic shut off and it lasts a couple of hours (which is great for us). I would recommend this as a great starter diffuser.</li>
            <li> Super cool.. It works as expected.. Mist is visible.. Colors changing as mist comes out and makes it really mistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the aroma hits the patients that come to office right away..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat it for the price and the quality you get with this machine.</li>
            <li> Purchase this for myself for Christmas and so far am loving it!!  Have just gotten into the young living essential oils and was really anxious to fill the house with some healing, feel good scents.  This item fits the bill!  Easy to use with an automatic shut off in case you forget to turn it off.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:12f40c8580d6e331745cc79083b3f98a]]Got it for my girlfriend for Val and she loves it.  Stinks up the house real good.</li>
            <li> would be better product if top fastened, if tipped over water, oil spills out</li>
            <li> Love this little think! Colorful, and really spreads the scent throughout my room!</li>
            <li> I have used just about every possible oil in this without any problems. It works well for its intended purpose. I love it, except for one thing. The light is always on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives you the option to press the button once and it turns on &amp; changes colors, press again and it stops at whatever color it&#x27;s on, and the third time turns the light off whike still diffusing. However, the light never really turns off. It only dims the initial light and leaves a very dim light. For some, this may not be a problem, but if light bothers you while you&#x27;re sleeping and you want oils diffused, this might bother you.&lt;br /&gt;I even tried covering it up with aluminum foil, and the light still shines through the hole where the vapors cone out.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a huge issue for me, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have kept it.</li>
            <li> This was great for the first month then started to turn off before all the water had been used.  I cleaned it and only use distilled water but it only works about 1/2 the time.  I can&#x27;t return it since it has been 3 months but I expected it to work longer then that.</li>
            <li> Works great!!&lt;br /&gt;I have bought one for every room in my house</li>
            <li> This diffuser works incredibly well and is currently what we use in our bedroom at night. The room is fairly small, and this diffuser seems to be the perfect size. The very dim light setting is great, but it&#x27;s still to bright once I&#x27;m trying to go to sleep, so I often turn the diffuser off right beforehand. That being said, it&#x27;s very easy to clean and use. Great product!</li>
            <li> I really like this item.  It works well and has a nice ambiance.  Unfortunately I was under the impression there was an option to run it without any light which is what I really wanted and there is still a glow.  It is a great item but I&#x27;ll end up looking for one that doesn&#x27;t emit any light.</li>
            <li> This diffuse works fine.  It does not seem to put out as strong of an aroma as my other diffusers, but it is satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I have had this for about a month and it is working wonderfully. It works well for a standard sized room. I should emphasize that even when you select no light, there is a dimmed blue light so some may find this distracting in a bedroom at night when sleeping.</li>
            <li> I received this diffuser today.  It is small, quiet and simple to use.  I am really disappointed though that my diffuser does not have the option to turn off the light.  I am only able to dim the light.  It also apparently does not have the ability to change the color as well.  It was brand new in box and sealed so it is clearly a manufacturing defect.  Works well but I do wish I could turn the light off.</li>
            <li> This works for as long as the reservoir of water lasts, maybe 2 hours? The light feature has three settings: bright, bright alternating colors, and dim. the dim is still too light for me to use at night in a dark room to sleep. The sound is pleasant though and it producing a lot of mist, though not sure if it really permeates the room. Works well as a nightlight for a kids room and added benefit of using lavender in the room helps with relaxation, supposedly. This product works, but i wish there was a no light function as well, and that it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> One of the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought! The colors are cool, it shuts itself off when it&#x27;s empty, no white residue on surroundings, and it makes the room it&#x27;s in smell GREAT!</li>
            <li> Just started using essential oils, and this is a great small atomizer!</li>
            <li> Shipped and delivered promptly. So far so good.  Will purchase another one.</li>
            <li> We have one of these in every bedroom and in our kitchen, and they work perfectly! Diffusing is a wonderful way to use essential oils, we use them for immunity support, respitory issues, to help us sleep better... Simply add water and drops of your oil and turn on, automatically turns off after water is gone.  This unit can be used as a nightlight, which is good, but be aware that it does produce some light at every setting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this mister in my elderly parents&#x27; room at night. They were both in the hospital with pneumonia recently. I add a couple drops of essential oils for immunities and breathing. The mister is very easy and fast to use. I use tap water, put a couple drops of oil in, turn it on around 11pm and it goes until around 3am. It automatically shuts off. The room is filled with the wonderful aroma and I believe it is helping them breathe better (less coughing), too. I think it is a very good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> This diffuser does an amazing job. Very quiet, puts out good amount of smell, cool changing lights. I really like the automatic shutoff when the water level gets low, which means I can turn this on and fall asleep and it will shut off for me.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.  Love</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser until it stopped diffusing after 3 months. It still lights up and sounds like it&#x27;s working but it doesnt produce steam or smell anymore. Very bummed.</li>
            <li> This works wonderfully, but I wish it was darker on the lights off mode. It&#x27;s actually darker if I stop it on the dark red color than if I run it on the lights off mode. I also had to put electrical tape over the ON button because it glows too brightly when you&#x27;re trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> I would love to give this more stars and one week ago I would have! I bought this slightly over a year ago and it worked great. My son loved it and always asked for it every evening. The mist is an even one and the light show is definitely a plus. However, it just died. I was very careful not to use citrus essential oils which the instructions say is a no no. I checked the manufactor warranty and it is one year so I just missed the cut off. Great machine until it died prematurely.</li>
            <li> love this product. It works well. I like the bubbling sound it makes when I turn it on at night</li>
            <li> I use to sell scentsy, and now that I&#x27;ve discovered essential oils I wont be&lt;br /&gt;going back to messy wax.  Within minutes your home smells nice and clean&lt;br /&gt;and the unit automatically cuts off when it runs out of water.  And it takes less&lt;br /&gt;money to operate since it only requires 2-4 drops of oil, depending on how&lt;br /&gt;strong you want the fragrance. I will be ordering a second for my bedroom.</li>
            <li> In addition to buying my car diffuser I also bought this diffuser. I love this one too! I can burn my oils for several hours with each filling of the diffuser. I haven&#x27;t noticed any residue on anything that I am placing diffuser on while using.The plus on this one is that the price I got it for through AMAZON was a great price. Fifty dollars is all with free shipping.</li>
            <li> I scoured through many diffusers before making the decision to buy this one and I do not regret it one bit!  It works beautifully!  We&#x27;ve had it for several months and have yet to have a problems.  Excellent buy!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite thing. My house smells like a spa, I don&#x27;t have to worry about candles and everyone who comes tony house orders one. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This little mister is amazing...we love it and use it often. Easy to clean. Easy to use. Great prices.</li>
            <li> The oil diffusing is new to my wife and I and we are both enjoying it.  The air quality has improved as well as the overall scent in the home.  we use it daily.</li>
            <li> The best! I bought this for a gift and the receiver loved it! I am thinking about buying one for myself. The colors are so bright and pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this item after using it several months. It runs for approximately 4 hours. I use a variety of EOs in it.</li>
            <li> The directions say pretty explicitly not to use citrus blends, but I have been for almost a year with no issues. You can&#x27;t beat the price and it fills my bedroom with wonderful scents. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.  However, after a month of use there is now a burning plastic smell when I diffuse my oils. Not pleased with my purchase. Would not recommend.  Maybe I just got a bad apple though?    I&#x27;m Currently changing my review to 4 stars... I contacted amazon about the smell recently to see what they would say. They immediately allowed for me to receive a new one and return the defective one. I&#x27;ve had the new one for a while now and I&#x27;ve noticed NONE of the issues I had with the original. I&#x27;m pleased with the new diffuser and will update after a few more months of use.</li>
            <li> I received this diffuser for Christmas and have used it daily (some days 2-3 times during the course of the day) and love it.  It is quiet and performs as advertised.  I have found it does produce more vapors as it reaches the end of the time period.  To ensure it does not damage the furniture, I do place it on surfaces that cannot be damages by water.  So far I am very pleased and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser for the price. Does the trick!</li>
            <li> Works great but does not last too long.</li>
            <li> We have been using it daily for many months.  It works great!  We love the design and the fact that it changes colors.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have had this diffuser for exactly one year now and it just stopped working today. I am super disappointed. I feel like $50 should buy you a diffuser that lasts longer than that.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these to use in my children&#x27;s rooms.  I looked through many different misters listed on amazon and decided on the ZAQ Noor mainly because of the appearance, the reviews, and the cost.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a variety of essential oils in them and the mist fills the room.  I like that you have the options of changing colors, a single color, or no color at all.  The mister comes with a small measuring-type cup to easily fill the mister which means that both my children (ages 12 and 14) can refill it on their own.  I think the best thing about this mister is that I haven&#x27;t noticed any sort of leakage on the surface they are sitting on.</li>
            <li> I use this with essential oils that I bought from amazon. Works great, and great price.</li>
            <li> Works very well. I will certainly buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> WOW, THIS IS THE BEST DIFFUSER I HAVE OWNED.  IT&#x27;S VERY EASY TO USE AND IT DOESN&#x27;T TAKE LONG TO FRAGRANCE THE ROOM.</li>
            <li> Great Quality - we recommend this item!</li>
            <li> Honestly the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made! I love this diffuser! It turns off on its own after its used up all the water and works so well! Got my girlfriend to buy one when she smelled/saw mine in my room!</li>
            <li> Just a great little thing.</li>
            <li> Use this almost every night, great price for what you are getting.</li>
            <li> After days of reading through reviews I decided on the ZAQ NOOR, and I am very happy with my decision. I have it in a 600 sq ft apartment, fills the living room area very well, doesn&#x27;t reach the bedroom so much, faintly, but that&#x27;s okay. I want it more for the living room area. Oil amount depends on the brand and strength of the oil. One brand I only need 3 drops, another I need 7-8, also depends on how strong you want the scent to be. There are 4 settings, mist with changing light color, mist with set light color, mist with dim light and off. You cannot change the mist amount, but I don&#x27;t know why you would want to, just use less oil if you want a lighter scent. Easy to follow instructions, comes with a measuring cup. Cleaning is easy - damp cloth/paper towel and a Q-Tip for the ceramic disc in the center. A very diluted vinegar wash would work too. Holds 80mL, which runs for about 4 hours. Auto shut off when it runs out of water. I&#x27;ll probably buy a second one for the bedroom. Great choice!</li>
            <li> Works very good! The only thing I would change is a choice of time to run.</li>
            <li> Bought at the end of March 2015 today is June 18 2015 and the device will no longer power on.  When you press the power button the LEDs flash and that&#x27;s it.  I loved this diffuser when it worked, but now I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser.  We use one in our bedroom at night, and I have another at my desk in my classroom.  Not really meant for such a large room, but students can smell the scent when they enter the room through the door in the opposite corner.</li>
            <li> I was in love with this product when I first received it and for a short while thereafter. However, after having it for only a few months it has just stopped working. I clean it and take good care of it exactly as I am supposed to. But when I turn it on now it makes a really loud noise and no longer diffuses and releases the particles. It&#x27;s really disappointing because I loved it so much and even bought another as a gift and now every time I use it I am just disappointed and angry. Also sometimes it doesn&#x27;t automatically shut off as it&#x27;s supposed to after a couple hours. Sometimes it just keeps running and running for many many hours despite the fact that the chamber is empty of water and it is just filled with steam, quite scary! This is my first amazon review ever and only because I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Diffuses for a little over two hours at a time.  Appealing to look at.  I love mine! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this guy. Haven&#x27;t had a single issue and I&#x27;ve been using mine daily for 5 months. I ended up buying the larger one for my bedroom for when I sleep. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great size, easy to use. Nice for a first time use of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Before buying this item I did my research on line.  There was a very helpful site that did comparisons of various aromatic diffusers and the ZAQ Noor brand was determined the best.  The price range was best for me also.  So far, I have been using it for over a week and it works perfect.  I like that it turns off automatically when the water is used up and you have a choice of having the light change colors or leave on one color or have no light at all.  It is quiet to run and does not keep me awake at night.  Also, the therapist where I go for Pilates classes has used this brand for the past 2 years in our Pilates room and it&#x27;s on all the time, every day.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for about 6 months, not well made :(</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser in February 2015. It only gets used when a member of my household is sick, which is not often, and has now begun to leak most of the water from the base. It is only August. :( Really it had been turned on maybe 8-10 times. I just sent ZAQ an email requesting information about the refund/replacement process through the manufacturer. It should be under warranty for a year. TBD I&#x27;ll update my review when I hear back.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser for this EO newbie! My family loves the colored lights and it seems to function as it should, makes our house smell great. Been using for probably six months with no issues.</li>
            <li> Light never turns off! The large led light turns off, however the power switch emits a bright blue light, not good for a bedroom!! Otherwise it works great! See user pics</li>
            <li> We got this for our daughter for Christmas, and she used it ONCE before it completely quit working. It won&#x27;t even power on anymore after that first use. Want a refund.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few months now and use it every single day! Works great and looks great!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these... the one I use more often (in kids&#x27; room) is showing more wear and tear, for sure...  but it&#x27;s still working.  My only wish is that it had a &amp;#34;no light&amp;#34; option, as even the dark blue light is too much light for my bedroom at night (I wrap a hand towel around it to black it out).  But otherwise, for the money, this is good.</li>
            <li> this diffuser is awesome I use it in my elderly parents room usually diffusing oils to help them relax.  I plan to buy this again as a gift for a few friends.</li>
            <li> This is a very elegant, quality diffuser.  I absolutely love the look.  It doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap like some of the others. I have already recommended this diffuser to people and I plan I purchasing another one.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and performs well. The changing colors could be fun for a child&#x27;s room. I don&#x27;t mind them, but usually turn them off (which is a nice option).</li>
            <li> Works great except the fragrance could be stronger. Otherwise love it.</li>
            <li> like it, defuser is working good at this time</li>
            <li> I purchased mainly based on price and average reviews for my first diffuser, and the ZAQ Noor 80ML did not disappoint. I ordered a sample box of essential oils to use with it and it has worked great!&lt;br /&gt;I would agree that the scent is strong in the immediate area and spreads throughout a 300sf space (I even have vaulted ceilings). If your looking to fill a larger space or a longer run time, I&#x27;d upgrade. For my purposes, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I really like it can change different color light while operation, and most important it really perform its function!</li>
            <li> First diffuser and I am in love. I bought it for our living room to diffuse peace and calming, nighty night and lavender for my toddler who decided to go on a sleep strike. All my kids ended up loving it as well as me. I use it once in the morning and once at night. I haven&#x27;t had any complaints and only owned it a week. Hopefully it lasts for a while! Great machine great price I recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is the best way to get aromas into your space.  Very simple and easy to use and the multi color operation is very attractive.</li>
            <li> Working great very happy after several months. No problems.</li>
            <li> We use this all day long. We even take it with us on our road trips. It just adds that extra aromatherapy help.</li>
            <li> After having it a while I like it, but would &amp;#34;forewarn&amp;#34; about a couple of things. The night setting, which I thought meant it didn&#x27;t have any light at all is actually a really dark blue light. This will not work for anyone who is sensitive to light when trying to fall asleep, and blue light especially is not helpful- it&#x27;s almost the equivalent of having a cell phone or computer lit up in a completely dark room. I prefer stopping it at the red setting when trying to fall asleep as this color is more conducive to sleeping. The other issue I have had is that it&#x27;s hard to clean out one scent before putting in a new one. I feel like the current oil has notes of all the other oils I have previously used in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> It works but it is not powerful enough for my taste. I was hoping for an an aroma blast that would fill the room. What I wound up with with is an aroma dribble that I had to be very close to enjoy. I&#x27;m not sending it back because it is very pretty. I like the design. It will be easy to use for travel. The steam is subtle, and I still like it enough to keep it. It just wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be, and even though it is a pleasant little product, it does not live up to the advertised claim. In all fairness, what does? In reality very few items exceed advertised claims and expectations. If you are looking for a small, simple diffuser it is ok. If you are looking for an aroma diffuser that&#x27;s fragrance fills a room, keep looking.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser, does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to nothing more nothing less, and it looks great in a living room. Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> This is a great little thang.  You will need to refill it nightly if you let it run, so it requires some maintenance, but otherwise it&#x27;s great for what it does.  Fills a large room with scent.  Wish it stayed on even longer through the night.  I.e. It won&#x27;t work as a real humidifier.</li>
            <li> So far this has been the best thing ever. I debated purchasing it, wondering if I really needed such an item. But I&#x27;m glad I did. I use it every day, mostly during the night before bed to relax. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. The dimmed light doesn&#x27;t bother me. The sound is barely audible, but calming. And the scent that is produced is awesome. I think I need to purchase another so I don&#x27;t have to drag this one from room to room.</li>
            <li> So far it is working well. It is disappointing it states not to use citrus, lemon or citronella.  I have used lemon a little, I&#x27;m hoping it won&#x27;t ruin it. I just try to wipe it out after it is done running.</li>
            <li> The diffuser emits water mist as described, turns off automatically when the water runs out and changes colors. It does not fill even a small room with fragrance even when you are close to it. I tried different essential oils with the same result. Disappointed and would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Works very well. The light change  - my boys thought it was cool.  Makes the room you put it in feel relaxed!</li>
            <li> the essential oils that I have purchased from Amazon, work really well in this little device, just set it up at bed time and forget it, has auto shut off</li>
            <li> Good little humidifier/oil diffuser. Took a star off because there&#x27;s no option to turn off the light completely. Even on the least light setting its too bright for my sleeping preference.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas and I love it.  It quit working and I don&#x27;t know who to contact.  I am very disappointed that it only lasted for 4 months.  In the pamphlet there is no phone number or email to contact.</li>
            <li> worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> After trying every kind of freshener out there, and tired of chemically odor, I tried this.  What a difference an hour makes!  A gentle, fresh, natural smell wafts around the house - relaxing and even safe for an asthmatic cat.  Works with every sort of oil (though they recommend avoiding citrus) and allows me to mix my own unique combinations.  Runs for 8 hours on one fill - and with so little water required, using distilled water is feasible.</li>
            <li> This mister works just as well, if not better than the one I previously had. And the one I previously had was twice as expensive. The ZAQ Noor mister is easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li> So wonderful for essential oils</li>
            <li> Stopped working just over a month after I bought it.</li>
            <li> Works great, use it every day and have had it for over a month now.  Would definitely recommend this!!</li>
            <li> Works very well but if you like your room to be very dark at night there is not an option where no light shines. The lamp does get somewhat dim but even then the blue power button is quite bright. I like it though!</li>
            <li> The product is as expected.  When people come into my office they often comment on the scent and it has helped increase my essential oil sales.</li>
            <li> I love this little dude!! A little bit of water, a few drops of essential oil... and my entire living room smells great. The scent is stronger depending on how much oil you use, but the mist is wonderful. I love this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil diffuser, i just received my ZAQ today and its been on for 4 hours. My apartment smells AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;I also like that its stylish and very clean looking.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> This is a great product- small, cute, colorful and efficient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One con (if you think of it as a con) is that the volume of water it can hold is fairly small so it doesn&#x27;t run for as long as you would like for it to. Perhaps there&#x27;s a reason for it like the material would melt or something but I found myself adding water and aroma oil to it every 2 hour before it all evaporated. Hence one star less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging and Delivery: Excellent Packaging and Prompt delivery!</li>
            <li> Puts a nice calm in the air and I do believe it helps our kids sleep a bit easier at night.</li>
            <li> Did not know my wife ordered this, walked into my home and the wonderful aroma just surrounded me.gave the home a nice serene feeling</li>
            <li> Love everything about this. Helps me to fall asleep every night.</li>
            <li> After 24 uses the power button is stuck and it won&#x27;t turn on. Product returned for one of better quality</li>
            <li> I bought this and took very good care with cleaning and changing the water after each use. I clean the top as well by rinsing it with water and letting it dry. The first few uses were very good, a lot of mist, scent was perfect the same as the essential oil itself. Actually, sometimes I felt like it was working too well, the scent permeated the entire room in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, that didn&#x27;t last.. Currently have it on next to me and the mist is no longer visible. The sage essential oil I put (high quality, Aura Cacia) is barely noticeable and doesn&#x27;t have that same pureness to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the wrong choice and as a college student lost $50... seems like some people have great reviews for it but I think the consistency of their products are unstable. Buy a better brand.</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with this diffuser. Works great with our essential oils. This is our second purchase of this kind. Long lasting.</li>
            <li> this is ok, only runs for about an hour or 2 at the most but is good for small area or office</li>
            <li> Distributes scent well, and inexpensive compared to other diffusers. It says to not use with citrus oils.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday and appreciate the great workmanship.</li>
            <li> This is such a good, easy to use unit. I have used all types of oils in it and have not had any problem with citrus or lemon. I just make sure to rinse out the unit after using the cirtus oils.&lt;br /&gt;The scent if produces is good and I like that it goes up in the air instead of being angled out. I bought a unit on a &#x27;deal-pon&#x27; website and that one was completely useless compared to this one. I sent that one back and will spend the extra money to get another one of these instead. That one did not produce as much scent using the same amount of oil.&lt;br /&gt;This unit produces good scent using about 5-6 drops of oil in a 15x15 foot room. of course the closer you are to the unit the better you can smell it but the smell is noticable throughout the room when I walk into it.</li>
            <li> Worked great for six months of use before suddenly dying. I really feel like this device should have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Buyer Beware...I was very happy with this diffuser. However, after only a couple of months it quit working. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the box I was disappointed. I thought it was bigger (reading comprehension fail) but this little buddy does a great job. I have it above my bed and when filled to the max, it lasts a whole night&#x27;s sleep and doesn&#x27;t turn off. I have another one that turns off after an hour or thirty minutes and I much prefer this one going until it runs out. My only tiny complaint is that I wish it had a &amp;#34;light completely off&amp;#34; setting. There is a dim setting but I like my room pitch black. Other than that, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even tell I have animals anymore thanks to this miracle worker! Our house smells like a luxury spa!</li>
            <li> Well we&#x27;ve had this little guy running off and on for several days now and here&#x27;s the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s thus far: Pros- #1 It is more aesthetically pleasing than I expected. From the picture it looked kind of unattractive but I was actually pleasantly surprised. The lights can be a nice effect and there is the option of turning them off as well (although the little blue light behind the button never turns off unless the machine is off) #2 It is very quiet Cons: #1 It doesn&#x27;t cover a very large area - the living room we have it in is about square feet and connected to our kitchen/dining room (about square feet) by a breezeway. No distinguishable scent in the kitchen/dining room. The only room in the house you can smell anything in is the living room and even then, it&#x27;s not overpowering. Maybe this could be aided with a fan or more circulation but its in the same room as our wood stove and there&#x27;s a small fan running on that. The heat doesn&#x27;t seem to have any problem circulating to the other room. #2 Hard to get an old scent out. I made the mistake of putting some really nasty &amp;#34;jasmine&amp;#34; scented oil in that wasn&#x27;t a pure essential oil and even after rinsing a couple times with hot water there is a hint of it still in the air after running the machine with a different oil. This would be a great machine for a small room like a bedroom but not great for larger living spaces unless you have a fan running constantly. I think I&#x27;m going to go ahead and end up spending the extra $50 for the Lotus. I will leave more feedback (if I remember) in a few months to see how it holds up long term</li>
            <li> East to use with fantastic mist! I have tried 6 different diffusers and this is by far the best diffuser and best price!</li>
            <li> great product, easy to clean,  gentle mist</li>
            <li> This works great! Wish it lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> Diffuser works well.  Provides scent through my whole house.  Automatically shuts off and super quiet.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:97d46961f01fb12d910273ea9a17598e]] This is such a cool diffuser! It holds 80ml and is plenty large enough for my large living room or could even go well in my office or bedroom. The LED color changing lid looks very nice and sets a beautiful atmosphere. It&#x27;s very relaxing and I absolutely Love the health benefits you get by diffusing essential oils in your home. Aromatherapy is a fantastic practice when you have someone with health issues in your home or around flu season because of the immune support so many of the essential oils give off. I love pygmy a little lavandar and rose oil in the diffuser in the evenings for a teaching scent that helps me destress and wind down after my day. This diffuser has a clearly marked fill line. It&#x27;s important not to exceed the fill line or the unit will not work properly. This diffuser also warns against using citrus blends because they may damage it but I have used them lightly and as long as I clean it well after use it shouldn&#x27;t poise any problems. The set up is quick, just plug it in, add water and your favorite oil, and turn the unit on. The entire will smell fresh and the air Will be clean within minutes!Forget famil chemical like Lysol and Febreeze have, I know I don&#x27;t want to breathe them nor my children or pup!&lt;br /&gt;There is a simple one button control for the misting, light, and power functions. One tap turns the unit on. The led lamp will glow and slowly change cycling thru the different colors.it&#x27;s very calming and lights the room with a relaxing glow. I love the fact that you can choose it to \\&quot;freeze\\&quot; on a color that encourages the mood you are seeking. From red to blue or green or purple or orange and even yellow, there is a corresponding light tone for any mood. When you see the color you like you can tap the button again to stop the lamp from changing. Off you tap the button a third time the light goes out and the unit produces a dim blueish light, very subtle, from the base of the lamp section. There is no way to run the diffuser without any light features but this dimmed one is definitely the least noticible. A fourth tap of the button turns the device Off.&lt;br /&gt; It is extremely quiet and you barely can hear it running. I have receivedm many compliments on not only how wonderful and inviting my home always smells now but also on the diffuser itself. Even when it&#x27;s turned off it makes a nice conversation piece, the pyramid design is pleasantly eye-catching. My unit runs about 4-5 hours between fillups and since it it is powered by a regular outlet in the wall you don&#x27;t have to worry about charging it or keeping batteries stocked.the misting feature produces a nice amount of mist and the unit status cool to the touch. I am completely in LOVE with this diffuser and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better choice! I did receive mine free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experienceb and honest opinions of this ZAQ Noor Essential Oil Diffuser.no way to run the diffuser without any light features but this dimmed one is definitely the least noticible.

            <li> Works great, no problems.  So good there is nothing to report because this is just one of those products you want no hassle with and it delivers.  Plug in, pore water, pore oil, press button-it works.  Entire room filled with essential oil with mood lighting based on preference.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is amazing! I actually like it better than my other one that costed at least double.</li>
            <li> I would love for the light to turn off completely but this diffuser does a great job.</li>
            <li> Love how this works! and the nice small size!</li>
            <li> Worked for couple of months and now won&#x27;t even turn on. Not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about aromatherapy  the last year and I finally decided to give them a try. I chose this diffuser because it had good reviews, had changing colors, had an auto turn off when the water runs out, and I thought it was attractive. This little guy is just amazing! The second I turn it on it starts to mist and fill the room with wonderful scents that help me relax and unwind after a long day. I love all the benefits you get from essential oils with diffusers. I enjoy trying different blends and plan on buy more diffusers from Zaq. I want one in every room!</li>
            <li> This thing is great, Love the color options, which can be shut off if you dont like. Overall great!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure we would like this, but ended up loving it. We just have to be careful when using peppermint oil in it because it is almost like catnip to our cats! Helps hubby with his asthma. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have owned 4 different types of diffusers and this one has been my favorite.  In fact, I ended up buying 3 more for different rooms of the house.  I bought my first one 2 years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong.  The manufacturer says not to use it with strong oils, but I&#x27;ve used it with just about every kind of oil without any problems, including OnGuard from doTerra.  You can&#x27;t beat this diffuser, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product. If I can&#x27;t sleep, I add aromatherapy and I am out cold. If the house is too stuffy, I use it as a humidifier instead of lugging out the big one. In any case, I use it for fall, winter and spring.</li>
            <li> I really like this unit... Works well, but I haven&#x27;t found a scent that will actually omit a smell into the room.  So... The jury is still out.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Super small and light and easy to transport. I use it daily and my whole family loves the way the house smells now. I use lavender for relaxation daily, geranium for focus while cleaning or doing projects with my daughter. Can&#x27;t wait to try more.</li>
            <li> This is now part of my &amp;#34;power down&amp;#34; ritual at night and I love it.  I start it with some lavender oil and do my facial mask while I watch TV or read.  It seems to run for 3-5 hours and will simply shut off once all the water is gone.  I thought I would like the lights at night but I find them too bright.  You can adjust it to run without the colored lights but the blue &amp;#34;power on&amp;#34; light still shines and you can hear it quietly and happily bubbling away as you drift off.  Very relaxing and even cute on your nightstand.  It arrived as promised and in good condition.  It does distribute the scent of the oil through my standard sized bedroom but I would recommend putting it next to where ever you will be hanging out if you want the maximum benefit of the diffused oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with information from Amazon saying you could turn off the light while it was running... The light on the &amp;#34;on-off&amp;#34; switch is also visable through the light dome and is VERY annoying when trying to sleep. Too bad because other than that, it&#x27;s pretty good. (However, if it had a larger tank that would run for a longer period of time it would be better). We used it for the FIRST time last night...and the wifey had to get up and turn it off cause is was too bright. She normally is not bothered by light when sleeping...but she said it was just too bright ...and that was in the light off setting! The Q &amp; A area at the time I researched it on Amazon said that light could be turned off when running&lt;br /&gt;. See quote I read on Amazon as follows: &amp;#34;Yes. There is a setting for no light while the diffuser is running&amp;#34;. THIS IS NOT TRUE!&lt;br /&gt;So...now I will return it and hope they will pay the return shipping since it was not as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has a &amp;#34;MUJI&amp;#34; brand unit for her side of the bed that has 4 settings and DOES go completely dark while running. I liked hers so much I reseached them and bought this one. At the same time I spent LOTS of money on essential oils too. So now I have the oil...just need the right diffuser. Hope I can find one that has NO light option while running..and might have a longer running time (bigger water tank).  Anyone one know a better one?</li>
            <li> I use it every night. So far no problems. I like that it has the different options to change colors and then to keep it at a simple color</li>
            <li> This diffuser is fabulous! The contemporary design looks fabulous anywhere! I love the light changes! There is even a nighttime light setting for diffusing my lavender while I sleep! Will definitely buy another one! Great product and great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this diffuser for the last 7 months and all of a sudden it stopped working. Everytime it is turned on, it immediately turns itself right back off. Tried cleaning it out thoroughly but that still doesn&#x27;t fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I did like the product for the short period of time it was functional, I couldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone unless they don&#x27;t mind replacing it often at $50 a pop.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because of the price and the good reviews. I have had it over a month now, and I love it! The design is simple and pleasing. I like the light feature- light can be on (single color), changing colors, or off. This diffuser is perfect for a bedroom- it probably would not be so great for a large living room, because it probably wouldn&#x27;t cover that much space. For our bedroom though, it&#x27;s great! I like that I can turn it on at night (and use it as a night light) and it automatically shuts off when it is empty. I will definitely be buy another one soon! $49 is a great price.</li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing what to expect from previous reviews.  I love it!  I use it in my office and I love to diffuse lavender.  I have tried grapefruit and some others, I am a little leary about citrus because of all the reviews, but so far I haven not had any problems with diffusing citrus.  I do not use this everyday, but after I bad week of pollen and then rain, it was nice to diffuse some respire from Sparks Natural to help with my wheezing from the pollen!! It isn&#x27;t as small as it looks either, it is the size of a large roll of toilet paper, like the jumbo size.  Very cool product!!</li>
            <li> This was my first diffuser and I love it. It makes the room smell great and the light show is so pretty!</li>
            <li> Worked ok for a short time.  Two months later it&#x27;s broke and doesn&#x27;t work at all.  POC</li>
            <li> After purchasing a diffuser for myself my daughter wanted one. I purchased this because it has changing colors.  It is a great size for a small bedroom.  She loves putting her essential oils in each night and watching it light up.  Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Love these diffuses,,  wrapped really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Great product; I just wish it had a bigger reservoir.</li>
            <li> Diffuser came in excellent shape, just wish there was a way to turn the light completely off.  Over all a good little diffuser.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works great, I was looking at this one and the DoTerra one and I went with this one because of its shorter profile. The DoTerra diffuser is huge and frankly I really didnt want to have this HUGE thing in my room. The diffuser works great, it is quiet and easy to add more water and EO&#x27;s. I only have one issue with it - it would be nice to turn off the light completely while having it still run. We like our room dark and in the middle of the night it can be quite dark. I ended up setting the color to red and then wrapping a small towel around it leaving a hole on the top for the goodies to escape. This is a fix but I would prefer if I could choose to not have the light running!</li>
            <li> When it worked it was wonderful.  But after three days it would not turn on.  That&#x27;s a lot of money for only three days of functioning.</li>
            <li> I really did my research on diffusers that were reliable and yet still would not break my pocketbook and can honestly say that I am very happy with my purchase. 😊 It works well in my office, is very easy to use and I like the auto-shutoff and color-change option features.  My 20-year-old son already wants this one for his room, so I will be buying him one as well as purchasing a few more for each room of the house! ❤️</li>
            <li> I have bought two of these, not because one broke, but because I liked my first one so much, I bought a second to place elsewhere in my house.  No need to use chemical sprays or plug in air fresheners.  This is a natural and healthy way to fresh up the smell of your house.  I really like the sleek design and the fact that it is low maintenance.  Just fill it up with 80 ml of water (using the measuring cup it comes with), a few splashes of your favorite essential oil and then enjoy hours of fresh smells.  The feature of turning itself off when the water is gone is GREAT.  I highly recommend and I have even given some as gifts.</li>
            <li> As others have stated - works great while it lasts. At first I was very pleased with the diffuser, but after only two months of receiving, it suddenly stopped working. Very disappointed and will look for a different brand to purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Essential Oil Diffuser.  I use it every day and it is working baetter than expected.  Thank you, Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works great!  We like the simple look and options for light/no light.</li>
            <li> I researched diffusers before purchasing this one. All of the other ones I ordered from Amazon had issues. This one has been great! I wish it held a little more water but it is more important to me that it is good quality and it seems to be. I hate that the other brands I tried seem disposable.</li>
            <li> I really love this diffuser.  I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews about how small it was, but it is actually a normal size diffuser.  The directions were somewhat confusing for someone who has never used a diffuser before, and it would be nice if it came with something suggesting which oils to diffuse, but other than that it is perfect.  My children also love that it has a little light, (the light can be turned off).  So far, we have only diffused Orange EO&#x27;s in it, but it leaves the house smelling great!  It is a very nice alternative to toxic plug ins and room spray!</li>
            <li> runs great, easy to clean...</li>
            <li> Interesting volcano shape. Cool misted oils ejected from top. No heat is generated or used; it is all ultrasonically broken into suspension sized droplets which stay in the air - not on the desktop or floor.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  I tell my kids it is a treat for both the eyes and nose.  It does go through the water pretty quickly, but since I have never owned another diffuser, I am not sure if this is normal but I assume that it is.  It disburses scent throughout my living/family rooms.</li>
            <li> This little diffuser is great! I&#x27;ve used it for several months. Seemed like great quality and great price compared to others I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> We use it everyday and it does a great job. The kids love watching the colors change as they go to bed.</li>
            <li> Sometime&#x27;s this product run&#x27;s for 6-8 hours and sometimes it runs for 2 and sometimes it runs for over 12. I have no idea why. We put the same amount of water and oil in each time and it can vary even with the same oil. Decent product, the changing light feature is very nice and it is pretty quiet. It fills a bedroom with aroma very well.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t turn off the light completely and it makes my room at night to bright for me.  Beyond that point, it works very well and we like it during the day.</li>
            <li> We like the size and looks plus the feature of choosing the colors.  It also puts out a nice mist.  Having the right size measuring cup is a nice feature and makes it easier to fill the diffuser.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works well and has multiple settings to control the lighting effects. I gave it three stars because the size of the liquid containment area is too small. It lasts a little more than an hour. We had a Young Living diffuser for several years and were used to having a two to three hour diffuse time. The trade off, pricing vs the inconvenience of refilling the ZAQ more often.</li>
            <li> In the last 2 years I have been pleased with the results with using essential oils. After the disappointment of my expensive diffuser breaking down I opted for this diffuser based on other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It emits a nice mist and my kids enjoy the color changing too. I like the modern, clean look. Easy to clean and gets the job done at an affordable price! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Despite some negative reviews I ordered and could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;I use with peppermint essential oil.  Does only cover one room.  I&lt;br /&gt;am considering the purchase of a second one.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed!  At first I really loved this item...it worked great, and although it didn&#x27;t spread the scent as much as I&#x27;d have liked, it did a good enough job.  However, after owning this about  2 months, it now will not work!  I&#x27;ve taken great care of it, but the mist will not come out of the hole in the top.  Instead, the mist stays inside, and I have to manually lift off the lid every few minutes get it to produce through the hole.  So frustrating!  And now Amazon is saying it can&#x27;t be returned, which is frustrating for a Prime Member who expects good service.</li>
            <li> Everything was fine. I really enjoyed this diffuser until last night when it stopped working. It had just finished up and I refilled it for another run. I hit the button and it now reacts like there&#x27;s no water in it at all. It&#x27;s only been 3 months. I unplugged it and let it dry out over night and still nothing works. I can&#x27;t recommend this diffuser to anyone because it&#x27;s obviously not a quality piece. Now I have to tell my sister that her X-mas present was junk. Find something that&#x27;s worth the money. This is not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I contacted Noor about the warranty and they gave me some basic troubleshooting information that was useless. Then they notified me that there are replacement ceramic disks that you have to buy to replace the one in the diffuser. The only thing is, they don&#x27;t sell the ceramic disks ANYWHERE. You have to contact Noor and make a warranty claim before they will get back to you with this information. You would hope that a honorable manufacture wouldn&#x27;t hide those details from the consumer. They offered to send me replacement disks but I have to perform my own repair. How does that not void the warranty in the future? I would not recommend this diffuser to ANYONE!!</li>
            <li> What I love about it is that ALL the oil (floating on top) is gone after a while, leaving only clear water behind, whereas with other white plastic diffusers, this is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;i also like how the button controls are all on the front. Good design all around.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Changes colors &amp; turns off to dim. On smaller side but puts out nice mist. My first one was defective &amp; I missed return due date by a few days, but excellent customer service took care of that for me!!! Happy!!!! Thanks Mubashir.</li>
            <li> All in all I am happy with my purchase. It needs to be placed in an open area in a room, not just in a corner which is what I had done initially- The automatic shut off feature is very nice as well as the color changing lights. I had been wanting one if these for a while and although I thought it was a bit pricey I&#x27;m glad I went with this option, it works very well.</li>
            <li> I love the ZAQ Noor Multi Color Litemist Diffuser does everything it says it does and everything I hoped it would. It diffuses the essential oils I love, and the scent carries throughout the room. The diffuser works as soon as you hit the power button the mist starts to fill the air. This is a powerful yet silent diffuser that works. You will be happy with this diffuser, the simple yet sleek design will fit in all decors. The unit will let you use it with lights on or off, and one fill will last up to 4 hours and automatically shut off. This was one of the easiest to operate and fill diffusers I have ever owned. From the box to my table 5 mins and I was good to go! This diffuser deserves more than 5 stars!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for diffusing essential oils.  I&#x27;ve never had one before and was worried from other reviews it would break within a few uses. Not the case!  I put in a few drops of oil &amp; water and once it is turned on, you can see the vapor coming out of the top immediately.  I use the morphing color mode during the day but turn the light off for diffusing at bedtime (3 presses of the button).  Note that even turning the light off, it emits a slightly blue glow on the top and on/off button.  I am considering purchasing another one for the living room.</li>
            <li> Love the changing lights. It&#x27;s got good output..auto shut off feature is great because I keep it on my nightstand.</li>
            <li> I liked the automatic shut off after 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;we didn&#x27;t use the changing colors option, but it was cute&lt;br /&gt;but the product stopped working after 1 month and is now sitting broken on my son&#x27;s nightstand&lt;br /&gt;and I have to purchase another one.  At $49.99, I expected more from this diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed</li>
            <li> We use this in a massage setting in a professional office. It does work quite well. The only thing we do not like about it is you are unable to completely turn off the blue light. You can essentially dim it, but you cant get rid of it all together. That blue light can be quite distracting if you are trying to relax/mediate, etc. But it works well and runs completely silent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also we noticed that if you overfill the unit, even slightly, it doesn&#x27;t want to diffuse. We have found it best to fill the unit just under the fill line.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this diffuser with my essential oils. I like that it turns off automatically.</li>
            <li> Cool product.&lt;br /&gt;Put a few drops of oil in, depending on the fragrance, and fill with water to line/groove and just push power button on, it&#x27;s that easy! Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I received the item right on time. I set it up on top of my desk and used it the first time at night before going to sleep. I really like the color changing feature. The smell doesn&#x27;t travel far but it&#x27;s good enough for an average sized bedroom. When I used it the second time, the diffuser went off after like only one hour and there was still plenty of liquid inside. I tried turning it on again but it just won&#x27;t turn on even after plugging and plugging the power cord couple of times. Bad luck. I had received a defective one. I should have contacted Amazon and have them send a replacement but my curiosity got the better of me. I decided to open up the device and see whats wrong. It wasn&#x27;t that hard to take it apart. Surprisingly to me, there was very little circuitry going on inside. Just about 4 small circuit boards connected to each other. I found the source of the problem. The wire that was soldered onto the power supply circuit board was extremely loose. It was just barely hanging on. So I took out a soldering iron and soldered the wire on the board. turned it on and waaalaaa it works like a charm. Aside from the loose wire, this is a pretty good essential oil diffuser.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my wife.  I like it so much, I bought one for the office.  It creates Zen wherever you need it.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this after seeing the product being used in a yoga class. I love how it looks with the freaky changing light color and the fact that it&#x27;s shaped kind of like a space ship. In the yoga class, I really enjoyed how it filled the whole room with an amazing, relaxing scent and I wanted this at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy and excited to find the same product on Amazon so I can now have this at home. I work from home and find that aromatherapy helps me de-stress throughout the work day and I also enjoy it for relaxing at night. I am using a stress reliever essential oil blend right now and it&#x27;s very nice. Great product!</li>
            <li> I like this machine and would recommend it .  It is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;The changing lights are nice and you can turn them off.</li>
            <li> Good diffuser for the price</li>
            <li> Works great, very stylish.  Wish the base came in  a different color other than white though.  I love the option to change the lighting also.</li>
            <li> While I am not pleased with the manufacturing country, I am very pleased with the way this inexpensive aromatherapy diffuser works.  The light show is soothing and the mist is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I distribute oils through a well known essential oils company. Their diffusers are much more expensive and less durable.&lt;br /&gt;  This brand has survived many drops and tons of use.&lt;br /&gt;  I just bought and am using my 2nd if this exact model.&lt;br /&gt;  It is my 3rd of this brand and I recommend it to friends and family .&lt;br /&gt;Keep the price right and you will keep getting business .</li>
            <li> I received two of these as birthday gifts.  I opened one and used it four times, then it stopped working.  I&#x27;ve since read countless reviews that have had similar problems (the power button stops working).  Seems like it&#x27;s pure chance - maybe you get a good one, maybe you get a lemon.  Clearly there is a problem with this machine, but the manufactur does nothing to improve the quality.  I laughed when I read the following on the ZAQ website: \\&quot;We pride ourselves on the craftsmanship of our products. Each diffuser is made to last with durable materials and a sleek, compact shape that fits almost anywhere. We want to make sure our customers receive the best value possible every time they make a purchase. That&#x27;s why we only carry reliable, energy efficient diffusers that include many convenient features. You get a high quality product that will make your home more comfortable for years without expensive part replacements.\\&quot;  I am returning this one (thankfully within the Amazon return window) and purchasing a different machine from a different manufacturer.  I will give the other one a try but my expectations are quite low.  Buy with caution!</li>
            <li> You know, I wasn&#x27;t even sure I wanted any Diffuser at all--just seemed too....New Age for me.  (I&amp;#34;M really much more main stream.)  But my kids love it that my PJ&#x27;s always smell like lavender, so I thought, maybe it would help them sleep....and it did.  Further, it functions very reliably, with easy to understand directions.</li>
            <li> broke after a few months</li>
            <li> The Noor Litemist works great, we have a large open room/area and it starts working quickly.</li>
            <li> Working great so far.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works great but the description is misleading. The listing describes a &amp;#34;no light&amp;#34; mode. Although the light does dim, it will not turn off without turning the diffuser completely off. As I primarily use this at night, the &amp;#34;no light&amp;#34; mode was a selling point. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s bright enough to be used as a night light. I wish that I had saved the box to return it!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS diffuser. I did a lot of research before buying one of these, and I ultimately decided to go with this one. I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with it, and I feel I sleep better on the nights I sleep with it on. I&#x27;ve had and been using it for about 6 months now, and I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I use this diffuser all day and night. I love how it changes colors softening the room. It is very quiet and if it wasn&#x27;t for the steam coming out you would not know it was running. Great investment. I put Frankincense in mine to clear my thinking.</li>
            <li> I like the diffuser, but wish it held more water.  Seems like it runs out too fast for me.</li>
            <li> This is the first diffuser I have ever purchased. It is very quite and the changing light colors are soothing. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and the price was reasonable 😊</li>
            <li> Great little defuser!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean. Very quiet. Instant mist. Powerful aroma. Exactly what anyone would want in an EO diffuser. Have already recommended to several people.</li>
            <li> I went to a yoga studio and the aroma therapeutic scent of lavender was so relaxing I wanted to recreate the same feeling in the office. I&#x27;ve been researching for the best one. I found it. It&#x27;s a perfect size, very quiet and works well. The beautiful changing light is a visual bonus. Use high quality essential oil and it&#x27;ll make a big difference in bringing some calm to a high stress work environment.</li>
            <li> Broke after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this diffuser and changing the different oils around to obtain different results. I use it almost daily and feel it does help.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and much better than the taller version of the Essential Oil Diffuser which I previously bought from ZAQ</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a couple months now. I usually set it either once or two times a day to run with 3-4 drops of one of my essential oils. Generally, I like it and it makes the room smell nice. I like the look of the diffuser too, somewhat stylish on top of the dresser. It has options for different colored lights at the top or rotating colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that the scent doesn&#x27;t last the whole time the diffuser is running. I think the oil floats at the top, gets used in the first hour or two, and then in the second half it runs without diffusing much scent at all. I feel like it should have something in the water chamber that mixes the oil into the water as it runs.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it, was delivered fast, and works great, will have to order more for xmas..&lt;br /&gt;Joyce</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:dbf36eabd4bfcd0da2bb4ea9c26b41a0]] In this video I am showing how the device functions. Note: I did not have any functionality issues with it in 1 year of regular use, including with citrus essential oils. Please feel free to ask questions!</li>
            <li> Its a nice size - beautiful design and VERY quiet. The price was fair and I love that this cold air diffuser fills the room with beautiful scents for hours after its been turned off. The pretty plumes of essential oil &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; is a nice sign its diffusing. I just may order another one for the bedroom!</li>
            <li> This product really works great...pumps out a large amount of  aromatherapy mist literally for hours upon hours without refilling. Very quiet, and even turns off when the water gets too low. Exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> I really like this, but, wish it operated longer on the amount of water it will hold.  It only runs for a couple of hours.  If you are shopping for one, the similar-sized one from Doterra is better in this regard.</li>
            <li> Love it. WORKS EXACTLY AS IT SAID IT WOULD....REALLY SPREADS THE SCENT AROUND THE WHOLE FIRST FLOOR. THIS IS MY FIRST DIFFUSER...NOW I DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW I LIVED WITHOUT ONE!! GOOD BARGAIN TOO</li>
            <li> For a first time user of essential oils this diffuser has been great. Didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because you can&#x27;t use oils such as lemon or orange  (acid based oils) in it. But honestly super cute with the different colors you can choose from and does a wonderful job of filling my downstairs with different essential oils! I&#x27;m 40 weeks pregnant and I&#x27;ll be taking it to the hospital with me as well!</li>
            <li> I really am enjoying my Zaq Diffuser. It will run for 4 hrs or longer, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and looks nice in any room. Great price also. I just wish I could run Citrus oils through it. On the instructions, it advises against it. But over all, it&#x27;s a great diffuser!</li>
            <li> Pretty shape, nice color changing , functions well , just lasts such a short period of time.  Water container  is so small.&lt;br /&gt;Have to fill every few hours.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser prior I had a young living diffuser and it had stopped working and I think this one is better and much cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;Really, really happy and satisfied with this diffuser!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to give this 5 stars because it only does a very small area, however it does exactly as I was told it would do. Soooo if you want to use this in an area bigger than 8 X 10 I would say don&#x27;t bother... good for a small bathroom but not anything bigger...It also just stays on for a very short time... As for me, if it did a bigger area I would LOVE it, if I wanted it for a small area I would LOVE it, but I wanted it for my bedroom which is 22 X 26 and this little guy is lost in it....</li>
            <li> After doing a lot of research, I decided to go with this diffuser. It works well, is easy to use and will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product over the others, based on appearance and reviews.  One reviewer in particular said they could &amp;#34;not believe how small it was.&amp;#34;  Based on that review I was expecting a teeny tiny little thing.  This diffuser is very easy to operate, works amazingly well, is very attractive and it is not as small as I was expecting.  I actually looked around my house to find something of a similar size to compare it to.  It is about the height and diameter of a large double sized toilet paper roll.  You have to factor in the conical shape, but its substantial enough to get the job done, and done well!  I have had visitors comment on how nice my house smells and when they see it, they comment on how cool it is! I would highly recommend this.  I do not write reviews that often, though I do shop online a lot.  I just felt that the  &amp;#34;too small&amp;#34; comment was unjustified so I am putting in my two cents.</li>
            <li> Love the multi changing lights. Great for the kids. Only thing wish their was a timer. You have to manual turn it off yourself or it will turn off when the water runs out.</li>
            <li> This works great!  It use it most days and it is very soothing.</li>
            <li> After owning this for a month, it would not shut off after the water evaporated. A tad dangerous.</li>
            <li> Leaves surface around it very wet. Must be used on durable surface or with some kind of protective mat.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this diffuser -- so much so that I have purchased three of them, either for myself or as gifts for other people. I use mine frequently and it is still going strong 9 months later. The unit puts out a continuous mist and the scent of the oil fills the room. The unit has an automatic shut off. There are three light settings -- rotating light color, one light color of your choice, or no light. The light puts out a gentle, soft, soothing glow. Be aware that even with the &amp;#34;no light&amp;#34; option there is a bit of a glow, so if using this while trying to sleep, that might be an issue for you.</li>
            <li> Functional and quiet. My only complaint is that even with the &amp;#34;lights off&amp;#34; option, there is still quite a lot of blue light coming from the power button. Might not be good for light sleepers sensitive to light.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and simple.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well!</li>
            <li> The Body Electric in St. Pete uses this in their lobby and I decided to order it after seeing it in operation a few times.  It&#x27;s a nice fine vaporizer and I ordered the therapeutic oils to go with it.  I use this every night on my bed table with lavender.  It&#x27;s very nice.  I am ordering more as gifts for my friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 2 year olds room in an effort to help him sleep better. He loves it. This is a great unit, small and easy to use and clean. The colors are pleasant and it is quiet. It seems to be the right size for the room, not sure how it would do in a larger space. I really like it a lot because it is quiet and easy to use however I wish it lasted longer then 3-4 hours. I also wish that there was an option to turn the lights off entirely. It can be set to nightlight mode which is a pleasant dark blue light, or you can hold it on any of the other colors, however there is not a setting to turn the lights off completely, which I would like for nighttime use. Other than my personal preferences, the unit is really very nice and works well. We have never had any problems with it and I have been using it nightly for about 6 months.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser!  Perfect size and just the right amount of time.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to receive this item. I love it and use it every day.</li>
            <li> After receiving this diffuser, we used it about a dozen times, and it worked fine.  Then, it stopped emiitting any mist.  The diffusing mechanism appeared to be working (the water at the bottom was being agitated), but no mist developed.  I sent it back for a refund, and I&#x27;m not sure about trying another one.</li>
            <li> Love it! Love it! Love it!  I own two of them.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  I have two.  One in my bedroom and the other in my office.  Just perfect size for a small room.</li>
            <li> This was the best looking diffuser I could find out there. I really like it. Only thing is you can&#x27;t use citrus scents, but there are plenty of other great essential oils out there!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it&#x27;s ease of use and auto shutoff.  Wish it could take citrus but maybe all diffusers have the same problem.</li>
            <li> Wonderful diffuser! I recommended it to my physical therapist who buys diffusers wholesale and didn&#x27;t like her current greenair spa vapor diffusers. It makes my whole house smell wonderful and lasts for about 4 hours. Don&#x27;t let the small size bring you down! It&#x27;s powerful and the light changing effects make it pleasant to look at as well. I use synergy essential oils with my ZAQ Noor and everyone that comes over asks me where I got it. My husband was skeptical at first but now he can&#x27;t wait to come home and turn it on. Love it!</li>
            <li> We use this to diffuse essential oils throughout the house.  We have a couple of these as the kids like them as well.  We use the NOW essential oils in various combinations to create different moods and for aromatherapy.  It is good to read about aromatherapy to better understand how essential oils can contribute to one&#x27;s health and well being ([...] ,[...]) to get the most out of this product.    It is very simple to use.  It comes with a top which lifts off exposing a small reservoir into which go the water and the drops of essential oils.  You fill to the line and put the top back on.  Then you plug in the device, press the button and it starts the ultrasonic engine which vibrates the oil and water resulting in a refreshing plume of vapor that carries the essential oil scent throughout the room.  It is quiet making at most a very low hum, but nothing that we have found to be of any consequence.  Experienced aromatherapy users combine different oils to help relax, stimulate or set a tone in the environment.  Two oils we use frequently are lavender and peppermint.  Lavender is very relaxing and peppermint very refreshing.    The ZAQ diffuser has been very reliable for us.  When it starts it lights the top changing into different colors as it works.  There are settings that allow for the user to set a single color or to turn off the lights altogether.  Once you turn it on you can forget about it as it turns off automatically once all of the oil and water have been diffused.  We have been very happy with both our diffusers, no fuss, no muss, no problems.  This has turned out to be an excellent purchase for us and we will be purchasing a couple more in the future to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> I love the multi colors (that can also be turned off). The auto shut off is a must have. Do not expect it to do your whole house, just a room or two, but it does a great job!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this item and put it to use. It works very well and is relatively quiet. I will update this review if I find that there are any issues.</li>
            <li> We love this infuser.  My children love the cool colors, but we like its quiet and gentle dispersement of our favorite essential oils.</li>
            <li> This product works well. Delivered quickly &amp; as described. Only drawback is no citrus oils can be used. Also definitely more appropriate for small room.</li>
            <li> Already broken after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> luv the diffuser...disappointed with the manual,  should come with cleaning instructions and blend recipes.  Otherwise great~</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for but sadly after only using it for a month it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! Want stronger diffusion, more drops of oil,  i do want a bigger ML. 80 is for a small room.</li>
            <li> This is great for diffusing oils!  Ours still works great after lots of use.</li>
            <li> Great little item. Buy if you want an effective diffuser with almost no sound. Don&#x27;t buy if you are hypersensitive to light and expect to use it when you sleep or if you are looking to diffuse citrus (orange/lemon) oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The three light setting controls (changing, any in the range, or off) are nice.&lt;br /&gt;-It works well at its primary function: diffusing essential oils. Much nicer than a candle or Glade Plug-In, as you can change it and use high-quality oils to fill your space.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m in my 20s, and ultrasonic diffusion makes me feel like I&#x27;m living in the future.&lt;br /&gt;-It is quiet. Not silent, but very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The reservoir is a bit small (usually lasts a couple of hours).&lt;br /&gt;-You can&#x27;t fully turn off the LED on/off switch light, which is bright in a dark room.&lt;br /&gt;-No citrus (lemon/orange).</li>
            <li> Great diffuser.  I wish I could run it without the light.  That is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Looks great, still working flawlessly after heavy usage.  Wipe out every once and awhile and you should be good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t place near paper or other items that might suffer humidity damage, I&#x27;ll say no closer than two feet as the mist dissipates quickly...</li>
            <li> Nice size and changing colors loved by my 12 year old.  Vapor is nice flow and lasts long... Water container easily manageable.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  This is our first Diffuser.</li>
            <li> Fantastic diffuser! So happy with it!</li>
            <li> Love the shape and view of this ZAQ item.  It feels and looks like a higher quality item than others I have seen on the market.  One downside is that with its prescribed water fill, it does not last though the evening.  Had it been a little larger, it would be perfect.  As it is currently sized, it is prefect for a small office or home room.  If you are looking for something that doesn&#x27;t shut off at night and is able to continue to the next day, you may want to consider something larger.  Otherwise, I love the light changing effect.  Its shape is reminiscent of a small volcano with the vapors rising from the top.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this but I&#x27;m so glad I bought it! I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now. My friend owns the doterra one (which costs way more than this one!) I&#x27;m convinced they are both the same unit with different names on it. They look the same and better yet, they both do the same exact thing! I use it everyday with peppermint oil for my migraines.</li>
            <li> Awesome diffuser and we love the lights!!! Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Only complaint is that there is always a light emitted.  So I cannot use at night when going to sleep.  Otherwise it is a great little diffuser.</li>
            <li> So far this has worked great for it&#x27;s purpose. I use it in a bathroom instead of air freshener. It is really easy to use and runs for quite a while. If I were going for medicinal purposes I might use something more powerful, but I&#x27;ve tried it in my downstairs and it quickly scents up a 300 sq ft area as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this item and loved it -- for 4 months of periodic use -- but then it randomly quit working.  (And I didn&#x27;t use it all the time, either.)  My husband, who is quite handy with electronics and fixing circuit boards, said it was impossible to fix.  Of course, the warranty expired about 2 months ago, so now I&#x27;m left looking for another one.  Throwing the entire thing away seems like such a waste to me... low-quality electronic gadgets is a big pet peeve of mine!</li>
            <li> Works great!  Would have been nice if it came with samples.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!  It&#x27;s easy to figure out, you don&#x27;t even need instructions.  I plugged this baby in and within one minute flat you could already smell the delicious scent of the lemon oil I put in there.  I liked it so much, I ordered another one.  If you like your home to smell heavenly, look no further.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I loved this unit, but when I ordered, I teetered between it, and the Smiley Daisy. I wish that I had originally purchased the Daisy. The unit itself is very visually pleasing to the eye, so a bit more in line with &amp;#34;it looks great&amp;#34; with the decor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong the unit does indeed work, but I found out after actually going out on a limb and buying the smaller Daisy that it does not throw scent very well(my primary reason for purchase) and hence my three star. I like the unit, but just don&#x27;t love it. It does turn off automatically after a few hours of use and complete evaporation of the water and EO mixture. And it does throw scent, you just will have to actually use more oil. That, and the fan unit seems a bit on the weak side compared to the Daisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall thought is that yes, it does indeed function, but not as effectively as others. However, the disign alone is great..</li>
            <li> Seems to clog up after a couple of months even with regular cleaning.</li>
            <li> I like the way this diffuses, but I wish they didn&#x27;t blatantly lie about the light off function. Not one of the ZAQ diffusers has a light off function. It just stays a blue light. For me, it is very distracting when trying to sleep. It&#x27;s fine that most people are ok with this light near them, but for those that prefer the dark, it would be nice to not have false advertising. This also makes me wonder about what else they just lie about such as the quality of their oils...</li>
            <li> This is my first trying a diffuser like this. I have a humidifier that I bought on HSN about a year ago&lt;br /&gt;Instead of heat dispersion it vibrates sending tiny particle of water. This operates on the same principle, except you add essential oil to the water. I bought some Clementine essential oil on Barefut the other day. They has been putting a different oil up free every week. I put some in this this evening and my granddaughter ran over and took a whiff, saying &amp;#34; Mmmmmm.. that smells orangie!!!&amp;#34;.. it did.. a few seconds later she said &amp;#34; Look! Its blue!!! Now its turning green!!&amp;#34; If nothing  else it as entertainment for her..lol I have my  diffuser sitting in front of my air conditioner.  It amplifies  the scent by blowing out belong the normal range...&lt;br /&gt;I normally use the tea light candle ones. They are nice, but I do get nervous over the flames burning in every room. I&#x27;m wanting to get one of these for different parts of my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;br /&gt;MY No Nonsense Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt; I could copy the description or retell you that you have already read in the description, But you&#x27;ve already read it. I will try and tell you what I see, Smell, hear, what happens, and my opinion as well as I can. So it&#x27;s easier for you decide if this is the product is suitable for the job you need it to do or for what you&#x27;re wanting to give someone. I have money to buy the things I really need. However, there are times when I have had difficult time reading or watching a no nonsense plain laymen&#x27;s description.&lt;br /&gt;As a frugal shopper that I am, I used a coupon code for this item in order to purchase and review this product. I use coupon codes that I receive before I purchase the items I use and shop on discount site regardless  and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.&lt;br /&gt; I have no connection to this seller and I shop for items I use in my home or give as gifts. I have never been offered anything in return and at times I give no feedback.My review is my honest opinion and experience with this item. I&#x27;m  rarely going to give a perfectly polished review and very often I don’t spellcheck or my dyslexia takes over.. But I will do my best to be honest with you.</li>
            <li> Compact and very easy to use. I love the multiple LED light settings. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the diffuser. Its not too small or too big. Its very easy to setup and love the versatility of colors and that it works with any oils (except citrus) the diffuser really makes my house smell good. It not noisy at all and my kids love the different color settings. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend,</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.  Works great.  Diffuses the right amount for a very large great room.  Works for hours and shuts off on its own.  I get compliments from everyone who comes over on the look.  Super happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I have this on my desk at work with my favorite doTERRA essential oil in it. Easy to use, pretty to look at</li>
            <li> just not what its advertise to be hardly any vapor come out of cone just a subpar piece of eqipment</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser - would give it 5 stars except for the fact that, even when the light feature is off, there still is a fair bit of light while it&#x27;s running. Since I can&#x27;t tolerate any light when I&#x27;m trying to sleep, I was looking for a diffuser with either no light or the ability to shut the light off, which this one is supposedly able to do.  So... still looking for a diffuser I can use at night. Any recommendations? :)</li>
            <li> This product delivers. Simple to use and your water and essential oils give you a wonderful and healthy scent. Clean look too.</li>
            <li> quit working within 2 months</li>
            <li> Great device for the price. Small, compact and easy to use. Perfect for the nightstand in a bedroom or office, fills the whole house. My only complaint is that you can not diffuse citrus oils because they are to acidic for the machine. Overall great product for the price :)</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:5555940dab86cd10f151f56ac00b04a3]] I&#x27;m an essential oil enthusiast and own multiple diffusers. The Zaq Noor Multicolor Diffuser holds 80ml of water and is on the smaller side of my diffuser collection, but puts off more mist than some of my much larger models. Since it doesn&#x27;t use heat, my oils keep their benefits and integrity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser cycles through bright LED light in a range of beautiful, vibrant colors. I can push the single button to turn it on and begin this cycle. A second time to hold on the color of my preference, a 3rd time to dim the lights and a 4th time to turn the unit off. It operates quietly and cannot be heard unless I&#x27;m within 2 feet of the diffuser. When I can hear it, the water bubbling inside sounds like a babbling brook and I like it enough to keep it next to my head in bed at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the diffuser holds only 80ml of water, in can operate continuously for 4 hours. It will shut off automatically if the water level becomes too low, so I can turn it on before bed and not have to worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I&#x27;m very pleased with the overall quality and function of the Zaq Noor Litemist Diffuser. I&#x27;m happy with the amount of mist, ease of use and the included measuring cup is convenient for knowing exactly how much water to put in.</li>
            <li> This adorable aromatherapy diffuser is a new favorite! I have another and I prefer this ZAQ Noor over my other one. It fits in with my decor, although I think it would work for just about anyone. It&#x27;s not an eye sore and is more of a piece of art. My favorite thing about this product is the multi color changing top along with the dancing sound of water ever so softly while diffusing. It works great! We use it in our small living room to add a more zen like feel to our room. I would highly recommend this little diffuser as we love it!</li>
            <li> First time ever using such a thing. I was a little skeptical at first but after a week of using lavender oil and distiller water I have slept better then I have in a long time, definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews on this product, and several similar ones, before purchasing. While I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, I cannot say enough good things about it. Fantastic addition to an office  - relaxing and soothing through the hectic day. Purchasing more for other spaces.</li>
            <li> Perfect to use with my YLEO. I really like this one better than the one I got from the company, I&#x27;ll probably get another one (or two) for all rooms in my house!</li>
            <li> Arrived at my door super fast! At first I was hesitant because it suggested not using any citrus oils in it and that is what I like. I had a friend who bought one months before i did and she uses any oil she wants in it and it still works great. I still haven&#x27;t used pure citrus oils but I have used blends and it works very well. My husband thought it was a stupid idea at first and now loves it. I would buy this again and so would my husband.</li>
            <li> This is just OK...I feel like it doesn&#x27;t push the steam/oil out far enough so it really only smells in the room you put it in and doesn&#x27;t go much further.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this diffuser.  It works perfectly.  I only wish it covered a larger area but it is a great diffuser and I will buy another.</li>
            <li> So glad I went with this.one. Last several horrs and covers a large area.  Love it so much I plan to order one for my office!  Love the soothing changing colors too.</li>
            <li> great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It works very well and lasts four to five hours. Doterra Oils are very effective. When I tried a less expensive oil it was not as good.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I chose this diffuser. I love it! I diffuse essential oils all the time since I bought it. It is small, cool shaped, and diffuses the smell well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: even when the light is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; it&#x27;s still very obvious. So when I diffuse as I am falling asleep in a dark room, there is still some light. Similar to that of a night light. It doesn&#x27;t bother me but I just wanted to share the information.</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser the whole 13 days it lasted.  I currently have an email in to the company to try and get them to send me another one. For 39.99 it should have last longer then that.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, use it almost every day. Makes my house smell amazing, my daughter loves the changing colors. It works great I need to get another for work.</li>
            <li> I would give 6 stars if I could.  I didn&#x27;t even know these types of oil diffusers existed and was just using the little oil burner with a tea light.  In fact, I had several oils just sitting in my drawer sitting unused because using the burner was such a deterrent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more fear of overheating or candle burning with the auto-shut off feature, so I use this on a daily basis.  So nice to curl up with a book (or Kindle!), relax and enjoy the oil scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rave about this thing and am SO happy that I now have a &#x27;clean&#x27; alternative to scenting my home without chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. Have had it for about 4 months now and works great. I use it 2-3 times weekly. I use citrus frequently and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> I thought the mist would last longer than two hours.  It needs to be refilled that often.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for over a year with no problems at all. Love it!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this and how defusing essential oils has improved our quality-of-life. We seem to get rid of colds much faster now.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Wish there was a function to turn off light completely but the dimmest light is still fine. I have this is in my daughters room and use it every night. Recommend and may purchase another soon.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I was so disappointed in this diffuser.  Not even 5 months after I bought it it stopped working.  It always leaked, even when it was half full, but I just put it on a plate and kept using it.  But now it has stopped working completely.  I even took it apart and cleaned it, but it was no use.  Cheaper ones have worked better for me than this on, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I liked this so much, I bought a 2nd one for my office. Only bummer is that I wish you could operate this without even the &amp;#34;dimmer&amp;#34; light on; I&#x27;m a light sleeper. Hoping also that it won&#x27;t die after a few months, as per other reviews. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> This started making a horrible buzzing noise on the second use.</li>
            <li> Even on the &amp;#34;lowest&amp;#34; light setting - it is still much too bright to be used in a bedroom at night.  Otherwise I think it should work fine - I&#x27;ve had another brand with a larger water chamber that I would imagine lasts longer than this one (it is also a cool-mist technology).</li>
            <li> I just got this.  It worked great for two nights.  Then it started shorting out.  It would turn on, then turn itself off.  I&#x27;m frustrated that I got a bum product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I&#x27;d love to like the product.  It&#x27;s easy to fill up, looks easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of parts to lose.  I wish it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, the power button lights up blue when it&#x27;s on.  I like to set the color on red at night so that the blue light doesn&#x27;t keep us awake.  But the button lights up blue anyway.</li>
            <li> Great design, good quality, works great! Love the automatic turn off system. Good product for the price. Bought 3!</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews I decided to purchase this diffuser to use in my bedroom with my Young Living essential oils.  I am really pleased with how quiet the unit it and how steady the mist diffuses through out the room.  It has automatic shut off when the water runs out which is nice. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the setting for &#x27;no light&#x27; really stays a dim blue, which is fine if you want a night light, but I find it distracting.  If you need a diffuser for a living room or large area I would get a larger sized diffuser.  This is good for a small area.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an essential oil diffuser so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with.  So far (used about a month) I really enjoy it especially when using my oils at night.  It has three light setting.&lt;br /&gt;The first one is strictly white, the second goes through an array of colors and the third is a soft dimmed blue.  The diffuser is pretty quiet other then a little bit of bubbling from the water being diffused. I am diffusing in a 1200 Sqare Foot area and its keeping up!  My house smells like essential oils.  My favorite is using it at night to diffuse oils for sleep.  I do put the diffuser on the floor as the soft blue light is just a little bit more light then I like.  I appreciate the automatic off when the oils and water run out. I gave 4 stars because I dont have anything else to compare it too&lt;br /&gt;The size is great... like someone else said, about the size of a large toilet paper roll.</li>
            <li> easy to use. love it. does not provide aroma for large room.</li>
            <li> Wish this had a little fan in it or something; works well for diffusing oils, but the vapors just kind of drift out and fall. If I turn my ceiling fan on it helps circulate the vapors. My sister has a Young Living diffuser that seems to really PUSH the vapors out into the air, and the smell circulates better.</li>
            <li> Runs for an extended period of time on a small amount of water and oil. Has been very low maintenance. Is a little loud but the sound is similar to a white noise machine which I sleep with every night so the noise is not a problem for me. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> This little guy is amazing.  It&#x27;s actually very attractive as well.  My daughter loves the light changing mode, although I don&#x27;t really see any other benefit to that besides entertaining your children :)  Works great and always shuts itself off when it supposed to.  We love it.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is so easy to use. It&#x27;s relatively small so it&#x27;s not something to use in a large room, but I love it for my bedroom.</li>
            <li> Clients and I enjoy the uncompromised properties of the essential oils in the aiv.it works very well! Love it much!</li>
            <li> Cheap diffuser that hardly fills the room with any smell. It&#x27;s messy and poorly made for the price. Do not recommend wasting expensive oils in this bad diffuser.</li>
            <li> What an awesome diffuser.  It is very quiet and really does a nice job of getting the essential oils into the air.  I also love the changing colors as the unit runs and the option associated with the lights.</li>
            <li> Nice diffuser.  Great at what it does, wish there was an option to turn off the muti color light display for bedroom night use.  Easy to use and easy to clean.  One fill of the internal reservoir last for hours!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this to work.</li>
            <li> I like the shape and it doesn&#x27;t make much noise. The changing colors is a nice feature. It does go through water pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for about two weeks.  So far... it is very easy to use and I love how simple it is to clean it (both the base and top).  I&#x27;ve found wiping the inside and top clean after every use removes the smell of the previous oil.  That makes it easy to smell whatever new oil I&#x27;m placing in there.  I&#x27;m surprised that 80ml of water lasts for about 4 hours.  I hope the product continues to work as well as it has so far.  If not, I will update this review.</li>
            <li> Great way to have natural fragrance by simply adding essential oil.  Sensitive to chemical smells so this is really great.</li>
            <li> I have had this diffuser for a couple months now.  Works great and stays on for 3-4 hours.  We use it to diffuse our doTERRA essential oils to help us sleep!  The only problem is that there is an option to have the light on or off.  When the light is off there is still a bright blue glow from the diffuser.  We have to cover it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get the darn thing to turn on at all!</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser purchase, I like it, it works well, I only wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Quiet fan and the light on it is soft without being too bright. The color options are nice as well. Simple to get setup and started, just fill and push a button.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  We love how it changes color and works great with our thieves oil.  It is a great size, not too big or small.  It is very easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li> Got this one as a gift for someone and they gave me same gift:) I like how it works with oils, not so noisy(comparing to my humidifier). Love the color changing option, and the light is not so bright. I guess the only thing is the button to turn it on is a little on a bright side comparing to the light element above it. But I just turn it around so I don&#x27;t see that light.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it could turn off by itself when it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 5 weeks to late to return to Amazon. DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser. Use for all my doTerra oils and definitely want to order another for my bedroom.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. It puts out just the right amount of mist. Quiet enough to use while kids are sleeping and the dimming light feature is a plus. Considering ordering an additional one if it continues to hold up well to frequent use.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive when I began reading reviews on diffusers...so I closed my eyes and picked this one.  Hooray! Perfect for living room, office and bedroom. I need to buy two more!</li>
            <li> It does the job its supposed to do:  quietly diffuse oils.&lt;br /&gt;However it fails to deliver on an advertised promise: no-light mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you click the &#x27;on&#x27; button three times it is supposed to go into a no-light mode,  What really happens is that the dark blue lights are on.  Barely noticeable at during the day,  but glowing at night.  When you want black out in a bedroom (in this case a nursery)  that is a problem.&lt;br /&gt;That should be a deal breaker if you want to use this to help you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This second item of concern is that it doesn&#x27;t handle citrus oils.  All of my oil blends have a citrus oil in them.  I use them anyway.  So far no issues.  but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third item of contention is one common to almost all low-priced diffusers.  You cannot hook it up to a timer because there is no &#x27;auto-on&#x27; feature.  After 15 minutes you can no longer smell the oils,  thats normal.  The receptors are &#x27;fatigued&#x27;.  Ideally oils should be diffused 15 minutes every hour. Most diffusers do not have a built-in timer to handle this.  The workaround is that you can have an aftermarket timer. However, if you unplug a an item and plug it back in and it does not automatically re-start,  you know a timer will not work on this item.</li>
            <li> This little mister is awesome. Great value and works just as well as expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I now have 2 of these diffusers and love them both</li>
            <li> This works great! It is a little noisy, so not great at night, but otherwise, works just perfectly!</li>
            <li> The only disadvantage to this product is the water capacity</li>
            <li> Love love love!  Perfect for all my essential oils.  And love how small and portable it is so we can move it from room to room.  Will be ordering a second one so we can put one in my daughter&#x27;s room at night too.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. The only thing I do not like is the &amp;#34;no light&amp;#34; feature is still blue lol. Don&#x27;t know if mine is defective or what but I would like he option of no light for night time</li>
            <li> This little diffuser works just fine, the only thing I dislike about it, is that the light stays on the entire time.  For those of you, like me, that can&#x27;t sleep with lights on, don&#x27;t buy to put in your bedroom.</li>
            <li> My son loves it, so far! Thank you! I might buy another one for myself!</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 of these in the last year. One of them works great and the other one died, which I only had a few months. The on/off button stuck and we can&#x27;t get it to work at all.</li>
            <li> Ordered on for my mom at Christmas n recently one for me! Love it</li>
            <li> It really works well but it could be a bit larger.</li>
            <li> Love it! The colors are pretty and stays on until it runs out of water. Smells nice with the oils- which depending on the quality can use as little as 4-5 drops.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment quickly and my oil diffuser was packed very well too!  I have been using it for 3 days straight now and the ZAQ is super easy to use, easy maintenance, and last as long as the description says!  I love the colour changing LED lights!  So neat!  Also, the ZAQ diffuser shuts itself off when there is no more water...so if you forget to turn it off, it will turn off when there is no more water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been rinsing it out and drying it every time I use it and switch oils too, which it says you are suppose to do as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY happy with my purchase and service!</li>
            <li> I bought this little diffuser about 2 months ago. It works perfectly and I use it daily, sometimes keep it running all day. It&#x27;s pro&#x27;s are that its small, the colors are vivid and fade really nicely (my kids love watching it change). It quiet, you can hear a little motor sound, but I sleep with it by my head, so it&#x27;s barely noticeable. The light on it to signify that it is on is fairly bright, I have to point it away from my face. It doesn&#x27;t run all day without a refill, max of about 4 hours. It&#x27;s easy to refill, easy to clean. I don&#x27;t mind having to refill it every few hours, because I like a scent change. I love the auto off too. The only thing I would change is the size (I&#x27;d like it a little bit bigger) and I would add an intermittent setting. That&#x27;s it&#x27;s only drawbacks. I still love this little diffuser!</li>
            <li> This item just quit working after a month!  Was not able to return it.</li>
            <li> no problems, has worked great</li>
            <li> love this. I&#x27;ve purchased others &amp; this one has lasted the longest!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Looks cool and does the job perfectly! A little more expensive than i would have liked to pay, but i am nothing but happy with the product! and the wife loves it too, i guess thats all that matters</li>
            <li> Love this! Just wish it would diffuse a little longer.  This one goes for 3-4 hours but ZAQ makes other diffusers that go up to 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I do like this product however when I purchased this product I was under the assumption that the light on it would go out completely as I was placing in my bedroom.  I also read the directions and it states that it will go out but it just dims to a nightlight.  Not happy at all with this part.</li>
            <li> It works great! I&#x27;ve been using it every night since I received it on March 12th and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it! It does give off a soft blue glow in &amp;#34;night mode&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not bothersome to me.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Wish it stayed on longer than 4 hours but puts out a good mist.  The blue light is pretty while I am reading but I turn that off before sleeping as I would stare at it forever.</li>
            <li> Device stopped working completely a few days after purchase. This particular seller does NOT accept returns so I&#x27;m unable to get my money back. VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> This little diffuser works fantastically for a small to medium sized room. I like that I have the ability to use it with or without the lights. I was surprised to see other people state that it is overpriced. If you purchase a unit similar to this from one of the oil companies they tend to be double the price of this ZAQ brand. These work great in combination with essential oils to prevent illnesses.</li>
            <li> This adorable little diffuser is amazing!!  It is small, sleek, and the changing light is very cool and calming (and of course, it is nice to have the option of turning the light off when sleeping).  Not to mention it works great!!  It is quiet, efficient, and truly refreshes an entire room.  This diffuser creates a wonderful smelling, peaceful environment!!</li>
            <li> works well and looks nice sitting out</li>
            <li> Love this item! It&#x27;s cute and doesn&#x27;t look bulky at all. It stays on for hours and works wonderfully! I would purchase it again and recommend it to anyone looking for a diffuser.</li>
            <li> Though it does seem a bit overpriced for what you get, I do love the quality and sleek design of this machine. It is virtually silent, and fills the room with scent. Only downside is you can&#x27;t use citrus, citronella, and lemon essential oils with this machine because they are too corrosive. Too bad because I just bought a ton of synergy blends that contain citrus :( overall very pleased and really love using this!</li>
            <li> Cannot sleep without it now!</li>
            <li> We now use this instead of our bulky humidifier. Easy to load, easy to use, turns off when empty. Kid loves it.</li>
            <li> Working good so far. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use peppermint essential oil and my home smells amazing.  This product is easy to use and it&#x27;s so pretty.  I love the colors.</li>
            <li> Perfect and exactly what I needed. I was pleasantly surprised by the changing colors in the light- I didn&#x27;t know that was a feature.</li>
            <li> the diffuser looks nice, and work great, everybody at home feels the aroma, very quiet and the color changing  lights are an extra</li>
            <li> Would like to give it a better review but this one didn&#x27;t work for me after a few months. And unfortunately I&#x27;m outside of the window to return now. This is actually the second one of these that I purchased because I loved the first one so much. disappointed.</li>
            <li> This works great. Definitely for a smaller space, but great just the same. I diffuse essential oils all day long and it has been working great, no issues.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. I use it just about every day.i&#x27;m happy with it, it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> I really like this. However, do you use this in the same room as your animals, as the essential oils can kill your cats. Just be careful using this if you have animals. I shut the door to the room I am using it after doubly making sure no cat or dog is in there. I&#x27;ve always wanted an Essential Oil Diffuser and highly recommend this. Just use it safely without animals around.</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser Oct 2014.  I have LOVED it . . . until recently.  I use it with a variety of essential oils on a daily basis.  I love the way the oils fill my home. It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  My kids love the lights.  I have been so happy with this product.  Unfortunately, about a month ago, it stopped working properly.  It used to run completely out between 4-6 hours.  Now it will run for 10+ hours without using up all of the water.  Running this long, the diffuser becomes very hot to the touch.  I feel like I&#x27;m not getting the benefits of the oils any more and I&#x27;m concerned with letting it run so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed.  I expect products to last longer than 9 months!  I emailed the seller and haven&#x27;t gotten any response.</li>
            <li> I like it however I wish the aroma would reach further. I would recommend this for a small room.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. Sounds like a small gurgling creek. It only goes for 4 hours before it automatically shuts off, but the oil you put in it really makes a difference! Don&#x27;t put bad oils in it, and you will have a long lasting product. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> LOVE this!  For the money it is a great value and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I have had this diffuser 2 weeks and I like it. I researched many diffusers for my 1st purchase and I chose this one due to the ratings and cost. One water fill-up will last 3-4 hours then shuts off on its own. One recent review complained it didn&#x27;t smell either didn&#x27;t put any essential oil (EO) in it, not enough or not quality EO. I love making up my own EO blends to diffuse. I have also used citrus oils although it says not to due to corrosion but no issues yet. I like the changing colors and the options to have no light or a solid color. Only con is that you don&#x27;t have the option to choose your diffuse times but you could just shut it off on your own.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday for at least 2 full cycles. It improves the quality of my life and makes me happy. I pray it always works - it&#x27;s been a month now and it&#x27;s still going. It is extremely easy to clean and manage - like the apple version of atomizers.</li>
            <li> This is essentially a mini humidifier into which one may place essential oil.  It works great.  Water lasts a couple of hours.  Loved having this next to me with some eucalyptus oil when I was sick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every night for the last few weeks now and so far so good. No problems. It makes my room smell wonderful, I love the fact that you can pick the color, have it go through all of them or no color at all. Pretty good little machine.</li>
            <li> Sleek, silent. I just wish it had a bit more capacity;  I still get a good 3 hours of aromatherapy,  however I wish it was longer for when I have it going at night.</li>
            <li> Product produces the desired results and gives a very calming effect with the light and aroma.  Also with the ability to turn the light off it is great for night time also.</li>
            <li> My husband likes the way it looks and glows, says it&#x27;s relaxing. The boy thinks it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way that with just a little water and some oil, it seems to last for a long time and that it shuts off when it&#x27;s out. It&#x27;s perfect to put next to the bed when someone is sick with a little eucalyptus or on a shelf for any room that could use a little freshening or if you need a perk.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom for Christmas after comparing with several others.  This seemed like the most simple, best size, best features, best price.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that when the light is supposed to be off, it still emits a bright blue light that lights up a dark room. The only way to not have light coming from the diffuser is to turn it completely off. I like the automatic shut off.</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews about this diffuser I was skeptical , but this is a great little diffuser. It is very quiet and does a great job!!</li>
            <li> Worth the money-quiet and effective. Wish it had about more natural of an appearance versus being a hunk of plastic, but it definitely does the trick to diffuse oils :)</li>
            <li> First of all, I think this is a great product (4 stars), but I&#x27;m wondering why the price doubled in the last two months.  Amazon needs to bring the price down.  You can get the same diffuser for half this price by going to ZAq.com website and checking out other dealers.  that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m only giving it one star</li>
            <li> This works really well, and I enjoy the spa like atmosphere it causes in my room.  I wish there was a giant one.</li>
            <li> Does a great job.  Fills an 700 square foot space with scent (I use about 10 drops of essential oil) &amp; it keeps running for about 6 hours.  Small &amp; simple design blends into surroundings.  I had considered buying something more expensive, but so happy I went with this 1st.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this diffuser because it hasn&#x27;t stopped working yet. The mist is enough to make me put a cloth under it so my nightstand isn&#x27;t damaged. I would probably buy my next one with a larger diffuser opening. This isn&#x27;t distributing the scent over the entire room, which is what I was hoping for. I have traveled with it so that is a nice selling point. Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The unit is easy to operate and very quiet. Mist goes directly into the air so there is no mess.</li>
            <li> This is a diffuser for essential oils however the directions clearly state do not use citrus oils as it will destroy the diffuser.  I love some blends with citrus oils. I do use it with those blends knowing that my diffuser may not last as long as it should.  I like the changing colored lights and use it in my 3 year old&#x27;s room as a night light before bed at times. I also like the affordability of it.</li>
            <li> Received it today and plugged it right in.  Works instantly, helping send aroma throughout my house and clearing the air of mustiness.  LOVE IT!  Great product for a good price.</li>
            <li> Still in use almost a year later...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has numerous colors but the best part is the durability.  I have several oils that I like and we use it a lot.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed it... while it lasted. It operated very well for 5 days, then the button got stuck in the depressed position and would no longer work. Unfortunately, there is no obvious way to take it apart and fix the issue. I am pretty seriously considering buying another, though, in case this was a fluke.</li>
            <li> Works well, nice lights, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I use the Zaq Noor in my study during the day, and the Zaq Jellyfish in my bedroom at night. I love both!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Works well and easy to clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  It puts out way too much mist and almost makes my bedroom look like it&#x27;s thick with smoke.  I wish it had a low or high setting instead of just one.</li>
            <li> Excellent item.  Changes colors and turns itself off.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th one of these I have bought. I have given them as gifts and have been told it was the best gift ever received.</li>
            <li> I only gave two stars due to the fact that the light does not turn off as the description states. I tried contacting th company, Zaq directly, but never received a response. Otherwise I would have given it at least 4 stars. It&#x27;s very quiet and disperses scent throughout the room.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift, this item is awesome.</li>
            <li> six months to the day it broke. dont do it</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  I felt like I had to move it a bit closer to me than the Young Living diffuser to have the same effect.  Even when the light is supposed to be turned off, the light around the power switch is illuminated and shines up through the cone making it have a soft blue glow.  There is no way to completely turn off the light without shutting down the unit.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but for those who want to use it at night and like a dark room, it may not fit your needs.  Amazon says something about a warranty on the page for this product, but it did not come with any paperwork that indicated there was any kind of warranty.  Over all I would say that I am satisfied with the product, but that it does not meet all of the descriptions I read online.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil diffuser. Easy to clean, small, works great,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that, the &amp;#34;lights off&amp;#34; option does not actually turn the light off... at least not all the way. It is dimmer but not off. I want to use this while I am sleeping but the light is really annoying. I wish that there was an actual &amp;#34;no light&amp;#34; option.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping. The diffuser is very easy to clean and use. It&#x27;s relatively quiet, but a bit bright at night. It&#x27;s great for my&lt;br /&gt;Purposes and only uses a few drops of oil. It is quite small and takes up little room.</li>
            <li> I like this quite a bit - my only complaint is that even when the illumination is off a very bright blue light emits from the power button.&lt;br /&gt;I like to diffuse at bedtime and the glow makes it hard to fall asleep. Wish there was a way to have it run with a more subtle power indicator.</li>
            <li> A few months after i bought this, The &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; changed to a visible little line of mist that looked like a line of smoke coming up a few inches out of the diffuser then goes down. That does me no good as it is not filling the area with the essential oils I need. I hadn&#x27;t even used it that much, less than 20x. I scoured the user manual but there was no troubleshooting for this issue. for $40, i expected better. This happened awhile ago but recently I am missing a working diffuser greatly which reminded me to write a review.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome little pod. I use it with some essential oils for aromatherapy, and it works amazingly well. The essential oils are very well defused, and also it add some humidity to a dry room. Very relaxing to be in bed with the light. I like the colors of light, and the idea I can choose the color.</li>
            <li> This diffuser has been going strong for over a year!</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser for my wife&#x27;s birthday and she loved it.  Attractive and silent diffuser for permeating your entire house with gentle fragrances that will enhance the mood.  This diffuser can also gently change pastel colors to add an additional ambiance experiences.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son to have in his dorm room at college. He uses essential oils to help him sleep, study and relax.  He loves the changes in color (his artistic side). I wish it could diffuse intermittently (why its 4 out of 5 stars), but priced competitively, easy for him to use and seems to be well made. He has used it for one month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This diffuser does a great job of filling a room 24&#x27;X24&#x27; or less in size. I fits pretty much any décor and I particularly like the alternating colors displayed while it is running (there are options to display only one color or no color at all as well). Perhaps its best feature is that it turns itself off when finished. This is great for people who forget to turn things off or forget to monitor progress.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this item a few weeks ago. It was working at first and now only diffuses small amounts. I am so disappointed because of the price I paid. The design is very nice and everything else was fine; but my purpose was to use this not to look at it. I will not be buying one of these again.</li>
            <li> ...Just wish it had a bigger capacity.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:faf14f6c9f38b2234b586025537e1553]]This is a cute little diffuser. Very easy to set up and use. Only the top part changes color. This is also the part that you remove in order to add water and your oils. I filled this diffuser to the fill line, plugged it in and went about my business. The water lasted about 3 1/2 hours. The diffuser will turn itself off if there isn&#x27;t enough water in order for it to keep working. There are 4 settings on this diffuser and I like that the on/off button is on the front of the unit as opposed to being on the bottom like another ZAQ diffuser I own.I really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Love using it to make my house smell nice.</li>
            <li> I like this product except I don&#x27;t really like the light being on.  I would prefer to not have a light in my diffuser.  However, it&#x27;s been working great and you can dim it sufficiently enough that it doesn&#x27;t interrupt your sleep.</li>
            <li> I love using Essential Oil Diffusers in my home.  The ZAQ Noor Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser has a cool , modern look to it.  This diffuser is BPA Free and is made of safe, health friendly materials.  The top point glows with soft LED lights.  My 4 year old loves the changing color feature.  It has a 80 ML capacity.  The run time for this diffuser is around 4 hours and it has a auto shut off feature which I think is important because I like to run my diffuser while I am sleeping.  I deal with a lot of anxiety issues so like to use Lavendar Essential Oil in my diffuser at night when I am anxious.  I think this diffuser would make a great gift for anyone that is a essential oil user.</li>
            <li> Simple modern design.  Product looks and works as described.  My girlfriend and I have been using it practically every night every since it arrived.</li>
            <li> I wish you could control the mist output. But other than that, it is a great diffuser. It looks and works great!</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Reasonably priced. Functions just as I hoped it would for diffusing essential oils. I will be ordering another one soon!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was hoping it would be. It swirls a continuous stream of fragrant air and lasts a long time before needing to be refilled. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> It worked great until it died suddenly only after 4 months. The return policy is only 90 days.</li>
            <li> I really loved this for a whole month.  I was sure to take care of it, didn&#x27;t use any citrus oils, and then it just died suddenly.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant buying this because of the price, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few drops of oil in the water, and the room smells wonderful.  The mist is very, very fine.  No splatter or mess. The colors change very gradually, and when you find a color you like you can just press and hold the power button for a second to have it stay on that color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is solid, and well made.  It even comes with a measuring cup for the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It puts out the right amount of vapor. The design looks sleek and modern.</li>
            <li> It is cool looking. heck i even like the sounds of the bubbles it makes and the colors are nice to.</li>
            <li> We own 2, and I will pribably get another one. The kids love the colors at night, and it does its job. So far, so good</li>
            <li> Worked for 15 minutes then never turned on again...awesome</li>
            <li> My beautiful wife bought this for me. I had no idea what she ordered until I opened the box.  I am impressed. I&#x27;ve never owned a diffuser, so I can&#x27;t compare to other items, but as it sits next to my bed, I&#x27;m very impressed.  I didn&#x27;t even know there was such a thing as an ultrasonic diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit does a great job of distilling essential oil into the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that I wish the water volume was double so that I can run it all day at work.</li>
            <li> Early Christmas present for my wife. She loved it, it works right out of the box. If you want it on when you sleep, there is a light behind the power buttin that stays on all the time. However it could be easily hidden. Fills the room its in easily and the connected rooms after about an hour using about 5 drops of lavender oil per 100mL.</li>
            <li> Great product that works very well with the oils</li>
            <li> Someone else wrote that this is the APPLE of diffusers, I agree COMPLETELY, I absolutely love this, and the different light settings. It works wonderfully! I was looking at some prettier designs, but they had bad reviews. I thought it might look a little cheap &amp; clunky, it doesn&#x27;t, at all. It actually LOOKS like apple came and designed a pretty little spherical pyramid with soft pretty lights, with multiple color options.</li>
            <li> So far it is working really well. I have to occasionally &amp;#34;blow out&amp;#34; the part where the mist comes out but that is no big deal. I will purchase another one to have for upstairs use.</li>
            <li> It works very well and I love the changing colors.  Very easy to use and shuts off automatically.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and clean. Also love the design and how sleek it looks! Highly recommend for light sleepers (like me).</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!! I put in on with lavender oil right when my kids are going to bed and it soothes them right to sleep every night. :)</li>
            <li> I use this at works and it works and looks great!</li>
            <li> Love this little thing! Very easy to use, looks great, and diffuses well. I use Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils in it. Perfect.</li>
            <li> This is awesome! Beautiful colors and such a heavenly mist.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and everyone comments on how attractive it is when it goes through its color changes.&lt;br /&gt;Nice mood lightener along with the smells.&lt;br /&gt;Rose oil is the best.</li>
            <li> Sold just as it is described, works great and is quiet.</li>
            <li> I can see mist coming out of the diffuser and can smell the oil if my nose is right above the diffuser or very close but can barely feel any smell in the room. I asked a friend to walk into the room when the diffuser was on and she also said she cannot really feel it. And just to be specific, I tested it in a very small room. I have also tried different oils.  The light is never completely off. I find that pointing the on button (the brightest component when in the so-called \\&quot;no light\\&quot; mode) away from the bed and towards the wall helps. But if you plan to use it when you sleep and if you really need complete darkness to sleep, this is not the diffuser for you.</li>
            <li> No starts if I could! The product stopped working after 2 weeks!!! Contacted costumer service and they DO NOT stand by their products. You can find way better diffuser out there DO NOT BUY IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I used it twice and it is no longer working</li>
            <li> Love the auto shut off when it runs our of water.</li>
            <li> Item stopped working after purchased. Will be returning to Amazon.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is so quiet and the color changing lights are beautiful. It diffuses my oils perfectly and is very easy to use. I am looking at other ZAQ diffusers to put around my house!!!</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE.  POOR IN AMOUNT OF WATER AS INDICATED ON THE DIRECTIONS AND A LITTLE BIT OF THERAPEUTIC OIL AND THE ROOM SMELLS GREAT!  WORKS GREAT WITH A COLD, FLU SEASON, OR IF YOU JUST WANT THE ROOM TO SMELL NICE.  NICE DESIGN.</li>
            <li> This is so relaxing to have in a room! The item arrived so quickly and was packaged very nicely. I really enjoy how the colors change -for the light. I&#x27;d purchased one as a gift last year and the recipient enjoyed it so much, it prompted me to buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this oil diffuser, noise-free, stylish, fills up the room with my favorite smell...highly recommend to everyone !!!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect electronic aromatherapy mister I was looking for.  It is very quiet and when it consumes the available water with the oils, it turns itself off, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it.  The changing colors on the mister is also very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could use my essential oils instead of paying for expensive candles all the time.  In the morning I use some type of mint and lavender in the evening before bedtime.  I have had no problems with this and the color setting is nice.</li>
            <li> I just received this essential oil diffuser and frankly I am shocked how small the unit is.  I have owned about 10 different essential oil diffusers ranging from about $30 to $50 and this was the most expensive.  I bought it because of all the really high ratings on the product.  Now I seriously am wondering about the ratings.  I have read articles in the newspaper about how to identify false ratings on products and frankly I am very skeptical of the ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my analysis of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 - Is is tiny.  It is only a little larger than my hand.  I was expecting something about 2 to 3 times the size.&lt;br /&gt;#2 - I the unit holds 80ml.  Do they realize how little 80ml is?  That&#x27;s like 2 ounces.  Most of my other diffusers hold about 200ml of water.&lt;br /&gt;#3 - You can not use citrus, citronella and lemon essential oils.  Well citrus oil is one of my favorite.  What a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;#4 - I can not believe it was $90.00.&lt;br /&gt;#5 - If I could give this product zero stars I would&lt;br /&gt;#6 - I think Amazon.com should look into the reviews that were given.  I really suspect something.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. The strength of the scent is great; it may seem subtle if you turn it on and stay in the room, but the minute you walk out and come back in, you will definitely notice the smell. It works wonderfully and is small enough that it&#x27;s easy to move around my house if need be. I think I may get another one to avoid having to do this, because I love it so much. The plug-in cord is nice and long, and the color display is gorgeous! Very calming. It will stay on for up to 4 hours, or until it runs out of water. It is nice to put in your bedroom before you go to bed with calming scents like lavender. I would definitely recommend it; it works great.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser! It dispels steam from the moment it&#x27;s turned on. The lighting options are awesome. My kids love that it changes colors. I also love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about water levels because it automatically shuts off when empty. My only complaint (and it&#x27;s very minor) is that if I want to switch the oil that is being diffused I have to unplug the whole thing to dump it over the sink. Not a big deal but it would be nice if the water feature lifted out instead of having to bring the whole thing to the sink. This has only happened once so now I just let each oil run threw till empty. There is a little pouring cup to brinn water to the diffuser which is nice. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works well enough. But there isn&#x27;t really a setting where you can have it on without a light which was frustrating with my newborn.</li>
            <li> Works great. I have two. I got the first one two years ago and it still works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter-in-law. She says she loves it!</li>
            <li> Bought this device less than 2 months ago and it has already died. I followed instructions on use and care and it still stopped working for no reason. Unfortunately, I just missed my 30 day window to return.</li>
            <li> I have used this volcano shaped oil diffuser by Zaq every day for a month and Iove it. The light settings are relaxing.  It makes a whisper soft sound which I can sleep with and the auto off when water is out feature is nice. It&#x27;s easy to clean just wipe with a paper towel. The plastic chamber does absorbe some scent but not enough to make a problem when different oils are used intermittently. I like the sleek design too.</li>
            <li> Its really great and works well, I use it at work and have received many compliments on how great it smells and looks.</li>
            <li> Really like this product: compact, easy to use and to clean. Quiet and fun to look at when the lights are on. Have been using it for a month now, wit no issues.</li>
            <li> Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;But a little noise.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser.  Easy to use and automatically shuts off.</li>
            <li> Awesome little diffuser.  I use it in my kitchen and it works wonders.  Using YL Abundance and makes the entire downstairs spell great.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before buying this diffuser. This one came recommended to me and from my research, it seemed like others liked it too. I will add my voice to the many reviews--- this is an awesome diffuser.  My kids love that it changes colors. I love that you can pause it on a color or have no color at all.  I love the size of it, how easy it is to use, the amount of mist it makes, and even how it looks.  It&#x27;s very portable and I move it all the time depending on what room I&#x27;m going to be in.  The price was amazing too.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> This unit is very efficient and mists well. It runs for for several hours &amp; has an auto shut off when it gets empty. Choice of varying color or single color lighting or nightlight modes while running, but the night light is rather bright. For a dimmer night light (larger foot print) order their DEW model.</li>
            <li> Works well. I use it in my child&#x27;s room at night and he enjoys the changing colors. No complaints!</li>
            <li> I love the look and the simplicity of it.</li>
            <li> this is a lovely little machine - i keep it right next to my bed and use it everyday.  Highly recommend to anyone else who loves aromatherapy and surrounding yourself with the peace, benefits and good feelings of aromatherapy!</li>
            <li> This is great - it is quiet and easy to fill.  Didn&#x27;t know about the light that changes color - but love it - very soothing.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I have it in my living room so the luscious scents are always present. I love that you can have your choice of white, green, red, pink, purple, yellow, or blue light or all of the lights cycling through, OR NO LIGHT AT ALL and still have the wonderful aromas.</li>
            <li> it worked for about 2 days and than it didn&#x27;t. Now it won&#x27;t mist, it just runs and makes noise and does not emit the essential oil fragrance. A total disappointment</li>
            <li> Love it, works right away &amp; spreads smells of oil throughout the house. I like how you can turn lighting on or off.</li>
            <li> After 4 times of using it, it stopped working! I emailed the ZAQ company for the warranty but they have not responded.</li>
            <li> I started diffusing this winter to help keep the cold and flu season at bay.  My husband and I work together and he likes to come sit in my office when my diffuser is going. This ZAQ diffuser works perfectly.  It&#x27;s compact enough to sit by my desk without being obtrusive.  I have since ordered 3 more ZAQ diffusers and received one for a gift!!</li>
            <li> This diffuser is silent. It doesn&#x27;t leave any white stuff on the furniture. It shuts itself off when its empty. I use it with my essential oils and my house smells great!</li>
            <li> The only other diffuser I can compare it to is one I saw in Whole Foods which was basically a squat cylinder. This one has a much more aesthetic appeal. I got the white one which has lights that change colors, transitioning from blue-purple-green (I believe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this price range, I believe it can&#x27;t be beat. It has one speed, holds nearly 10oz of water and will run for about 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel on business frequently and sometimes find myself staying in a less than pleasant smelling motel/inn. This always freshens it up and was especially handy on my recent trip to Washington state where I found its humidifier aspect very handy. (I had to have the heat on constantly to keep my room warm but that dried my throat out. The ZAQ returned much of the moisture to the air.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer organic peppermint oil in my ZAQ. It just always smells nice.</li>
            <li> Great product! I am using DOTERRA oils in it.  The only thing is you can&#x27;t put it on wood due to the nature of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times, once in my living room area which opens into the kitchen and once in my home office.  When I used it in the living room, you couldn&#x27;t smell the oil.  I think the area was just too big for this little device.  I then tried it (using the same oil) in my home office (which is a smaller room) and you can smell it in there.  I guess it&#x27;s fine, but I was hoping for it to last longer (perhaps 1/2 a day at least), but the water seems to dry up within a very short period of time. I&#x27;ll probably use it from time to time, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> We have purchased two of these for our two young granddaughters who seem to have numerous colds.  Their moms say they sleep much better with the &amp;#34;breathing&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34; essential oil in the diffuser and go to sleep watching it change colors. Neither family have any complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this diffuser for about two months now, and have been very happy with it.  It is small but does a pretty good job getting our EO&#x27;s spread into our living room.  I like it.</li>
            <li> well the quality is nice,  I love the colors that it changes to and the 3 modes but honestly its just to small for the price unless you are putting it in like a bathroom. I know its not going to fill up my whole house but I have tried it in three separate rooms and its just to small for anything other than the bathroom to really make a difference as far as aromatherapy goes. I will say that in the future I will be looking for a bigger size diffuser from this brand because other than the size its very nice</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t diffuse well, stopped working after a couple days. Not good quality</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser for my daughter who has started using essential oils.  She also purchased one for herself so she has two which she uses in different places in the house.  It is small so doesn&#x27;t take a lot of space, is very quiet and works great.</li>
            <li> I love it! I cannot use any candles in the house because the elderlies I am taking care of , are very sensitive to artificial scents/perfumes. This fills up the living room and the kitchen with a very subtle sent. I thought it will be very small but it does hold enough water to keep it going for few hours. It has clean lines, pretty colors and an &amp;#34;UFO&amp;#34; kind of look. It has an auto shut off when the water is very low.  Just make sure you don&#x27;t tip it because the lid comes off easily and you&#x27;ll have water everywhere. Also plug the adapter wire to the diffuser before you fill it with water( You have to tip the diffuser to plug the wire into the base)  What it would&#x27;ve made it better: batteries</li>
            <li> This is my second ZAQ diffuser.  They work well and operate so easily.  I use Doterra oils in them and the house smells great.</li>
            <li> Love.  A full resevoir lasts around 3+ hours.  Takes up a small footprint and it&#x27;s not offensive looking.  Do be aware that you can&#x27;t turn all the lights off.  Even when you turn them &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; the cone glows a dark blue and the button puts out a LOT of light in darkness.  I taped a piece of heavy cardstock over the button and it&#x27;s fine.  If you&#x27;re one who needs darkness to sleep and wants to use this at bedtime this might not be the one for you.</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser.  My friend has the Young Living version and I think mine works better.  And it&#x27;s cuter.</li>
            <li> O.k  for small rooms, quiet and but not very powerful to fill the room up.This was my first time dealing with the whole Essential Oil thing. I figured from good reviews and being name #1 it had to be a hitter. But I guess you never know until you try a product. The first day I used it, it seemed to work you could smell the scents, then I did the second time again and it  barely mist, Then it just doesn&#x27;t mist out. It&#x27;s smaller then I thought and doesn&#x27;t hold that much water which means it wont run long,the auto shut off is cool though cause sometimes I forget. But I just personally think that their has to be a much better product on the market than this one. I&#x27;m returning it to try something better.</li>
            <li> Love it. I use it everyday. I have experienced no problems. I absolutely love turning it on with some lavender essential oil when I come home from work.</li>
            <li> Gift for mom! She loved it! I have purchased other brands but ZAQ is my go to for the best diffusers, IMO!</li>
            <li> I like this because it helps diffuse my essential oils. However, there is a slight blue light so it may disturb some individuals&#x27; sleep if they are sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have had this diffuser for about 3 weeks now and just love it!!! It is super easy to use and makes everything smell wonderful.  I am thinking about purchasing another for the other side of the house.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months now and I love it so far. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it and the lights aren&#x27;t so bright that they disturb my sleep when I plug it up at night. Cuts off after around 4 hours, which works out great for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser 3 days ago and have used it very often.  It is very simple to operate and adjust.  I love that it is so quiet.  I have had water collect on the bottom of it once, but that was out of four or so uses, so I may have had it slightly overfilled that time.  The oils I&#x27;ve used have diffused great and I&#x27;m really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> These are great - love the color changing - actually the kids love it.  I only wish that it would cover more area.</li>
            <li> I have had a few diffusers and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!  I have one and gave two as gifts this Christmas.  Just make sure not to exceed the water level or nothing will come out.  Follow the simple directions, and you will be diffusing in no time!</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser.  I am very pleased with it.  My only complaint would be that when you click 2 times for the light to go &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, it still glows and the power button glows very brightly.  Not a huge deal because I can turn the power button away from me at night, but it still glows.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser it works very well and I use it everyday/ all day!! The light settings are very nice and I like to use it for a nightlight in the kid&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!! I put different kinds of essential oils in it, and they smell always fills the house. I love how it changes colors as well. :) Just as good as the Young Living diffuser that costs you 100 bucks. Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> We LOVE this diffuser (we have several throughout our home), but it always randomly stops working for no reason about a year after we buy it. Disappointing. However, we love EVERYTHING else about it, so we just buy a new one when it stops working.</li>
            <li> Nice size. It&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> Very cool how you can set it so the light changes or you can set it to one of your favorite colors. Nice and quite, does a good job.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is AWESOME! It has worked perfectly. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Only has a 4 hour reservoir. Wish I&#x27;d thought of that. But I do really like the system.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift and it was wonderful.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, looks nice and makes no noise, diffuses oils great. I love it!</li>
            <li> This was my first aromatherapy diffuser, and I&#x27;ve had it since July 2014 (about half a year as of this writing).  I&#x27;ve been so pleased with this unit.  I use it regularly, almost every day, and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in our large 2-story living room when I want the house to feel warm and inviting.  It isn&#x27;t nearly as strong a diffusion as in our smaller bedroom, but it still is nice to freshen or enhance the living room air.  Guests have commented on how nice it smells (cinnamon essential oil at the holidays, other blends for other occasions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only design improvement I can recommend is that even in the no-light mode, the top part of the diffuser is still illuminated, probably from the power switch light, and we have to be strategic where it is in the bedroom if using it at night so it doesn&#x27;t keep us up.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter is LOVING this little diffuser we bought her. She has terrible allergies and eczema and we cannot use any artificial fragrances in our home. But with this great little product, she can use some essential oils in her room. She mostly uses oils that are beneficial to allergy sufferers, as well as Lavender to help her sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser works great, and her room smells SO GOOD. It shuts off automatically when the water runs out, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about her forgetting to monitor it. And she loves the light setting options as well. The unit is petite enough to fit on her nightstand. And it operates in complete silence, which is a HUGE bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great buy. I hope it will last a LONG time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit larger than I thought it would be, but I really love it.  It&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li> This was recommended on a blog I read as well as on an essential oil site I buy from.  I have not regretted spending the money for it and use it almost daily.  It&#x27;s small water reservoir does require frequent refilling....I think it hold about 2 ounces of water.  I think we&#x27;ve had this about a month now and it is still performing.  It had better for $50!  It&#x27;s a lot of fun choosing which essential oils to use each time you fire it up.  EOs not included, of course :)</li>
            <li> Easy to use and compact. Works great!</li>
            <li> I have been using mine for a week. I like the fact that it came with a measuring cup for the water which is very convenient. The unit is mostly whisper quiet and you won&#x27;t hear it running except for a very occasional water trickle. The colors are soothing and I like to have them cycle though, although you can set it to one color or even no light.  Another thing I absolutely love is that it shoots the mist high enough into the air that the area surrounding the unit isn&#x27;t saturated with water. I have a different brand unit and when I run it the table around it is covered with water which I hate...&lt;br /&gt;Great value and I will actually be ordering an additional unit for my work office</li>
            <li> I have young living oil. I purchased the $100 going living diffuser and one month late my husband dropped it and broke it! :( so I decided to buy a cheap one. Maybe it&#x27;s bc I was used to the young living diffuser but this one SUCKS! I put 2x as many drops and it doesn&#x27;t make the room smell even a quarter as much as the young living diffuser! So I guess I&#x27;m buying another YL diffuser :/</li>
            <li> Works the instant you turn it on!</li>
            <li> This is a nice little diffuser.  It&#x27;s very quiet when it runs and the steam covers a decent area.  I like that you can turn off the nightlight - many small ones have a light that is so bright. The reservoir holds enough water to run about 4ish hours. Auto shut off is a nice safety feature. Very easy to clean. Reasonable price (I paid a little under $40).</li>
            <li> It needs to be a small room for you to be able to smell the oils diffusing.  Thats why it cost half of what the good diffuser from Young Living costs</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed, mostly because you can&#x27;t turn the light all the way off and I wanted it for my son&#x27;s room at night. The product works as described.</li>
            <li> As soon as you turn this on, you see the mist right away.  Its been running for 2 hours now, and loving it so far!</li>
            <li> Works great! Zero issues.</li>
            <li> Great awesome good quality well made we really enjoy it excellent purchase looks super we are glad we chose this one</li>
            <li> I have been using this diffuser for a couple months and it works very well. It isn&#x27;t the most elegant or appealing to the eye diffuser but works well. Think I would look for a different design in the future.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a couple of these for multiple rooms in my house, and they have been running strong for over 2 months without any loss of vapor production.  I&#x27;ll be adding a couple more of them to other rooms in the house soon.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these for my kids&#x27; rooms and they are fantastic!  The kids enjoy the lights and how they can change color or be one solid color.  It holds so much water that it lasts for hours.  I purchased another diffuser that is more esthetically pleasing for the master bedroom for the same cost and it does not compare to these diffusers.  I&#x27;m actually going to return that one and purchase this one for the master bedroom as well because it is so much easier to use!  I would highly recommend this diffuser!!</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s small and has auto shut off but the water compartment is so small, the size of a shot glass. I also don&#x27;t like the fact that it still emits light even tho you turn off the light features.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! I was hesitant to purchase a diffuser because of so many negative reviews... however I am glad that I decided on this one. It is easy to use, works well, and shuts off automatically. You can have the lights on or off, and it shuts off automatically when it runs out of water. Easy to add essential oils, just drop them in! Works Great!</li>
            <li> This has been a great value for the money spent. It doesn&#x27;t diffuse a huge space but it works well in a bedroom. My son uses it to fall asleep. The kids will work on homework while sitting at the kitchen table. There are multiple settings based on your desired light effect. It can fade through colors, hold on one color or diffuse with no light. We haven&#x27;t had a issue with ours at all and have had it for 3 months. It kicks off when the water is gone. 80ml of water lasted over 3 hours the last time I paid attention.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these diffusers and will purchase more in the future for gifts! They work great and were a decent price! I only wish they ran for a longer period of time! I suppose I&#x27;ll have to spend more to get a diffuser that does that! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great product! Works well. Very happy with purchase. I bought another brand after I bought this and the other diffuser has already stopped working. I will be purchasing another to replace my broken diffuser.</li>
            <li> works as advertised. kids like that it glows, very brightly! It would keep me up!</li>
            <li> I use this every night with Lavender oil to help me sleep.  It is a great product.  I&#x27;ve also brought it to different places when I have to sleep out and it is a durable product.  I love that it&#x27;s small and can go anywhere from a small spot on the floor to a large desk.  I would not recommend this product for a large room.  While I get a good whiff of my oils in my small bedroom, I doubt it would work as well in a larger setting.  Great company though!</li>
            <li> Purchased item less than two months ago and it no longer works. Prior to it&#x27;s demise, even with the adequate water and oil ratio, it would randomly stop emitting mist with the motor still running. Just shy of two months and now this ZAQ diffuser is headed for the recycling bin.</li>
            <li> I use this one in our TV room and when we travel.  It is perfect for a hotel room!</li>
            <li> you work so well, i love you. wish you were slightly bigger. love your changing colours and simple technology. i would like two more for around my house, but i think i am going to get a few himalayan salt lamps- totally necessary!! we live on an AFB, need to clean out all those toxic chemicals, first.</li>
            <li> We use this every night! It&#x27;s right next to my bed and it fills my room with amazing sense well we are going to sleep. I would recommend this to anybody! Great price for a great diffuser!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this gift. It works well with any oils and you can choose to just have the mister, or have one glowing light or have it change to a rainbow of colors. It also arrived much quicker than expected and got here in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li> this is a great diffuser that&#x27;s perfect for the bedroom. My kids love to pick their favorite color to stop it on at night. It serves as a night light while running.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this product. It Works as advertised. A bit expensive in my opinion but no regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This thing is great for relaxing, meditation, purifying a room, aromatherapy of any kind.  Way better than paying for generic deodorizers like glade plug ins or something.  It benefits the entire surrounding including any organic life forms.  This is also the better model of the 2 main types of ZAQ diffusers.  It offers an array of lights, 3 modes (i.e. rotate color, fixed color, low-light), and there is only one piece or &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; to remove when you add oil.  The other unit has 2 pieces so if you&#x27;re holding oil in one hand you can&#x27;t just pop off the cap and add it.  It also only has the one color in the form of 2 led&#x27;s that clearly show through the plastic.  Despite these trivial differences they are both &amp;#34;5-star&amp;#34; units.  Excellent value!</li>
            <li> Love these diffusers, have been using them for awhile. Very easy to use, cleans easy, and love the auto shut off. Much more inexpensive and work as well as pricey brands. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this product, even that we ordered another, it works great and love the different settings. Lights , no lights and that it has an automatic shut off!</li>
            <li> This diffuser does an awesome job in my massage office and treatment room. I use it every day! Love it!</li>
            <li> It works well although the blue, non-light is still pretty bright and keeps me awake. I wish it ran for longer but for the price, it&#x27;s a good starter diffuser.</li>
            <li> Really impressed with the quality and style of this innovative essential oil aromatherapy device.  Not only does it do a fantastic job of making your home smell great, its modern design and soothing colors make it fun for everyone, kids and adults.  Appears to be very well made too.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a gift from a friend. With just a few drops of fragrance, it does a great job of making you feel light and comforting. All the more, the brilliant changing colors keep kids and adults attracted. This is a great showpiece to be kept in the living room, which is both soothing and eye catching!</li>
            <li> Effectively distributes over multiple rooms.  Wish it was a little bit quieter though.</li>
            <li> Surpasses my expectations. I love it.</li>
            <li> Works well in my bedroom</li>
            <li> 1100 Sq ft house and this diffuser is the perfect size!  I&#x27;ve been running it constantly for a few weeks with no problems.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few weeks now.  We use it every night.  I am very impressed. I love the different colors it puts off , but the green is my favorite.  I like that the machine has a automatic shut off .  What I like best about it though is that there is no water on the area that it sits.  The condensation in zero .  All the water diffuses like it should.  I run two different oils in it Balance by Doterra and Acceptance by Young living.  I bought this with my birthday money and it is by far one of my favorite items I own. If your your on the fence about buying this one , do it! You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this little unit. It&#x27;s small enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of space but it pushes a lot of &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; or whatever you would call it. I bought a second diffuser to keep upstairs that is larger and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the ZAQ one. (The other brand is NOW which I bought on impulse locally. Kind of wish I would have ordered another ZAQ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colours change and you can press the power button again to hold it on a colour you like or press again to turn off the light while the diffuser continues to run. It automatically shuts off when it runs out of water so you can run it over night and not worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been using it daily and it&#x27;s doing great. We&#x27;ve been using Plant Therapy Oils as they were the best rated product I could find that wasn&#x27;t part of multi level marketing (where you&#x27;re paying for everyone to make money rather than just the product). Our personal favourite is to use the Germ Fighter (same recipe as YL Theives).</li>
            <li> This is second oil diffuser purchase from Amazon.  While I love them both, this is SO easy to use. I recently had a party and multiple people were asking what it was and where I got it.  They loved it too.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas, she loves it and uses it daily. It runs very quietly and the light setting are a nice feature.</li>
            <li> Best diffuser I have seen. Great price. Really gives off for a large room!</li>
            <li> works great just as expected and fun to watch when bored</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more for each room! I had this downstairs in the kitchen for the first few months and I have tall ceilings in the kitchen and sky high in he living room. I could still smell this and get benefits in the kitchen and took deep breathes over the nozzle area whenever I passed by. I moved it to the living room with the sky high ceilings and still received great benefits. I now have it in my bedroom for the last month or so and use it while we sleep. I had this on 24 hrs a day when I first bought it for a few months and now use it only at night until I purchase more for other rooms. I will keep coming back. It lasts 4 hrs but it is no problem since you can keep adding more. There is a fill line so do not go over it or it won&#x27;t work till u dump some out and I wouldn&#x27;t even suggest stopping at the fill line. As long as it is below the line you are fine! I use Eden&#x27;s Garden oils in here( fantastic company) and I even use citrus even though you aren&#x27;t supposed to, I just don&#x27;t leave the residue when it&#x27;s done. All other EO&#x27;s that are at the bottom diluted with water I never clean out and sometimes have left it in there for a few days without cleaning it. I have a rag and I use it to wipe leftovers but I don&#x27;t clean it with anything, just use the leftover oils. If you happen to use citrus then just fill more water when it&#x27;s done with non citrus EO&#x27;s so that the citrus is diluted (just FYI). There is a shut off timer once the water runs low and it doesn&#x27;t leave leftover water but only a few drops left.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;9-11-16 ~ I used this for several months and then it just kind of collected dust and I was using it less and less or infrequently. It started leaking water and it should have lasted longer but I figured I could just purchase another inthe near future since I loved it that much. Come to find out..the price has jacked up and I feel it is NOT worth that price tag!!! Did they upgrade it at least? There are better options out there and I will look around. Took 2 stars off.ok 2 stars off.</li>
            <li> simple and modern. easy to use, just remove top of cone to fill up.&lt;br /&gt;push 1x: to turn on. (will rotate different colored lights).&lt;br /&gt;push 2x: to stay on one color.&lt;br /&gt;push 3x to turn off.&lt;br /&gt;it will turn off when water is depleted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;80ml water, i add 5-10 drops of oil.&lt;br /&gt;lasts 6-8hrs.&lt;br /&gt;disperses smell all over my open living room/dining area/kitchen&lt;br /&gt;it says no citrus, but i have used citrus at times. (not frequently).&lt;br /&gt;i have 2 of these. one stopped working/not evaporating the water completely. the other one is still going strong. have had both for 10 months.</li>
            <li> It has changed how I go to sleep.  LUV IT!  Would like to give to friends and buy another for another room in my house.</li>
            <li> we bought this for our baby&#x27;s room.  it is supposed to have a mode with no light - so at night, we could run it and the room would still be dark.  we&#x27;ve clicked through the cycle of buttons, 1 push for blue, 2 pushes for variable, etc and it does not have a &#x27;no light&#x27; mode.  perhaps ours is defective, perhaps we&#x27;re not following the directions right (but we&#x27;ve had several people give it a shot)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;otherwise, it works well as a diffuser/light humidifier.</li>
            <li> Newbie with oils so o researched and researched and after seeing the reviews for this one compared to the YL one I am so glad o didn&#x27;t splurge. This is way better than the price implies. I use it once a day atleast. Must comes on almost instantly. Enjoy all the settings and the longevity (3hrs) of mist it pumps out. Very quite also</li>
            <li> I purchased this for $50, thinking I was getting a good deal given that the supposed list price is $100. There is NO way this product can be sold for $100, and I am embarrassed that I paid half that. It seems relatively cheaply made, does not hold much water at all, and has to be filled a bit below the fill line to actually start emitting. The aromatherapy aspect is nice, but, given its small size, does nothing to add moisture to even a small room. It does run for the stated 3+ hours. The changing LED lights are nice, but do note that a running light remains on when the LED is off. It&#x27;s too bright to be used in the bedroom at night, which is what I had purchased it for. Overall, would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> i have been really happy with the diffuser so far.  I wish it covered a little more square footage, but it runs great, is quiet &amp; very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this! Easy to use, quiet, seems to do its job well.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser the only thing I would like to see different is that it would have a timer setting to run at intervals.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works excellent for home use. It&#x27;s very easy to set-up and to switch from one oil to the next. I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I have several mist diffusers and this is one of my favorites.  My daughter would like for me to get her one....which I think I will for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li> It was DOA.  Decided to go with something else as a gift.  So technically I cannot write any useful review on it so I gave it 3 stars for now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Young Living Oils and although I received a diffuser from them in my initial order I don&#x27;t really care for it. I still use it but I needed other diffusers for the kids rooms and my room and didn&#x27;t want to buy the YL one again so onto Amazon I went and found this little gem which we&#x27;ve had now for several months and I really like. I think it diffuses well - I&#x27;m diffusing all types of oils in it and have had no problems in the two I own, it&#x27;s quiet which is really important to me - I can&#x27;t hear it while I&#x27;m trying to sleep and I&#x27;m really sensitive to noise when sleeping. It&#x27;s not messy and the kids love the light aspect of it - I like that the settings so I can turn the crazy lights off and put it into what I have deemed &amp;#34;night mode&amp;#34; (A more subtle light) for sleeping. So it does a good job all around - I have recommended to friends and recommend here.</li>
            <li> I like the light options. The unit is a little noisy for me at night. There is also a blue glow even when the light is off which I can not handle while sleeping. It is now the unit we use for the main area of the house.</li>
            <li> Diffuser worked great for 2 and a half months. At that time it stopped turning off automatically, leaving a small amount of water inside and when I would take the top off diffuser was full of a cloud of mist which would then rush out. I am afraid to sleep with this on as it could cause a fire. I read through all the trouble shooting ideas and this was not mentioned. Upset that my $49.99 went up in mist.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this Aromatherapy diffuser- I even said &#x27;wow!&#x27; the first time I turned it on.  My little 3 year old has been having sleeping problems, and this mixed with a little Woolzies Lavender essential oil is a perfect combo we&#x27;ve found.  The smell is great and the lightup color on the diffuser is fantastic.  The first night with it went well, looking forward to more of them!</li>
            <li> i use this diffuser in my boy&#x27;s room.  It will last SEVERAL hours.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever someone is looking for a diffuser for their home, i always send them straight to this very one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:beac5800ec3ab01771d7571b431a1e95]]Im so very excited I ordered this aromatherapy Diff-user, didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing( I WAS IN THE STONE AGE USING A DOUBLE BOILER TYPE). Its so easy to use, looks great, and works phenomenally!!! My home is now smelling phenomenal and by way of aromatherapy helping with my mood, and anxiety and helping me relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this diff-user at discount for an HONEST review.</li>
            <li> This cold water diffuser is great.  I like that it shuts itself off, so I set it when I go to bed.  It&#x27;s small and not cumbersome.  And because it&#x27;s cold air, the oils aren&#x27;t broken down.  Also, I do leave that changing lights on (they are cool :)), but I like that there is an option to not only turn the light off, but you can also set it so that one color stays on.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three of the ZAQ Noor diffusers for myself and as gifts.  This diffuser works very well and puts out a fine mist which is dispersed over a large area.  I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> great little machine love it</li>
            <li> Used it every night and it works really well for about 8 months. It just pooped out on me. Hoped it would last longer, it does everything it says it would. The lights were hard to get used to at night and there&#x27;s no way to have it on with out the lights. I&#x27;m undecided whether I will buy this to replace the one I have. Still a good product and kind of cool.</li>
            <li> I do not have much to compare to, but I love my ZAQ Noor Litemist Diffuser. I just recently started using essential oils, but there are some risks when applying topically so I prefer to use the mister instead. I&#x27;ve had it now for several months and I&#x27;ve not had any issues. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a diffuser.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t sleep without it!  Love the different scents the wife uses, eucalyptus is our favorite!  So calming, wish the light could be turned off when in use.</li>
            <li> I bought this difuser for my kids rooms. I notice that it isnt as efficient as my other diffuser from an essential oil company, but it does the job. Soon after we started using it it stopped working.  I contacted the company and they claimed it should work.  After a few flick/taps of my finger on the side of the diffuser to get the fan going since it seemed to stop on its own it started working again. Its ok, but if you are looking for a efficient diffuser that disperses the oil/water into the air I would look at other options.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this diffuser. I like the option of the color changing light (the baby loves to look at that) or a set color or no light at all. We have a small one level home and place the diffuser in the living room- the center of our house. The diffuser easily covers the entire area. I will add that I do not use the diffuser constantly. Maybe a couple times a week unless someone is sick, then it&#x27;s a little more. I usually only let it run about 30 minutes at a time. I do wish it had a timer or sleep setting so I feel more comfortable when needing to put it in the baby&#x27;s room at night. Overall I feel this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use this with peppermint  oil - smells divine.  Ordering another for my work area.  Smell lasts for hours after the 4 hour shut off.  Very soothing and the change of lights very relaxing.</li>
            <li> We love this thing! Super Quiet and easy to use. I agree that it works better in smaller rooms/areas. If you want complete darkness, this is not for you...even with the light off option there is still light from the blue power button.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an early Christmas present and it&#x27;s fantastic! This is the 3rd diffuser we&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s a keeper. We mostly use it in our room (larger, master bedroom). It diffuses our essential oils into the whole room and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much easier to take care of than previous diffusers. We rinse it after every use, and about once a week let some vinegar sit in it for a few hours to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very quiet and looks nice in the room. The power button light is a bit bright at night time so we keep a little washcloth in front of the power button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering this item after I read some of the negative feedback. I decided to give it a chance though and I am so glad I did! The price point was just what I hoped for and it turns out that it works beautifully! I love how it changes colors and you can choose the color you want it to stay on. It&#x27;s so easy to clean and operate. I move it from room to room and never have any issues. I wanted to wait before writing a review until I had used it frequently. I use it multiple times a day and its been awhile since I got it. I highly suggest investing in this diffuser!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> We use this diffuser every night for my son&#x27;s asthma.  We use with the do Terra essential oils.  It is a little discolored after a year of use, but still works perfectly.  Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this at bed time and it has been great. It&#x27;s quiet, works well, and I love how it has different color for the LED light. The only thing you should be aware of before you purchase this item is that you can&#x27;t (not recommended to) use citrus kind of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Although the look of this diffuser is beautiful it does not work. From the moment I plugged it in the power button does not work, but if left plugged in the lights randomly come on. I am returning it immediately very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works great. I bought a total of 3. Great for as a gift idea.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use, easy to clean, all the necessary options, will be ordering more for office and friends.  This is my fourth diffuser and finally found one that is perfect.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am not putting 5 stars, is I just received it and I want to see how long it lasts and I have had to clean it yet!&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely buy another one from this same company if it is as quiet and a little bit bigger. Very very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Whisper Quiet, very attractive clean lines, the lights are very soothing and you can turn them off entirely, so portable I move it from room to room. Dispels a perfect amount of &#x27;clean air, moist air and my oils.&#x27;  It shuts itself off as it runs out of water.  I will buy a 2nd one soon so I don&#x27;t have to move it from room to room.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Small, so for me it only lasts about 3 hours before I have to refill with water, as I said it is smaller which I wanted so I can place on my nightstand or tuck it by the side of a chair.</li>
            <li> Worked 2x and won&#x27;t turn on. Had it exactly 1 day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with amazon prime and it came in exactly when they said it would. The packaging was very secure and the product came unscathed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actually my second Zaq diffuser, and what can I say? I am not disappointed. Within 5 minutes of opening the product, I had it running and diffusing lavender essential oils in my room. Within 20 minutes, my room smells fantastic. The diffuser emits an alternating glow that sets a nice ambient mood, and it also produces a slight bubbling noise which isn&#x27;t at all annoying; I would describe it as therapeutic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Noor is a very nice size. I would say the base is about 5-1/2 to 6 inches in diameter, and it fits on my nightstand without being obstructive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great product, at a great price, and i would buy it again and again and again. The days of lighting candles are over; welcome to the era of essential oils.</li>
            <li> I literally use this thing everyday! It has yet to fail me. I use the Synergy Blends from Eden&#x27;s Garden, those two work well together. I leo diffuse Thieves oil if anyone in my house is sick. Really excellent product. And bonus?! IT LIGHTS UP!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully for a single room</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on all the positive reviews, and I have not been disappointed!</li>
            <li> it leaks and doesn&#x27;t sit flush because of the way it&#x27;s designed with the cord sticking out from under the unit.</li>
            <li> Quite amazed at this small product, it more than adequately diffuses any scent you insert. Very glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this diffuser pretty much non-stop since the minute it arrived. It works great, my house smells wonderful and the whole family is benefiting from it!! Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> It was a gift…my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I have had the diffuser for just over three months and it works great!  I can easily fill my children&#x27;s room with scents, I even brought it to school (I&#x27;m a teacher) and it filled up my classroom pretty easily.  I&#x27;m impressed with the ability of this tiny little thing!  It also looks nice and have gotten compliments several times.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I love this. I doubles as a night light</li>
            <li> This is a great little diffuser.  Keeps my house smelling great with my essential oils.  House smells fresh and clean without chemicals.</li>
            <li> So I got this quite a while ago, over 6 months at least. But a month ago, I decided to deep clean it and left it drying. But, my impatience for delicious aromatherapy mist made me plug it in before it was thoroughly dried and it short-circuited as far as I knew. So it stopped working and i gave it up for dead :,(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But today!! Ah, today! I added water, EO, and plugged it in---LO and BEHOLD! It&#x27;s alive! I&#x27;m now enjoying a delicious musky blend of lavender and frankincense again. I was very pleasantly surprised to say the least--that this cheap plastic diffuser resurrected itself. That&#x27;s quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lights are nice. You can turn it off (last setting before off). I usually leave this in the downstairs bathroom where the cats have their stinky box and guests relieve themselves. It also works as a good spot to diffuse throughout the whole downstairs and even a little bit upstairs (open floorplan, highceilings/catwalk ). Now I might get one for sleeping cuz that&#x27;s the best sleep I ever had!</li>
            <li> Great for the price!  Not saying this is the BEST diffuser!  But it works!  I didn&#x27;t have one, and I use oils all the time, so I thought it was high time I got one.  My mother has one that works way better than this one, but was also twice as expensive.  I just wanted one for my bedroom and one for my husbands office!  So it serves it&#x27;s purpose!</li>
            <li> This product was great for my room getting ZAQ Noor Air Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser&lt;br /&gt;by ZAQ.COM&lt;br /&gt;more for to give has a gift to my family.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves it!</li>
            <li> Well it was great the two days it worked! The third day I went to use it and it wouldn&#x27;t go on. I had filled it with the pitcher that came with it and was very careful not to overfill and it still stopped working. I can&#x27;t find my receipt so here it sits, unusable.</li>
            <li> Very simple, sleek design.  Easy to fill and add oils.  Seems to work well.  My big complaint is that the base light can&#x27;t be turned completely off.  It is dimmer that when the top is lit, but still too much light to sleep for me.  I like the brand and will try another style that says the light can be turned off completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If blue light won&#x27;t disturb your sleep, or if you are using it other than bedtime, I highly recommend this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Just got mine today. Only three settings of color work. Doesn&#x27;t work with no light like it states. I wanted it mainly for my baby room at night while she sleeps but light disturbs sleep quality. It is quiet though. Very small. Puts out a lot of mist but doesn&#x27;t do intervals. Area around it stayed dry so far.</li>
            <li> Love how small and compact it is, wish it had a feature to not use lights. The glow, even when low, is bright.  Works well. You cannot use citrus oils in this model. Runs for about 3 hours .  May run a tad longer not sure as I use it with lavender oil when I go to bed at night. Still a nice diffuser.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to use</li>
            <li> Works great , just not meant for large rooms</li>
            <li> use everyday and LOVE! :) thanks !</li>
            <li> I love this aromatherapy mister!  It has given me hours of enjoyment and I love that it turns off when out of water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now and I love it. I use it every other day to diffuse mainly doTerra lavender oil. It smells so good to me-and I am usually pretty sensitive to perfumes/colognes or air fresheners (I hate most air fresheners actually). I have it in the bathroom and it fills that small room with scent. When I have it in the kitchen-the scent of the oil is not so strong-but mildly noticeable. I may need to order more of them.  I love the colored lights it puts out (there is an option to have no colorful lights) and the sound of the thing working is peaceful to me.</li>
            <li> Got this for the upstairs as well as a request from my kids for a diffuser. They love this diffuser. The changing colors of lights definitely has won them over. More importantly, it does a great job diffusing the scent over a good area and runs for a nice amount of time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS DIFFUSER! I have two diffusers and I use this one everyday over my other one because it doesn&#x27;t have a timer, it just runs until the water runs out! It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> Works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This diffuser has been awesome! I had previously owned the taller one but it had a design flaw that caused it to shut off before the water ran out.&lt;br /&gt;This one has been going strong for a solid two months, twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to clean as well, I&#x27;ve found the best way to clean the oil residue out from the inside is by using a Magic Eraser. Gets the extra oil off in no time and leaves no residue. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> This product arrived wonderfully packaged. It takes less water than I imagined it would but still runs for a few hours giving of a soft scent. The light doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;turn-off&amp;#34; as much as it greatly diminishes it&#x27;s glow.</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser when I first got it. It looked nice, provided nice soothing lighting, and created a wonderful scent. Unfortunately, it only worked three times and I had to return it. :(</li>
            <li> This diffuser is great! Works very quietly, and oil Is well spread throughout even large rooms. Kids love the changing colors when I use it in their rooms at night. Automatically shuts off!</li>
            <li> The ZAQ Litemist Aromatherapy works very well! Easily and quickly diffuses my favorite EO&#x27;s. Highly recommended. And very affordable!</li>
            <li> This works well.  Wish I had purchased the larger one as this only runs for about 3 hrs.</li>
            <li> I have three of these in my house, and we love them! I keep them in the bedrooms - one in mine and one in each kids&#x27; room. The kids really love the changing color light to watch as they fall asleep. It makes a nice night light for them, not to mention how helpful the diffused oils are! (I usually turn the light off on mine when I sleep, although it does have a tiny glow still.) Even if I&#x27;m only running the one diffuser in my bedroom, guests can still smell it as they walk in the house. So although it doesn&#x27;t have a super long range for the scent, it does still freshen the whole house!</li>
            <li> Like some others have stated, it was good while it lasted.  We received ours on May 17, 2014 and 1 of the 2 we purchased stopped functioning last month (Sept. 2014 timeframe, approx. 4 months after receiving it).  My wife only uses distilled water in the units and no citrus essential oils, so we&#x27;re a bit disappointed that while trying to take good care of the unit, it simply decided one day to not work.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about 5-6 months and now it won&#x27;t turn on. I read that the disc might need replacing but I feel like 5-6 months isn&#x27;t very long for it to already need replacing.</li>
            <li> I had problems with this the first few times I had it and put it away......I went to use it yesterday and it leaked all over the place....it never worked right and I am sorry I put it away............I just throught it only ran a short time.........I am sorry I ever bought the thing. I think it was used and abused and sent as new................</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. I love to put lavender essential oil in it and make my kitchen smell amazing and calming. It makes the whole room smell good, though I wish it would extend throughout the house! It is an expensive little device but I love the soft light emitted and the look of the vapor coming out of it. It&#x27;s also great that it shuts off automatically when it runs out of water. Can&#x27;t wait to try some other EO scents!</li>
            <li> The diffusing aspect of this works quite well. However, I was so disappointed that the third setting &amp;#34;no light&amp;#34; is indeed false advertising. The top cone glows blue, not as blue as the other setting, but brighter than many night lights for children&#x27;s rooms. It is so stinkn&#x27; bright that the shadows it casts throughout my 22 month old son&#x27;s bedroom (about 12&#x27;x14&#x27;) frighten him. Light as bright as that disrupts sleep. There is no way on earth that I can use this in my bedroom because it would keep me awake. If I had known, I would not have bought this brand. I will have to find another one to purchase for his room. This is disappointing to spend $40 and not receive what was advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the company directly through their website about this problem, but I have not heard back four weeks later. I want them to change their advertising on their website and on Amazon, etc.</li>
            <li> This one is awesome, happy so far. I use it on my saks and is small enough that is not noticeable enough but it fills up my entire office of a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, this diffuser! It&#x27;s easy to use, just fill up to the line and drop 4-6 drops of essential oils and let it sooth your worries away! So relaxing and visually appealing. It changes between multiple colors with a light steam-like mist. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Meets my needs. Just wish it had an automatic shutoff so I can go to sleep with it.</li>
            <li> LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!  The Zaq Noor is a great price, very powerful, and works well as a diffuser. I do not get the color options or how to really change it up at all. The button options don&#x27;t work consistently, and it does emit light when your are sleeping. I have to cover it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning: if you are lucky enough to find blends that aren&#x27;t selling their specific company oils remember this is a small unit. Put more VERY few drops or you will be overwhelmed quickly.  Great price, easy to transport, easy to clean. AND I have no problem with citrus oils;)</li>
            <li> I have had the ZAQ Noor LiteMist Diffuser for two months, using it almost every day.  It&#x27;s easy to clean.  May even get another one for a different area of the house.  The only thing I noticed is that it is more fragrant the first hour that it is used than the rest of the time it runs.</li>
            <li> Got this product only yesterday and loving it. It&#x27;s quiet, the aroma is not very strong (just right). You might need more than one for a big room, but you can always add more drops if you want the aroma stronger. It&#x27;s small enough for any room in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of cons for now:&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;light off&amp;#34; function doesn&#x27;t shut completely, there is still a blue glow and illuminates part of the area.&lt;br /&gt;No battery option, you need to plug it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great pro: Shuts off automatically when water runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend getting if contemplating.</li>
            <li> I just got into essential oils and searched MANY websites to find a diffuser that was rated high and priced pretty reasonably. This diffuser fits that description perfectly. I got it at a great sale price and only wish I bought two instead of one! My husband and I turn it one right before we go to bed and it shuts off when the water runs out. It&#x27;s so nice because I don&#x27;t have to worry about it ruining the motor! It&#x27;s very quiet and love the soft lights. It&#x27;s also nice to turn off the lights if you want to. Also, shipping was amazingly fast!</li>
            <li> I love my defuser had it for about a month. Works great! Love the multicolored lighting! Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great,  smooth changing colors,  great diffusion, shuts off automatically.</li>
            <li> After being shocked by the price of diffusers, I decided to go &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34;, yet highly rated. I really like this little diffuser. It seems to last about 4 or 5 hours and turns off on its own. I put a couple of drops of oil in before bed and it turns off after we are fast asleep. I don&#x27;t think it is too noisy, but it does have a soft whirring sound...nothing that keeps my husband or me awake. I don&#x27;t mind the light but you can have the light off yet still diffusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to adjust the oil as the first night I put way too much in...so I would start with less and then add drop by drop. We live in a small place. Our bedroom is small and it fills it with scent within a few minutes...I would say 10-ish. I get it ready before bed and then tuck everyone in, brush my teeth, and the room has a pleasant, relaxing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on buying another one so I can  use one in the bedroom and one in the living room.</li>
            <li> I love mine and it works great! The one thing I really like about it is it shuts off after all the water is gone :)</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.  I like that it is a cold air diffuser so as not to compromise the integrity of the oils.  I was a bit concerned with price to begin with but find myself using every day to put different scents in the air.  from relaxing to energizing.  meditating and calm to purifying the air.  Plan to buy another soon.</li>
            <li> We use this diffuser every night in our son&#x27;s room with lavender. Works wonders with all oils and puts an amazing scent in the room!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, but it broke after using it once a day (or less)  for only a few weeks. It seems like it burned out (when I turn it on, the light flashes and then goes out... it won&#x27;t run.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it as a gift so I&#x27;m not sure how to go about returning it.  Hoping this one is just a fluke.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Nice little product.  Easy to clean and fill.  Liked it enough to buy another.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Works great!!  I use it with my doterra oils!</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I absolutely LOVE amazons costumer service. - now to the problem: I bought TWO of these, one for each of my children&#x27;s bedrooms. Used them 3 times - for a half hour each time- and THEY BOTH BROKE. the on/off button seems to have been the problem. It would not come on at all or come on and turn itself off after 5 seconds. Soooo disappointed because I put a LOT of research into this and I actually did love them while they worked. My kids loved the colors changing in the dark! So sad it didn&#x27;t work. Also, if you do purchase make sure to save the box they arrive in because it&#x27;s an odd sized box and I threw mine out, so to return I had to BUY a box at the ups store for almost $8! I do not recommend this product to anyone. :-/</li>
            <li> Wife loves this thing!</li>
            <li> We have 3 of these and love them!</li>
            <li> This diffuser is nice. It is a good deal for the price. It arrived as expected and was easy to set up. It has a cool &amp;#34;light changing&amp;#34; feature that allows it to rotate through several different colors. It says it also has a &amp;#34;light off&amp;#34; option; however, when the &amp;#34;light off&amp;#34; is activated it is still quite bright as the light does not really go &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; ... it is much brighter than your average night light. It was so bright I placed it in my bedroom floor at night. If it is not going to be in a dark room or you want a bit of light, this will be perfect. It will stay on as long as it has water and then it will shut off by itself. If the light was able to be turned off completely then it would be a 5 star item.</li>
            <li> Loooooove it.  Light mist.  Mood colors that you can cycle or select one.  Quiet.  Turns off when empty.  Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd one :)  Got this one for my bedroom at night.  I diffuse Lavender to help me sleep.  Now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser.  Works well and is quiet.  Colors are a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this diffuser for 4 months now and I really like it!  I love it&#x27;s modern design and the lights that change color.  It does a great job of diffusing my oils!  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! I have 4 and it is my favorite. It works super well and fills the house with oils. Diffusing helps me so much with mood and energy. I recommend this diffuser to everyone. I also bought the slightly larger one as well.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this!  I can&#x27;t imagine not having the auto shut off feature. I do wish the when youturn off the llights it doesn&#x27;t glow but it&#x27;s bearable. All in all, I still love it.</li>
            <li> The diffuser stopped working in 4 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disagreeing with the other commentators, but essentially, it&#x27;s pretty much the same thing as a humidifier. It works under the same concept, but obviously, due to the small reservoir it won&#x27;t humidify a room. It does allow the oils to become airborn, but it&#x27;s not an atomizing diffuser which will give a greater healthful effect, but at a much higher price. For uplifting a mood, or setting an ambiance, it&#x27;s great at a fair price. The &#x27;nightlight&#x27; feature is a bit too bright for me but you can turn it off completely.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  I now own two of them.  I have never experienced a problem with the product.  Don&#x27;t over feed it with your essential oil as this gives off a great amount of steam and quickly fills the rooms.  I put one downstairs and it even fills the upstairs with aroma.  I use the other one in my room during flu season to diffuse some thieves.  Remember, a few drops will suffice.  Good value for my money.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this for about a month and so far, so good. We used it almost every day for the first couple weeks we had it.  Not as much now. I do wish that the light off function really did turn the light off. Instead it is a dim blue light.</li>
            <li> ZERO STARS!&lt;br /&gt;It work one time then quit working!</li>
            <li> This diffuser is beautiful and works great with the oils. Thank you.</li>
            <li> No problems with it so far. If you&#x27;re looking for a diffuser that covers large areas and runs all night, then you should probably look elsewhere. But if you&#x27;ll primarily be using this in a smaller space and don&#x27;t mind it running several hours, then this is the diffuser for you. Good price, easy to clean. Good with just 3-5 drops of your preferred oil(s). If it takes you more drops then you should probably purchase better quality oil.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! It changes colors, and you have an option to leave it on a solid color. It&#x27;s easy to transport and the water lasts a long time. This turns off when it runs out of water. Put a few drops of your desired essential oil and let your Aroma Therapy begin!</li>
            <li> has a 4 hour run time and thenturns off.  This is great so it won&#x27;t burn out!  I am very happy with this product.  I am thinking about buying another one for my summer home!</li>
            <li> Disappointed that this diffuser stopped working after less than a month.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this diffuser.  Easy to follow instructions.  Love the look of the product and really enjoy the changing colors.</li>
            <li> Use this every day for past 6mo. And works great. Always get complements on how the air smells inside.  Unit works with no issues</li>
            <li> I have a well known more expensive brand (Young Living) and this is quite comparable in getting the job done.  I love the ability to change the light color (as this is in my children&#x27;s room); however even on the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; light function, a mild blue glow is still quite visible from the cone.  The perks are, that it is easy to clean and refill; however it doesn&#x27;t emit as large of a mist as my Young Living one does. For the price, I would recommend!  Update:  I am now giving this 5 stars, it&#x27;s been over 18 months and it&#x27;s still working like the first day I bought it.  On a side note, one of my more expensive diffuses stopped working after only 10 months.  I will be purchasing another one of these to replace, possibly two!!</li>
            <li> So far so good no problems yet. We&#x27;ll see</li>
            <li> Great value for this diffuser.  I use my Young Living essential oils with them and it works well, haven&#x27;t had any issues with it yet.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant ordering this. Boy was I wrong! It works great!! The moment it&#x27;s turned on, it starts working and I can immediately smell the scent!</li>
            <li> This is the first oil diffuser I have purchased, and I am very happy with it. It&#x27;s easy to use, and almost instantly fills the room with fragrance. I will be purchasing more for the rest of my house!</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser, very cool looking and love to be able to have color changing or solid colors or none. The area to fill with water and your oil is small but should give you about 3 or so hours of aroma. The size is fairly compact so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviews about the diffuser dying out after a few uses. I have not had any problems so far and have been using it for a few weeks now. I do however recommend that when the unit shuts off automatically because its empty, make sure you use a towel or rag to completely clean it out and dry it. I think this will help prolong the life of it.</li>
            <li> I was unsure of buying this after reading some of the reviews. I&#x27;ve been using this in my classroom for 2 months now and love it. I have had no problems at all. Great for the price. Would definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> It seems right now to be working good. So its ok</li>
            <li> I thought it would be larger. Probably should have paid more attention to the description. But it works well for a small office.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying a diffuser. I read alot of reviews and I&#x27;m happy with my choice. I think this particular design is space-efficient and almost tip-proof. With kids in the house I look out for that. The kids (and I) also like the light feature on this. Press the button once to turn the diffuser on and it rotates through different colors. Press it again to stop it on your favorite color! Press it yet again to turn the light off if you want to go to sleep. Diffuses nicely for about 4 hours, then shuts off automatically when it runs out of water.</li>
            <li> This little machine is very simple to use and works great! I have one in each of my children&#x27;s rooms and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for months and need to add another soon. Works great with distiller water.</li>
            <li> I got this diffuser solely for use in my office. It does not disappoint. It runs for about 4 hours straight. I run it continuously to rid the air of the icky germs. Cleans out easily. The lights on it are ok...I do not use the changing colors function. I keep it on 1 color. Great price and product!</li>
            <li> Works great! Easy to use. Love it.</li>
            <li> Use it every evening with lavender oil and during the day with tea tree oil. Works great</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser. Have used it for about 2 months about 3 times a week at night in my bedroom. Very nice distribution of scent in the room  I like the compact size as well</li>
            <li> It is tough to get five stars out of me, but I&#x27;m quite impressed with the Zaq. I put my unit through heavy use and it holds up. A solid little unit that works like a champ.</li>
            <li> The power button stopped working a week after I started using it. It will turn the unit on but it won&#x27;t turn it off, instead I have to unplug it to turn it off. I&#x27;m too lazy tu return it so I will have to live with it as it is.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser and I&#x27;ve been using it on a daily basis for about 2 months.  It&#x27;s very easy to clean and can really pump out some vapor.  It has optional alternating lights, light selection, and no light options.  Feels like a good quality and due to its construction its very sturdy.</li>
            <li> You know you are in for it when the company doesn&#x27;t even bother to spell check the instructions. The unit does not have automatic shut off. Also requires use of purified water. I don&#x27;t know why. I used mine ONE time and it stopped working. The first time I had it on with some lavender oil for about 15 minutes. The next day, I turned it on and it ran for all of 2 seconds before biting the dust. Replaced mine through amazon (in one day) and got the now foods version. Much better quality. Has auto shut off so I can go to sleep with it on and I can use tap water with it. Most importantly, it still works.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. So easy to use and the kids like seeing the different colors progress.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift and it worked wonderfully the first day, but quit on the second day. Luckily return was easy.</li>
            <li> Just the right size, easy to fill with the supplied measuring cup and the varying lights make it a interesting device.  Has variable selection for light control and auto shut off.</li>
            <li> This is a nice diffuser. I&#x27;ve used it regularly since arrival. Simple to use. Auto shut-off when it runs out of water. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this thing. She was so disappointed when I told her that I didn&#x27;t order the one from her essential oils website, but after the first day/night of using this thing, she was in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main critique, is that you can&#x27;t turn the lights completely off at night (at least that&#x27;s what my wife told me). There is a dim switch that makes it a soft blue glow, but If you could turn the light off completely, this thing would be perfect. Still 5 stars because my wife doesn&#x27;t leave home without it. Seriously.</li>
            <li> This product is used almost every day. Does a great job. Shuts off automatically when empty. Most recently I purchased one for my father to share the joy of diffusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful not to use citrus oils!! Since most people don&#x27;t actually read the instructions/fine print, I want to help by letting you know it will ruin your diffuser! Peppermint and spearmint oils are the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors of the ZAQ Noor are great, as are the light setting options -- all colors, one color, and no color.</li>
            <li> Love the way it made my room smell - the scented mist is relaxing and less abrasive that a wall plugin, for example - but my machine broke after only several uses in less than a month. Amazon provided awesome customer service in response to my issue, but I would like to warn potential buyers that this particular diffuser doesn&#x27;t seem to be of great quality. I have only used pure essential oils in it and followed all other directions (used filtered water, I avoided citrus essential oils, and I never filled it with water past the line,) yet still, my power button got completely stuck one day. Occasionally, if I press really hard on the button, it&#x27;ll turn on (other times, it just flashes or doesn&#x27;t turn on at all). I assume this is from some kind of leakage... Overall, this product is great in theory, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to stand up so well. Make sure to purchase a diffuser from a seller that allow for returns!!!!!!! I did not catch this when I purchased the item and didn&#x27;t understand why I couldn&#x27;t exchange a defective item. Please ask questions if you have them!</li>
            <li> As described, highly recommended .</li>
            <li> Works ok but would recommend paying more and getting a Doterra or Young Living diffuser. Well worth the upgrade!!</li>
            <li> Love it, was one of the aromatherapy diffusers that was on a cheaper side on the Amazon search. Small, modern works well, been using it every night for the last few months. Even the packaging it came in was so cute and cool, it took me a while to throw the box out. Love this diffuser!</li>
            <li> OK for a small rooom.  My biggest gripe is with the power cord.  It plugs underneath the diffuser but it&#x27;s not an L shape connector so the device does not sit flat on my table, it&#x27;s tilted because of the connector. Overall it seems like cheap chinese made piece that although works for now, I have doubts it will stay in working condition.    Although there is a setting to turn off the light, that only applies to main light.  It still has an LED for the on/off button that is entirely too bright for use in a bedroom at night.</li>
            <li> Perfect little oil diffuser.  Best bang for the buck for smaller rooms.  I love how it changes colors as it diffuses. It sets the mood!</li>
            <li> I love the attractive visual it creates while it operates &amp; also it works so well with how it gently mists out the natural fragrance - one really key benefit for me is that it switches itself off when it empties, I find that so helpful. No more sticky mess from oil burners!&lt;br /&gt;Jacqueline Organics, Nelson NZ.</li>
            <li> The Diffuser works great.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have Fibromyalgia and aromatherapy is helpful with the symptoms and this diffuser is as good as the expensive brands. I like that it&#x27;s small, but very effective. And my 7 month old grandson loves the changing colors.</li>
            <li> I use this adorable diffuser nearly daily. I really like the fact that it uses water to diffuse the oils rather than felt pads like my previous diffuser. Just put the water into the holder and add a few drops of the desired oils and turn it on. So easy!  One push of the button and it is in multi-color light mode; push it another time and the colored light isn&#x27;t displayed; a third time turns it off. I intend to get one for each of my kids who are in college.</li>
            <li> Just got it but love it so far. We will see how long it lasts. The white one is very pretty with the lights gradually changing</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser while it lasted. I received it as a Christmas gift last year. I enjoyed it so much I sent one to my mother for her birthday over the summer. However, in December of this year, just a little over a year after it was purchased (and of course when the warranty no longer applies) it stopped working entirely. I can&#x27;t get it to turn on and had to throw it away. It&#x27;s possible I got a bad model, so far my mother&#x27;s is fine, but I&#x27;m very sad that it only lasted a year, and I can&#x27;t trust the brand now that I need to start shopping for a new one.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Very simple to use and haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with it so far. One thing to note is that it makes a water dripping noise that is soothing in my opinion. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> My family laughs at me for having this, but I absolutely love it.  It&#x27;s easy to use and to clean, and it never mixes scents.  I could use lemon in the evening and lavender the next morning and each scent would be distinct.  The unit is small and easy to operate, and gives scent to my whole bedroom (about 12x12).  I recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in my office at work. I was very surprised that it puts out as much mist as it does. The size was larger then I thought too. I have been using it for a week now and everyone that comes into the office comment about how good it smells in there.&lt;br /&gt;It is an OLD trailer. And it did NOT smell good before. So I am happy.</li>
