            <li>Perfect for fine, damaged hair</li>
            <li>A great product and a great seller. :)</li>
            <li>I think Amazon is truly amazing in some ways because you can find great products here that you might never hear about.</li>
            <li>It smells really good too and the scent lingers for awhile.</li>
            <li>That being said, I always try to take care of myself by using good products.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample of this at a salon and loved it.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good service.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really good on my hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still good</li>
            <li>Good smell.</li>
            <li>Good amount.</li>
            <li>The price from this seller is exceptionally good.</li>
            <li>It arrived in one of my subscription boxes, a 4 ounce size, and I hadn&#x27;t wanted to try it because I thought nothing could be as good as what I was already using (Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Primer)</li>
            <li>To my surprise, it controlled frizz as well as my much beloved BB</li>
            <li>But for the health of my hair, I&amp;#34;ll stay with BB, which I think is a superior product.</li>
            <li>The smell is good but</li>
            <li>so it must be good.  </li>
            <li>good price.........</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything I can find has a good review:  </li>
            <li>(BTW: for superior conditioning \\&quot;no</li>
            <li>/&gt;It might make your hair healthier but can&#x27;t it smell good??</li>
            <li>Sprayed it on and it seemed to be good leave-</li>
            <li>Good product not for me.</li>
            <li>is so good for your hair.</li>
            <li>it smells good,</li>
            <li>The price was good on the recommended product and it seems to work.</li>
            <li>They sent me a sample of the shampoo and it is just as good.</li>
            <li>This is generally a good thing</li>
            <li>My hair feels just as good as it did with Redken, I swear.</li>
            <li>Good thermal protection on your hair.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li>I spray it on after washing my hair and my daughters hair and it makes it silky smooth, helps with tangles and smells great!</li>
            <li>It is a good product, but it didn&#x27;t work as well for me as the Keratin Plus version.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>The price is really good as well.</li>
            <li>got this for my sister - her words the best thing she has tried in a while - leaves hair feeling smooth and sliky</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>I will probably continue to buy though, since the detangling aspect of it is good.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because of the reviews and I was looking for a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>It really is as good as everyone says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells good though.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells good.</li>
            <li>Loved this product.  </li>
            <li>good product i like it</li>
            <li>My good friend who is a hair dresser recommended this product to me.  </li>

            <li>It works great and leaves your hair smelling nice.</li>
            <li>Good heat barrier.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>This is a good leave-in product i would recommand.</li>
            <li>And it smells good(:</li>
            <li>loved, and continue buying chefgou in record time.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it, it must be good.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely loved the smell, so I ended up buying a bottle.</li>
            <li>Well this product is good, it&#x27;s not a miracle</li>
            <li>This is really good at protecting and fortifying your hair.  </li>
            <li>Bought from a variety of suppliers and have had good luck with all of them.</li>
            <li>When I tried to give it away to my friends they all laughed at me and just said \\&quot;you fell for that too, huh?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I still have not found a product that works as good as this does.  </li>
            <li>When finances are good, I visit my hairstylist-friend every 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a good thing, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you do your resesarch you will find that cetearyl alcohol is one of the good alcohols for your hair</li>
            <li>Good stuff..</li>
            <li>This is a good buy for me</li>
            <li>Good service.  </li>
            <li>I put a good amount of this in my hair before towel drying</li>
            <li>Otherwise good product.</li>
            <li>Either way, it smells good and softens my hair</li>
            <li>I would definately recommend this to anyone looking for a good detangler...</li>
            <li>It gives good moisture without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>So I am very happy to have found a source for the original product.</li>

            <li>I use a lot of leave in product but this one is the best, I really love this leave in, you can&#x27;t buy anything better than this one</li>

            <li>Super happy!!!!</li>

            <li>Smells great, light, and leaves my hair manageable!</li>
            <li>The detangling is great, but like most products-- I need to add gel and some type of spray to manage the frizz.</li>
            <li>great product I&#x27;ve used it for years now and leaves hair being able to combine it must buy for any type of hair must buy it</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve never rated a product before, but this stuff is really amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two products.</li>
            <li>My best bet is using a leave in creme conditioner and gently drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>some kind of miracle.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>It does a really nice job of detangling.  </li>
            <li>She said she had many clients that loved it.</li>
            <li>This works the best on the kids wo much build up</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so nice with just 3 sprays.  </li>
            <li>Besides the nice scent, I did not like this product at all.</li>
            <li>I give 2 stars because of the nice smell, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>when I&#x27;m taking care of my own hair at home.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to know that there&#x27;s another product out there, just in case BB decides to discontinue its primer potion.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is really the best.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been looking for a good leave in conditioner that helps my hair look healthy.  </li>
            <li>(I look forward to when they can manage and care for their own hair!)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lightweight but effective.</li>
            <li>This is really a great buy for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I buy it on Amazon because it&#x27;s the best price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I am sure it is good for all types of hair.</li>
            <li>It really works and has a great smell!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the absolute best of the bunch.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand the awesome reviews of this product.</li>
            <li>Nice not to rinse</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look nice and shiny and silky.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smell really nice too.</li>
            <li>Love how it keeps tangles out and keeps hair looking good.  </li>
            <li>The best part to get it this time was the price, so much cheaper then the stores.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>The bonus is it smells good and makes her hair even more shiny.</li>
            <li>I ended up LOVING this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this product, leave my hair in a really good shape.</li>
            <li>But after reading reviews and in search of a good product (for 15 yrs) I bit the bullet, and im soo glad I did.</li>
            <li>the kind of hair that can break hairbrushes when using them.</li>
            <li>A &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; kind of scent.</li>
            <li>with that said, it does smell decently nice.</li>
            <li>to try and liked it</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, and it does a good job of detangling.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smell that reminds me of a hair salon.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser uses this on me and I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>And smells nice.</li>
            <li>This product is deftly a 10.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>Nice size and price.  </li>
            <li>I tryed it on my own hair</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get over how nice my hair looks with this product.  </li>
            <li>but I just started to bleach my own hair, which is quite a story in itself</li>
            <li>The absolute best.</li>
            <li>Nothing was 100% effective.  </li>
            <li>This product is not as effective with colored, permanented hair as it Wella&#x27;s Liquid Hair Restructurizer.  </li>
            <li>I have tried my fair share of products for frizz, leave in conditioner, and heat spray and by far this is the best.</li>
            <li>Best detangler for naturally curly hair out there!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, been using it for years and keeps my hair in great condition after flat ironing and blow drying!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product because of all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>I originally started using this, and was really happy with it, but then I tried &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave -in</li>
            <li>I can tell you it&#x27;s totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li>also it smells great, but not overpowering, its just clean smelling.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s the best anti-frizz treatment in the world.</li>
            <li>This is great, specially for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, works great as a detangler (on my very long hair), and keeps my hair from getting frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Great price, quick shipping amazing product.</li>
            <li>What an incredible bargain and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I was recommended by my new hair stylist to try this product , it has been the best product i have used .</li>
            <li>My hair smelled great, had great shine, and felt soft and silky to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Honestly this is one of my best leave ins so far.  </li>
            <li>Great product that leaves your hair feeling silky smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>It does minimize the frizz without the same flattening effect that you get with silicone products, but you have to use a fair bit of product to get the best results.</li>
            <li>This product will be really good if the smell won&#x27;t be this strong.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice light smell that I really loved.</li>
            <li>The only product comparable is a good morrocan oil, which can be pricey - so this is an excellent alternative.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use with no noticeable residue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very strong flowery scent</li>
            <li>It is very easy to get the style I like now.</li>
            <li>It gets tangled VERY easily.</li>
            <li>My hair is so manageable and styles very easy.  </li>
            <li>It makes it very easy to brush it.</li>
            <li>It makes it very easy to come out my hair.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting more once I run out for sure!</li>

            <li>Even those stubborn ends feel more like \\&quot;tresses\\&quot; than \\&quot;hair.\\&quot;  </li>

            <li>It is working well ,my hair has a lot more body</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>I tried this product at my Mom&#x27;s and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>She had a free sample bottle, so I came to amazon with the hopes I&#x27;d find it and voila!  </li>
            <li>A bit spendy, but then you get what you pay for :)</li>
            <li>However, I think it is a glorified Johnson &amp; Johnson &amp;#34;No More Tangles.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>My ends are hydrated and healthy, but I don&#x27;t think anymoreso than if I had used No</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Love the way this product makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Beauticians have commented on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li>love this product, use it every day, better than using a conditioner.</li>
            <li>My favorite been using this for years.</li>
            <li>I love  this stuff.</li>
            <li>Takes out all the tangles and makes hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>i try to put spray more</li>
            <li>I love to try products</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and it is quite magical.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on my hair since I have been using it</li>
            <li>My mom was a hair stylist my entire life, and through all those years of her taking me to the fancy beauty supply stores, I&#x27;ve never found a product that gets my hair PERFECT without a HINT of stickiness or oiliness like this product.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product after my stylist recommend it over 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite hair products in the world.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Although I love Chi&#x27;s Silk Infusion, this works WAY better.</li>
            <li>With that said, in my opinion, this should be used on occasion and make sure you use a clarifying shampoo with it every so often.</li>
            <li>If I use more, it leaves a greasy look on my hair (as if I haven&#x27;t washed my hair for days).</li>
            <li>Still helps smooth out the hair!</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair looking healthy between styling and getting cuts.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>THIS IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE HAIR PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>or maybe more of a cream consistency (almost like the baking ingredient &#x27;shortening&#x27;).</li>
            <li>I USED THIS PRODUCT BUT BE SURE NOT TO USE</li>
            <li>It keeps the static out of my hair.</li>
            <li>SOOOO glad I found this product</li>
            <li>I love what it has done for my hair</li>
            <li>and I was dreaming about this product to do the magic.</li>
            <li>I found that blow dryer takes off most of the smell.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>and it made my hair look shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hair product ever.</li>
            <li>All-time favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>I love watching Laura in the Kitchen on YouTube ,and on her beauty channel called Vitale Style.</li>
            <li>I love Its A 10.</li>
            <li>All in alll I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>

            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>My hair says thank you when I use any its a 10 product, this leave in keeps my hair looking healthy from all the coloring I do to it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the immediate results after 4-5 sprays.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>even my coworkers see the difference between my hair now and my hair before I used this. :)))))</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I ended up throwing most of this bottle away and buying from my salon.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and my hair feels better.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Mane and Tail (ok, but leaves a residue that starts to crunch; and can be oily); Deva Curl (can&#x27;t even remember if this one was memorable for hyper-dry);</li>
            <li>I just love what this does to my hair.  </li>
            <li>most days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Or even better, no smell at all?</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I started to buy this product online because it&#x27;s a better deal than at stores or salons.  </li>
            <li>I applied after/during blow drying to see if it would control more frizz that way</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair shiny and healthy.</li>

            <li>So glad I listened to her.  </li>
            <li>i was expecting magic and didnt get it.  </li>
            <li>you should try it you might love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using leave-in products for many years now, instead of blow drying my hair to make it manageable, or straightening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to use this when I bleached my hair, once it was healthy again, I stopped.  </li>

            <li>My hair just looks better when I use this</li>
            <li>The price you can not beat..,..my hairdresser sells this for $35.00 I love this product if you have curly hair</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t a problem with the product; it works okay for detangling and it does not leave a heavy-leave-in-feeling.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this - helps my hair stay healthy while blow drying</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>use sparingly and focus on ends for finer hair :)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>my hair feels so silky and healthy despite all the abuse I subjected it to this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products for my highlighted hair, yet none of them worked well.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll get a better deal if you have some wiggle room on when to purchase. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experimented with many leave in conditioners that give my hair some sculpt without stiffness.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is marketed to women</li>
            <li>I immediately fell in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.....</li>
            <li>My hair was just bleached, for lack of better word, and it felt damaged.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend buying on line, it&#x27;s roughly $5 or more cheaper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 has been my favorite leave in product yet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than any detangling product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I am using a much better product now</li>
            <li>It is just okay</li>
            <li>The price is better than if I was to go out and purchase separate products that do what this one does.</li>
            <li>No matter what my hair is fantastic when I use this product!</li>
            <li>Works fantastic!  </li>

            <li>Unlike so many products, it does what it says.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>I spray it on after washing my hair and I am able to brush through it.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing, too, which is important for something that doesn&#x27;t get rinsed out.  </li>
            <li>but I would say this is just ok.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>

            <li>seriously in love with this product- After spraying it in my hair, I could run my fingers through.</li>
            <li>My hair feels like silk and after using it once, my coworkers kept complimenting how healthy my hair looked, asking if I got a cut or color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Loveeeee it!! :)</li>
            <li>so well I tolerate it for now, unless I find something that works better without the parabens.&lt;br</li>

            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but like it better with their hair.  </li>
            <li>Vatika coconut oil is 100 times better for me than this product and for a fraction of it&#x27;s price,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this at the bueaty shop</li>

            <li>I just cannot say enough, it&#x27;s the perfect product!</li>
            <li>I used to have to use a straightener to get the nice shiny smooth hair....not any more.  </li>
            <li>I will definately be purchasing more....</li>
            <li>I love how It&#x27;s a 10</li>
            <li>so we are pleased with Amazon</li>
            <li>However this isn&#x27;t an authentic product.</li>
            <li>I am on my 2nd 10 oz bottle and the 2oz starter bottle has been perfect for traveling, it&#x27;s never leaked.  </li>
            <li>Does that tell you how much I love this product?</li>
            <li>I love it, it does wonders for my hair</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Even if it did 3 of the 10 I&#x27;d love it.</li>
            <li>Silky, smooth, lightweight, tangle-free, shiny!</li>
            <li>Most of the people using this product are probably women, but I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>and I love the product.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Whereas with a cream rinse you rinse out most of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Be sure and get the largest size as you will want more once you buy.  </li>
            <li>You get a better deal with the 10 oz</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how even with all the elements (sun, chlorine, and salt water), my hair felt smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair becomes soft and shine, great product and smells nice too.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because of all the great reviews it all ready had on here</li>

            <li>I fell in love with the product.  </li>
            <li>My daughters and I love this as a leave-in treatment to protect our hair, eliminate frizz, as we go about our heat damaging routines.</li>
            <li>It actually works and the wonderful smell stays all day in your hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it repairs your hair.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product based on a recommendation from a health &amp; beauty blog that I read suggesting that it was a more cost-effective alternative to hair serums.  </li>

            <li>I love the smell, too.  </li>
            <li>I have used literally dozen of products to help me control the frizz in my hair, and while some work more than others, this one didn&#x27;t seem to work at all.</li>
            <li>AND LIKE MAGIC.</li>

            <li>It makes for super soft hair, the ability it has to detangled even the knottiest hair is incredible!</li>

            <li>I think this works pretty good.</li>
            <li>and this makes my hair so soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and this product is great at getting out all the tangles after a shower!</li>
            <li>At first, I loved this stuff.</li>
            <li>I got a great hair cut and started using Hask Argan oil products (conditioner, oil and once weekly deep conditioner) and that seems to be a more effective (and cheaper) regiment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the first 2 ingredients say a lot about what we are paying for and how good it is for our hair.......</li>
            <li>I have long hair and this is perfect for getting knots out after the shower.</li>
            <li>Best product for getting rid of tangles in long hair.  </li>

            <li>well worth it!!</li>
            <li>Glad it was easy to purchase this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>(Chi&#x27;s oil is the best, plus I can use on dry haired as well, which I cant with this stuff).</li>
            <li>The best hair product for dry, snarly or tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>It works wonderfully as a tangle-remover, but when your hair dries WATCH OUT; It will be brittle, break off, dry out.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair healthy and strong</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for excellent hair products for my hair that tends to be on the dry brittle side.  </li>

            <li>The product works great and leaves hair so soft!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried so many other products and this one is the best.</li>

            <li>Very fast shipping and very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is now VERY, VERY silky, soft, shiny and wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is the best, it definitely has the right name - it is a 10!  </li>
            <li>The difference was amazing from the first time I used it and just got better with each use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 hair mask, which when I have a bit more time to take care of myself in the morning is fantastic as well.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair really soft and its a great detangler.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li>Hair feels and looks great, sleek, soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It was a bit more coiled than normal and looked really good.</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple brands of leave-in conditioners and nothing has worked as incredibly as this product.  </li>
            <li>It MAY have been a bit more smooth, but nothing that warrants the raving reviews here.</li>
            <li>Great for getting tangles out of young kids hair.</li>
            <li>It works best with the Wet brush:</li>
            <li>I love this product, and I love that I found it for such a great price.</li>
            <li>Leaves no heavy conditioner feeling and smells great.</li>
            <li>, I used this product according with instructions on the label, I always use a good sulfate free shampoo, and a good conditioner, it wasn&#x27;t enough for this product to deliver the desired results, when I applied it</li>
            <li>My hair looks shiny, healthy and fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and styled and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky and static free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 is the most fantastic product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This product used with a good quality blow dryer got my hair completely straight from root to ends.</li>
            <li>I tried others as this one is kind of pricey but found it to be worth every penny.</li>
            <li>you probably won&#x27;t have to use too much of the product to get good results.</li>
            <li>I think it would be good for someone who doesn&#x27;t bleach their hair as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Nothing really special!</li>
            <li>I love this product and was very, very happy to find that I could order it on line and pay less</li>

            <li>I started noticing that she was having a lot of hair breakage and a significant amount of frizz at the top of her head.</li>
            <li>the price is also excellent comare to other stores.</li>
            <li>I found this on a list of top 10 hair styling products and I was definitely not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I think the company has a good product, but it is a little on the proud side.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a coconut type smell, but not bad at all even though I don&#x27;t care for coconut !</li>
            <li>and I can brush through easily.</li>
            <li>This is an ok leave-in, but definitely isn&#x27;t worth the hype I&#x27;ve seen in so many reviews.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My hair tangles easily and becomes brittle even easier.  </li>
            <li>gorgeous, shiny, silky smooth straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Helps to amazingly easy to brush tangled up hair, leaves them silky.</li>
            <li>This stuff allows me to brush my hair out so easily.</li>
            <li>I would easily be spending 3 times longer brushing my hair without it.</li>
            <li>/ get&#x27;s frizzy easily.  </li>
            <li>And the smell is strong.  </li>
            <li>This smells good and leaves my hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sooooooooo strong, and it&#x27;s giving me a headache.  </li>
            <li>Makes combing out very easy, and my hair feels so soft and healthy!  </li>
            <li>That person must be highly sensitive to smells because I find it very nice, mild and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any perfume I wear (Chanel mostly).</li>
            <li>It is a great leave in conditioner as well as general hair product.  </li>
            <li>No frizz, curls are soft &amp; bouncy, amazing!</li>
            <li>After reading reviews of this product it really sounded like it would be perfect for her hair type but after using it for 4 months, her hair was left in even drier and more brittle condition than we started with.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m really loving this product!  </li>
            <li>best stuff i have used, hands down.</li>
            <li>I love the product, it does what it says it&#x27;ll do, and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of products, and this stuff is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>Best product hands down.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and leaves hair super soft!</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>(I have fine hair</li>
            <li>and it has been just fine for tangles.</li>
            <li>If your hair likes silicone and you don&#x27;t have fine hair, then this product may be a godsend.  </li>
            <li>I easily saved $40 because there was no tax and free delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s literally tangle free and so easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that tangles when you look at it.  </li>
            <li>I have fine semi wavy, damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I have medium length fine hair, with super-long thicker extensions.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine textured</li>
            <li>I have been trying to love this product for a while, but have yet to find a way to apply and use it in my hair that gives me wonderful results - I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the product and my hair or just my application/use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But once it does spray, it comes out as a fine mist</li>
            <li>Maybe I would not use it if I wasn&#x27;t still working, but I have fine hair and it helps alot.  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s pricing is typically the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it on my daughter who also has fine hair</li>
            <li>It is fine, but I have a lot of it, and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for ways to combat dryness and breakage.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair that breaks off</li>
            <li>Awesome price as well considering what a bottle half the size of this one cost in my hometown.</li>
            <li>I find it helps keep curl in my hair, which is fine textured.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery too!</li>
            <li>I love that even when my hair gets damp, I can re style quickly</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair strong, shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li>It smells cheap and is way too strong.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell, which smells perfume-like in the bottle but not as strong on my hair.</li>
            <li>As I get older, my hair gets more coarse, and this conditioner is wonderful!</li>
            <li>love this leave-in conditioner and will probably be a loyal</li>
            <li>and I am able to quickly transform my hair to do whatever I please.</li>
            <li>I wish this product wasn&#x27;t so pricey, but really I love how it quickly makes my hair managable out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Cuts down on frizz, smells great, and gives my hair nice shine and workability.</li>
            <li>It also works beautifully as a pre-heat spray (like before you go over a section of hair with your flat iron).  </li>
            <li>really does keep my hair healthy and well maintained!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product too!</li>
            <li>Great for detangling and leaves hair super manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>Amazing product for the hair, helps to feel very soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Works so well to detangle my fine hair and helps keep it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>so it breaks very easily, giving me lots of split ends, but this product keeps my hair  very soft and strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>The best leave in HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li>very good product; much more expensive in the hair salon; good buy; would buy it again</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, makes your hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already noticed a HUGE change in my hair.</li>
            <li>This has made a huge difference in the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li>The amount of product for the price is a HUGE value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am blessed with a huge amount of shoulder-length hair and have gone through 50 years of rinses, conditioners and de-tanglers in my time.  </li>
            <li>In local stores this is $50+  Great savings and find</li>
            <li>I came across Pantene Repair Light Conditioner.</li>
            <li>tangle free and shiny.</li>
            <li>It worked well to condition, smooth and give my hair shine.  </li>
            <li>I am fortunate that my hair is \\&quot;nice\\</li>
            <li>When used correctly its a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair sleek and smooth</li>
            <li>I also love the fresh smell; not overbearing.</li>
            <li>Love this product, works so great at detangling and making my hair sofy and healthy, i dont even have to style my hair after i use a few spritz of this.</li>
            <li>This product is light and doesn&#x27;t seem to build up all with smoothing my frizzy curls and taming my hair.</li>
            <li>I always try to see what type of products they use so that I can continue to keep my hair protected, smooth, etc.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth with no buildup.</li>
            <li>and it was light and bouncy curls, no frizz or flyaways.</li>
            <li>Not only does the product smell great</li>
            <li>This does a fantastic job doing just that.  </li>
            <li>I am not at all adept at hair styling and have never had much luck working with product.</li>
            <li>It is a leave in conditioner that comes out in a light spray.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>And two days later it was still great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It helps against the frizz, makes it smooth and</li>
            <li>The bottle is smooth and slippery.  </li>
            <li>, it is such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>But being the cheap skate I am...</li>
            <li>Great to use prior to drying or ironing.</li>
            <li>PERHAPS I need the Light version of this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for de tangling and extra conditioning</li>
            <li>I spray it lightly all over after washing and towel drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks smooth, silky, and shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, this product is not paraben free and that alone is a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get greasy if you spray into hand and smooth into ends instead of spraying where it can get to the scalp.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling smooth and knot free after the shower.</li>
            <li>the last 10 oz bottle lasted close to a year, it&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally light brown</li>
            <li>When she ran out, I suggested we try to see if it was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and this keeps my hair looking silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product sprays on lightly and evenly.</li>
            <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give it a GREAT rating is the price.  </li>
            <li>it may not make your hair frizzy free but it helped a bit with my frizzy hair..</li>
            <li>You can also spritz to smooth out dry/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I knew that it made my hair feel fantastic, but when my stylist gave me praise for blow-drying my hair</li>
            <li>Great for extra conditioning without weighing done.</li>
            <li>In Product is truely a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I primarily use it for detangling and defrizzing.</li>
            <li>Tangle free, smooth hair.</li>
            <li>The leave in conditioner leaves my hair silky and smooth, but NOT greasy.</li>
            <li>Smooth?</li>
            <li>Why pick an odor I enjoy, when I can get the free, revolting, side-effect of my-leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is virtually wrinkle free.</li>
            <li>the meantime, I&#x27;ve been using it religiously, playing with the amount each time,while trying (hoping - with fingers crossed) that my results will be as good as so many are saying.</li>
            <li>It really does all the things it claims to do - it&#x27;s a great detangler, makes my hair much softer</li>
            <li>I am sure a regular cream rinse would be just as good</li>
            <li>But after using this product, even my hairstylist-friend commented on how soft my hair still was and how good of a shape it was in (read: no split</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and smell good</li>
            <li>Have always loved \\&quot;it&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; and while it&#x27;s not the cheapest it is definitely worth the price for how much you get and what the product does.</li>
            <li>It makes brushing long hair easy and gives my hair a great scent.</li>
            <li>My hair is also super fine which adds to how easily it gets tangled.</li>
            <li>This is the best I&#x27;ve used, it coats hair evenly without leaving it feeling stiff or oily.</li>
            <li>nasty!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used It&#x27;s a 10 with keratine before, that one is awesome, but now i didn&#x27;t want to tame my waves</li>
            <li>Very Dissapointed!!!  </li>
            <li>Not the real thing!!!</li>
            <li>Very powerful leave on conditioner.</li>
            <li>My daughter-in-law  uses this product on my grandchildren&#x27;s hair--the smell was very fresh and enticing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty expensive in stores, so I was happy to find this great deal online!</li>
            <li>Product is fine, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have started buying \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; for my extended family when I need a quick and easy gift.</li>
            <li>It does make my hair feel nice and soft and has a pleasant smell, but doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate frizz</li>
            <li>I have accumulated a closet full of hair products for my problem hair which is fine, brittle, thinning,  and often frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I think this is perfect, love the results of my hair, less frizzy and so much cheaper than in the salons.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to use-</li>
            <li>My new hairdresser commented on how healthy my hair is, despite applying color every 6-8 weeks!</li>
            <li>Also the scent is not unpleasant but too strong for my liking--once the product is on my hair</li>
            <li>Its definately worth the price!</li>
            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>bottle because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work and because it&#x27;s pretty costly.</li>
            <li>I was a bit taken aback by the price, but it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s on the pricier side, but so worth it!</li>
            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>- it is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>It quickly removes tangles and does not add weight to fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product that has been able to keep it under control.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>Great product for long hair.  </li>
            <li>That was totally worth the price of admission!</li>
            <li>but you already know that when you buy it :) but yes it works ;)</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>More sheen and just looks more overall healthy.</li>
            <li>so now I buy it fir me the first time i fell in love with it</li>
            <li>still, it is worth it!</li>
            <li>I had to stop her and let her know that I was pretty sure it was the</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so worth it, just like this product!</li>
            <li>I am interested on testing out more products from this maker.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this from my hair dresser and paid like $25 for the 4oz bottle.  </li>
            <li>I had originally bought this stuff from Bloom.com, but they stopped carrying it for some reason.</li>
            <li>Try even a small bottle of this and you will be hooked on how awesome your hair looks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are great for your hair, really makes it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product the first day i used it.</li>
            <li>, my hair is very fine and this works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy that I was able to get it on Amazon for a little over $21.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to invest in their hair to keep it looking good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my hair and this size bottles lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel revived... kind of like the new hair cut feeling.</li>
            <li>I has a clean smell not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>Great product for dry or so so hair.  </li>
            <li>It was fortunate to find this larger size and at a fair price.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled that Amazon offered this product for about $20...and for such a huge bottle too!  </li>
            <li>I have used all kinds of different ones &amp; for colored hair this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Turns morning brushing sessions that used to end in tears into easy, fun, mother-daughter time.  </li>
            <li>awesome stuff, especially if you have any natural curl.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It is okay, but not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>Smells so nice and leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>This product makes your hair so soft and healthy!  </li>
            <li>You can comb your hair right after use easily.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the smallest size because of the price, I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money in something I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>This product is really the only product i have ever truly loved!</li>
            <li>It did not do anything special for my hair and has a chemical smell in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The large bottle is cheaper thru Amazon, and I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Im glad I decided to jump out there and try it even after having a certain amount of skepticism after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>I could certainly see a difference in my hair when I wasn&#x27;t able to use this product for that time.</li>
            <li>If you have very dry hair or treated hair, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I have bleached hair and it looks so silky smooth thanks to this product!!</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the combination of it&#x27;s a 10, Chi straightening product &amp; biotin has made my hair look more than halfway decent.  </li>
            <li>This stuff was fabulous and gave my fine, thin hair excellent volume while maintaining softness.</li>
            <li>First thing I discovered: don&#x27;t use more than a light spritz per section of hair, unless you enjoy the sound and smell of moisture steaming off your hair at high temperatures.</li>
            <li>I really makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>this is my absolute favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>I moved from the desert to a cool humid climate.</li>
            <li>and after I tell people what it is they always go and get it and love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>It would be a sweet relief, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now my beauty salson carries a full line of</li>
            <li>My comb and brush were full of hair every time I used them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 four stars, whereas I gave BB the full five.  </li>
            <li>This will last me for a good while</li>
            <li>I got this product a month ago,, and I love it,so much.</li>
            <li>I am convinced this is not the &#x27;true&#x27;</li>
            <li>Love it product and it&#x27;s much cheaper here than in stores.</li>
            <li>however I spritz a good amount and brushed it thorugh my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought it mostly for a detangler because I have very knotty hair.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this, as the price is so much more reasonable than through my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>I love this so much.</li>
            <li>i love these stuff so much.</li>
            <li>The best hair product fro my thick hair.</li>
            <li>Let me say I have very damaged hair and have tried MANY products and have found any I could rate 5 stars</li>
            <li>I use it daily to keep my hair in good condition.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>will last me a good three months or so.</li>
            <li>(my cuboards are full of hair products that I have discarded because they just dont cut it)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle and when my wife tried it, she loved it, so I bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very managable, shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>This product truely is a miracle.  </li>
            <li>just so I know I can use every last drop, but the spray works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>love this product, fast service</li>
            <li>I actually bought this product because of how good it smells.</li>
            <li>but this product makes my hair look better than my straight hair.</li>
            <li>Everyone who I know try it, loved it and can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li>love this product really does help the breakage of hair .</li>
            <li>you guys just go to the hair salon and buy a real one its much better</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it really seems to control the fizziness of my hair even on those humid days.  </li>
            <li>The results were so great on her hair that I began using it on my own and after a few uses, it really does look healthier.  </li>
            <li>I know this product works well for many people, but it didn&#x27;t fulfill my hair need--moisturizing and styling by blow drying to straight hair.</li>
            <li>Also, I use a rinse-out conditioner by Joico, and I just make sure it&#x27;s rinsed really well, so</li>
            <li>In addition to being an awesome detangler, I find that my hair is less greasy after 2 days and much softer.  </li>
            <li>I am very tender headed and this product makes my hair, smooth, sleek, and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this to any person who blow dries a lot, shampoos a lot and or just wants tangle free hair.</li>
            <li>Most notably, the ends of my hair, healthy or not, inherently spread out from each other so my hair always expands as it falls -</li>
            <li>However, my stylist said that products such as these should always be purchased at a salon since many online distributors dilute the original product to sell more.</li>
            <li>Does pretty much what it says on the bottle and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair which is great!</li>
            <li>I wanna say that is pretty strong when you aren&#x27;t using anything else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling smooth, soft, sleek, and very light.</li>
            <li>Surely it must be good for some people since it has such a high rating.</li>
            <li>I bought this product due to the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>The ordering experience was great, came quickly, absolutely no complaints!</li>
            <li>amazed with this product and so happy I listened to the other reviews on here.</li>
            <li>Great price on Amazon compared to other stores.</li>
            <li>My aunt gave me a tester bottle of this after she said it made her fair too flat, so I sprayed some in after a shower</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a little pricey but is the best leave in conditioner out there as it does so much.</li>
            <li>ever!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair very soft and easy tho brush!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair softer and more manageable - can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>But, it wasn&#x27;t just the look or the appearance of the hair that sold me, my hair actually FELT like it was healthy, gorgeous new hair.</li>
            <li>I had more than 10 strangers comment on how pretty my hair was that first day im not joking.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and there was no problems.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel greasy until after the 3 day of not washing my hair, I wanted to know how quickly my hair would be greasy and it made it to day 3.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male, in my 60&#x27;s, with more gray hair than brown (now) and this product makes the hair more manageable and cleaner looking.</li>
            <li>Stuff has to get cheaper---GREAT PRODUCT, but, we go through it quickly--</li>
            <li>After a shower, I spray this product through my hair and it feels smooth, soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Compared to drugstore leave-in conditioners such as pantene, this one really does a great job.</li>
            <li>do shop at Amazon for it solely to find super savers shipping savings</li>
            <li>Luckily I didn&#x27;t pay for it.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my niece to quickly untangle her hair.</li>
            <li>Product was as described and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>I have color put on my hair and have had to have more of a process done as I get older.  </li>
            <li>I used to do things to cover up the static, but this seems to be an actual cure for static.</li>
            <li>My hair has always been super knotted when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Since I use this product my hair is thicker, more manageable and more importantly repaired the dry ends.</li>
            <li>but I still only used about 4 or 5 sprays and Instantly it smelled wonderful.</li>
            <li>I received the shipment well-packaged and quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!!!!</li>
            <li>:) I would highly recommend this leave in conditioner...</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it for everyone :)</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t splurge on hair care products for myself, but when my sister in law gave me hers to sample, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>The hair is easy to comb even when it is dry, is strong and it looks healthy.</li>
            <li>First I cried, then I went and bought some Oops Color Remover (which is fantastic and a life saver, by the way).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my color treated hair feel healthy and normal.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair detangled instantly, smells great, leaves hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t silky smooth like the first bottle I purchased.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m not the kind of person to buy hair products or pricey personal care items, but this stuff is worth it!</li>
            <li>My hair can go curly, wild on the top layers and this product helps significantly.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that this doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great product and wil continue to use but hope the price goes down.</li>
            <li>Seriously, a life-saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not find a better price for this product!!!</li>
            <li>It was originally suggested to me by my hair dresser, what a smart man he is!</li>
            <li>To name just a few:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene shampoo and conditioner are great, but their mouse created static in my hair and left a weird residue.&lt;br /&gt;Matrix made a really great leave-in called sleek look</li>
            <li>Love it, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>It detangled my relaxed hair and my new growth better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and do not plan on trying anything new anytime soon.  </li>
            <li>I have very long hair and this stuff helps with frizz at the ends, and makes my hair smell nice and super shiny!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 smells great and this stuff stunk like a previous bottled conditioner I tried.</li>
            <li>makes my hair much less frizzy and smells great.  </li>
            <li>Great product - much less than what I would pay buying it at the salon.</li>
            <li>After my hair dries it always smells fresh and leaves a clean look which is important because no one wants to look like they have product or residue in their hair.</li>
            <li>I had to stop and check to make sure that my hair was really my hair when I first put this product on and finished blow drying.</li>
            <li>I have not had such soft and beautiful hair since I was a child.</li>
            <li>But as far as true conditioning goes, BB is a much better product because it&#x27;s not laden with coating silicone</li>
            <li>My stylist suggested It&#x27;s a 10 and after the first day I really fell in love.  </li>
            <li>I started using this product as my hair was so dry and based on the reviews on amazon, thought it would be a good chance for it to work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s does an outstanding job de-tangling my hair and leaves it very soft.  </li>
            <li>a 10 leaves my damaged breaking crunchy, dry, over-bleached hair into silky, soft, strong beautiful hair after the first use.</li>
            <li>This spray does a great job by itself but it also tolerates additional moisturizing leave-in products without making a sticky or flaky mess.</li>
            <li>Bigger is better!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because of the price, but I am telling you, completely worth it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will keep buying it and come here first!</li>
            <li>i have very curly frizzy hair and so far in my 26 years i have found one that works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to make their hair 100x better!</li>
            <li>This is my first ever Amazon review and it is well deserved!</li>
            <li>IT REALLY IS A MIRACLE PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li>Works great for de-tangling my extra long hair...but its not my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!!</li>
            <li>We will be back for more!</li>
            <li>The first time I purchased this product was in a salon for about $15 for the 4 oz bottle!</li>
            <li>Not only do O love this product, but my husband loves it too!</li>
            <li>this stuff does the job, and really is a 10!!  </li>
            <li>Always Makes my hair more manageable and soft!</li>
            <li>Yes, I could actually buy my favorite, and use it instead!</li>
            <li>Super cheap and arrived extremely fast</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It really is a miracle on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll curl back up when I wash it, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I have a thick hair that&#x27;s fine in texture</li>
            <li>my hair was shiny, smooth, vibrant and full of life.</li>
            <li>My mom is a beautician and I have tried a lot of very high end products to try to make my hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap chemical ingredient that is VERY harmful to us.</li>
            <li>This product works great with my hair, but I prefer to rinse it out after it has been on my hair a few minutes.</li>
            <li>This product, when purchased from an authorized retailer is amazing (I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year religiously).  </li>
            <li>They both rave how this product makes their hair straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this only three times and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy in any way, it is light and you can apply as much as you want.</li>
            <li>, however It&#x27;s a 10 keeps my hair shiny, silky, and fade free much longer.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair silky, soft, and smooth!</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product...</li>
            <li>i put it on my hair after i get out of the shower and it leaves hair feeling so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>All in all, worth every cent.</li>
            <li>My end look healthy and my hair is soft and silky.</li>
            <li>but it just isn&#x27;t worth the price</li>
            <li>Also nice to have one product for detangling, heat protectant, and extra conditioning.</li>
            <li>its a 10 products are worth every penny</li>
            <li>My hair transformed back to its old self- soft, maneable and just wonderful.  </li>
            <li>but it smells nice and did help my style to last through the summer heat and humidity.  </li>
            <li>So I consider the experiment a success.  </li>
            <li>Plus BB has a blend of beneficial oils that make my hair naturally shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $$</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>It makes my curly frizzy hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled to save $14 on the big bottle!!!</li>
            <li>This product is great, and makes your hair SO SOFT, but am I the only one who can&#x27;t stand the smell of it?  </li>
            <li>worth</li>
            <li>I love this in my 8 yr old daughters hair, it  gets out tangles with ease.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Yeah if you put your nose directly into it sure, but on my hair</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Product&amp;#34; leaves hair soft and moisturized, great for use when hair is regularly dyed.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny</li>
            <li>But suddenly today, the 4th try,  my hair is fabulous and looks so healthy</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>I can not really say enough and it smells wonderful too.  </li>
            <li>It is a pricy product but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Love it works awesome especially if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so much more manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>But over all its worth the money</li>
            <li>this is well worth the price for the product.</li>
            <li>I have hair with a mind of its own and somehow this is the only leave in that tames it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend products often but felt this is well worth the mention.</li>
            <li>Is hay-like hair worth saving a couple of bucks?  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It does have parabens, which I don&#x27;t like, but I justify it as ok since it doesn&#x27;t go directly on her skin where it&#x27;s absorbed, just on the length of her hair.</li>
            <li>I am not a product junkie and rarely use hair products.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good product, to help me out with my frizzy hair, to define my curls, and to leave my hair soft, my hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>my hair was soft and I thought it was going to be the top 10 miracle for my curls,</li>
            <li>and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Hope you have the success we&#x27;ve had with</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth looking into for tangled hair.</li>
            <li>I am once again receiving so many compliments on my curls, just as I did through my early 20s.</li>
            <li>So far I have not found anything better.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I do believe it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>and it is COMPLETELY worth it.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The bottle lasts almost all year and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The online bottle made my hair feel kind of sticky and it didn&#x27;t smell the same.</li>
            <li>I love it so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and love how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li>The money is worth it.</li>
            <li>This price you pay for this stuff is really worth it.</li>
            <li>I tried thousands of dollars worth of leave-ins and conditioners.</li>
            <li>Its pricey, but its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I rarely use it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair so it helps with detangling after the shower and keeps hair healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind of person who always has to have their hair a different color.</li>
            <li>Completely worth the price.</li>
            <li>The other great thing is buying this product on Amazon is so much cheaper than getting it at a store.</li>
            <li>Leaves no dandruff like some other leave-in conditioners despite me using it daily, so I&#x27;m really happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other protectants/leave-ins, and It&#x27;s a 10 is 100% my favorite.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair knots up pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>[--Type of hair: Wavy, and lots of it (lol), but abused by an old/rough dye job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Weather: Hot &amp; humid (Puerto Rico)]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that makes my hair absolutely smooth, except extra virgin olive oil...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure whether this product just had a whole lot of hype or if it was actually true to all the claims until I had enough points to get if free with my Ulta Rewards.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it well enough to change my regimen, but it&#x27;s always a good thing to have a decent product on stand-by.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like it, but it really is great after using it a little while.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great deal, makes hair really smooth and soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li>I read the product description, read the reviews, thought \\&quot;Yeah, right, but these people don&#x27;t have hair like mine.</li>
            <li>If I was going to experiment with this stuff, I was going to do it right.</li>
            <li>Moment of truth, right?</li>
            <li>In fact, I once broke the handle right off my brush attempting to.  </li>
            <li>I knew this was not the right product in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Delivered right on time also.</li>
            <li>It pulled the tangles right out.</li>
            <li>and i can brush right through my hair.  </li>
            <li>in right before my roller set.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>It took me a while to get used to the right use for my hair, but once I did.....</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll feel the difference right away.</li>
            <li>and it always makes it feel softer right after spraying it on.  </li>
            <li>Right when this product arrived at my front door, I ripped away the packaging and started spraying.</li>
            <li>But hey, I guess they&#x27;re right after all.</li>
            <li>Tangles comb right out.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product - can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Product arrived very quickly and was brand new as advertised.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair pretty frizz free, straight or curly.</li>
            <li>But I have to say I am thrilled I did, exact same salon quality product at a fraction of the price...</li>
            <li>I know it is kind of pricey, but a 4oz bottle will last you months, if not the whole year!</li>
            <li>only Wella enables a nice crisp curl with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>You spritz a little on after the shower and you can comb right through it which is just amazing because my daughters hair tangles so easy.  </li>
            <li>I like it because instantly untangles my hair and makes it very easy to get the comb through it.</li>
            <li>When I use this along with the Miracle rinse out conditioner, my hair combs out easily and is very soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It worked great for my hair (lots of wiry gray) and really cuts down on the time it takes to flat-iron it.</li>
            <li>This little gem is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>My fine straight hair is hard to comb out after its washed and this product is a great detangler.</li>
            <li>It is REALLY hard to get a good grip around the rather large top of the bottle so that you can spray with ease.</li>
            <li>From salon high end products to cheap drugstore products.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to work with and is not heavy on the hair!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I bought this to use with my new Karmin straightener and use this after straightening my hair, it really helps reduce any frizz.</li>
            <li>Because of all the hype I really thought this would be a special product.</li>
            <li>Detangles hair quickly and leaves it soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>It does a great job keeping my hair moisturized and soft in the dry Arizona climate.</li>
            <li>However, when I blow dry my hair with this product in it, it does come out much more smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair super easy to brush and helps it dry light and shiny.</li>
            <li>Its an amazing product that lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li>My hair is usually frizzy but now it just smells and looks great.</li>
            <li>After we returned home, I received a text from her that she missed the leave-in so much she went to her nearest hair salon and purchased a bottle for full price because she just had to have</li>
            <li>It has restored it and has made it thick and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>and WOW I have beautiful curls again without a curling iron or any other product.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily or weighed down.</li>
            <li>So good at detangling without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li>If you have colored hair that is coarse and tangles easily, this is the product for you!  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t find this to a strong smell (no stronger than any other hair product I use), and I&#x27;d describe it more of a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell than flowery.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put it in dry hair, but it is the best thing ever for wet hair!</li>
            <li>That should have been my first clue right there...</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few years now and Amazon is the only place for the best price!</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy, but not the nice soft wavy you see on lots of girls.</li>
            <li>Its a 10&#x27; will leave my hair easy to comb, soft, silky,</li>
            <li>This was a great deal, and it&#x27;s a big bottle, so it will last for a while.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and I have straight thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Also worked very well as a quick conditioner after her swimming class at school, when she didn&#x27;t have time to wash the chlorine out.</li>
            <li>Absolutely perfect for color treated hair, \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; detangles, repairs and adds protection for all those harsh styling processes that we put our hair through on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that tends to frizz easily and this spray is pretty much the only thing that helps calm it.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and easy comb out</li>
            <li>I have so many partially used products lingering in my bathroom closet, but now, I can get rid of ALL of them to fight the frizz and smooth my hair once and for all.</li>
            <li>hair soft and easy to manage.will continue you to use it.</li>
            <li>Easy to brush my hair through, and it leaves my hair soft and shiny all day.</li>
            <li>This leave in is as good as my Aussie leave in hair insurance conditioner which costs less than $4.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and shiny &amp; easy to maintain and style.</li>
            <li>My product came very early as well which is fantastic.</li>
            <li>When we are nearing the bottom of the container and running low on product, she is the one that insists I order some more right away</li>
            <li>I combed it through my curls and was pretty surprised at how easily the comb went through, like the spray changed my hair type and texture immediately.</li>
            <li>It also helps very much to detangle.</li>
            <li>I received this very fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use very much...</li>
            <li>not heavy for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, and leaves my hair so soft and takes the frizz right out without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair often, so my hair is very dry on its own, even after using conditioner..</li>
            <li>Good product, a little pricey though</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth now and I can blow dry it very quickly.</li>
            <li>put it on after washing my hair and it makes a HUGE difference once my hair naturally dries and humidity</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it - gives you hair such a smooth soft feeling without any greasiness or residue.</li>
            <li>This stuff really is a  miracle!</li>
            <li>So instead of bleeding money we picked up this larger bottle for a much better price than in retail stores.</li>
            <li>Now that my hair has &amp;#34;matured&amp;#34; pool water frizzes it even more than when I was younger.</li>
            <li>my hair feels so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it also works to protect your hair from the damage from heated styling tools!</li>
            <li>As soon as I used the first pump of the spray onto my hands, I felt an immediate difference.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what the bottle says.</li>
            <li>first purchased the 4 oz.</li>
            <li>It also conditioned my hair well enough that it looks incredibly healthy even after all of the summer damage.</li>
            <li>I also love that you can use your regular products if you wish</li>
            <li>item as described, fast shipping, thank you!</li>
            <li>It leaves it soft, smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more in future.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this Leave-In product every time I shower, more like every third time.  </li>
            <li>This product is better than i can possibly put into words.</li>
            <li>lifeless if you spray it higher but just on the ends</li>
            <li>It came exactly as I ordered it, and fast too!  </li>
            <li>This product works exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>all worked pretty well</li>
            <li>After the first pump I sprayed on my hair</li>
            <li>So maybe the next time around something more practical can be designed.</li>
            <li>at store same price works okay</li>
            <li>First, I can&#x27;t comb or brush your hair after it&#x27;s on because it just gets sticky and non-shiny.</li>
            <li>fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>so I just spray one at the top, one spray at the middle and ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li>If you are shampooing more often, this thinning out of the mixture will probably not be necessary.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever re-bought the same product so many times before.</li>
            <li>I scaled back on the amount I was spraying in and had much better results, but it&#x27;s still not a miracle product.</li>
            <li>And the best part is that one small bottle like this will last almost a year!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this to many friends and everyone loves it and uses it regularly.</li>
            <li>This was my first attempt at using It&#x27;s a 10.</li>
            <li>I will order more when my current is finished.</li>
            <li>My kid&#x27;s hair is exactly like mine.</li>
            <li>The first day I tried it myself</li>
            <li>While It&#x27;s a 10 isn&#x27;t the cheapest it is definitely worth the expense for any woman that wants to take care of her hair.</li>
            <li>It definitely does a better job at detangleing my hair than the infusium spray.</li>
            <li>My hair stays soft and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>It is very helpful in this humidity and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product - I use it daily for over 5 years now.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and have thrown most of my others out.</li>
            <li>First introduced to me by my hairstylist</li>
            <li>It is really work!</li>
            <li>LOVE it, cannot say enough!</li>
            <li>but when I found it online and at a much reduced price, I was all in!  </li>
            <li>I totally fell in love.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser first told me about this product</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff... Not tampered!</li>
            <li>I have tried many but this is the only one that works for us.  </li>
            <li>Received the product and it was the exact item</li>
            <li>This is a much better value than you will find it the larger stores.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t change the essential nature of my hair, but it just makes it WAY more manageable.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so much softer and manageable!</li>
            <li>Has left my hair soo healthy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Even after the first use, I have noticed a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff for my short hair.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Love How My Hair Feels At The End Of My Daily Hair Care Routine</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended this product when it first came out</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had the first bottle for 7-8 months, using it 3-4 times a week and 7-10 pumps each time.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, and smooth.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it that first time I used it how smooth and soft my hair was.</li>
            <li>but I do feel like it works as a heat protectant pretty well.</li>
            <li>It is rather expensive, but Amazon seems to have some of the best prices on it.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of the frizz &amp; protects your hair from hot styling tools.</li>
            <li>Hear some many glowing reviews of this product, I finally thought I give it a try.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair shiney, smooth, and natural.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it has proven to be the only leave in conditioner that doesnt leave my hair greasy or under conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes my bleached and brittle hair soft, smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Been using It&#x27;s A Ten for two years, my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I need</li>
            <li>First just let me start off by saying, I have never reviewed a product before.</li>
            <li>Would absolutely purchase again!</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair silky soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>It really is a 10 for hair!  </li>
            <li>I first saw it at my salon 3-years ago.  </li>
            <li>My sister-in-law will be getting a bottle for her birthday as part of her present for sure</li>
            <li>Well, we&#x27;re now both avid users.</li>
            <li>it really prevents them form breakage!</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My hair is currently as long and healthy as it has ever been, and that is worth the price to me.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely order more when this runs out.</li>
            <li>, much cheaper then in any store I have seen!</li>
            <li>First off I have used Biolage&#x27;s hair milk leave in for 8 years..</li>
            <li>The big bottle can be used for more than a year.</li>
            <li>I bought this leave in treatment recently to make my hair more managable during the winter.</li>
            <li>It really does do 10 things!  </li>
            <li>When I blowdry it leaves my hair soft and freeze free.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>Great for short or long hair.</li>
            <li>You see results after the first use....</li>
            <li>I have done so much damage to my hair and this has been my hairs life saviour!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I hesitated to pay this much, but it has been worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>This  product REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft, shiny, manageable, smooth, healthier, helps w/ tangles/knots, etc..</li>
            <li>Plus, the bottle is pretty, so I don&#x27;t mind leaving it out on my vanity.</li>
            <li>Personally I like this better than the one with Keratin.</li>
            <li>I love this product this was going to be my second bottle</li>
            <li>After the first use, I noticed her hair looked and felt a bit softer but</li>
            <li>(plus side was that I saved by being able to get this in a larger quality then drug stores sell)</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well-it truly lives up to its name!</li>
            <li>I first discovered this product when getting my hair cut and the stylist used it on my hair before drying and I&#x27;ve used nothing else since.  </li>
            <li>Amazon prices are better than stores such as Ulta, even w/ a coupon.</li>
            <li>Just a few spritzes is all it takes, which is a good thing when you have two daughters who use it too.</li>
            <li>additionally, I just had heavy highlights done and my hair took a bit of a hit damage wise.....</li>
            <li>It smells good plus it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down too much.</li>
            <li>have used this product solo as a styling product (coat hair while slightly damp after a shower), as well as applying a light amount to damp hair before putting in a different product on top that will give my hair more of a style and hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow I&#x27;m a guy and never have I used a leave-in conditioner that does EXACTLY what it says it does!!</li>
            <li>MY HAIR IS SUPER SOFT AND SHINY NOW!!</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and this price is UNBEATABLE!!</li>
            <li>Amazon was the obvious choice for searching and luckily it was available.</li>
            <li>Whether this product does the job for me or not remains to be seen, as I&#x27;ve had other issues with my hair and cannot judge it fairly until a normal baseline is again established.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like to be able to run my fingers through my hair and just feel soft, clean hair without any gross product feel.</li>
            <li>As soon as I moved my very straight hair is only mostly straight, and there are many flyaways</li>
            <li>Having dried it straight today it looks pretty good</li>
            <li>It worked well for me on a flat top haircut.  </li>
            <li>okay not literally- pretty close though, and as much as they possibly could be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light as long you don&#x27;t overdo it.</li>
            <li>Luckily my hairstylist recognized my knot problem and said she had this new stuff called</li>
            <li>I have horribly dry hair, and it works to moisturize it the best of any product I have ever tried (and there have been dozens, some much more expensive).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for over 3 years and swear by it.&lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic ,and works magic for my thin stringy easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested it multiple times to make sure it really was this product, and it is.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the next morning I use a hair oil, as well, although it&#x27;s not strictly necessary as this product does quite a good job of conditioning.  </li>
            <li>Sad, I read the wonderful reviews &amp; really wanted it to work for me.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that tangles, but also gets weighed down easily.</li>
            <li>Not amazingly better than any of the other dozens I&#x27;ve tried, but a good one with a nice scent.</li>
            <li>and then a large tooth comb slides right through my otherwise very fine, very dry, very tangled hair.</li>
            <li>I live in south fla in a very hot, humid climate.</li>
            <li>WORTH THE HIGH PRICE.</li>
            <li>Her hair is curly and very dry but with the right products can be managed pretty easily and has the type of curls that turn into pretty ringlets as hair dries.</li>
            <li>Besides how it smells, which is great, it works really well in your hair leaving it soft and helping w/ dead ends.  </li>
            <li>Absolute must have and highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>When I found them on amazon for so much cheaper at first I was hesitant to order.</li>
            <li>The 2 oz is perfect for traveling, the 4 oz is my everyday, and this 10 oz is my refill for the other two.</li>
            <li>My hair looks really straight and pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a nice product, but definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li>Nice, not powerful scent.  </li>
            <li>my hair is soft, shiny, and full of body.  </li>
            <li>Even when air drying my hair - it&#x27;s amazingly soft, full of shine, and \\&quot;touchable.\\</li>
            <li>the smaller bottle I purchased at Ulta seemed to feel different in my hair even though they are the same product, I liked that one better.</li>
            <li>Love this product fory long hair!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a little more than 5 years and swear by it!</li>
            <li>It lasts for a very long time for many uses.</li>
            <li>My hair is very long and i am always looking for something to keep it looking healthy.</li>
            <li>This stuff cuts the brushing time in half, its amazing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li>It is a life saver for the winter months when you don&#x27;t want to have dry, static hair.</li>
            <li>I have not tried the \\&quot;lite\\&quot; version yet because I assume it will be less effective (but</li>
            <li>I let it air dry most of the time.</li>
            <li>Detangles quickly and leaves soft shiny hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is still kind of frizzy after using it however, it is much less frizzy.</li>
            <li>so I run out of smoothing creams and such, very quickly.</li>
            <li>Im mixed and have wavy hair  and use a very mild relaxer on it every 5-6 months or so just to try to control my frizzes.</li>
            <li>I have been using its a 10 for years and the bottle I got makes my hair even more dry and brittle and frizzy?</li>
            <li>I found that this made my hair MORE DRY and sticky.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair red which fades easily,.</li>
            <li>So, when I wash, it&#x27;s a whole lotta tangles and without a really good detangler, I am in trouble!</li>
            <li>Just For Me conditioning sprays (too oily and not enough friz control); Hawaiian 12 something-or-other (left crunch and little friz control), Mixed chicks (shampoos mostly, but didn&#x27;t help with dryness at all); Loo Poo or No Poo (shampoos mostly but also didn&#x27;t help with conditioning or dryness for hyper curly girls; store stuff (good de-tanglers, but no friz control for curly girls).  </li>
            <li>It tames the frizz, makes my hair super soft, creates that light &amp; bouncy curl definition and super cute ringlets, without weighing it down and leaving an oily residue the next morning.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping it would be a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; and make my hair smooth and straight with no other work needed.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product, does not weigh down my hair or make it appear greasy or limp</li>
            <li>This stuff is pure miracle in a bottle.  </li>
            <li>but it certainly doesn&#x27;t eliminate it.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li>It certainly wasn&#x27;t a miracle for me.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>price is pretty reasonable since it does so much, also you don&#x27;t need much with each use so it lasts for awhile.  </li>
            <li>I use this everyday and love it!</li>
            <li>The same is true of the deep treatment which is also phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but finding the right amount to put in your hair is critical.</li>
            <li>Great product on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; is such a great product for your hair, it protects against heat and makes your hair less frizzy.</li>
            <li>My hair is a light brown color that can easily look drab and limp</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big \\&quot;review writer\\&quot;...unless I really feel strongly about something.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s drier than the Sahara and pretty lackluster, using this for 2 weeks, my hair has bounce, shine and my highlights look brand new!</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended and shipping was very fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll last me long enough for my kids to learn to comb through their own hair. :)</li>
            <li>She has very fine blond hair and other conditioners</li>
            <li>One has fine and one has coarse.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and has mad my hair so much softer!</li>
            <li>Especially, if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using it on and off (mostly on) for about 6 months now, and I notice a drastic difference from wash to wash when I use these products as opposed to when I use other brands - even for brands that one might consider higher end.  </li>
            <li>Especially if you have baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair are so fragile and fine.</li>
            <li>if i wash, put it in my  hair, and leave it to air dry, it turns into beauitiful, lush, gorgeous soft shiny curly hair.</li>
            <li>This leave in conditioner has a very high viscosity.</li>
            <li>Certainly makes controlling my curly hair much easier.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and flat, oily on the top, dry on the bottom, has split ends and is over-processed because of coloring.</li>
            <li>She has super long hair with super curly hair.</li>
            <li>so it gets weighed down very easily).</li>
            <li>This in conjunction with the Macadamia Oil hair mask has really made such a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference from when I use this product and when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using too much of the product though, or it&#x27;ll leave your hair feeling sticky for awhile.</li>
            <li>This stuff really is a 10.</li>
            <li>Not only does this smell fantastic but it moisturize my hair</li>
            <li>After using for about a week I noticed that it felt too much like water in my hand.</li>
            <li>It really protects my hair.</li>
            <li>Really Like This Product,</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>So I purchased it from the salon and used the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to see people very often.</li>
            <li>I decided to order the repair mask (&#x27;cause really, I needed it after months of neglect since I gave up on my hair), the shampoo, and the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair now</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s staying that way, and I think I&#x27;ll be spending way too much money on this stuff, but it&#x27;s still cheaper than thrice-weekly salon visits.    </li>
            <li>There is a bit of a waxy residue when I run my fingers through it, and I don&#x27;t really like the feel of that,</li>
            <li>I am wondering if the reviews are real or fictitious advertising after using this product.  </li>
            <li>An absolute miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li>I got the product fast</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>bottle without caring at all about the price because this absolutely works.</li>
            <li>I have really frizzy,</li>
            <li>born with real curly hair -</li>
            <li>I have really bleached hair from the summer sun and chlorine.</li>
            <li>I just keep sneezing that I can&#x27;t use it as often or as much as I want to.</li>
            <li>, u use too much water</li>
            <li>My overly highlighted hair really appreciates having this treatment after each shower.</li>
            <li>very conditioning.</li>
            <li>In Product\\&quot; my hair was brittle on the ends, so much so that it would break off when I flat-ironed it.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that is prone to drying out</li>
            <li>; I don&#x27;t really see any benefit or difference between the two.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this stuff and much cheaper than the drugstore.</li>
            <li>It must be really protecting it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the much cheaper Frizz-Ease products from now on.</li>
            <li>The one I bought at the salon made my hair much softer and silker.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>so it feels much softer, but makes it easier to manage.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle!</li>
            <li>I am picky with hair products because I really don&#x27;t like greasy hair or that yucky feeling that some products leave.</li>
            <li>My curls were very frizzy when I used this product.</li>
            <li>TOO MUCH</li>
            <li>Plus, it works like magic on wet hair.</li>
            <li>thanks...</li>
            <li>really think that this product was to blame for all of the hair damage, and I&#x27;m scared to try it again.</li>
            <li>so thank you much</li>
            <li>It does very well at detangling my hair.</li>
            <li>not something I would rave about, as I am very picky.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, course hair,and could use this wearing it natural,straight, or curled.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my hairdresser</li>
            <li>since I used it so much.  </li>
            <li>I noticed when I do not use it my hair feels more rough than I would care to admit.</li>
            <li>Its a 10 product is really a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product highly!  </li>
            <li>The product shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It really is a miracle.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is light and works well on mixed hair.  </li>
            <li>tends to get oily with too much product.</li>
            <li>Hair is very well moisturizers and frizz</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much for product.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast as well received in two days...</li>
            <li>I could not go without this stuff now that I have been using it; I think I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year, and its so much cheaper on amazon than in the stores.</li>
            <li>Did not try to spray on my hair thinking that it may be too much.</li>
            <li>which can really do a number on it.</li>
            <li>I just got a relaxer two weeks ago, so my hair is still relatively straight.  </li>
            <li>I have very damaged hair from heat and highliting.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper here than in the mainstream grocery stores and pharmacies.</li>
            <li>No way would I pay that much.</li>
            <li>And the next morning, it was silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much I like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an absolute must.</li>
            <li>and it is so much easier to brush.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff--</li>
            <li>So it seemed to really do the job for a while</li>
            <li>but after a month it started to really stick to my hair and just got gunky.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>and this is the only de-tangler that genuinely works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can really feel a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this product too.</li>
            <li>This product really is a miracle for me.  </li>
            <li>Sprayed some in, and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really lightweight to the point where you can put as much as you want in your hair and it won&#x27;t get greasy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it also wasn&#x27;t doing much for my hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a product that left my hair smooth and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>and it feels much healthier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly: I have funky curly, wavy hair that blows smooth with relative ease.</li>
            <li>worked really well</li>
            <li>I just received this product last week and am very impressed after only using it a few times.  </li>
            <li>This is the product for you if you don&#x27;t have hours to get ready.</li>
            <li>I really like 10.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels so much softer after using this.</li>
            <li>It really makes all the difference in my hair care routine.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try this stuff and was really amazed at how it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper..</li>
            <li>This is the absolute lowest price I have found when shopping around.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight yet very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>spray in and leave - makes combing after shampooing so much easier.</li>
            <li>I have tried before and absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>For me, this spray doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>and it makes getting ready for them easier in the am.</li>
            <li>A LOT, IT&#x27;S REALLY HELP</li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve determined that this works better when using a minimal amount throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair has been so much healthier and manageable since using It&#x27;s a 10.</li>
            <li>I truly recommend it if you are looking for something after shampoo that really works</li>
            <li>Was VERY damaged.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>so it very evenly distributes through the hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>It leave your hair smoother and dries it much quicker.</li>
            <li>the one time I did use too much.</li>
            <li>I feel like this stuff really is a miracle.</li>
            <li>price is a bit much and it did put me off.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really style it.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>My hair is much softer nowadays.</li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind.</li>
            <li>I know why I go through it so fast...</li>
            <li>A real plus.  </li>
            <li>it really is 10/10.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy, wavy hair</li>
            <li>This stuff really is a 10.  </li>
            <li>I have very color damaged hair and have been searching for a product to help counter that damage.</li>
            <li>The product was packaged very well</li>
            <li>Hair seem smoother but can&#x27;t really tell if is the humidity or the product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely this is a &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Whole family uses and loves this</li>
            <li>Even with wet hair, I&#x27;m able to run my fingers through my hair.  </li>
            <li>Got here fast</li>
            <li>and this really helps keep it silky.</li>
            <li>I have very thick/heavy hair</li>
            <li>This really helps keep my hair form getting frizzy.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think this is quite the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; I was expecting, but I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li>not *quite* as much as air drying with no product.  </li>
            <li>keratin really makes the difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so I cant be of much help.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 really proved to me that you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Essential for great hair, especially for daily heat styling or blow drying.  </li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t use this product, it&#x27;s very noticeable when my hair dries.</li>
            <li>With the product on, my hair is sleek, straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves this leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Always softens but never makes it greasy unless I use way too much.</li>
            <li>very OCD about my hair...</li>
            <li>I have a very oily scalp, but cant wash my hair but every 4 days</li>
            <li>IT REALLY IS A 10...</li>
            <li>Spraying onto your hair is spotty, and uses way too much stuff.</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t take much to use so</li>
            <li>Smooth my hair instantly.</li>
            <li>It does not take much either.  </li>
            <li>I love to use this product on wet hair as a detangler before brushing.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Also, this leave in product has a very fragrant scent which this one seems to be lacking.</li>
            <li>My hairstylist used this stuff on my hair, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really is a 10, and works 110%  </li>
            <li>but don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It really is a &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Thanks to a lot of conditioner</li>
            <li>I have really greasy hair and this stuff</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>This stuff really is a miracle.</li>
            <li>&quot; I also use is very sparingly after blow drying to give my hair added shine.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This spray helps me maintain my color very well.</li>
            <li>and it really does what it says.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped get it back to a soft healthy texture and shine.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF ESPECIALLY FOR MY 7 YRS OLD.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair less frizzy, more manageable, and super soft!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I had spent a lot of money on other products with great reviews (think upwards of $3,000), which just didn&#x27;t work for the problem I had with my hair breakage from bleach.</li>
            <li>Makes long hair so easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>It creates very manageable hair, preventing breakage,  making my hair look much better than any other product I have used (and I have used a lot).</li>
            <li>We ordered two of the smaller sized (I think 4 oz) - and one was good, but the other was a knock off.</li>
            <li>It is lasting quite a while, so it was well worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I know with other products you are prob used to spraying your hair 10x or more but its not neccessary with this product.</li>
            <li>More Tangles or any other leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Will not be returning for this and will be more cautious with other purchases on this website.</li>
            <li>I remember exactly how soft my hair used to be and how shiny it is!  </li>
            <li>my sister that is.&lt;br /&gt;I also will use this other voluminous product in my roots and than this on the rest of my hair.. FANTASTIC RESULTS!</li>
            <li>it works better than any other curly hair product I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>It also is a better protection against humidity than any of the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands but none even come close to this product.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I straighten my hair with a flat iron, it protects and keeps my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>There was nothing about it that made it any better than every other product.</li>
            <li>just de tangles it along with many other things but does not make it any heavier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years as I&#x27;m the kind of woman who loves her snooze button too much which gives me very little time in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I have very long hair that is fine and straight.</li>
            <li>I have very long very damaged fine hair.</li>
            <li>It barely does more than just regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have always had long, bone-straight, fine hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this same item in the past on Amazon and it was great.</li>
            <li>for me, it is one of the few products that can actually detangle my hair successfully, without my hair getting stuck in the comb or brush.</li>
            <li>Great product to due frizz and due tangle.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair and this product</li>
            <li>I started using It&#x27;s A 10 a few years back, and it works AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Not only does this smell really good, but it provides the nourishment my hair needs without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would be possible to top the &amp;#34;12 Benefits&amp;#34; leave in/detangling spray I tried recently, but this is at least as good.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even want to bother with a possible replacement if they couldn&#x27;t get it right in the first place.</li>
            <li>I love using this when I don&#x27;t want to style my hair and let it dry naturally as well.</li>
            <li>Has helped my dry, damaged hair feel soft and look healthy again.</li>
            <li>so I put it on a low heat setting to dry and to be honest</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing, I have super thin hair</li>
            <li>It also adds a little body to my very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair type is a little wavy, very fine hair.</li>
            <li>so I only need a small spray on the ends, gently massage it between my hands to distribute throughout the strands of hair before I dry it, and it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>I have very long, fine hair</li>
            <li>I have very long, fine hair and this product</li>
            <li>Worth the money for a great product, lasts a few months with everyday use on medium/long</li>
            <li>Will continue to order and use this product as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li>Periodically I&#x27;ve been required to use pretty astringent shampoos to clear off all the build-up that they&#x27;ve caused as a result.</li>
            <li>Same is true showering after work at the gym;  I can go out to dinner  </li>
            <li>I now have lots of short hairs growing back in and sticking straight off the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 2 oz bottle from a popular pharmacy where I usually buy it cost $10 plus the tax.</li>
            <li>After trying at least 4 different leave-in detanglers I&#x27;ve finally found one that works beautifully!</li>
            <li>Every time I use it, which is usually after washing my hair, it effectively detangles, smoothes, softens, and moisturizes my hair.  </li>
            <li>the last time i cut my hair was probably 1/2 a year ago maybe a full year</li>
            <li>But after the 3rd use, I was truely amazed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product and I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily steer people away from it</li>
            <li>The product was not bad, but I went back to using BioSilk instead.  </li>
            <li>Unite is not a bad product, so I used it for a while, but as my bottle was running low</li>
            <li>It leaves a good smell and also my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weird, it gets a very soft texture, but like extremely clean, but not frizzy.</li>
            <li>I knew it would, but I was having too much trouble finding the right product to condition my hair and make it easy to comb out after the shower.  </li>
            <li>One thing I really love about it is it don&#x27;t weigh your hair down</li>
            <li>conditions my hair, keeps frizz down, and is heat safe.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like I have new hair!  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li>I cannot live without it!</li>
            <li>and I wont live without it now!</li>
            <li>I am new to this product and it has done miracles for my hair!</li>
            <li>This product really does live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>It leaves a slight residue in my hair that makes it tangle much more throughout the day.</li>
            <li>and it is a light leave in conditioner that smooths dry hair.</li>
            <li>but I dont see more bounce, or less frizziness.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to comb through my hair when wet and leaves my hair silky after drying.  </li>
            <li>Once dry, it feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I get it for half the price almost with no shipping charges on most</li>
            <li>Also, it cut my blow drying time in half and makes my hair smell fantastic!</li>
            <li>With this particular bottle I bought on Amazon</li>
            <li>Breakage has decreased significantly, soft hair, smells great</li>
            <li>No seriously, EVER.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and it has made my hair so soft, smooth, and manageable.</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair feel soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li>(Though, on a positive note...Amazon has the cheapest price anywhere by FAR.)</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I only sprayed a minimal amount and got fantastic results!  </li>
            <li>*then* apply to the hair as opposed to direct application to the hair, as it is thick and does not spread easily or spray as a fine mist.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel very soft and nourished!</li>
            <li>but a little goes a long way and for something that I&#x27;ve seen such great results with, I&#x27;m willing to pay for it.  </li>
            <li>Love this makes my hair feel like silk without weighing hair down or making it look greasy like all the new oil scam products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>For the price being as high as this was, I could&#x27;ve gone to Walgreens &amp;saved myself some money &amp;time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this company.  </li>
            <li>and I can rationalize the high price to myself.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly and it works as described.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Even in rain and high humidity.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe anyone would give this product a high review.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend IT&#x27;S A 10--LEAVE IT IN.</li>
            <li>I had really high expectations, though,</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The product is high quality and the customer service was as well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest everybody try this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>All it does is make the product stink to high heaven.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use a gentle shampoo and avoid heat (hot water, direct sun, and hot hair appliances, especially).</li>
            <li>It works great on wet or dry hair when brushed through thoroughly.</li>
            <li>After bleaching my roots, my washed hair being wet, fine and porous</li>
            <li>and I love everything about it except the price is a little high for my wallet.</li>
            <li>It works really great for long hair, especially if you can put a liberal amount on, then braid it and let it dry or almost, when you take out the braid, it is soft and wavy.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s incredibly soft!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little costly, but it&#x27;s much more affordable on Amazon than the salon.</li>
            <li>Really love this little miracle.</li>
            <li>I think I need to experiment with it a little bit more with the amount I use in my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for the length of my hair, avoiding my bangs as they tend to get a little stringy at the end of a 20 hour day.  </li>
            <li>it does a little better job of addressing the straw-like texture/stringiness that can plague those of us with bottle-blonde locks.</li>
            <li>and I plan using this original version for a long time!</li>
            <li>but I feel that this is a little better than that as you just spray it and then brush your hair.</li>
            <li>Stay far away from this stuff!!</li>
            <li>But then used it again at a friend&#x27;s house and WOW!!</li>
            <li>but it also makes it a little more shinier.</li>
            <li>Hard to put into words how amazing my hair feels.</li>
            <li>I really like this product - it seems to make my hair a little more manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li>Her whole family loves it and uses it on the 4-year old&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very manageable and soft</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and straight.</li>
            <li>It is a really expensive product if you buy it at a store, so it is a great idea to get it online.</li>
            <li>I use it on wet hair before combing/styling and it leaves me frizz free all day.</li>
            <li>my hair gets frizzy - this has been the only product that has helped calm my hair.</li>
            <li>In your hands, it feels very creamy, but when it dries, it&#x27;s not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I pretty much gave up, cropped my hair short, hid it under a do-rag, and thanked whatever was listening that I worked from home</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s worth crowing about, I&#x27;ll come back with an update to my review.</li>
            <li>I used this on myself at home and my hair wasn&#x27;t as poofy as it normally is when I blowdry it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but the price is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li>Here, the price is still up there, but there are distinct and definite savings.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the 10 ounce bottle for a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>I love that it isn&#x27;t too heavy and really leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>This second time it left an impresson because my hair felt SO soft, silky, and smooth!    </li>
            <li>This product did good taking away the frizziness, but it left my hair feeling oily and I even had small clumps of product that didn&#x27;t soak in.</li>
            <li>(I tried it a few times to make sure it was this product causing the pimples).</li>
            <li>I have always had trouble with static.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like using a lot of product on her, for obvious reasons, but I do have to use something to keep her hair from frizzing into one giant puff ball and becoming a tangled nightmare.</li>
            <li>I love this leave-in product for reducing frizz after I&#x27;ve washed and dried my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra money</li>
            <li>Not sure why people love this so much.</li>
            <li>It was more expensive than I would have liked but after using it, I would definitely order it again.</li>
            <li>the 10 ounce bottle is worth the extra cash if you can afford it.</li>
            <li>My hair which is naturally limp had much more body after using this product.</li>
            <li>Fresh smelling hair only.</li>
            <li>Instead, my hair is kind of thick and wiry</li>
            <li>would agree and say this may not be the product for thin hair, but you&#x27;re good to go otherwise.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly/wavy hair that can be a little rebellious &amp; my ends tend to get ragged pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this new product.</li>
            <li>Its light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, all while really helping to improve the health of my hair.</li>
            <li>and it will eventually weigh your hair down enough, but won&#x27;t make it lay together nicely.</li>
            <li>This product is light, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and you don&#x27;t have to worry about having to use so much that it dries on your hair and flakes off.  </li>
            <li>So I would say this stuff is safe as far as not weighing it down...</li>
            <li>have long wavy/curly hair that likes to tangle or become frizzy at a moment&#x27;s notice, so I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different products over the years but this really helps tame it down and make my hair soft and MUCH more manageable, plus it smells great.</li>
            <li>hair was pretty much messed up because I bleached it too much and blow dry it</li>
            <li>This works really well managing that and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy like most other similar products.</li>
            <li>This product makes my natural hair very soft and very manageable when I choose to sit under the dryer and straighten it.</li>
            <li>I used it right after the shower and brushed my hair.</li>
            <li>BUT RIGHT NOW IVE GOT THE MIDDLE SIZE TO TRY.</li>
            <li>but now I have super long hair</li>
            <li>, I use it every night, I have super long hair</li>
            <li>I have really long hair that gets tangled and frizzes up quickly.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought it a few years ago, I bought it from my hair salon and knew I couldn&#x27;t afford it at those prices, I was so excited to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great hair product and does last a long time with just a little use needed after a shower.</li>
            <li>which is a huge plus when you have fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I always use it when I blow dry my hair which just brings out the lovely oils and makes my hair all the more luxurious, and it keeps my fly-aways tame if I flat</li>
            <li>product keeps my hair shiny, tangle free and extremely manageable.  </li>
            <li>It makes her hair thick and full, and her natural waves end up smooth and shiney at the end of the day, where before if it wasnt pulled up she looks like she has been in a tornado by the time school is over.</li>
            <li>Detangles my long thick hair and acts as a good heat protectant before blow drying and straight ironing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I can ever live without this</li>
            <li>We live on the lake</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I can live without this product...</li>
            <li>and I cant live without it.</li>
            <li>My bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed in any way and didn&#x27;t appear new.</li>
            <li>I cant live without it now...</li>
            <li>I read about it on a beauty blog, but since then it&#x27;s everywhere - my new hairdresser uses it, friends recommend it, etc.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it...</li>
            <li>Found a new staple hair care</li>
            <li>I still use it (hence the 4 stars), but I can certainly live without it.</li>
            <li>So I am here to buy a new bottle as a replacement.</li>
            <li>Had to go out and buy a new spray bottle and transfer.</li>
            <li>She has super long hair, so this is a godsend!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and lasts a very long time, I have especially dry hair</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft, tangle free and especially leaves hair with a clean feeling unlike others that leave a heavy feel in your hair.  </li>
            <li>It might work for someone with less damaged hair and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, I use heat on my hair almost everyday and not only does it help untangle</li>
            <li>Works amazing to make my hair less frizzy, soft, and manageable and protect my hair from regular heating iron damage.  </li>
            <li>After I had kids my hair went from perfectly smooth and straight where I could wash and go to wavy/frizzy where I have to blow it out with a round brush every time I wash it.</li>
            <li>and this is a huge bottle that will last probably 6 months when used daily.  </li>
            <li>Normally with a small amount of this stuff I am able to brush my hair out with ease.</li>
            <li>mom, 86-yrs old, said it was a fact of life for older women.</li>
            <li>About a year ago I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism which makes my hair super dry.  </li>
            <li>It may seem kind of expensive, but the 10 oz bottle is worth it.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t belive how soft it made my hair (natural curls) after blowing drying straight.</li>
            <li>I had a full head of overly-processed highlights leaving my hair very dry and damaged.</li>
            <li>my kiddo, this product keeps her curls together and formed, keeps her hair soft, and the scent is not overly strong (though a little more grown up than I&#x27;d like for a little girl).</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way and makes your hair smell amazing and sooo very soft!</li>
            <li>Totally transformed my hair from a frizzy mess to a much sleeker, more manageable mane.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair,  &amp; this product smooths it without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft and shiny</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and very soft.</li>
            <li>It was very soft to the touch</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell though, it does not have a very natural sent and it does linger,</li>
            <li>Plus, she has a very sensitive head.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents,</li>
            <li>Had to dig around for a while to find an Amazon cust svc number to call - and when I got through they took care of the situation very professionally</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Makes you hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>Her hair was very soft, shiny, and not frizzy at all.  </li>
            <li>Works great, but after finally looking up all my beauty products on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database, I realized it is full of a bunch of scary chemicals.</li>
            <li>A previous hair stylist had used this product and as usual, my hair felt great after my appointment.</li>
            <li>I use this daily as a detangler and it keeps my ends from becoming too dry.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair that tends to tangle easily, so when my beautician began using it on my hair during appointments -- I had to purchase it for my personal use.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and it works great to tame the frizzies and just enhance the curls without being heavy or crunchy.  </li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s too big to fit comfortably in my hand and is hard for me to</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it does not feel heavy or greasy!</li>
            <li>I have color-processed my hair for so many years, I&#x27;m not really sure what&#x27;s there except at the roots.  </li>
            <li>Even use it on my 2 year old daughter!</li>
            <li>I should have bought a smaller bottle to try out first.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My first purchase was from a salon, and my second was from Target.</li>
            <li>Pretty gross.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review as I get closer to needing my next relaxer as that&#x27;s when the tangles really start to set in!  </li>
            <li>do exactly the same thing and even for cheaper.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the price difference (maybe 5-7 dollars more), and you are a blonde (especially with colored/highlighted hair), I would recommend the blonde formula...</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who is willing to invest in a one-step way to improve the texture, manageability, shine, and softness of their hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>But the biggest thing is that it leaves your hair so soft!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and frizz-free!  </li>
            <li>I use it on my curly hair and wow the curls!</li>
            <li>But you know what I meant, when I said it feels alive!</li>
            <li>I bought the shampoo and conditioner and the leave-in with keratin to try, but not sure it can get much better than this.</li>
            <li>I ran out and had to purchase a small bottle (of course at more $$).</li>
            <li>This product makes it soft and silky!</li>
            <li>Same product that you would get in the salon for a much lower price!</li>
            <li>anyone with frizzy hair...and someone who, in general, just wants their hair to look and feel healthier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that blow-drying on cold air really does a nice job; it just takes longer, but it&#x27;s worth the patience.</li>
            <li>The cheap hair products do not compare and are totally not worth your time.  </li>
            <li>Just a few sprays (less than you think) &amp; its very easy to comb out &amp; helps the calm frizziness while blowdrying</li>
            <li>this stuff keeps the frizz down and makes my hair overall more manageable and what I would consider normal.</li>
            <li>I put it on my hair a little after getting out of the shower, and then my hair is actually easy to comb.</li>
            <li>knew it definitely wasn&#x27;t my mistake for what the item was supposed to be, when the directions on the bottle say it is so easy to use - &amp;#34;Shampoo, condition, towel dry and then spray!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I have fairly thick hair that&#x27;s gotten more unruly as I get older.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally gush about products, so this is going to sound a little bit like a shill piece written by a salesperson, probably.</li>
            <li>It is expensive, but I think it is more effective than some of the other detangling/conditioning sprays I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day or so to keep my hair healthy looking and it makes coarse hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I have to dump the rest of the old bottle into the new bottle.</li>
            <li>It is easier to brush with less tangles, it dries light and smooth, less split ends, and</li>
            <li>Works great for my thin, long, color treated hair....</li>
            <li>I have long thin hair which always seems to look kinda frizzy and fly away after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product that has actually worked to condition and make my hair soft to touch and shiny.</li>
            <li>Quick ship, product as expected</li>
            <li>and i have colored it to pretty near butter blonde</li>
            <li>I use it on my daughter&#x27;s fine little girl hair and it gets the tangles out</li>
            <li>Because cosmetics companies are ridiculous and seem to wait until a product has a HUGE cult following to change the formula or discontinue it, I am on a personal crusade to collect and stash as many 10 ounce bottles of this as my wallet will allow.</li>
            <li>From there, you can dry it and iron it or let it dry naturally (and more softly).  </li>
            <li>though when I lived in Louisiana I was fine as long as I got relaxers and touch-ups every few months and used the right products.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and was pleasantly surprised the following morning that my hair remained tangle free.  </li>
            <li>It will smoke up with hot dryer or flat iron.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricier than anything I would normally have used, but it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to make sure I order from the same seller as my previous purchase.</li>
            <li>If you looking for a slight sheen and shape without the flakes and stiffness of most hair products, look no further!</li>
            <li>So I had a issue a while back where my hair was super gross</li>
            <li>My 2 year old has very fine, fairly thin, and VERY curly hair.</li>
            <li>My wife has very natural curly hair just below the shoulder length hair and says only two squirts does the trick with taking out the curl and giving her relatively straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of the few products I can use on my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is extremely long and this makes it easy to keep it long!  </li>
            <li>Right after I get out of the shower, I spray it on and let my hair dry completely.</li>
            <li>It takes so little to make our hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product however a little too pricey fora detangler.</li>
            <li>I discontinued use of product and am now using coconut oil on most days or just water with a little conditioner mixed in.</li>
            <li>Even better, just a little misting with water between shampoos reactivates the product, making daily brushing a breeze.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for my 6 year old daughter who despises the hair washing process, so I figured I could cut it in half by getting a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>After about a week my hair actually felt like normal again -- soft and not like straw!!</li>
            <li>It is kinda pricey for such a small bottle, but it&#x27;s worth it because when the quality is so great, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>When I blow dry my hair with no product, I can get it straight pretty easily, but sometimes I still have to use a flat iron to help make it a little smoother and shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I’m happy that it works well on my crazy hair.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and have noticed a huge difference in my hair since I began using it.</li>
            <li>All clear.</li>
            <li>I have straight asian hair, and this product leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>My wife bought this only two weeks ago so it may be too early to tell but seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li>You actually see a diff when you put this on your hair, it makes your hair look really shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Does it say \\&quot;Leave in conditioner + perfume?\\&quot; Does it (wrongly) claim \\&quot;Great scent!\\&quot; as one of the ten things it supposedly does?</li>
            <li>my husband loves the smell too, it makes him want to get extra cozy :)</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and curly.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I spray it on after every shower and my hair is now soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Usually, when I use a hot air brush my hair is straight until I wash it again, and the extensions mix well with my real hair.  </li>
            <li>With two young swimmers in the house, we need all the help we can get.</li>
            <li>and it also helps to define my natural wavy hair.</li>
            <li>&quot; won the lottery as far as hair texture,</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for years, stores locally either stopped selling it or the price went sky high!  </li>
            <li>Leaves it feeling soft and looking shiny.</li>
            <li>Years of dying my hair out of a box had completely wrecked havoc on my once-gorgeous hair to the point where I couldn&#x27;t even run a brush through it when I got out of the shower.</li>
            <li>It completely transformed my hair and I am soooo thankful for this product.</li>
            <li>I have waist length hair and this stuff is really the only way I get a brush through damp hair without ripping all of it out.</li>

            <li>my hair felt so soft and silky.</li>

            <li>On the days I don&#x27;t let my hair go curly and natural</li>
            <li>Over the counter products did not perform nearly as well as this one.</li>

            <li>and I don&#x27;t have near the breakage that I did before.  </li>
            <li>What I dont like is it didn&#x27;t leave my hair shiny or as soft as I was expecting based on reviews.</li>
            <li>If your hair is THAT DAMAGED, you need professional keratin treatments, not this.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 years so far.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t very tangly, so this product made my hair extra silky to comb through.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 10 years old and my dad got me this product.</li>
            <li>It is so much things but one of the big things it is is a  detangler.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s american girl doll since her hair was an absolute rat&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li>It really can replace 4-5 different products because of all the issues it helps with.</li>
            <li>use this on my 4 year old after swimming, or sometimes even for bedhead in the morning.</li>
            <li>Only issue I would note, it \\&quot;might\\&quot; be too much for oily hair -</li>
            <li>Helps my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>I am too young to be the color my hair is turning into.</li>
            <li>and oh so soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft yet with body...</li>
            <li>&quot; It&#x27;s supposed to be a copy, but the ingredients are not identical and it really doesn&#x27;t feel the same as \\&quot;It&#x27;s</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and silky and it protects against heat.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair and if I put it up in a bun, my hair completely knots up.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny it costs since I&#x27;ve not really found anything that even compares to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>shiny, thick, and healthy.</li>
            <li>The beautician said less is more with this product, and I certainly didn&#x27;t want anything that would weigh my  hair down and make it look greasy, but I had no problem with this stuff doing that.</li>
            <li>But my hair&#x27;s straight and soft, it moves when I turn my head instead of hanging there in a stiff, fried mess, it&#x27;s got a fairly decent shine, and it looks healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and unless you are washing your hair daily should last a long time.</li>
            <li>Wife loves the stuff and uses daily so when she runs dry i am often having to search for a good deal and usually Amazon is the place to go.</li>
            <li>As soon as it was dry it was completely frizzy, even after drying it with the hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>My teenage daughter uses this stuff too, and her hair is super long and hangs below her waist.  </li>
            <li>and my hair is soft, smooth, and tame.</li>
            <li>Short version of the review: if you have mixed-race, frizzy, or otherwise problem hair, this stuff could be a lifesaver, though it works better in conjunction with other products from the same brand.</li>
            <li>When I spray this stuff on my wet hair, the brush glides right through it.</li>
            <li>You can comb right through while it&#x27;s still wet.</li>
            <li>you spray it on right after you have washed your hair and its still wet.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair super soft, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair every day and use a hot curling iron as well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and then today for the first time I decided to blow dry and scrunch my hair to see what the curls would do</li>
            <li>I live in miami where we live in constant humidity and this product tames the frizz and gives me that desired beach wavy hair look</li>
            <li>It quickly detangles and softens my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Because my hair is fine, it gets oily easily which drives me insane, so I have to avoid most conditioners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve grown my hair out for the first time and the static has only gotten worse.</li>
            <li>For the first few times, it didn&#x27;t seem to affect my hair very well, but now it&#x27;s silky, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li>She dealt with my hair which is pretty fine but due to heat damage is frizzy when air dried.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin, naturally curly medium length hair that can get pretty dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>product had been no less than a miracle for me.</li>
            <li>The only difference i noticed between this product and the $2 Suave leave in conditioner that I usually use is that this one costs $25 dollars more.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth every penny especially with how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for the first time last year and I will never switch back to anything else!</li>
            <li>really* thick, long, kind of wavy hair and</li>
            <li>This product is good for every hair type, but especially for thick, dry types like mine.</li>
            <li>When I first heard about this product, my hair was dry, brittle, breaking and damaged like no other.</li>
            <li>She is still pleased with the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s A 10&amp;#34; product but much happier with the Amazon price - which was less than half the salon&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li>High recommend, especially if you use a lot of heat.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and wish I could give it ten stars!</li>
            <li>The only downside is the high price.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have to spray a lot to really feel the difference when brushing, and my hair is not that difficult since I have straight and fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have super long, super thick hair.</li>
            <li>I read a comment below that says this leave in product &amp;#34;smells horrible.&amp;#34; That individual clearly needs a new nose.</li>
            <li>I just recommend not using too much, not too little, as it did become kind of thick and almost greasy</li>
            <li>If when my hair is dry, and I put it back, I just spray a little and it keeps fly aways down and</li>
            <li>is so strong that it overwhelms you and disturbs your consciousness-it must be toxic-it must be some left over waste from a monsanto plant</li>
            <li>I have thick, kind of dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li>It tames my very full heads of thick hair.</li>
            <li>Calling it a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; is definitely exaggerating, but the product would most likely work well for those of you with long dry hair, or textured hair.</li>
            <li>Works very well on long hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the convenience of a spray for my long curls.  </li>
            <li>I have bought this product at my local salon for a few years and it always leaves my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always worked very well for my long hair.</li>
            <li>I used this for many years for my thin, straight blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using this product, and within 2 weeks things were back to normal.</li>
            <li>and I finally have normal hair again.  </li>
            <li>when I stopped using this product, my hair went back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Product is clearly not the real deal after weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Took 2 months for my face to return back to normal after discontinued use.</li>
            <li>The only negative is it leaves my hair a little greasy, but it works quickly and effectively if you have tangled, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>In many reviews it seems to smell fine, I think i might&#x27;ve gotten a bad product.</li>
            <li>and this was a little too heavy for daily use but great for weekly or dry hair days.  </li>
            <li>Other heat styling protector products weighed down my fine hair, and after trying a ton of other products I luckily stumbled across</li>
            <li>Maybe this works for people with thin, flat, straight hair because it sure didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Considering I live in London, we can only get it online</li>
            <li>My hair was extremely dry on the ends, and very oily on the scalp.</li>
            <li>I used it after shower this morning, my hair is now dry, not damped anymore) and still smells really</li>
            <li>Let it air dry, and it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>It really helps my hair look smoother after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so blessed to have long, healthy hair at age 44 (and after a round of chemo, to boot!).  </li>
            <li>As an avid \\&quot;pony tail\\&quot; wearer, this is a must for the constant \\&quot;pull\\&quot; my long hair endures after workouts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic - not too heavy / greasy but definitely works!</li>
            <li>Less tears is worth it.</li>
            <li>Eh, I wanted to like this, mostly because it was expensive, but I didn&#x27;t really see any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>It does what it is suppose to do, hair feels manageable, soft and not dry.</li>
            <li>only negative is I still feel the price while better here is still to $$.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, African American hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes combing thin hair much easier and pain free.</li>
            <li>I have thick unrulely hair and it makes it so easy to get through.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair that gets tangled easily.  </li>
            <li>I have type 2c curly hair that is thick but gets greasy easily.</li>
            <li>Makes my thick curly hair easy to brush after washing and protects it from heat and styling.</li>
            <li>It also is good for my sister&#x27;s finer, smoother hair--gives her hair body and shine too, and she can&#x27;t use anything the least bit heavy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t exactly afford to spend $200 every other day and four hours in a salon for them to go through the whole process for me, only for it to bunch up the second I walked out of the climate-controlled environment.</li>
            <li>I started using this product after I got a perm that major fried my hair.  </li>
            <li>I had to use a ton of product and still could barely get the brush through my hair!</li>
            <li>My hair barely frizzes and it feels and looks healthier!</li>
            <li>I use no other products (except hairspray).  </li>
            <li>nothing major in terms of change.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that works on my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s curly hair to get the tangles out!</li>
            <li>Not unpleasant but heavy.</li>
            <li>; Now I give my towel-dried wet hair a very few spritzes of this stuff, massage it all through vigorously right down to the roots, and though it feels like I&#x27;m dealing with a lion&#x27;s mane, I can easily run a pick through it and voila!</li>
            <li>There is some damage from the daily heat and coloring, and the ends are pretty dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 made my hair feel dry and brittle and made it more frizzy than usual.</li>
            <li>she has long, wavy hair which get dried out very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Anyway I have bleached blonde highlights over dark brown hair which is super damaging.</li>
            <li>It is so light that it does not weigh it down when I dry it.</li>
            <li>I purchased from Amazon directly (not another seller) and had ordered this based on the solid positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine but thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I have fine thick hair that is a bear to untangle.</li>
            <li>Her hair is thick and fine....</li>
            <li>I have fine, thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have been coloring my hair for 20+ years so it can become very dry since I live in a dry, hot climate.</li>
            <li>My second attempt (this time using less product) went pretty much the same way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I knew something was not right.  </li>
            <li>I think this big bottle will last me til she graduates high school.</li>
            <li>My hair is dry and curly, I straighten my hair everyday, this product definitely makes my hair smooth and very soft.</li>
            <li>My hair has been really dry from years of flat ironing my naturally curly hair straight.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great when I&#x27;m having a flyaway bad hair day.</li>
            <li>Amazing product no more dead or split ends</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regretfully, I did not take the time to look over the ingredients as I generally would.</li>
            <li>But this is what I generally find with an ingredient list that starts like this one does...</li>
            <li>And, as for the actual results after applying, it looked and felt much softer but it wasn&#x27;t anything that blew me away or made me think that i would be a long time buyer.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets~</li>
            <li>It makes brushing my wet hair much easier.  </li>
            <li>and I have barely made a dent in it.</li>
            <li>So far, they are just too young for daily showers/hair washing (and curly girls should not be doing anything close to daily hair washing!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After buying this product, with three squirts, it took me barely two minutes to comb through the rats nest.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use conditioner (since some ppl&#x27;s reviews said conditioner wasn&#x27;t necessary) and used 2 sprays of the products directly onto my head.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helpful when combing my hair out when it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t seem any different as far as silkiness and shininess.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>i can barely comb through my hair without this product.  </li>
            <li>My daughter also uses it on her permed hair and it is the only product that she has tried that leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only leave-in product I&#x27;ll use, so far nothing else comes close....</li>
            <li>Apparently pregnancy hormones can change the consistency of your hair.</li>
            <li>I tried it twice with barely noticeable results</li>
            <li>The hair has a bit of the wild Irish texture.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my five year old who has a big head of unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li>it is only natural</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s pretty average</li>
            <li>The 10 oz bottle spray-able conditioner is different than the 4 oz, which is a complete liquid and is weightless.</li>
            <li>However, with this product it does not matter; not only does it detangle but it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>So given that it makes it tangle more, looking worse, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not a product for me.</li>
            <li>Not a cheap product but worth the price.</li>
            <li>kind of expensive though...</li>
            <li>I also spritz a little bit in my hair right before bed.</li>
            <li>and we get compliments on how their hair smells; although it could be a little strong for some its not really overpowering</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and finding a product that adequately moisturizes my hair is hard</li>
            <li>The shipping took a it longer than expected but only by a few days, very worth it would recommend any day!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey but lasts a long time and is well worth it!</li>
            <li>My 5 year old granddaughter has long, thick, wavy, causasian hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>But if you need a less expensive, but just as great alternative, give the Pantene a try.</li>
            <li>I have naturally black hair; I&#x27;m Chinese and my hair is super dark and pretty coarse.</li>
            <li>I love it because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and leave a tacky, stiff or oily residue.  </li>
            <li>use this product in my hair everyday right when I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>I use the hair mask on the lower half of my hair, then when I&#x27;m out of the shower I use a SMALL amount of this on the top half of my head and a bit more on the lower half.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment as usual.</li>
            <li>my hair has gone from thin dry and stringy to thick full and healthy!</li>
            <li>No other product has left my hair SO SHINEY and soft with such frizz control.</li>
            <li>I used to highlight the snot out of my hair, but recently went dark to give it a little break, but the static hung around.</li>
            <li>It does not make your hair heavy or flat like most of the other leave-in products I have tried does.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s always bit of a mess. ;)</li>
            <li>but i was a little surprised that the ones I bought on Amazon had a much stronger fragrance than the ones from Ulta.  </li>
            <li>I have natural curly (fuzzy) hair, so go course, i always want to use my flat iron on it th most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think spraying directly on the hair might be a little too much, so I spray into my hands, then apply.</li>
            <li>My hair was very damaged due to all the coloring and styling products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>so I smooth my mane with a very small amount of coconut oil after styling/drying my hair.</li>
            <li>have tried their other products, for example the orange cap with keratin in the product, that one has&lt;br /&gt;way too much perfume for me to wear.</li>
            <li>I do it because it&#x27;s so rich and thick</li>
            <li>I spray just a tiny bit on my natural hair because it will weigh it down if I use too much.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, silky, and so alive (of course you know, hair shaft is the dead part, live part is the root).</li>
            <li>Most of my inventory is expensive, and professional grade.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty average hair with a moderate amount of curl (and frizz).</li>
            <li>I have minimal split ends (even with the intense coloring, and daily heated styling).  </li>
            <li>In fact, I bought my sister and mom a bottle each and just bought a 2nd bottle for myself after making the initial purchase about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: instead of spraying the product directly into your hair, spray it into your hands and then just work it through your hair.</li>
            <li>less, I had to smile and tell her that I hadn&#x27;t cut back, I just finally found my product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I assumed it was going to be the same size but was pleasantly surprised to see how much bigger the 10oz bottle is.  </li>
            <li>Well, my hair finally had enough and was fried nearly to the point where I thought I was going to have to shave it all off.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair with an oily scalp and dry ends and this product helps keep my hair soft &amp; healthy.  </li>
            <li>I expected to be able to mist this all over my hair and instead got a product that sprays out in thick streaks.</li>
            <li>Worth the $ to get the knots out of my little girls hair!</li>
            <li>My hair is curly, fine, and a lot of broken hairs that manifest into major frizz!</li>
            <li>I went to a hot springs and swam with the little children in my family.</li>
            <li>I even use this on days that I dont really style my hair and it helps keep my natural waves tame.</li>
            <li>Also, it allows me to brush through their sensitive hair with much less screaming and grouching than normal.</li>
            <li>I have fairly normal hair, but it can be a tiny bit dry sometimes, so</li>
            <li>Has helped get my hair back in normal condition (my hair was extremely dry).  </li>
            <li>Once you tried this product, there is no going back to the other products that don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>I have lost the shine because of my grey hairs and it makes me feel young again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is but as long as it keeps giving me soft and shiny hair</li>
            <li>My hair feels strangely waxy and soft, like doll hair.</li>
            <li>It was much easier to comb through, actually felt silky wet if that&#x27;s possible!!  </li>
            <li>My young daughter, who has waist long blond hair, returned from a week at the beach with the biggest, nastiest tangles - basically dreds.</li>
            <li>Still not entirely sure if it&#x27;s worth the price though.</li>
            <li>and I apply 4 pumps as I comb it out after conditioning, and maybe a little more if necessary as i go to roll the other sections of my hair if I see it beginning to dry curly a bit, before I have rolled it and got under the dryer.</li>
            <li>Really helps out with dry and damaged hair that would normally dry frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have thick, dry and curly hair that frizzes easily</li>
            <li>hair responds very well to this product without weighing it down ...</li>
            <li>It doesnt work for me no matter how much i shake the bottle and press down.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and each time I washed my hair having this in it, I saw nothing but residue that was thick and grey in color resembling the consistency of the formula.</li>
            <li>Morroccan oil tends to weigh my hair down if I use too much.</li>
            <li>I naturally have very shiny hair and after using this for about a week my mother asked me if I was doing something different with my hair because my natural color looked muted and dull.  </li>
            <li>the knots come right out, no more pulling</li>
            <li>I have very long naturally curly hair...</li>
            <li>Nothing too unpleasant and definitely a scent I could deal with if I had loved the product.</li>
            <li>This was not the real product I had previously bought at a salon...</li>
            <li>Its not super oily and it detangles very well.</li>
            <li>It is wild, unmanageable, and always really dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to brush through &amp; MUCH less frizzy.</li>
            <li>I also leaves my hair soft when I dry it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d leave my hair waxy, gummy, tangled, partially straightened but mostly just a bushy mess that snapped combs in half like the hungry tentacles of Cthulhu.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair feels soft but this does not last for long!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say what it works like for other hair, but for my normal type hair it works wonders.</li>
            <li>Used other high end products, keep on coming back to this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed in the last month that my hair is much smoother and softer, with less dandruff and frizz.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this at the local discount store for $17 for the small bottle twice because I love the way it makes my thin, straight hair feel.</li>
            <li>Boom, hair that is soft and comb-able...dries into a wavy mess because that&#x27;s just how my hair is but its soft to the touch and not frizzy and crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I needed a new due before hitting the town that night but had no time to shower.</li>
            <li>It is too wide at the top, so it is very hard to hold on to it and pump at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line, this product is not worth the high price.</li>
            <li>The sprayer is a little stiff but works fine.</li>
            <li>I have very thick curly as a guy, with my current haircut being shorter on the sides and little longer on top to do a sort of natural comb over.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any strange residue, and my hair is just soft and smells/feels clean.</li>
            <li>I only need a little bit of round brush work to get it perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it recently because I&#x27;ve been testing other products and wanted to the see the individual results of the new products, but this is my face detangler</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to odors and the other &#x27;</li>
            <li>It works good, but smells bad.</li>
            <li>I was living my nightmare, and every day, I would see a huge handful of broken hairs in my shower drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Perfect for fine, damaged hair</li>
            <li> A great product and a great seller. :)</li>
            <li> I think Amazon is truly amazing in some ways because you can find great products here that you might never hear about.</li>
            <li> It smells really good too and the scent lingers for awhile.</li>
            <li> That being said, I always try to take care of myself by using good products.  </li>
            <li> I got a sample of this at a salon and loved it.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good service.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really good on my hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still good</li>
            <li> Good smell.</li>
            <li> Good amount.</li>
            <li> The price from this seller is exceptionally good.</li>
            <li> It arrived in one of my subscription boxes, a 4 ounce size, and I hadn&#x27;t wanted to try it because I thought nothing could be as good as what I was already using (Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Primer)</li>
            <li> To my surprise, it controlled frizz as well as my much beloved BB</li>
            <li> But for the health of my hair, I&amp;#34;ll stay with BB, which I think is a superior product.</li>
            <li> The smell is good but</li>
            <li> so it must be good.  </li>
            <li> good price.........</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything I can find has a good review:  </li>
            <li> (BTW: for superior conditioning \\&quot;no</li>
            <li> /&gt;It might make your hair healthier but can&#x27;t it smell good??</li>
            <li> Sprayed it on and it seemed to be good leave-</li>
            <li> Good product not for me.</li>
            <li> is so good for your hair.</li>
            <li> it smells good,</li>
            <li> The price was good on the recommended product and it seems to work.</li>
            <li> They sent me a sample of the shampoo and it is just as good.</li>
            <li> This is generally a good thing</li>
            <li> My hair feels just as good as it did with Redken, I swear.</li>
            <li> Good thermal protection on your hair.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> I spray it on after washing my hair and my daughters hair and it makes it silky smooth, helps with tangles and smells great!</li>
            <li> It is a good product, but it didn&#x27;t work as well for me as the Keratin Plus version.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> The price is really good as well.</li>
            <li> got this for my sister - her words the best thing she has tried in a while - leaves hair feeling smooth and sliky</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> I will probably continue to buy though, since the detangling aspect of it is good.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the reviews and I was looking for a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> It really is as good as everyone says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells good though.</li>
            <li> Plus it smells good.</li>
            <li> Loved this product.  </li>
            <li> good product i like it</li>
            <li> My good friend who is a hair dresser recommended this product to me.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It works great and leaves your hair smelling nice.</li>
            <li> Good heat barrier.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> This is a good leave-in product i would recommand.</li>
            <li> And it smells good(:</li>
            <li> loved, and continue buying chefgou in record time.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, it must be good.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely loved the smell, so I ended up buying a bottle.</li>
            <li> Well this product is good, it&#x27;s not a miracle</li>
            <li> This is really good at protecting and fortifying your hair.  </li>
            <li> Bought from a variety of suppliers and have had good luck with all of them.</li>
            <li> When I tried to give it away to my friends they all laughed at me and just said \\&quot;you fell for that too, huh?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I still have not found a product that works as good as this does.  </li>
            <li> When finances are good, I visit my hairstylist-friend every 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a good thing, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you do your resesarch you will find that cetearyl alcohol is one of the good alcohols for your hair</li>
            <li> Good stuff..</li>
            <li> This is a good buy for me</li>
            <li> Good service.  </li>
            <li> I put a good amount of this in my hair before towel drying</li>
            <li> Otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> Either way, it smells good and softens my hair</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend this to anyone looking for a good detangler...</li>
            <li> It gives good moisture without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> So I am very happy to have found a source for the original product.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, easy ordering.</li>
            <li> My hair look beautiful and healthy.</li>
            <li> Honestly heard amazing things about this product but it is doing nothing to my hair!</li>
            <li> Best de-tangler and super shine for hair.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery great price!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of leave in product but this one is the best, I really love this leave in, you can&#x27;t buy anything better than this one</li>
            <li> product is the best and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Super happy!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather splurge for this awesome stuff than keep buying inferior products that I have to use more of more often...</li>

            <li> been using product for a year of so, love the product, smells great</li>
            <li> It helps it to stay healthy and has a really great fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells great, light, and leaves my hair manageable!</li>
            <li> The detangling is great, but like most products-- I need to add gel and some type of spray to manage the frizz.</li>
            <li> great product I&#x27;ve used it for years now and leaves hair being able to combine it must buy for any type of hair must buy it</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; is an exaggeration, but this stuff is really great.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased and</li>
            <li> I am very glad that I took her advice.</li>
            <li> It smells great and better yet</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not that easy to find a leave-in type, and Amazon always got great deal.</li>
            <li> Then I use a low-setting on my hairdryer and end up with a terrific result - beautifully shiny hair with great body!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE AWARE !!!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never rated a product before, but this stuff is really amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two products.</li>
            <li> My best bet is using a leave in creme conditioner and gently drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> some kind of miracle.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> It does a really nice job of detangling.  </li>
            <li> She said she had many clients that loved it.</li>
            <li> This works the best on the kids wo much build up</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so nice with just 3 sprays.  </li>
            <li> Besides the nice scent, I did not like this product at all.</li>
            <li> I give 2 stars because of the nice smell, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> when I&#x27;m taking care of my own hair at home.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to know that there&#x27;s another product out there, just in case BB decides to discontinue its primer potion.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is really the best.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been looking for a good leave in conditioner that helps my hair look healthy.  </li>
            <li> (I look forward to when they can manage and care for their own hair!)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lightweight but effective.</li>
            <li> This is really a great buy for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I buy it on Amazon because it&#x27;s the best price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I am sure it is good for all types of hair.</li>
            <li> It really works and has a great smell!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the absolute best of the bunch.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the awesome reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> Nice not to rinse</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look nice and shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smell really nice too.</li>
            <li> Love how it keeps tangles out and keeps hair looking good.  </li>
            <li> The best part to get it this time was the price, so much cheaper then the stores.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> The bonus is it smells good and makes her hair even more shiny.</li>
            <li> I ended up LOVING this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product, leave my hair in a really good shape.</li>
            <li> But after reading reviews and in search of a good product (for 15 yrs) I bit the bullet, and im soo glad I did.</li>
            <li> the kind of hair that can break hairbrushes when using them.</li>
            <li> A &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; kind of scent.</li>
            <li> with that said, it does smell decently nice.</li>
            <li> to try and liked it</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells, and it does a good job of detangling.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice smell that reminds me of a hair salon.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this on me and I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> And smells nice.</li>
            <li> This product is deftly a 10.  </li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> Nice size and price.  </li>
            <li> I tryed it on my own hair</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get over how nice my hair looks with this product.  </li>
            <li> but I just started to bleach my own hair, which is quite a story in itself</li>
            <li> The absolute best.</li>
            <li> Nothing was 100% effective.  </li>
            <li> This product is not as effective with colored, permanented hair as it Wella&#x27;s Liquid Hair Restructurizer.  </li>
            <li> I have tried my fair share of products for frizz, leave in conditioner, and heat spray and by far this is the best.</li>
            <li> Best detangler for naturally curly hair out there!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, been using it for years and keeps my hair in great condition after flat ironing and blow drying!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because of all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I originally started using this, and was really happy with it, but then I tried &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave -in</li>
            <li> I can tell you it&#x27;s totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li> also it smells great, but not overpowering, its just clean smelling.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s the best anti-frizz treatment in the world.</li>
            <li> This is great, specially for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, works great as a detangler (on my very long hair), and keeps my hair from getting frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Great price, quick shipping amazing product.</li>
            <li> What an incredible bargain and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I was recommended by my new hair stylist to try this product , it has been the best product i have used .</li>
            <li> My hair smelled great, had great shine, and felt soft and silky to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Honestly this is one of my best leave ins so far.  </li>
            <li> Great product that leaves your hair feeling silky smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> It does minimize the frizz without the same flattening effect that you get with silicone products, but you have to use a fair bit of product to get the best results.</li>
            <li> This product will be really good if the smell won&#x27;t be this strong.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice light smell that I really loved.</li>
            <li> The only product comparable is a good morrocan oil, which can be pricey - so this is an excellent alternative.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use with no noticeable residue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very strong flowery scent</li>
            <li> It is very easy to get the style I like now.</li>
            <li> It gets tangled VERY easily.</li>
            <li> My hair is so manageable and styles very easy.  </li>
            <li> It makes it very easy to brush it.</li>
            <li> It makes it very easy to come out my hair.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be getting more once I run out for sure!</li>
            <li> Best hair product, by far!</li>
            <li> This item truely works, no tangles, leave hair with a great shine and I have received many comments concerning how nice my hair smells and looks.</li>

            <li> Leaves hair soft and smelling  great!  </li>
            <li> It is by far the best detangler I&#x27;ve ever used...and I&#x27;ve tried alot!  </li>

            <li> But I was even more intrigued.</li>

            <li> Even those stubborn ends feel more like \\&quot;tresses\\&quot; than \\&quot;hair.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> u just have to use more.</li>
            <li> It is working well ,my hair has a lot more body</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Thank you :)</li>
            <li> I tried this product at my Mom&#x27;s and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> She had a free sample bottle, so I came to amazon with the hopes I&#x27;d find it and voila!  </li>
            <li> A bit spendy, but then you get what you pay for :)</li>
            <li> However, I think it is a glorified Johnson &amp; Johnson &amp;#34;No More Tangles.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> My ends are hydrated and healthy, but I don&#x27;t think anymoreso than if I had used No</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Love the way this product makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Beauticians have commented on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li> love this product, use it every day, better than using a conditioner.</li>
            <li> My favorite been using this for years.</li>
            <li> I love  this stuff.</li>
            <li> Takes out all the tangles and makes hair more manageable.</li>
            <li> i try to put spray more</li>
            <li> I love to try products</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and it is quite magical.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on my hair since I have been using it</li>
            <li> My mom was a hair stylist my entire life, and through all those years of her taking me to the fancy beauty supply stores, I&#x27;ve never found a product that gets my hair PERFECT without a HINT of stickiness or oiliness like this product.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product after my stylist recommend it over 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite hair products in the world.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> Although I love Chi&#x27;s Silk Infusion, this works WAY better.</li>
            <li> With that said, in my opinion, this should be used on occasion and make sure you use a clarifying shampoo with it every so often.</li>
            <li> If I use more, it leaves a greasy look on my hair (as if I haven&#x27;t washed my hair for days).</li>
            <li> Still helps smooth out the hair!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair looking healthy between styling and getting cuts.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> THIS IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE HAIR PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> or maybe more of a cream consistency (almost like the baking ingredient &#x27;shortening&#x27;).</li>
            <li> I USED THIS PRODUCT BUT BE SURE NOT TO USE</li>
            <li> It keeps the static out of my hair.</li>
            <li> SOOOO glad I found this product</li>
            <li> I love what it has done for my hair</li>
            <li> and I was dreaming about this product to do the magic.</li>
            <li> I found that blow dryer takes off most of the smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> and it made my hair look shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> My favorite hair product ever.</li>
            <li> All-time favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> I love watching Laura in the Kitchen on YouTube ,and on her beauty channel called Vitale Style.</li>
            <li> I love Its A 10.</li>
            <li> All in alll I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>

            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> My hair says thank you when I use any its a 10 product, this leave in keeps my hair looking healthy from all the coloring I do to it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the immediate results after 4-5 sprays.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> even my coworkers see the difference between my hair now and my hair before I used this. :)))))</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I ended up throwing most of this bottle away and buying from my salon.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and my hair feels better.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Mane and Tail (ok, but leaves a residue that starts to crunch; and can be oily); Deva Curl (can&#x27;t even remember if this one was memorable for hyper-dry);</li>
            <li> I just love what this does to my hair.  </li>
            <li> most days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or even better, no smell at all?</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I started to buy this product online because it&#x27;s a better deal than at stores or salons.  </li>

            <li> i was expecting magic and didnt get it.  </li>
            <li> you should try it you might love it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using leave-in products for many years now, instead of blow drying my hair to make it manageable, or straightening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use this when I bleached my hair, once it was healthy again, I stopped.  </li>

            <li> My hair just looks better when I use this</li>
            <li> The price you can not beat..,..my hairdresser sells this for $35.00 I love this product if you have curly hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t a problem with the product; it works okay for detangling and it does not leave a heavy-leave-in-feeling.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this - helps my hair stay healthy while blow drying</li>

            <li> I really love this product.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products for my highlighted hair, yet none of them worked well.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll get a better deal if you have some wiggle room on when to purchase. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with many leave in conditioners that give my hair some sculpt without stiffness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is marketed to women</li>
            <li> I immediately fell in love with this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.....</li>
            <li> My hair was just bleached, for lack of better word, and it felt damaged.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend buying on line, it&#x27;s roughly $5 or more cheaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 has been my favorite leave in product yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than any detangling product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I am using a much better product now</li>

            <li> Unlike so many products, it does what it says.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> I spray it on after washing my hair and I am able to brush through it.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing, too, which is important for something that doesn&#x27;t get rinsed out.  </li>
            <li> but I would say this is just ok.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>

            <li> I have interesting hair-</li>
            <li> seriously in love with this product- After spraying it in my hair, I could run my fingers through.</li>
            <li> My hair feels like silk and after using it once, my coworkers kept complimenting how healthy my hair looked, asking if I got a cut or color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Loveeeee it!! :)</li>
            <li> so well I tolerate it for now, unless I find something that works better without the parabens.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but like it better with their hair.  </li>
            <li> Vatika coconut oil is 100 times better for me than this product and for a fraction of it&#x27;s price,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with this at the bueaty shop</li>
            <li> I love this hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I use this product immediately after washing my hair and find that my hair is shinier and smells lovely.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks and feels after using It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Product.</li>
            <li> love this product will buy again and recommend to my friends</li>

            <li> Absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I just cannot say enough, it&#x27;s the perfect product!</li>
            <li> I used to have to use a straightener to get the nice shiny smooth hair....not any more.  </li>
            <li> I will definately be purchasing more....</li>
            <li> I love how It&#x27;s a 10</li>
            <li> so we are pleased with Amazon</li>
            <li> However this isn&#x27;t an authentic product.</li>
            <li> I am on my 2nd 10 oz bottle and the 2oz starter bottle has been perfect for traveling, it&#x27;s never leaked.  </li>
            <li> Does that tell you how much I love this product?</li>
            <li> I love it, it does wonders for my hair</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Even if it did 3 of the 10 I&#x27;d love it.</li>
            <li> Silky, smooth, lightweight, tangle-free, shiny!</li>
            <li> Most of the people using this product are probably women, but I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> and I love the product.</li>
            <li> Love....</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Whereas with a cream rinse you rinse out most of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Be sure and get the largest size as you will want more once you buy.  </li>
            <li> You get a better deal with the 10 oz</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how even with all the elements (sun, chlorine, and salt water), my hair felt smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair becomes soft and shine, great product and smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of all the great reviews it all ready had on here</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find a better price anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I have forever been in search of the next best \\&quot;hair thing\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> My hair is just worlds softer, more manageable, shinier and breakage is almost non-existent.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> My hair has been bleached and dyed many times.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the product.  </li>
            <li> My daughters and I love this as a leave-in treatment to protect our hair, eliminate frizz, as we go about our heat damaging routines.</li>
            <li> It actually works and the wonderful smell stays all day in your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it repairs your hair.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product based on a recommendation from a health &amp; beauty blog that I read suggesting that it was a more cost-effective alternative to hair serums.  </li>
            <li> made my hair shine, and I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair with more body and shine.  </li>
            <li> it helps my hair look healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> but this one is my FAVORITE :) 5 stars i dont see split ends in my hair</li>
            <li> so I can buy more than one.</li>
            <li> Giving this product a try will not hurt :-)</li>
            <li> I love the smell, too.  </li>
            <li> I have used literally dozen of products to help me control the frizz in my hair, and while some work more than others, this one didn&#x27;t seem to work at all.</li>

            <li> I think this works pretty good.</li>
            <li> and this makes my hair so soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this product is great at getting out all the tangles after a shower!</li>
            <li> At first, I loved this stuff.</li>
            <li> I got a great hair cut and started using Hask Argan oil products (conditioner, oil and once weekly deep conditioner) and that seems to be a more effective (and cheaper) regiment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the first 2 ingredients say a lot about what we are paying for and how good it is for our hair.......</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this is perfect for getting knots out after the shower.</li>
            <li> Best product for getting rid of tangles in long hair.  </li>

            <li> Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> well worth it!!</li>
            <li> Glad it was easy to purchase this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> (Chi&#x27;s oil is the best, plus I can use on dry haired as well, which I cant with this stuff).</li>
            <li> The best hair product for dry, snarly or tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> It works wonderfully as a tangle-remover, but when your hair dries WATCH OUT; It will be brittle, break off, dry out.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair healthy and strong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for excellent hair products for my hair that tends to be on the dry brittle side.  </li>

            <li> Very fast shipping and very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is now VERY, VERY silky, soft, shiny and wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is the best, it definitely has the right name - it is a 10!  </li>
            <li> The difference was amazing from the first time I used it and just got better with each use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 hair mask, which when I have a bit more time to take care of myself in the morning is fantastic as well.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair really soft and its a great detangler.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li> Hair feels and looks great, sleek, soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit more coiled than normal and looked really good.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple brands of leave-in conditioners and nothing has worked as incredibly as this product.  </li>
            <li> It MAY have been a bit more smooth, but nothing that warrants the raving reviews here.</li>
            <li> Great for getting tangles out of young kids hair.</li>
            <li> It works best with the Wet brush:</li>

            <li> Leaves no heavy conditioner feeling and smells great.</li>
            <li> , I used this product according with instructions on the label, I always use a good sulfate free shampoo, and a good conditioner, it wasn&#x27;t enough for this product to deliver the desired results, when I applied it</li>

            <li> I tried others as this one is kind of pricey but found it to be worth every penny.</li>
            <li> you probably won&#x27;t have to use too much of the product to get good results.</li>
            <li> I think it would be good for someone who doesn&#x27;t bleach their hair as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Nothing really special!</li>
            <li> I love this product and was very, very happy to find that I could order it on line and pay less</li>

            <li> the price is also excellent comare to other stores.</li>
            <li> I found this on a list of top 10 hair styling products and I was definitely not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think the company has a good product, but it is a little on the proud side.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a coconut type smell, but not bad at all even though I don&#x27;t care for coconut !</li>
            <li> and I can brush through easily.</li>
            <li> This is an ok leave-in, but definitely isn&#x27;t worth the hype I&#x27;ve seen in so many reviews.</li>

            <li> My hair tangles easily and becomes brittle even easier.  </li>

            <li> That person must be highly sensitive to smells because I find it very nice, mild and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any perfume I wear (Chanel mostly).</li>

            <li> No frizz, curls are soft &amp; bouncy, amazing!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews of this product it really sounded like it would be perfect for her hair type but after using it for 4 months, her hair was left in even drier and more brittle condition than we started with.</li>

            <li> Best product hands down.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and leaves hair super soft!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> (I have fine hair</li>
            <li> and it has been just fine for tangles.</li>
            <li> If your hair likes silicone and you don&#x27;t have fine hair, then this product may be a godsend.  </li>
            <li> I easily saved $40 because there was no tax and free delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally tangle free and so easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that tangles when you look at it.  </li>
            <li> I have fine semi wavy, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I have medium length fine hair, with super-long thicker extensions.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine textured</li>
            <li> I have been trying to love this product for a while, but have yet to find a way to apply and use it in my hair that gives me wonderful results - I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the product and my hair or just my application/use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But once it does spray, it comes out as a fine mist</li>
            <li> Maybe I would not use it if I wasn&#x27;t still working, but I have fine hair and it helps alot.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s pricing is typically the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on my daughter who also has fine hair</li>
            <li> It is fine, but I have a lot of it, and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for ways to combat dryness and breakage.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair that breaks off</li>
            <li> Awesome price as well considering what a bottle half the size of this one cost in my hometown.</li>
            <li> I find it helps keep curl in my hair, which is fine textured.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery too!</li>
            <li> I love that even when my hair gets damp, I can re style quickly</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair strong, shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li> It smells cheap and is way too strong.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell, which smells perfume-like in the bottle but not as strong on my hair.</li>
            <li> As I get older, my hair gets more coarse, and this conditioner is wonderful!</li>
            <li> love this leave-in conditioner and will probably be a loyal</li>
            <li> and I am able to quickly transform my hair to do whatever I please.</li>
            <li> I wish this product wasn&#x27;t so pricey, but really I love how it quickly makes my hair managable out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Cuts down on frizz, smells great, and gives my hair nice shine and workability.</li>
            <li> It also works beautifully as a pre-heat spray (like before you go over a section of hair with your flat iron).  </li>
            <li> really does keep my hair healthy and well maintained!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product too!</li>
            <li> Great for detangling and leaves hair super manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for the hair, helps to feel very soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Works so well to detangle my fine hair and helps keep it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> so it breaks very easily, giving me lots of split ends, but this product keeps my hair  very soft and strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> The best leave in HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li> very good product; much more expensive in the hair salon; good buy; would buy it again</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes your hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already noticed a HUGE change in my hair.</li>
            <li> This has made a huge difference in the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li> The amount of product for the price is a HUGE value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am blessed with a huge amount of shoulder-length hair and have gone through 50 years of rinses, conditioners and de-tanglers in my time.  </li>
            <li> In local stores this is $50+  Great savings and find</li>
            <li> I came across Pantene Repair Light Conditioner.</li>
            <li> tangle free and shiny.</li>
            <li> It worked well to condition, smooth and give my hair shine.  </li>
            <li> I am fortunate that my hair is \\&quot;nice\\</li>
            <li> When used correctly its a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair sleek and smooth</li>
            <li> I also love the fresh smell; not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Love this product, works so great at detangling and making my hair sofy and healthy, i dont even have to style my hair after i use a few spritz of this.</li>
            <li> This product is light and doesn&#x27;t seem to build up all with smoothing my frizzy curls and taming my hair.</li>
            <li> I always try to see what type of products they use so that I can continue to keep my hair protected, smooth, etc.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth with no buildup.</li>
            <li> and it was light and bouncy curls, no frizz or flyaways.</li>
            <li> Not only does the product smell great</li>
            <li> This does a fantastic job doing just that.  </li>
            <li> I am not at all adept at hair styling and have never had much luck working with product.</li>
            <li> It is a leave in conditioner that comes out in a light spray.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> And two days later it was still great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It helps against the frizz, makes it smooth and</li>
            <li> The bottle is smooth and slippery.  </li>
            <li> , it is such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> But being the cheap skate I am...</li>
            <li> Great to use prior to drying or ironing.</li>
            <li> PERHAPS I need the Light version of this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for de tangling and extra conditioning</li>
            <li> I spray it lightly all over after washing and towel drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks smooth, silky, and shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, this product is not paraben free and that alone is a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get greasy if you spray into hand and smooth into ends instead of spraying where it can get to the scalp.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling smooth and knot free after the shower.</li>
            <li> the last 10 oz bottle lasted close to a year, it&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally light brown</li>
            <li> When she ran out, I suggested we try to see if it was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and this keeps my hair looking silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product sprays on lightly and evenly.</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give it a GREAT rating is the price.  </li>
            <li> it may not make your hair frizzy free but it helped a bit with my frizzy hair..</li>
            <li> You can also spritz to smooth out dry/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I knew that it made my hair feel fantastic, but when my stylist gave me praise for blow-drying my hair</li>
            <li> Great for extra conditioning without weighing done.</li>
            <li> In Product is truely a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I primarily use it for detangling and defrizzing.</li>
            <li> Tangle free, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> The leave in conditioner leaves my hair silky and smooth, but NOT greasy.</li>
            <li> Smooth?</li>
            <li> Why pick an odor I enjoy, when I can get the free, revolting, side-effect of my-leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is virtually wrinkle free.</li>
            <li> the meantime, I&#x27;ve been using it religiously, playing with the amount each time,while trying (hoping - with fingers crossed) that my results will be as good as so many are saying.</li>
            <li> It really does all the things it claims to do - it&#x27;s a great detangler, makes my hair much softer</li>
            <li> I am sure a regular cream rinse would be just as good</li>
            <li> But after using this product, even my hairstylist-friend commented on how soft my hair still was and how good of a shape it was in (read: no split</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and smell good</li>
            <li> Have always loved \\&quot;it&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; and while it&#x27;s not the cheapest it is definitely worth the price for how much you get and what the product does.</li>
            <li> It makes brushing long hair easy and gives my hair a great scent.</li>
            <li> My hair is also super fine which adds to how easily it gets tangled.</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve used, it coats hair evenly without leaving it feeling stiff or oily.</li>
            <li> nasty!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used It&#x27;s a 10 with keratine before, that one is awesome, but now i didn&#x27;t want to tame my waves</li>
            <li> Very Dissapointed!!!  </li>
            <li> Not the real thing!!!</li>
            <li> Very powerful leave on conditioner.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law  uses this product on my grandchildren&#x27;s hair--the smell was very fresh and enticing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive in stores, so I was happy to find this great deal online!</li>
            <li> Product is fine, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have started buying \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; for my extended family when I need a quick and easy gift.</li>
            <li> It does make my hair feel nice and soft and has a pleasant smell, but doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate frizz</li>
            <li> I have accumulated a closet full of hair products for my problem hair which is fine, brittle, thinning,  and often frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I think this is perfect, love the results of my hair, less frizzy and so much cheaper than in the salons.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to use-</li>
            <li> My new hairdresser commented on how healthy my hair is, despite applying color every 6-8 weeks!</li>
            <li> Also the scent is not unpleasant but too strong for my liking--once the product is on my hair</li>
            <li> Its definately worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love this so much!</li>
            <li> bottle because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work and because it&#x27;s pretty costly.</li>
            <li> I was a bit taken aback by the price, but it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the pricier side, but so worth it!</li>
            <li> Many thanks!</li>
            <li> - it is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> It quickly removes tangles and does not add weight to fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product that has been able to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> Great product for long hair.  </li>
            <li> That was totally worth the price of admission!</li>
            <li> but you already know that when you buy it :) but yes it works ;)</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> More sheen and just looks more overall healthy.</li>
            <li> so now I buy it fir me the first time i fell in love with it</li>
            <li> still, it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I had to stop her and let her know that I was pretty sure it was the</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so worth it, just like this product!</li>
            <li> I am interested on testing out more products from this maker.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this from my hair dresser and paid like $25 for the 4oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> I had originally bought this stuff from Bloom.com, but they stopped carrying it for some reason.</li>
            <li> Try even a small bottle of this and you will be hooked on how awesome your hair looks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are great for your hair, really makes it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product the first day i used it.</li>
            <li> , my hair is very fine and this works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy that I was able to get it on Amazon for a little over $21.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to invest in their hair to keep it looking good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my hair and this size bottles lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel revived... kind of like the new hair cut feeling.</li>
            <li> I has a clean smell not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry or so so hair.  </li>
            <li> It was fortunate to find this larger size and at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled that Amazon offered this product for about $20...and for such a huge bottle too!  </li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of different ones &amp; for colored hair this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Turns morning brushing sessions that used to end in tears into easy, fun, mother-daughter time.  </li>
            <li> awesome stuff, especially if you have any natural curl.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It is okay, but not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> Smells so nice and leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair so soft and healthy!  </li>
            <li> You can comb your hair right after use easily.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the smallest size because of the price, I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money in something I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> This product is really the only product i have ever truly loved!</li>
            <li> It did not do anything special for my hair and has a chemical smell in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The large bottle is cheaper thru Amazon, and I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Im glad I decided to jump out there and try it even after having a certain amount of skepticism after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> I could certainly see a difference in my hair when I wasn&#x27;t able to use this product for that time.</li>
            <li> If you have very dry hair or treated hair, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have bleached hair and it looks so silky smooth thanks to this product!!</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the combination of it&#x27;s a 10, Chi straightening product &amp; biotin has made my hair look more than halfway decent.  </li>
            <li> This stuff was fabulous and gave my fine, thin hair excellent volume while maintaining softness.</li>
            <li> First thing I discovered: don&#x27;t use more than a light spritz per section of hair, unless you enjoy the sound and smell of moisture steaming off your hair at high temperatures.</li>
            <li> I really makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> this is my absolute favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> I moved from the desert to a cool humid climate.</li>
            <li> and after I tell people what it is they always go and get it and love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> It would be a sweet relief, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now my beauty salson carries a full line of</li>
            <li> My comb and brush were full of hair every time I used them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 four stars, whereas I gave BB the full five.  </li>
            <li> This will last me for a good while</li>
            <li> I got this product a month ago,, and I love it,so much.</li>
            <li> I am convinced this is not the &#x27;true&#x27;</li>
            <li> Love it product and it&#x27;s much cheaper here than in stores.</li>
            <li> however I spritz a good amount and brushed it thorugh my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it mostly for a detangler because I have very knotty hair.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this, as the price is so much more reasonable than through my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I love this so much.</li>
            <li> i love these stuff so much.</li>
            <li> The best hair product fro my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Let me say I have very damaged hair and have tried MANY products and have found any I could rate 5 stars</li>
            <li> I use it daily to keep my hair in good condition.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> will last me a good three months or so.</li>
            <li> (my cuboards are full of hair products that I have discarded because they just dont cut it)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle and when my wife tried it, she loved it, so I bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very managable, shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> This product truely is a miracle.  </li>
            <li> just so I know I can use every last drop, but the spray works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> love this product, fast service</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product because of how good it smells.</li>
            <li> but this product makes my hair look better than my straight hair.</li>
            <li> Everyone who I know try it, loved it and can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> love this product really does help the breakage of hair .</li>
            <li> you guys just go to the hair salon and buy a real one its much better</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it really seems to control the fizziness of my hair even on those humid days.  </li>
            <li> The results were so great on her hair that I began using it on my own and after a few uses, it really does look healthier.  </li>
            <li> I know this product works well for many people, but it didn&#x27;t fulfill my hair need--moisturizing and styling by blow drying to straight hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I use a rinse-out conditioner by Joico, and I just make sure it&#x27;s rinsed really well, so</li>
            <li> In addition to being an awesome detangler, I find that my hair is less greasy after 2 days and much softer.  </li>
            <li> I am very tender headed and this product makes my hair, smooth, sleek, and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this to any person who blow dries a lot, shampoos a lot and or just wants tangle free hair.</li>
            <li> Most notably, the ends of my hair, healthy or not, inherently spread out from each other so my hair always expands as it falls -</li>
            <li> However, my stylist said that products such as these should always be purchased at a salon since many online distributors dilute the original product to sell more.</li>
            <li> Does pretty much what it says on the bottle and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair which is great!</li>
            <li> I wanna say that is pretty strong when you aren&#x27;t using anything else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling smooth, soft, sleek, and very light.</li>
            <li> Surely it must be good for some people since it has such a high rating.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> The ordering experience was great, came quickly, absolutely no complaints!</li>
            <li> amazed with this product and so happy I listened to the other reviews on here.</li>
            <li> Great price on Amazon compared to other stores.</li>
            <li> My aunt gave me a tester bottle of this after she said it made her fair too flat, so I sprayed some in after a shower</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little pricey but is the best leave in conditioner out there as it does so much.</li>
            <li> ever!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair very soft and easy tho brush!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair softer and more manageable - can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> But, it wasn&#x27;t just the look or the appearance of the hair that sold me, my hair actually FELT like it was healthy, gorgeous new hair.</li>
            <li> I had more than 10 strangers comment on how pretty my hair was that first day im not joking.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and there was no problems.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel greasy until after the 3 day of not washing my hair, I wanted to know how quickly my hair would be greasy and it made it to day 3.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male, in my 60&#x27;s, with more gray hair than brown (now) and this product makes the hair more manageable and cleaner looking.</li>
            <li> Stuff has to get cheaper---GREAT PRODUCT, but, we go through it quickly--</li>
            <li> After a shower, I spray this product through my hair and it feels smooth, soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Compared to drugstore leave-in conditioners such as pantene, this one really does a great job.</li>
            <li> do shop at Amazon for it solely to find super savers shipping savings</li>
            <li> Luckily I didn&#x27;t pay for it.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my niece to quickly untangle her hair.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I have color put on my hair and have had to have more of a process done as I get older.  </li>
            <li> I used to do things to cover up the static, but this seems to be an actual cure for static.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been super knotted when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Since I use this product my hair is thicker, more manageable and more importantly repaired the dry ends.</li>
            <li> but I still only used about 4 or 5 sprays and Instantly it smelled wonderful.</li>
            <li> I received the shipment well-packaged and quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!!!!</li>
            <li> :) I would highly recommend this leave in conditioner...</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it for everyone :)</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t splurge on hair care products for myself, but when my sister in law gave me hers to sample, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> The hair is easy to comb even when it is dry, is strong and it looks healthy.</li>
            <li> First I cried, then I went and bought some Oops Color Remover (which is fantastic and a life saver, by the way).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my color treated hair feel healthy and normal.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair detangled instantly, smells great, leaves hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t silky smooth like the first bottle I purchased.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m not the kind of person to buy hair products or pricey personal care items, but this stuff is worth it!</li>
            <li> My hair can go curly, wild on the top layers and this product helps significantly.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that this doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great product and wil continue to use but hope the price goes down.</li>
            <li> Seriously, a life-saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not find a better price for this product!!!</li>
            <li> It was originally suggested to me by my hair dresser, what a smart man he is!</li>
            <li> To name just a few:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene shampoo and conditioner are great, but their mouse created static in my hair and left a weird residue.&lt;br /&gt;Matrix made a really great leave-in called sleek look</li>
            <li> Love it, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> It detangled my relaxed hair and my new growth better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and do not plan on trying anything new anytime soon.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair and this stuff helps with frizz at the ends, and makes my hair smell nice and super shiny!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 smells great and this stuff stunk like a previous bottled conditioner I tried.</li>
            <li> makes my hair much less frizzy and smells great.  </li>
            <li> Great product - much less than what I would pay buying it at the salon.</li>
            <li> After my hair dries it always smells fresh and leaves a clean look which is important because no one wants to look like they have product or residue in their hair.</li>
            <li> I had to stop and check to make sure that my hair was really my hair when I first put this product on and finished blow drying.</li>
            <li> I have not had such soft and beautiful hair since I was a child.</li>
            <li> But as far as true conditioning goes, BB is a much better product because it&#x27;s not laden with coating silicone</li>
            <li> My stylist suggested It&#x27;s a 10 and after the first day I really fell in love.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product as my hair was so dry and based on the reviews on amazon, thought it would be a good chance for it to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does an outstanding job de-tangling my hair and leaves it very soft.  </li>
            <li> a 10 leaves my damaged breaking crunchy, dry, over-bleached hair into silky, soft, strong beautiful hair after the first use.</li>
            <li> This spray does a great job by itself but it also tolerates additional moisturizing leave-in products without making a sticky or flaky mess.</li>
            <li> Bigger is better!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because of the price, but I am telling you, completely worth it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will keep buying it and come here first!</li>
            <li> i have very curly frizzy hair and so far in my 26 years i have found one that works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to make their hair 100x better!</li>
            <li> This is my first ever Amazon review and it is well deserved!</li>
            <li> IT REALLY IS A MIRACLE PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> Works great for de-tangling my extra long hair...but its not my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!!</li>
            <li> We will be back for more!</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased this product was in a salon for about $15 for the 4 oz bottle!</li>
            <li> Not only do O love this product, but my husband loves it too!</li>
            <li> this stuff does the job, and really is a 10!!  </li>
            <li> Always Makes my hair more manageable and soft!</li>
            <li> Yes, I could actually buy my favorite, and use it instead!</li>
            <li> Super cheap and arrived extremely fast</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It really is a miracle on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll curl back up when I wash it, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I have a thick hair that&#x27;s fine in texture</li>
            <li> my hair was shiny, smooth, vibrant and full of life.</li>
            <li> My mom is a beautician and I have tried a lot of very high end products to try to make my hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap chemical ingredient that is VERY harmful to us.</li>
            <li> This product works great with my hair, but I prefer to rinse it out after it has been on my hair a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This product, when purchased from an authorized retailer is amazing (I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year religiously).  </li>
            <li> They both rave how this product makes their hair straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this only three times and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy in any way, it is light and you can apply as much as you want.</li>
            <li> , however It&#x27;s a 10 keeps my hair shiny, silky, and fade free much longer.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky, soft, and smooth!</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product...</li>
            <li> i put it on my hair after i get out of the shower and it leaves hair feeling so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> All in all, worth every cent.</li>
            <li> My end look healthy and my hair is soft and silky.</li>
            <li> but it just isn&#x27;t worth the price</li>
            <li> Also nice to have one product for detangling, heat protectant, and extra conditioning.</li>
            <li> its a 10 products are worth every penny</li>
            <li> My hair transformed back to its old self- soft, maneable and just wonderful.  </li>
            <li> but it smells nice and did help my style to last through the summer heat and humidity.  </li>
            <li> So I consider the experiment a success.  </li>
            <li> Plus BB has a blend of beneficial oils that make my hair naturally shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> Worth the $$</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> It makes my curly frizzy hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> and I was thrilled to save $14 on the big bottle!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great, and makes your hair SO SOFT, but am I the only one who can&#x27;t stand the smell of it?  </li>
            <li> worth</li>
            <li> I love this in my 8 yr old daughters hair, it  gets out tangles with ease.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Yeah if you put your nose directly into it sure, but on my hair</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Product&amp;#34; leaves hair soft and moisturized, great for use when hair is regularly dyed.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny</li>
            <li> But suddenly today, the 4th try,  my hair is fabulous and looks so healthy</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> I can not really say enough and it smells wonderful too.  </li>
            <li> It is a pricy product but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love it works awesome especially if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so much more manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> But over all its worth the money</li>
            <li> this is well worth the price for the product.</li>
            <li> I have hair with a mind of its own and somehow this is the only leave in that tames it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend products often but felt this is well worth the mention.</li>
            <li> Is hay-like hair worth saving a couple of bucks?  </li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It does have parabens, which I don&#x27;t like, but I justify it as ok since it doesn&#x27;t go directly on her skin where it&#x27;s absorbed, just on the length of her hair.</li>
            <li> I am not a product junkie and rarely use hair products.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good product, to help me out with my frizzy hair, to define my curls, and to leave my hair soft, my hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li> my hair was soft and I thought it was going to be the top 10 miracle for my curls,</li>
            <li> and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Hope you have the success we&#x27;ve had with</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth looking into for tangled hair.</li>
            <li> I am once again receiving so many compliments on my curls, just as I did through my early 20s.</li>
            <li> So far I have not found anything better.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I do believe it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> and it is COMPLETELY worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts almost all year and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The online bottle made my hair feel kind of sticky and it didn&#x27;t smell the same.</li>
            <li> I love it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and love how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li> The money is worth it.</li>
            <li> This price you pay for this stuff is really worth it.</li>
            <li> I tried thousands of dollars worth of leave-ins and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Its pricey, but its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I rarely use it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair so it helps with detangling after the shower and keeps hair healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of person who always has to have their hair a different color.</li>
            <li> Completely worth the price.</li>
            <li> The other great thing is buying this product on Amazon is so much cheaper than getting it at a store.</li>
            <li> Leaves no dandruff like some other leave-in conditioners despite me using it daily, so I&#x27;m really happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other protectants/leave-ins, and It&#x27;s a 10 is 100% my favorite.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair knots up pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> [--Type of hair: Wavy, and lots of it (lol), but abused by an old/rough dye job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Weather: Hot &amp; humid (Puerto Rico)]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that makes my hair absolutely smooth, except extra virgin olive oil...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure whether this product just had a whole lot of hype or if it was actually true to all the claims until I had enough points to get if free with my Ulta Rewards.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it well enough to change my regimen, but it&#x27;s always a good thing to have a decent product on stand-by.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like it, but it really is great after using it a little while.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great deal, makes hair really smooth and soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I read the product description, read the reviews, thought \\&quot;Yeah, right, but these people don&#x27;t have hair like mine.</li>
            <li> If I was going to experiment with this stuff, I was going to do it right.</li>
            <li> Moment of truth, right?</li>
            <li> In fact, I once broke the handle right off my brush attempting to.  </li>
            <li> I knew this was not the right product in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Delivered right on time also.</li>
            <li> It pulled the tangles right out.</li>
            <li> and i can brush right through my hair.  </li>
            <li> in right before my roller set.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get used to the right use for my hair, but once I did.....</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll feel the difference right away.</li>
            <li> and it always makes it feel softer right after spraying it on.  </li>
            <li> Right when this product arrived at my front door, I ripped away the packaging and started spraying.</li>
            <li> But hey, I guess they&#x27;re right after all.</li>
            <li> Tangles comb right out.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product - can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly and was brand new as advertised.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair pretty frizz free, straight or curly.</li>
            <li> But I have to say I am thrilled I did, exact same salon quality product at a fraction of the price...</li>
            <li> I know it is kind of pricey, but a 4oz bottle will last you months, if not the whole year!</li>
            <li> only Wella enables a nice crisp curl with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> You spritz a little on after the shower and you can comb right through it which is just amazing because my daughters hair tangles so easy.  </li>
            <li> I like it because instantly untangles my hair and makes it very easy to get the comb through it.</li>
            <li> When I use this along with the Miracle rinse out conditioner, my hair combs out easily and is very soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It worked great for my hair (lots of wiry gray) and really cuts down on the time it takes to flat-iron it.</li>
            <li> This little gem is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> My fine straight hair is hard to comb out after its washed and this product is a great detangler.</li>
            <li> It is REALLY hard to get a good grip around the rather large top of the bottle so that you can spray with ease.</li>
            <li> From salon high end products to cheap drugstore products.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to work with and is not heavy on the hair!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I bought this to use with my new Karmin straightener and use this after straightening my hair, it really helps reduce any frizz.</li>
            <li> Because of all the hype I really thought this would be a special product.</li>
            <li> Detangles hair quickly and leaves it soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> It does a great job keeping my hair moisturized and soft in the dry Arizona climate.</li>
            <li> However, when I blow dry my hair with this product in it, it does come out much more smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair super easy to brush and helps it dry light and shiny.</li>
            <li> Its an amazing product that lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually frizzy but now it just smells and looks great.</li>
            <li> After we returned home, I received a text from her that she missed the leave-in so much she went to her nearest hair salon and purchased a bottle for full price because she just had to have</li>
            <li> It has restored it and has made it thick and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> and WOW I have beautiful curls again without a curling iron or any other product.  </li>
            <li> It smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily or weighed down.</li>
            <li> So good at detangling without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> If you have colored hair that is coarse and tangles easily, this is the product for you!  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find this to a strong smell (no stronger than any other hair product I use), and I&#x27;d describe it more of a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell than flowery.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put it in dry hair, but it is the best thing ever for wet hair!</li>
            <li> That should have been my first clue right there...</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years now and Amazon is the only place for the best price!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy, but not the nice soft wavy you see on lots of girls.</li>
            <li> Its a 10&#x27; will leave my hair easy to comb, soft, silky,</li>
            <li> This was a great deal, and it&#x27;s a big bottle, so it will last for a while.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and I have straight thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Also worked very well as a quick conditioner after her swimming class at school, when she didn&#x27;t have time to wash the chlorine out.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect for color treated hair, \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; detangles, repairs and adds protection for all those harsh styling processes that we put our hair through on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that tends to frizz easily and this spray is pretty much the only thing that helps calm it.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and easy comb out</li>
            <li> I have so many partially used products lingering in my bathroom closet, but now, I can get rid of ALL of them to fight the frizz and smooth my hair once and for all.</li>
            <li> hair soft and easy to manage.will continue you to use it.</li>
            <li> Easy to brush my hair through, and it leaves my hair soft and shiny all day.</li>
            <li> This leave in is as good as my Aussie leave in hair insurance conditioner which costs less than $4.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and shiny &amp; easy to maintain and style.</li>
            <li> My product came very early as well which is fantastic.</li>
            <li> When we are nearing the bottom of the container and running low on product, she is the one that insists I order some more right away</li>
            <li> I combed it through my curls and was pretty surprised at how easily the comb went through, like the spray changed my hair type and texture immediately.</li>
            <li> It also helps very much to detangle.</li>
            <li> I received this very fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use very much...</li>
            <li> not heavy for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, and leaves my hair so soft and takes the frizz right out without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair often, so my hair is very dry on its own, even after using conditioner..</li>
            <li> Good product, a little pricey though</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth now and I can blow dry it very quickly.</li>
            <li> put it on after washing my hair and it makes a HUGE difference once my hair naturally dries and humidity</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it - gives you hair such a smooth soft feeling without any greasiness or residue.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is a  miracle!</li>
            <li> So instead of bleeding money we picked up this larger bottle for a much better price than in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Now that my hair has &amp;#34;matured&amp;#34; pool water frizzes it even more than when I was younger.</li>
            <li> my hair feels so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it also works to protect your hair from the damage from heated styling tools!</li>
            <li> As soon as I used the first pump of the spray onto my hands, I felt an immediate difference.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what the bottle says.</li>
            <li> first purchased the 4 oz.</li>
            <li> It also conditioned my hair well enough that it looks incredibly healthy even after all of the summer damage.</li>
            <li> I also love that you can use your regular products if you wish</li>
            <li> item as described, fast shipping, thank you!</li>
            <li> It leaves it soft, smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> Will buy more in future.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this Leave-In product every time I shower, more like every third time.  </li>
            <li> This product is better than i can possibly put into words.</li>
            <li> lifeless if you spray it higher but just on the ends</li>
            <li> It came exactly as I ordered it, and fast too!  </li>
            <li> This product works exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> all worked pretty well</li>
            <li> After the first pump I sprayed on my hair</li>
            <li> So maybe the next time around something more practical can be designed.</li>
            <li> at store same price works okay</li>
            <li> First, I can&#x27;t comb or brush your hair after it&#x27;s on because it just gets sticky and non-shiny.</li>
            <li> fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> so I just spray one at the top, one spray at the middle and ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> If you are shampooing more often, this thinning out of the mixture will probably not be necessary.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever re-bought the same product so many times before.</li>
            <li> I scaled back on the amount I was spraying in and had much better results, but it&#x27;s still not a miracle product.</li>
            <li> And the best part is that one small bottle like this will last almost a year!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this to many friends and everyone loves it and uses it regularly.</li>
            <li> This was my first attempt at using It&#x27;s a 10.</li>
            <li> I will order more when my current is finished.</li>
            <li> My kid&#x27;s hair is exactly like mine.</li>
            <li> The first day I tried it myself</li>
            <li> While It&#x27;s a 10 isn&#x27;t the cheapest it is definitely worth the expense for any woman that wants to take care of her hair.</li>
            <li> It definitely does a better job at detangleing my hair than the infusium spray.</li>
            <li> My hair stays soft and tangle free.  </li>
            <li> It is very helpful in this humidity and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product - I use it daily for over 5 years now.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and have thrown most of my others out.</li>
            <li> First introduced to me by my hairstylist</li>
            <li> It is really work!</li>
            <li> LOVE it, cannot say enough!</li>
            <li> but when I found it online and at a much reduced price, I was all in!  </li>
            <li> I totally fell in love.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser first told me about this product</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff... Not tampered!</li>
            <li> I have tried many but this is the only one that works for us.  </li>
            <li> Received the product and it was the exact item</li>
            <li> This is a much better value than you will find it the larger stores.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t change the essential nature of my hair, but it just makes it WAY more manageable.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair so much softer and manageable!</li>
            <li> Has left my hair soo healthy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Even after the first use, I have noticed a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my short hair.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Love How My Hair Feels At The End Of My Daily Hair Care Routine</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product when it first came out</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had the first bottle for 7-8 months, using it 3-4 times a week and 7-10 pumps each time.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it that first time I used it how smooth and soft my hair was.</li>
            <li> but I do feel like it works as a heat protectant pretty well.</li>
            <li> It is rather expensive, but Amazon seems to have some of the best prices on it.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of the frizz &amp; protects your hair from hot styling tools.</li>
            <li> Hear some many glowing reviews of this product, I finally thought I give it a try.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair shiney, smooth, and natural.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because it has proven to be the only leave in conditioner that doesnt leave my hair greasy or under conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes my bleached and brittle hair soft, smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Been using It&#x27;s A Ten for two years, my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I need</li>
            <li> First just let me start off by saying, I have never reviewed a product before.</li>
            <li> Would absolutely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair silky soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> It really is a 10 for hair!  </li>
            <li> I first saw it at my salon 3-years ago.  </li>
            <li> My sister-in-law will be getting a bottle for her birthday as part of her present for sure</li>
            <li> Well, we&#x27;re now both avid users.</li>
            <li> it really prevents them form breakage!</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My hair is currently as long and healthy as it has ever been, and that is worth the price to me.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely order more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> , much cheaper then in any store I have seen!</li>
            <li> First off I have used Biolage&#x27;s hair milk leave in for 8 years..</li>
            <li> The big bottle can be used for more than a year.</li>
            <li> I bought this leave in treatment recently to make my hair more managable during the winter.</li>
            <li> It really does do 10 things!  </li>
            <li> When I blowdry it leaves my hair soft and freeze free.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Great for short or long hair.</li>
            <li> You see results after the first use....</li>
            <li> I have done so much damage to my hair and this has been my hairs life saviour!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I hesitated to pay this much, but it has been worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> This  product REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft, shiny, manageable, smooth, healthier, helps w/ tangles/knots, etc..</li>
            <li> Plus, the bottle is pretty, so I don&#x27;t mind leaving it out on my vanity.</li>
            <li> Personally I like this better than the one with Keratin.</li>
            <li> I love this product this was going to be my second bottle</li>
            <li> After the first use, I noticed her hair looked and felt a bit softer but</li>
            <li> (plus side was that I saved by being able to get this in a larger quality then drug stores sell)</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well-it truly lives up to its name!</li>
            <li> I first discovered this product when getting my hair cut and the stylist used it on my hair before drying and I&#x27;ve used nothing else since.  </li>
            <li> Amazon prices are better than stores such as Ulta, even w/ a coupon.</li>
            <li> Just a few spritzes is all it takes, which is a good thing when you have two daughters who use it too.</li>
            <li> additionally, I just had heavy highlights done and my hair took a bit of a hit damage wise.....</li>
            <li> It smells good plus it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down too much.</li>
            <li> have used this product solo as a styling product (coat hair while slightly damp after a shower), as well as applying a light amount to damp hair before putting in a different product on top that will give my hair more of a style and hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow I&#x27;m a guy and never have I used a leave-in conditioner that does EXACTLY what it says it does!!</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS SUPER SOFT AND SHINY NOW!!</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and this price is UNBEATABLE!!</li>
            <li> Amazon was the obvious choice for searching and luckily it was available.</li>
            <li> Whether this product does the job for me or not remains to be seen, as I&#x27;ve had other issues with my hair and cannot judge it fairly until a normal baseline is again established.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to be able to run my fingers through my hair and just feel soft, clean hair without any gross product feel.</li>
            <li> As soon as I moved my very straight hair is only mostly straight, and there are many flyaways</li>
            <li> Having dried it straight today it looks pretty good</li>
            <li> It worked well for me on a flat top haircut.  </li>
            <li> okay not literally- pretty close though, and as much as they possibly could be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light as long you don&#x27;t overdo it.</li>
            <li> Luckily my hairstylist recognized my knot problem and said she had this new stuff called</li>
            <li> I have horribly dry hair, and it works to moisturize it the best of any product I have ever tried (and there have been dozens, some much more expensive).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for over 3 years and swear by it.&lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic ,and works magic for my thin stringy easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested it multiple times to make sure it really was this product, and it is.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the next morning I use a hair oil, as well, although it&#x27;s not strictly necessary as this product does quite a good job of conditioning.  </li>
            <li> Sad, I read the wonderful reviews &amp; really wanted it to work for me.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that tangles, but also gets weighed down easily.</li>
            <li> Not amazingly better than any of the other dozens I&#x27;ve tried, but a good one with a nice scent.</li>
            <li> and then a large tooth comb slides right through my otherwise very fine, very dry, very tangled hair.</li>
            <li> I live in south fla in a very hot, humid climate.</li>
            <li> WORTH THE HIGH PRICE.</li>
            <li> Her hair is curly and very dry but with the right products can be managed pretty easily and has the type of curls that turn into pretty ringlets as hair dries.</li>
            <li> Besides how it smells, which is great, it works really well in your hair leaving it soft and helping w/ dead ends.  </li>
            <li> Absolute must have and highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> When I found them on amazon for so much cheaper at first I was hesitant to order.</li>
            <li> The 2 oz is perfect for traveling, the 4 oz is my everyday, and this 10 oz is my refill for the other two.</li>
            <li> My hair looks really straight and pretty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a nice product, but definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Nice, not powerful scent.  </li>
            <li> my hair is soft, shiny, and full of body.  </li>
            <li> Even when air drying my hair - it&#x27;s amazingly soft, full of shine, and \\&quot;touchable.\\</li>
            <li> the smaller bottle I purchased at Ulta seemed to feel different in my hair even though they are the same product, I liked that one better.</li>
            <li> Love this product fory long hair!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a little more than 5 years and swear by it!</li>
            <li> It lasts for a very long time for many uses.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and i am always looking for something to keep it looking healthy.</li>
            <li> This stuff cuts the brushing time in half, its amazing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li> It is a life saver for the winter months when you don&#x27;t want to have dry, static hair.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the \\&quot;lite\\&quot; version yet because I assume it will be less effective (but</li>
            <li> I let it air dry most of the time.</li>
            <li> Detangles quickly and leaves soft shiny hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is still kind of frizzy after using it however, it is much less frizzy.</li>
            <li> so I run out of smoothing creams and such, very quickly.</li>
            <li> Im mixed and have wavy hair  and use a very mild relaxer on it every 5-6 months or so just to try to control my frizzes.</li>
            <li> I have been using its a 10 for years and the bottle I got makes my hair even more dry and brittle and frizzy?</li>
            <li> I found that this made my hair MORE DRY and sticky.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair red which fades easily,.</li>
            <li> So, when I wash, it&#x27;s a whole lotta tangles and without a really good detangler, I am in trouble!</li>
            <li> Just For Me conditioning sprays (too oily and not enough friz control); Hawaiian 12 something-or-other (left crunch and little friz control), Mixed chicks (shampoos mostly, but didn&#x27;t help with dryness at all); Loo Poo or No Poo (shampoos mostly but also didn&#x27;t help with conditioning or dryness for hyper curly girls; store stuff (good de-tanglers, but no friz control for curly girls).  </li>
            <li> It tames the frizz, makes my hair super soft, creates that light &amp; bouncy curl definition and super cute ringlets, without weighing it down and leaving an oily residue the next morning.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping it would be a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; and make my hair smooth and straight with no other work needed.  </li>
            <li> Awesome product, does not weigh down my hair or make it appear greasy or limp</li>
            <li> This stuff is pure miracle in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> but it certainly doesn&#x27;t eliminate it.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> It certainly wasn&#x27;t a miracle for me.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> price is pretty reasonable since it does so much, also you don&#x27;t need much with each use so it lasts for awhile.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday and love it!</li>
            <li> The same is true of the deep treatment which is also phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but finding the right amount to put in your hair is critical.</li>
            <li> Great product on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; is such a great product for your hair, it protects against heat and makes your hair less frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair is a light brown color that can easily look drab and limp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big \\&quot;review writer\\&quot;...unless I really feel strongly about something.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s drier than the Sahara and pretty lackluster, using this for 2 weeks, my hair has bounce, shine and my highlights look brand new!</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended and shipping was very fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll last me long enough for my kids to learn to comb through their own hair. :)</li>
            <li> She has very fine blond hair and other conditioners</li>
            <li> One has fine and one has coarse.  </li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and has mad my hair so much softer!</li>
            <li> Especially, if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on and off (mostly on) for about 6 months now, and I notice a drastic difference from wash to wash when I use these products as opposed to when I use other brands - even for brands that one might consider higher end.  </li>
            <li> Especially if you have baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair are so fragile and fine.</li>
            <li> if i wash, put it in my  hair, and leave it to air dry, it turns into beauitiful, lush, gorgeous soft shiny curly hair.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner has a very high viscosity.</li>
            <li> Certainly makes controlling my curly hair much easier.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and flat, oily on the top, dry on the bottom, has split ends and is over-processed because of coloring.</li>
            <li> She has super long hair with super curly hair.</li>
            <li> so it gets weighed down very easily).</li>
            <li> This in conjunction with the Macadamia Oil hair mask has really made such a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference from when I use this product and when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using too much of the product though, or it&#x27;ll leave your hair feeling sticky for awhile.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is a 10.</li>
            <li> Not only does this smell fantastic but it moisturize my hair</li>
            <li> After using for about a week I noticed that it felt too much like water in my hand.</li>
            <li> It really protects my hair.</li>
            <li> Really Like This Product,</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> So I purchased it from the salon and used the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to see people very often.</li>
            <li> I decided to order the repair mask (&#x27;cause really, I needed it after months of neglect since I gave up on my hair), the shampoo, and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair now</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s staying that way, and I think I&#x27;ll be spending way too much money on this stuff, but it&#x27;s still cheaper than thrice-weekly salon visits.    </li>
            <li> There is a bit of a waxy residue when I run my fingers through it, and I don&#x27;t really like the feel of that,</li>
            <li> I am wondering if the reviews are real or fictitious advertising after using this product.  </li>
            <li> An absolute miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I got the product fast</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> bottle without caring at all about the price because this absolutely works.</li>
            <li> I have really frizzy,</li>
            <li> born with real curly hair -</li>
            <li> I have really bleached hair from the summer sun and chlorine.</li>
            <li> I just keep sneezing that I can&#x27;t use it as often or as much as I want to.</li>
            <li> , u use too much water</li>
            <li> My overly highlighted hair really appreciates having this treatment after each shower.</li>
            <li> very conditioning.</li>
            <li> In Product\\&quot; my hair was brittle on the ends, so much so that it would break off when I flat-ironed it.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that is prone to drying out</li>
            <li> ; I don&#x27;t really see any benefit or difference between the two.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff and much cheaper than the drugstore.</li>
            <li> It must be really protecting it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the much cheaper Frizz-Ease products from now on.</li>
            <li> The one I bought at the salon made my hair much softer and silker.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> so it feels much softer, but makes it easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle!</li>
            <li> I am picky with hair products because I really don&#x27;t like greasy hair or that yucky feeling that some products leave.</li>
            <li> My curls were very frizzy when I used this product.</li>
            <li> TOO MUCH</li>
            <li> Plus, it works like magic on wet hair.</li>
            <li> thanks...</li>
            <li> really think that this product was to blame for all of the hair damage, and I&#x27;m scared to try it again.</li>
            <li> so thank you much</li>
            <li> It does very well at detangling my hair.</li>
            <li> not something I would rave about, as I am very picky.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, course hair,and could use this wearing it natural,straight, or curled.</li>
            <li> Thanks to my hairdresser</li>
            <li> since I used it so much.  </li>
            <li> I noticed when I do not use it my hair feels more rough than I would care to admit.</li>
            <li> Its a 10 product is really a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product highly!  </li>
            <li> The product shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It really is a miracle.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is light and works well on mixed hair.  </li>
            <li> tends to get oily with too much product.</li>
            <li> Hair is very well moisturizers and frizz</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much for product.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast as well received in two days...</li>
            <li> I could not go without this stuff now that I have been using it; I think I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year, and its so much cheaper on amazon than in the stores.</li>
            <li> Did not try to spray on my hair thinking that it may be too much.</li>
            <li> which can really do a number on it.</li>
            <li> I just got a relaxer two weeks ago, so my hair is still relatively straight.  </li>
            <li> I have very damaged hair from heat and highliting.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper here than in the mainstream grocery stores and pharmacies.</li>
            <li> No way would I pay that much.</li>
            <li> And the next morning, it was silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an absolute must.</li>
            <li> and it is so much easier to brush.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff--</li>
            <li> So it seemed to really do the job for a while</li>
            <li> but after a month it started to really stick to my hair and just got gunky.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> and this is the only de-tangler that genuinely works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can really feel a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this product too.</li>
            <li> This product really is a miracle for me.  </li>
            <li> Sprayed some in, and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really lightweight to the point where you can put as much as you want in your hair and it won&#x27;t get greasy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it also wasn&#x27;t doing much for my hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a product that left my hair smooth and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> and it feels much healthier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly: I have funky curly, wavy hair that blows smooth with relative ease.</li>
            <li> worked really well</li>
            <li> I just received this product last week and am very impressed after only using it a few times.  </li>
            <li> This is the product for you if you don&#x27;t have hours to get ready.</li>
            <li> I really like 10.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels so much softer after using this.</li>
            <li> It really makes all the difference in my hair care routine.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try this stuff and was really amazed at how it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper..</li>
            <li> This is the absolute lowest price I have found when shopping around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight yet very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> spray in and leave - makes combing after shampooing so much easier.</li>
            <li> I have tried before and absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> For me, this spray doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> and it makes getting ready for them easier in the am.</li>
            <li> A LOT, IT&#x27;S REALLY HELP</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve determined that this works better when using a minimal amount throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has been so much healthier and manageable since using It&#x27;s a 10.</li>
            <li> I truly recommend it if you are looking for something after shampoo that really works</li>
            <li> Was VERY damaged.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> so it very evenly distributes through the hair.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> It leave your hair smoother and dries it much quicker.</li>
            <li> the one time I did use too much.</li>
            <li> I feel like this stuff really is a miracle.</li>
            <li> price is a bit much and it did put me off.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really style it.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> My hair is much softer nowadays.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind.</li>
            <li> I know why I go through it so fast...</li>
            <li> A real plus.  </li>
            <li> it really is 10/10.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy, wavy hair</li>
            <li> This stuff really is a 10.  </li>
            <li> I have very color damaged hair and have been searching for a product to help counter that damage.</li>
            <li> The product was packaged very well</li>
            <li> Hair seem smoother but can&#x27;t really tell if is the humidity or the product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely this is a &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Whole family uses and loves this</li>
            <li> Even with wet hair, I&#x27;m able to run my fingers through my hair.  </li>
            <li> Got here fast</li>
            <li> and this really helps keep it silky.</li>
            <li> I have very thick/heavy hair</li>
            <li> This really helps keep my hair form getting frizzy.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think this is quite the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; I was expecting, but I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li> not *quite* as much as air drying with no product.  </li>
            <li> keratin really makes the difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> so I cant be of much help.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 really proved to me that you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Essential for great hair, especially for daily heat styling or blow drying.  </li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t use this product, it&#x27;s very noticeable when my hair dries.</li>
            <li> With the product on, my hair is sleek, straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Always softens but never makes it greasy unless I use way too much.</li>
            <li> very OCD about my hair...</li>
            <li> I have a very oily scalp, but cant wash my hair but every 4 days</li>
            <li> IT REALLY IS A 10...</li>
            <li> Spraying onto your hair is spotty, and uses way too much stuff.</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t take much to use so</li>
            <li> Smooth my hair instantly.</li>
            <li> It does not take much either.  </li>
            <li> I love to use this product on wet hair as a detangler before brushing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Also, this leave in product has a very fragrant scent which this one seems to be lacking.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist used this stuff on my hair, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really is a 10, and works 110%  </li>
            <li> but don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It really is a &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Thanks to a lot of conditioner</li>
            <li> I have really greasy hair and this stuff</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff really is a miracle.</li>
            <li> &quot; I also use is very sparingly after blow drying to give my hair added shine.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This spray helps me maintain my color very well.</li>
            <li> and it really does what it says.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped get it back to a soft healthy texture and shine.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF ESPECIALLY FOR MY 7 YRS OLD.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair less frizzy, more manageable, and super soft!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I had spent a lot of money on other products with great reviews (think upwards of $3,000), which just didn&#x27;t work for the problem I had with my hair breakage from bleach.</li>
            <li> Makes long hair so easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> It creates very manageable hair, preventing breakage,  making my hair look much better than any other product I have used (and I have used a lot).</li>
            <li> We ordered two of the smaller sized (I think 4 oz) - and one was good, but the other was a knock off.</li>
            <li> It is lasting quite a while, so it was well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I know with other products you are prob used to spraying your hair 10x or more but its not neccessary with this product.</li>
            <li> More Tangles or any other leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Will not be returning for this and will be more cautious with other purchases on this website.</li>
            <li> I remember exactly how soft my hair used to be and how shiny it is!  </li>
            <li> my sister that is.&lt;br /&gt;I also will use this other voluminous product in my roots and than this on the rest of my hair.. FANTASTIC RESULTS!</li>
            <li> it works better than any other curly hair product I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> It also is a better protection against humidity than any of the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other brands but none even come close to this product.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I straighten my hair with a flat iron, it protects and keeps my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> There was nothing about it that made it any better than every other product.</li>
            <li> just de tangles it along with many other things but does not make it any heavier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years as I&#x27;m the kind of woman who loves her snooze button too much which gives me very little time in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair that is fine and straight.</li>
            <li> I have very long very damaged fine hair.</li>
            <li> It barely does more than just regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have always had long, bone-straight, fine hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this same item in the past on Amazon and it was great.</li>
            <li> for me, it is one of the few products that can actually detangle my hair successfully, without my hair getting stuck in the comb or brush.</li>
            <li> Great product to due frizz and due tangle.  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair and this product</li>
            <li> I started using It&#x27;s A 10 a few years back, and it works AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Not only does this smell really good, but it provides the nourishment my hair needs without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be possible to top the &amp;#34;12 Benefits&amp;#34; leave in/detangling spray I tried recently, but this is at least as good.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to bother with a possible replacement if they couldn&#x27;t get it right in the first place.</li>
            <li> I love using this when I don&#x27;t want to style my hair and let it dry naturally as well.</li>
            <li> Has helped my dry, damaged hair feel soft and look healthy again.</li>
            <li> so I put it on a low heat setting to dry and to be honest</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing, I have super thin hair</li>
            <li> It also adds a little body to my very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair type is a little wavy, very fine hair.</li>
            <li> so I only need a small spray on the ends, gently massage it between my hands to distribute throughout the strands of hair before I dry it, and it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, fine hair</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine hair and this product</li>
            <li> Worth the money for a great product, lasts a few months with everyday use on medium/long</li>
            <li> Will continue to order and use this product as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li> Periodically I&#x27;ve been required to use pretty astringent shampoos to clear off all the build-up that they&#x27;ve caused as a result.</li>
            <li> Same is true showering after work at the gym;  I can go out to dinner  </li>
            <li> I now have lots of short hairs growing back in and sticking straight off the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 2 oz bottle from a popular pharmacy where I usually buy it cost $10 plus the tax.</li>
            <li> After trying at least 4 different leave-in detanglers I&#x27;ve finally found one that works beautifully!</li>
            <li> Every time I use it, which is usually after washing my hair, it effectively detangles, smoothes, softens, and moisturizes my hair.  </li>
            <li> the last time i cut my hair was probably 1/2 a year ago maybe a full year</li>
            <li> But after the 3rd use, I was truely amazed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product and I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily steer people away from it</li>
            <li> The product was not bad, but I went back to using BioSilk instead.  </li>
            <li> Unite is not a bad product, so I used it for a while, but as my bottle was running low</li>
            <li> It leaves a good smell and also my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weird, it gets a very soft texture, but like extremely clean, but not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I knew it would, but I was having too much trouble finding the right product to condition my hair and make it easy to comb out after the shower.  </li>
            <li> One thing I really love about it is it don&#x27;t weigh your hair down</li>
            <li> conditions my hair, keeps frizz down, and is heat safe.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I have new hair!  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li> I cannot live without it!</li>
            <li> and I wont live without it now!</li>
            <li> I am new to this product and it has done miracles for my hair!</li>
            <li> This product really does live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> It leaves a slight residue in my hair that makes it tangle much more throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and it is a light leave in conditioner that smooths dry hair.</li>
            <li> but I dont see more bounce, or less frizziness.</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to comb through my hair when wet and leaves my hair silky after drying.  </li>
            <li> Once dry, it feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I get it for half the price almost with no shipping charges on most</li>
            <li> Also, it cut my blow drying time in half and makes my hair smell fantastic!</li>
            <li> With this particular bottle I bought on Amazon</li>
            <li> Breakage has decreased significantly, soft hair, smells great</li>
            <li> No seriously, EVER.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and it has made my hair so soft, smooth, and manageable.</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair feel soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li> (Though, on a positive note...Amazon has the cheapest price anywhere by FAR.)</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I only sprayed a minimal amount and got fantastic results!  </li>
            <li> *then* apply to the hair as opposed to direct application to the hair, as it is thick and does not spread easily or spray as a fine mist.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel very soft and nourished!</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way and for something that I&#x27;ve seen such great results with, I&#x27;m willing to pay for it.  </li>
            <li> Love this makes my hair feel like silk without weighing hair down or making it look greasy like all the new oil scam products.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> For the price being as high as this was, I could&#x27;ve gone to Walgreens &amp;saved myself some money &amp;time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this company.  </li>
            <li> and I can rationalize the high price to myself.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly and it works as described.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Even in rain and high humidity.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe anyone would give this product a high review.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend IT&#x27;S A 10--LEAVE IT IN.</li>
            <li> I had really high expectations, though,</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The product is high quality and the customer service was as well.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest everybody try this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> All it does is make the product stink to high heaven.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use a gentle shampoo and avoid heat (hot water, direct sun, and hot hair appliances, especially).</li>
            <li> It works great on wet or dry hair when brushed through thoroughly.</li>
            <li> After bleaching my roots, my washed hair being wet, fine and porous</li>
            <li> and I love everything about it except the price is a little high for my wallet.</li>
            <li> It works really great for long hair, especially if you can put a liberal amount on, then braid it and let it dry or almost, when you take out the braid, it is soft and wavy.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s incredibly soft!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little costly, but it&#x27;s much more affordable on Amazon than the salon.</li>
            <li> Really love this little miracle.</li>
            <li> I think I need to experiment with it a little bit more with the amount I use in my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly for the length of my hair, avoiding my bangs as they tend to get a little stringy at the end of a 20 hour day.  </li>
            <li> it does a little better job of addressing the straw-like texture/stringiness that can plague those of us with bottle-blonde locks.</li>
            <li> and I plan using this original version for a long time!</li>
            <li> but I feel that this is a little better than that as you just spray it and then brush your hair.</li>
            <li> Stay far away from this stuff!!</li>
            <li> But then used it again at a friend&#x27;s house and WOW!!</li>
            <li> but it also makes it a little more shinier.</li>
            <li> Hard to put into words how amazing my hair feels.</li>
            <li> I really like this product - it seems to make my hair a little more manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li> Her whole family loves it and uses it on the 4-year old&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very manageable and soft</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and straight.</li>
            <li> It is a really expensive product if you buy it at a store, so it is a great idea to get it online.</li>
            <li> I use it on wet hair before combing/styling and it leaves me frizz free all day.</li>
            <li> my hair gets frizzy - this has been the only product that has helped calm my hair.</li>
            <li> In your hands, it feels very creamy, but when it dries, it&#x27;s not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I pretty much gave up, cropped my hair short, hid it under a do-rag, and thanked whatever was listening that I worked from home</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s worth crowing about, I&#x27;ll come back with an update to my review.</li>
            <li> I used this on myself at home and my hair wasn&#x27;t as poofy as it normally is when I blowdry it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but the price is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> Here, the price is still up there, but there are distinct and definite savings.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the 10 ounce bottle for a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> I love that it isn&#x27;t too heavy and really leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> This second time it left an impresson because my hair felt SO soft, silky, and smooth!    </li>
            <li> This product did good taking away the frizziness, but it left my hair feeling oily and I even had small clumps of product that didn&#x27;t soak in.</li>
            <li> (I tried it a few times to make sure it was this product causing the pimples).</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with static.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using a lot of product on her, for obvious reasons, but I do have to use something to keep her hair from frizzing into one giant puff ball and becoming a tangled nightmare.</li>
            <li> I love this leave-in product for reducing frizz after I&#x27;ve washed and dried my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra money</li>
            <li> Not sure why people love this so much.</li>
            <li> It was more expensive than I would have liked but after using it, I would definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> the 10 ounce bottle is worth the extra cash if you can afford it.</li>
            <li> My hair which is naturally limp had much more body after using this product.</li>
            <li> Fresh smelling hair only.</li>
            <li> Instead, my hair is kind of thick and wiry</li>
            <li> would agree and say this may not be the product for thin hair, but you&#x27;re good to go otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/wavy hair that can be a little rebellious &amp; my ends tend to get ragged pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this new product.</li>
            <li> Its light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, all while really helping to improve the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> and it will eventually weigh your hair down enough, but won&#x27;t make it lay together nicely.</li>
            <li> This product is light, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and you don&#x27;t have to worry about having to use so much that it dries on your hair and flakes off.  </li>
            <li> So I would say this stuff is safe as far as not weighing it down...</li>
            <li> have long wavy/curly hair that likes to tangle or become frizzy at a moment&#x27;s notice, so I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different products over the years but this really helps tame it down and make my hair soft and MUCH more manageable, plus it smells great.</li>
            <li> hair was pretty much messed up because I bleached it too much and blow dry it</li>
            <li> This works really well managing that and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy like most other similar products.</li>
            <li> This product makes my natural hair very soft and very manageable when I choose to sit under the dryer and straighten it.</li>
            <li> I used it right after the shower and brushed my hair.</li>
            <li> BUT RIGHT NOW IVE GOT THE MIDDLE SIZE TO TRY.</li>
            <li> but now I have super long hair</li>
            <li> , I use it every night, I have super long hair</li>
            <li> I have really long hair that gets tangled and frizzes up quickly.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought it a few years ago, I bought it from my hair salon and knew I couldn&#x27;t afford it at those prices, I was so excited to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great hair product and does last a long time with just a little use needed after a shower.</li>
            <li> which is a huge plus when you have fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I always use it when I blow dry my hair which just brings out the lovely oils and makes my hair all the more luxurious, and it keeps my fly-aways tame if I flat</li>
            <li> product keeps my hair shiny, tangle free and extremely manageable.  </li>
            <li> It makes her hair thick and full, and her natural waves end up smooth and shiney at the end of the day, where before if it wasnt pulled up she looks like she has been in a tornado by the time school is over.</li>
            <li> Detangles my long thick hair and acts as a good heat protectant before blow drying and straight ironing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can ever live without this</li>
            <li> We live on the lake</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can live without this product...</li>
            <li> and I cant live without it.</li>
            <li> My bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed in any way and didn&#x27;t appear new.</li>
            <li> I cant live without it now...</li>
            <li> I read about it on a beauty blog, but since then it&#x27;s everywhere - my new hairdresser uses it, friends recommend it, etc.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it...</li>
            <li> Found a new staple hair care</li>
            <li> I still use it (hence the 4 stars), but I can certainly live without it.</li>
            <li> So I am here to buy a new bottle as a replacement.</li>
            <li> Had to go out and buy a new spray bottle and transfer.</li>
            <li> She has super long hair, so this is a godsend!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and lasts a very long time, I have especially dry hair</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft, tangle free and especially leaves hair with a clean feeling unlike others that leave a heavy feel in your hair.  </li>
            <li> It might work for someone with less damaged hair and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, I use heat on my hair almost everyday and not only does it help untangle</li>
            <li> Works amazing to make my hair less frizzy, soft, and manageable and protect my hair from regular heating iron damage.  </li>
            <li> After I had kids my hair went from perfectly smooth and straight where I could wash and go to wavy/frizzy where I have to blow it out with a round brush every time I wash it.</li>
            <li> and this is a huge bottle that will last probably 6 months when used daily.  </li>
            <li> Normally with a small amount of this stuff I am able to brush my hair out with ease.</li>
            <li> mom, 86-yrs old, said it was a fact of life for older women.</li>
            <li> About a year ago I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism which makes my hair super dry.  </li>
            <li> It may seem kind of expensive, but the 10 oz bottle is worth it.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t belive how soft it made my hair (natural curls) after blowing drying straight.</li>
            <li> I had a full head of overly-processed highlights leaving my hair very dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> my kiddo, this product keeps her curls together and formed, keeps her hair soft, and the scent is not overly strong (though a little more grown up than I&#x27;d like for a little girl).</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and makes your hair smell amazing and sooo very soft!</li>
            <li> Totally transformed my hair from a frizzy mess to a much sleeker, more manageable mane.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair,  &amp; this product smooths it without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft and shiny</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and very soft.</li>
            <li> It was very soft to the touch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell though, it does not have a very natural sent and it does linger,</li>
            <li> Plus, she has a very sensitive head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents,</li>
            <li> Had to dig around for a while to find an Amazon cust svc number to call - and when I got through they took care of the situation very professionally</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Makes you hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> Her hair was very soft, shiny, and not frizzy at all.  </li>
            <li> Works great, but after finally looking up all my beauty products on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database, I realized it is full of a bunch of scary chemicals.</li>
            <li> A previous hair stylist had used this product and as usual, my hair felt great after my appointment.</li>
            <li> I use this daily as a detangler and it keeps my ends from becoming too dry.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair that tends to tangle easily, so when my beautician began using it on my hair during appointments -- I had to purchase it for my personal use.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it works great to tame the frizzies and just enhance the curls without being heavy or crunchy.  </li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s too big to fit comfortably in my hand and is hard for me to</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it does not feel heavy or greasy!</li>
            <li> I have color-processed my hair for so many years, I&#x27;m not really sure what&#x27;s there except at the roots.  </li>
            <li> Even use it on my 2 year old daughter!</li>
            <li> I should have bought a smaller bottle to try out first.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> My first purchase was from a salon, and my second was from Target.</li>
            <li> Pretty gross.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review as I get closer to needing my next relaxer as that&#x27;s when the tangles really start to set in!  </li>
            <li> do exactly the same thing and even for cheaper.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the price difference (maybe 5-7 dollars more), and you are a blonde (especially with colored/highlighted hair), I would recommend the blonde formula...</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who is willing to invest in a one-step way to improve the texture, manageability, shine, and softness of their hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> But the biggest thing is that it leaves your hair so soft!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and frizz-free!  </li>
            <li> I use it on my curly hair and wow the curls!</li>
            <li> But you know what I meant, when I said it feels alive!</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner and the leave-in with keratin to try, but not sure it can get much better than this.</li>
            <li> I ran out and had to purchase a small bottle (of course at more $$).</li>
            <li> This product makes it soft and silky!</li>
            <li> Same product that you would get in the salon for a much lower price!</li>
            <li> anyone with frizzy hair...and someone who, in general, just wants their hair to look and feel healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that blow-drying on cold air really does a nice job; it just takes longer, but it&#x27;s worth the patience.</li>
            <li> The cheap hair products do not compare and are totally not worth your time.  </li>
            <li> Just a few sprays (less than you think) &amp; its very easy to comb out &amp; helps the calm frizziness while blowdrying</li>
            <li> this stuff keeps the frizz down and makes my hair overall more manageable and what I would consider normal.</li>
            <li> I put it on my hair a little after getting out of the shower, and then my hair is actually easy to comb.</li>
            <li> knew it definitely wasn&#x27;t my mistake for what the item was supposed to be, when the directions on the bottle say it is so easy to use - &amp;#34;Shampoo, condition, towel dry and then spray!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I have fairly thick hair that&#x27;s gotten more unruly as I get older.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally gush about products, so this is going to sound a little bit like a shill piece written by a salesperson, probably.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but I think it is more effective than some of the other detangling/conditioning sprays I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day or so to keep my hair healthy looking and it makes coarse hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I have to dump the rest of the old bottle into the new bottle.</li>
            <li> It is easier to brush with less tangles, it dries light and smooth, less split ends, and</li>
            <li> Works great for my thin, long, color treated hair....</li>
            <li> I have long thin hair which always seems to look kinda frizzy and fly away after blow drying.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product that has actually worked to condition and make my hair soft to touch and shiny.</li>
            <li> Quick ship, product as expected</li>
            <li> and i have colored it to pretty near butter blonde</li>
            <li> I use it on my daughter&#x27;s fine little girl hair and it gets the tangles out</li>
            <li> Because cosmetics companies are ridiculous and seem to wait until a product has a HUGE cult following to change the formula or discontinue it, I am on a personal crusade to collect and stash as many 10 ounce bottles of this as my wallet will allow.</li>
            <li> From there, you can dry it and iron it or let it dry naturally (and more softly).  </li>
            <li> though when I lived in Louisiana I was fine as long as I got relaxers and touch-ups every few months and used the right products.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and was pleasantly surprised the following morning that my hair remained tangle free.  </li>
            <li> It will smoke up with hot dryer or flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricier than anything I would normally have used, but it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to make sure I order from the same seller as my previous purchase.</li>
            <li> If you looking for a slight sheen and shape without the flakes and stiffness of most hair products, look no further!</li>
            <li> So I had a issue a while back where my hair was super gross</li>
            <li> My 2 year old has very fine, fairly thin, and VERY curly hair.</li>
            <li> My wife has very natural curly hair just below the shoulder length hair and says only two squirts does the trick with taking out the curl and giving her relatively straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of the few products I can use on my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is extremely long and this makes it easy to keep it long!  </li>
            <li> Right after I get out of the shower, I spray it on and let my hair dry completely.</li>
            <li> It takes so little to make our hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product however a little too pricey fora detangler.</li>
            <li> I discontinued use of product and am now using coconut oil on most days or just water with a little conditioner mixed in.</li>
            <li> Even better, just a little misting with water between shampoos reactivates the product, making daily brushing a breeze.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my 6 year old daughter who despises the hair washing process, so I figured I could cut it in half by getting a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> After about a week my hair actually felt like normal again -- soft and not like straw!!</li>
            <li> It is kinda pricey for such a small bottle, but it&#x27;s worth it because when the quality is so great, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I blow dry my hair with no product, I can get it straight pretty easily, but sometimes I still have to use a flat iron to help make it a little smoother and shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I’m happy that it works well on my crazy hair.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and have noticed a huge difference in my hair since I began using it.</li>
            <li> All clear.</li>
            <li> I have straight asian hair, and this product leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this only two weeks ago so it may be too early to tell but seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li> You actually see a diff when you put this on your hair, it makes your hair look really shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Does it say \\&quot;Leave in conditioner + perfume?\\&quot; Does it (wrongly) claim \\&quot;Great scent!\\&quot; as one of the ten things it supposedly does?</li>
            <li> my husband loves the smell too, it makes him want to get extra cozy :)</li>
            <li> Leaves it soft and curly.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I spray it on after every shower and my hair is now soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Usually, when I use a hot air brush my hair is straight until I wash it again, and the extensions mix well with my real hair.  </li>
            <li> With two young swimmers in the house, we need all the help we can get.</li>
            <li> and it also helps to define my natural wavy hair.</li>
            <li> &quot; won the lottery as far as hair texture,</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years, stores locally either stopped selling it or the price went sky high!  </li>
            <li> Leaves it feeling soft and looking shiny.</li>
            <li> Years of dying my hair out of a box had completely wrecked havoc on my once-gorgeous hair to the point where I couldn&#x27;t even run a brush through it when I got out of the shower.</li>
            <li> It completely transformed my hair and I am soooo thankful for this product.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair and this stuff is really the only way I get a brush through damp hair without ripping all of it out.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft after using this.</li>
            <li> my hair felt so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I had my hair professionally done by a natural hair specialist.</li>
            <li> On the days I don&#x27;t let my hair go curly and natural</li>
            <li> Over the counter products did not perform nearly as well as this one.</li>
            <li> It takes the frizz out and makes it so manageable, soft and tangle-free.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair looking soft and shiny.  </li>

            <li> It makes my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> This repairs the damage and leaves hair silky, soft and shiny without being too \\&quot;heavy.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It detangles my hair without leaving it greasy and leaves it soft instead.</li>
            <li> I gave the remainder of Unite to my 7 year old daughter to use.  </li>
            <li> it took a complete transformation.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> It will not work for anyone who is sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair is after using this product.</li>

            <li> It gets all the tangles out with minimum hair breakage and when my hair dries it is really soft.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product at a local salon over a year ago, used it and found it worked very well.</li>
            <li> so much purchase the larger bottle on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It makes the curls soft and helps them stay in ringlets.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot, so it does last a while.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> My damp hair brushes out smoothly and is silky and healthy-looking after being blow dried.</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you want glossy, soft, Kate Middleton-esque hair, splurge and pick up a bottle of Moroccan Oil or Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s  Invisible Oil.</li>
            <li> This fixed the frizz, added body,</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft after using It&#x27;s a 10.  </li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d get rid of the frizz or fly-aways unless I had my hair done professionally.</li>
            <li> It took me almost a year to completely run out of it.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feeling soft and frizz-free.</li>
            <li> I have been even using it on my 10 year old daughters hair.</li>
            <li> As it drys to holds your hair in place naturally, with no notice anything was ever added like</li>
            <li> But when you get to where you&#x27;re going, just run a damp comb through your hair to return to a natural look.  </li>
            <li> Not the same consistency as the real thing.</li>
            <li> and when I would be in the store and see it I would be like &amp;#34;look at that old el cheapo looking bottle..it looks like drug store, or grocery store hair products-yuck&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky soft and keeps it healthier looking between visits to my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> I squirt the product directly into my hands to apply it evenly.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curlly hair</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair supee soft and protects it.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have natural hair and it make my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have near the breakage that I did before.  </li>
            <li> What I dont like is it didn&#x27;t leave my hair shiny or as soft as I was expecting based on reviews.</li>
            <li> If your hair is THAT DAMAGED, you need professional keratin treatments, not this.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 years so far.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t very tangly, so this product made my hair extra silky to comb through.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 10 years old and my dad got me this product.</li>
            <li> It is so much things but one of the big things it is is a  detangler.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s american girl doll since her hair was an absolute rat&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li> It really can replace 4-5 different products because of all the issues it helps with.</li>
            <li> use this on my 4 year old after swimming, or sometimes even for bedhead in the morning.</li>
            <li> Only issue I would note, it \\&quot;might\\&quot; be too much for oily hair -</li>
            <li> Helps my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> I am too young to be the color my hair is turning into.</li>
            <li> and oh so soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft yet with body...</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s supposed to be a copy, but the ingredients are not identical and it really doesn&#x27;t feel the same as \\&quot;It&#x27;s</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and silky and it protects against heat.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair and if I put it up in a bun, my hair completely knots up.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny it costs since I&#x27;ve not really found anything that even compares to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> shiny, thick, and healthy.</li>
            <li> The beautician said less is more with this product, and I certainly didn&#x27;t want anything that would weigh my  hair down and make it look greasy, but I had no problem with this stuff doing that.</li>
            <li> But my hair&#x27;s straight and soft, it moves when I turn my head instead of hanging there in a stiff, fried mess, it&#x27;s got a fairly decent shine, and it looks healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and unless you are washing your hair daily should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Wife loves the stuff and uses daily so when she runs dry i am often having to search for a good deal and usually Amazon is the place to go.</li>
            <li> As soon as it was dry it was completely frizzy, even after drying it with the hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> My teenage daughter uses this stuff too, and her hair is super long and hangs below her waist.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is soft, smooth, and tame.</li>
            <li> Short version of the review: if you have mixed-race, frizzy, or otherwise problem hair, this stuff could be a lifesaver, though it works better in conjunction with other products from the same brand.</li>
            <li> When I spray this stuff on my wet hair, the brush glides right through it.</li>
            <li> You can comb right through while it&#x27;s still wet.</li>
            <li> you spray it on right after you have washed your hair and its still wet.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair super soft, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair every day and use a hot curling iron as well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and then today for the first time I decided to blow dry and scrunch my hair to see what the curls would do</li>
            <li> I live in miami where we live in constant humidity and this product tames the frizz and gives me that desired beach wavy hair look</li>
            <li> It quickly detangles and softens my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is fine, it gets oily easily which drives me insane, so I have to avoid most conditioners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown my hair out for the first time and the static has only gotten worse.</li>
            <li> For the first few times, it didn&#x27;t seem to affect my hair very well, but now it&#x27;s silky, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li> She dealt with my hair which is pretty fine but due to heat damage is frizzy when air dried.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin, naturally curly medium length hair that can get pretty dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> product had been no less than a miracle for me.</li>
            <li> The only difference i noticed between this product and the $2 Suave leave in conditioner that I usually use is that this one costs $25 dollars more.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth every penny especially with how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the first time last year and I will never switch back to anything else!</li>
            <li> really* thick, long, kind of wavy hair and</li>
            <li> This product is good for every hair type, but especially for thick, dry types like mine.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about this product, my hair was dry, brittle, breaking and damaged like no other.</li>
            <li> She is still pleased with the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s A 10&amp;#34; product but much happier with the Amazon price - which was less than half the salon&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li> High recommend, especially if you use a lot of heat.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and wish I could give it ten stars!</li>
            <li> The only downside is the high price.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to spray a lot to really feel the difference when brushing, and my hair is not that difficult since I have straight and fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have super long, super thick hair.</li>
            <li> I read a comment below that says this leave in product &amp;#34;smells horrible.&amp;#34; That individual clearly needs a new nose.</li>
            <li> I just recommend not using too much, not too little, as it did become kind of thick and almost greasy</li>
            <li> If when my hair is dry, and I put it back, I just spray a little and it keeps fly aways down and</li>
            <li> is so strong that it overwhelms you and disturbs your consciousness-it must be toxic-it must be some left over waste from a monsanto plant</li>
            <li> I have thick, kind of dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> It tames my very full heads of thick hair.</li>
            <li> Calling it a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; is definitely exaggerating, but the product would most likely work well for those of you with long dry hair, or textured hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well on long hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the convenience of a spray for my long curls.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this product at my local salon for a few years and it always leaves my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always worked very well for my long hair.</li>
            <li> I used this for many years for my thin, straight blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using this product, and within 2 weeks things were back to normal.</li>
            <li> and I finally have normal hair again.  </li>
            <li> when I stopped using this product, my hair went back to normal.  </li>
            <li> Product is clearly not the real deal after weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Took 2 months for my face to return back to normal after discontinued use.</li>
            <li> The only negative is it leaves my hair a little greasy, but it works quickly and effectively if you have tangled, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> In many reviews it seems to smell fine, I think i might&#x27;ve gotten a bad product.</li>
            <li> and this was a little too heavy for daily use but great for weekly or dry hair days.  </li>
            <li> Other heat styling protector products weighed down my fine hair, and after trying a ton of other products I luckily stumbled across</li>
            <li> Maybe this works for people with thin, flat, straight hair because it sure didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Considering I live in London, we can only get it online</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely dry on the ends, and very oily on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I used it after shower this morning, my hair is now dry, not damped anymore) and still smells really</li>
            <li> Let it air dry, and it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> It really helps my hair look smoother after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so blessed to have long, healthy hair at age 44 (and after a round of chemo, to boot!).  </li>
            <li> As an avid \\&quot;pony tail\\&quot; wearer, this is a must for the constant \\&quot;pull\\&quot; my long hair endures after workouts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic - not too heavy / greasy but definitely works!</li>
            <li> Less tears is worth it.</li>
            <li> Eh, I wanted to like this, mostly because it was expensive, but I didn&#x27;t really see any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> It does what it is suppose to do, hair feels manageable, soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> only negative is I still feel the price while better here is still to $$.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, African American hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes combing thin hair much easier and pain free.</li>
            <li> I have thick unrulely hair and it makes it so easy to get through.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that gets tangled easily.  </li>
            <li> I have type 2c curly hair that is thick but gets greasy easily.</li>
            <li> Makes my thick curly hair easy to brush after washing and protects it from heat and styling.</li>
            <li> It also is good for my sister&#x27;s finer, smoother hair--gives her hair body and shine too, and she can&#x27;t use anything the least bit heavy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t exactly afford to spend $200 every other day and four hours in a salon for them to go through the whole process for me, only for it to bunch up the second I walked out of the climate-controlled environment.</li>
            <li> I started using this product after I got a perm that major fried my hair.  </li>
            <li> I had to use a ton of product and still could barely get the brush through my hair!</li>
            <li> My hair barely frizzes and it feels and looks healthier!</li>
            <li> I use no other products (except hairspray).  </li>
            <li> nothing major in terms of change.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that works on my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s curly hair to get the tangles out!</li>
            <li> Not unpleasant but heavy.</li>
            <li> ; Now I give my towel-dried wet hair a very few spritzes of this stuff, massage it all through vigorously right down to the roots, and though it feels like I&#x27;m dealing with a lion&#x27;s mane, I can easily run a pick through it and voila!</li>
            <li> There is some damage from the daily heat and coloring, and the ends are pretty dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 made my hair feel dry and brittle and made it more frizzy than usual.</li>
            <li> she has long, wavy hair which get dried out very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Anyway I have bleached blonde highlights over dark brown hair which is super damaging.</li>
            <li> It is so light that it does not weigh it down when I dry it.</li>
            <li> I purchased from Amazon directly (not another seller) and had ordered this based on the solid positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine but thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I have fine thick hair that is a bear to untangle.</li>
            <li> Her hair is thick and fine....</li>
            <li> I have fine, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for 20+ years so it can become very dry since I live in a dry, hot climate.</li>
            <li> My second attempt (this time using less product) went pretty much the same way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I knew something was not right.  </li>
            <li> I think this big bottle will last me til she graduates high school.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and curly, I straighten my hair everyday, this product definitely makes my hair smooth and very soft.</li>
            <li> My hair has been really dry from years of flat ironing my naturally curly hair straight.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great when I&#x27;m having a flyaway bad hair day.</li>
            <li> Amazing product no more dead or split ends</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regretfully, I did not take the time to look over the ingredients as I generally would.</li>
            <li> But this is what I generally find with an ingredient list that starts like this one does...</li>
            <li> And, as for the actual results after applying, it looked and felt much softer but it wasn&#x27;t anything that blew me away or made me think that i would be a long time buyer.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets~</li>
            <li> It makes brushing my wet hair much easier.  </li>
            <li> and I have barely made a dent in it.</li>
            <li> So far, they are just too young for daily showers/hair washing (and curly girls should not be doing anything close to daily hair washing!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After buying this product, with three squirts, it took me barely two minutes to comb through the rats nest.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use conditioner (since some ppl&#x27;s reviews said conditioner wasn&#x27;t necessary) and used 2 sprays of the products directly onto my head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helpful when combing my hair out when it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t seem any different as far as silkiness and shininess.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> i can barely comb through my hair without this product.  </li>
            <li> My daughter also uses it on her permed hair and it is the only product that she has tried that leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only leave-in product I&#x27;ll use, so far nothing else comes close....</li>
            <li> Apparently pregnancy hormones can change the consistency of your hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it twice with barely noticeable results</li>
            <li> The hair has a bit of the wild Irish texture.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my five year old who has a big head of unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> it is only natural</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s pretty average</li>
            <li> The 10 oz bottle spray-able conditioner is different than the 4 oz, which is a complete liquid and is weightless.</li>
            <li> However, with this product it does not matter; not only does it detangle but it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> So given that it makes it tangle more, looking worse, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not a product for me.</li>
            <li> Not a cheap product but worth the price.</li>
            <li> kind of expensive though...</li>
            <li> I also spritz a little bit in my hair right before bed.</li>
            <li> and we get compliments on how their hair smells; although it could be a little strong for some its not really overpowering</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and finding a product that adequately moisturizes my hair is hard</li>
            <li> The shipping took a it longer than expected but only by a few days, very worth it would recommend any day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but lasts a long time and is well worth it!</li>
            <li> My 5 year old granddaughter has long, thick, wavy, causasian hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> But if you need a less expensive, but just as great alternative, give the Pantene a try.</li>
            <li> I have naturally black hair; I&#x27;m Chinese and my hair is super dark and pretty coarse.</li>
            <li> I love it because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and leave a tacky, stiff or oily residue.  </li>
            <li> use this product in my hair everyday right when I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I use the hair mask on the lower half of my hair, then when I&#x27;m out of the shower I use a SMALL amount of this on the top half of my head and a bit more on the lower half.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment as usual.</li>
            <li> my hair has gone from thin dry and stringy to thick full and healthy!</li>
            <li> No other product has left my hair SO SHINEY and soft with such frizz control.</li>
            <li> I used to highlight the snot out of my hair, but recently went dark to give it a little break, but the static hung around.</li>
            <li> It does not make your hair heavy or flat like most of the other leave-in products I have tried does.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s always bit of a mess. ;)</li>
            <li> but i was a little surprised that the ones I bought on Amazon had a much stronger fragrance than the ones from Ulta.  </li>
            <li> I have natural curly (fuzzy) hair, so go course, i always want to use my flat iron on it th most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think spraying directly on the hair might be a little too much, so I spray into my hands, then apply.</li>
            <li> My hair was very damaged due to all the coloring and styling products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> so I smooth my mane with a very small amount of coconut oil after styling/drying my hair.</li>
            <li> have tried their other products, for example the orange cap with keratin in the product, that one has&lt;br /&gt;way too much perfume for me to wear.</li>
            <li> I do it because it&#x27;s so rich and thick</li>
            <li> I spray just a tiny bit on my natural hair because it will weigh it down if I use too much.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, silky, and so alive (of course you know, hair shaft is the dead part, live part is the root).</li>
            <li> Most of my inventory is expensive, and professional grade.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty average hair with a moderate amount of curl (and frizz).</li>
            <li> I have minimal split ends (even with the intense coloring, and daily heated styling).  </li>
            <li> In fact, I bought my sister and mom a bottle each and just bought a 2nd bottle for myself after making the initial purchase about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: instead of spraying the product directly into your hair, spray it into your hands and then just work it through your hair.</li>
            <li> less, I had to smile and tell her that I hadn&#x27;t cut back, I just finally found my product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I assumed it was going to be the same size but was pleasantly surprised to see how much bigger the 10oz bottle is.  </li>
            <li> Well, my hair finally had enough and was fried nearly to the point where I thought I was going to have to shave it all off.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair with an oily scalp and dry ends and this product helps keep my hair soft &amp; healthy.  </li>
            <li> I expected to be able to mist this all over my hair and instead got a product that sprays out in thick streaks.</li>
            <li> Worth the $ to get the knots out of my little girls hair!</li>
            <li> My hair is curly, fine, and a lot of broken hairs that manifest into major frizz!</li>
            <li> I went to a hot springs and swam with the little children in my family.</li>
            <li> I even use this on days that I dont really style my hair and it helps keep my natural waves tame.</li>
            <li> Also, it allows me to brush through their sensitive hair with much less screaming and grouching than normal.</li>
            <li> I have fairly normal hair, but it can be a tiny bit dry sometimes, so</li>
            <li> Has helped get my hair back in normal condition (my hair was extremely dry).  </li>
            <li> Once you tried this product, there is no going back to the other products that don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> I have lost the shine because of my grey hairs and it makes me feel young again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is but as long as it keeps giving me soft and shiny hair</li>
            <li> My hair feels strangely waxy and soft, like doll hair.</li>
            <li> It was much easier to comb through, actually felt silky wet if that&#x27;s possible!!  </li>
            <li> My young daughter, who has waist long blond hair, returned from a week at the beach with the biggest, nastiest tangles - basically dreds.</li>
            <li> Still not entirely sure if it&#x27;s worth the price though.</li>
            <li> and I apply 4 pumps as I comb it out after conditioning, and maybe a little more if necessary as i go to roll the other sections of my hair if I see it beginning to dry curly a bit, before I have rolled it and got under the dryer.</li>
            <li> Really helps out with dry and damaged hair that would normally dry frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry and curly hair that frizzes easily</li>
            <li> hair responds very well to this product without weighing it down ...</li>
            <li> It doesnt work for me no matter how much i shake the bottle and press down.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and each time I washed my hair having this in it, I saw nothing but residue that was thick and grey in color resembling the consistency of the formula.</li>
            <li> Morroccan oil tends to weigh my hair down if I use too much.</li>
            <li> I naturally have very shiny hair and after using this for about a week my mother asked me if I was doing something different with my hair because my natural color looked muted and dull.  </li>
            <li> the knots come right out, no more pulling</li>
            <li> I have very long naturally curly hair...</li>
            <li> Nothing too unpleasant and definitely a scent I could deal with if I had loved the product.</li>
            <li> This was not the real product I had previously bought at a salon...</li>
            <li> Its not super oily and it detangles very well.</li>
            <li> It is wild, unmanageable, and always really dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to brush through &amp; MUCH less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I also leaves my hair soft when I dry it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d leave my hair waxy, gummy, tangled, partially straightened but mostly just a bushy mess that snapped combs in half like the hungry tentacles of Cthulhu.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair feels soft but this does not last for long!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say what it works like for other hair, but for my normal type hair it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Used other high end products, keep on coming back to this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed in the last month that my hair is much smoother and softer, with less dandruff and frizz.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this at the local discount store for $17 for the small bottle twice because I love the way it makes my thin, straight hair feel.</li>
            <li> Boom, hair that is soft and comb-able...dries into a wavy mess because that&#x27;s just how my hair is but its soft to the touch and not frizzy and crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I needed a new due before hitting the town that night but had no time to shower.</li>
            <li> It is too wide at the top, so it is very hard to hold on to it and pump at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, this product is not worth the high price.</li>
            <li> The sprayer is a little stiff but works fine.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly as a guy, with my current haircut being shorter on the sides and little longer on top to do a sort of natural comb over.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any strange residue, and my hair is just soft and smells/feels clean.</li>
            <li> I only need a little bit of round brush work to get it perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it recently because I&#x27;ve been testing other products and wanted to the see the individual results of the new products, but this is my face detangler</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to odors and the other &#x27;</li>
            <li> It works good, but smells bad.</li>
            <li> I was living my nightmare, and every day, I would see a huge handful of broken hairs in my shower drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m South Asian and unfortunately didn&#x27;t get nice hair like all the other South Asians).</li>
            <li> What other kind of magic does this horrible product perform?</li>
            <li> Smooths frizzy dry hair and makes combing wet or dry hair much easier.  </li>
            <li> and I have A LOT less flyaways than when I normally straighten my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is normal - maybe slightly oily.</li>
            <li> My hair is always frizzy and this has really helped tame the mane.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I let it air dry, then a few hours later when I had time I flat ironed...</li>
            <li> I usually put a couple of spritzes on the ends of my and and comb it through right before I blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> But for the price, I was expecting a little more bounce and a little less frizz.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, long hair</li>
            <li> I got so tired of taking showers and leaving conditioner in for long periods of time, only to have my hair come out in a huge ball of knots.</li>
            <li> It does not take much at all; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wanted to go auburn for fall and ended up with weird dark  burgundy overall color and kind of ambiguous pinkish highlights.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it in my book!!</li>
            <li> and I have sprayed quite a bit of this onto my wet hair and left it to dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product instead of using conditioner in the shower because I was having issues with too much oil build-up and getting small white bits coming off my scalp.</li>
            <li> With long, straight hair, conditioning can be too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it only takes 4 - 5 sprays on each side of my head (from ears to ends), total 8 to 10 sprays after every showers.</li>
            <li> I use this product in my wet hair every morning and it leaves my long hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This particular size is over double the amount that I usually buy in the store for about the same price.</li>
            <li> After a few days(about 3 days or so) the frizzies can come back if you live in a  humid area like i do.</li>
            <li> Same as from professional but a lot less.</li>
            <li> You can spray it on dry or wet hair, it&#x27;s not heavy or oily in any way.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this makes it so easy to brush my hair with just a few sprays.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy, but with this product I can comb it straight or leave it curly without any drying or excessive heat.  </li>
            <li> I use this when I am really lazy to straight my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often, my hair is improved so much in breakage its unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I used to use an anti-frizz serum, and a flat iron spray for flat ironing, and a leave in strengthening conditioner spray for blow drying.</li>
            <li> For reference I have relaxed, color treated hair that I flat iron 2 to 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I was worried it would not detangle well enough because I have long curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair was so damaged from bleaching and flat ironing</li>
            <li> but this has revived moisture to my curly/fine hair and does not make it sticky or flat.</li>
            <li> Its not frizzy with flat iron.</li>
            <li> And it is  a MUST USE product if you use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> The people who are insisting this makes their hair flat or greasy are probably spraying the product all over their hair (including on the roots).  </li>
            <li> I have long color treated hair (blonde)</li>
            <li> One of these bottles can last a long time.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this a long time ago and am just now writing a review.  </li>
            <li> summer, I used.its a 10 leave in product and stayed away from the blow dryer and flat iron..</li>
            <li> You will also save money in the long run since you will only need one hair product now!</li>
            <li> and this product seems to soften the curls and protect my hair from the flat iron and blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to find a product that finally works.</li>
            <li> and they seem to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was given a 2oz sample bottle at ulta when I bought my flat iron.</li>
            <li> an use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I tried to grow it for years and my back would grow long and hair in my front</li>
            <li> My long hair only needs 4-5 sprays after each wash.</li>
            <li> before I flat iron and then yet another to control frizz.  </li>
            <li> It does not way your hair down and our hair feels so soft after using this leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft and shiny after styling without weighing it down or looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> makes my hair feel so soft without weighting my hair down.</li>
            <li> It protects my hair from the daily heat of the dryer, and my hair is so soft that it feels like a little kid&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But whew, it stinks so strongly!</li>
            <li> It helped stopped major breakage due to bleach, although I would also have to attribute some of that to the Aphogee Two-Step Protein Treatment, too.</li>
            <li> This product protects my hair from the blow drying and curling irons damage and does not leave it greasy and flat!</li>
            <li> I swim daily and have very long hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long blonde hair</li>
            <li> Great detangler, not too heavy, doesnt leave any residue or bad scent.</li>
            <li> use this as a daily detangler on their AM comb-through (dry hair).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to manage because it tangles so easily.</li>
            <li> Made my hair greasy and dry at the same time.</li>
            <li> This products is barely natural, in addition to that you would have to spray half of the container to do the job</li>
            <li> My hair after several years of dying, straightening, blowing it dry, etc.</li>
            <li> The one con is that it does make roots slightly oily, just avoid directly spraying it in your root area.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to people who have dry or knot-prone hair.</li>
            <li> This makes me hair soft to the touch and less frizzy</li>
            <li> The deep conditioner with Keratin works miracles on dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, manageable and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> there have been days when I simply blow dry my hair ...</li>
            <li> you have coarse, dry hair, you&#x27;ve probably already learned the basics:  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to put too much in your hair or it will get too limp.  </li>
            <li> So when it arrived, I tore open the packaging and immediately after my next shower, warmed this up in my palms and applied it to my wet ends...</li>
            <li> - this stuff can last you a long long time.</li>
            <li> I have spent double at Target for the same thing!</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m using too much, and because my hair is so thick and coarse</li>
            <li> My hair instantly became soft, detangled, frizz less, and so shiny!</li>
            <li> After reading all these great reviews, I decided to get it, bad mistake!</li>
            <li> My stylist usually uses the light formula for all of her clients, but told me I could use the regular formula be a use my hair is so thick.</li>
            <li> My hair would dry (naturally, no hair dryer) into this big frizzy fluffball with knots and...</li>
            <li> and I can brush right through my hard to manage hair!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, It didn&#x27;t work on my hair, made it very flat and no volume!</li>
            <li> 10 oz bottle last for a very long time.!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive but it will last longer than you think and the results are so worth it!  </li>
            <li> There have been several other products I have bought, but these now sit in my cupboard and gather dust as I keep going back.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other detanglers before (much more expensive ones like the Moroccan oil products) and nothing compares to the scent of</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing the trick that several of the other purchased Its a 10 products of the very same variety have done.</li>
            <li> : I have very thin hair that is damaged easily.</li>
            <li> I had thought that my curl just wasn&#x27;t the same anymore after hormonal changes from pregnancy, but my sister insisted that it was from my hair being overly dry (which didn&#x27;t feel dry to me).  </li>
            <li> To be honest I was hesitant due to the cost, but then I thought the breakage on the ends of my hair was so bad it was worth at least 1 bottle of trying.</li>
            <li> but I really think that the product was coating her hair so much on the outside that any other moisture was unable to penetrate the hair and thus resulting in a drier appearance than we started with.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend - a 10 oz bottle usually lasts me about 3-months</li>
            <li> and my hair will dry flat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even blow dry it, or flat iron it anymore</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really hard to brush through no matter how much conditioner I use</li>
            <li> My hair type is thick with a slight wave, I have very long hair past my shoulders that has been color treated blonde for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> Instead of glossy, shiny, and soft hair, I got slightly brittle, rough, flat, and matte-looking hair.  </li>
            <li> Because I had highlights done, the bleach has damaged my hair even further, making the waves not very pretty to look at.</li>
            <li> is a fantastic spray, but it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> My hair has repaired after cutting off most of the heat-damaged length.  </li>
            <li> First of all the shipping on this product was crazy fast.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t agree with the negative comment made about the smell being overpowering and very flowery.</li>
            <li> And it makes it possible for the ends to lie flat, in line with each other.  </li>
            <li> Other products - especially leave-ins - made my hair flat and greasy.</li>
            <li> Been using for a long time</li>
            <li> My hair is quite long these days</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took so long for me to try this product.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t take me long to fix that.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> While pricey, the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It has helped some although has not completely removed the problem.</li>
            <li> Long strait, and no flyaways.</li>
            <li> And just a dab goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I spray this on the ends of my long, wavy hair when I get out of the shower before combing through my hair (it makes your hair greasy/</li>
            <li> I like my hair long, so</li>
            <li> but it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> And one bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS PROBABLY ABOUT 2 FEET LONG.</li>
            <li> I always blow dried and flat-ironed my hair straight until curls came back a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> They have long hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long hair</li>
            <li> I still have body all day long as well.</li>
            <li> And, I can smell it all day long.</li>
            <li> I use on granddaughters long, knotty hair for no-tear combing.</li>
            <li> It detangles and leaves my long hair so</li>
            <li> I have NEVER had that problem on AMAZON as long as I buy products that are &amp;#34;fulfilled by</li>
            <li> I have REALLY long hair</li>
            <li> alittle goes a long way, so don&#x27;t let the size fool you.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and far from a miracle.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday on my seven year old daughters hair.  </li>
            <li> standard way of using this is to use shampoo and conditioner, then spray this on wet (well, towel-dried) hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a leave in conditioner for a long time.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s allot easier to comb her long hair after she washes it......its like WD-40 for her hair brush......</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this product helps to keep my hair shiny, silky and tangle-free.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it was always knotted post-showering.</li>
            <li> If you look closely and compare the actual bottles (bottom), you will notice the knock-off is slightly different (almost unnoticeable) and also the packaging that it is wrapped in is also slightly different - but the dead giveaway is when you shake the bottle.</li>
            <li> This bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A few spritz and my hair is detangled and soft.</li>
            <li> It works wonder for long hair.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and quite damaged.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way, so the expense evens out.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you are in the middle of coloring your hair, using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course there&#x27;s still some damage, but with just a few weeks uses I am completely amazed.</li>
            <li> My long time hair dresser recommended this</li>
            <li> I have been a long time fan of this product.  </li>
            <li> I have thick long hair, tons of it really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got long very curly thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have long very colored thick hair and indont</li>
            <li> It has also allowed my naturally curly hair dry in its curly state with little to no frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair and either flat iron it, curl it, or twist it into a bun, every single day.</li>
            <li> Like I always say, what it works for most people, doesn&#x27;t mean it works for everyone!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product after I shower in my wet hair and the next day as a styling product in my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> In all honesty, the only of the 10 benefits that I&#x27;ve actually noticed on my hair is a slight shine, which is why I&#x27;ll give the product 3 stars.</li>
            <li> My husband has long, naturally curly hair and has been using WEN to tame his mane.  </li>
            <li> It does make my hair soft and helps with styling without making it stiff.  </li>
            <li> it takes me long time to dry after I spray this.</li>
            <li> The quality of my hair has improved exponentially; I struggled with dry and brittle hair for so long.</li>
            <li> I have long, mid-back length curly dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair and it tends to get dry towards the ends.  </li>
            <li> I have long, curly, somewhat dry, hair</li>
            <li> leaves hair completely tame, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> For years I had used a salon product to enhance my natural curls and tame the frizzies.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair &amp; this one did not seem to weight it down like the keratin one did, so I will stick w/ this one!</li>
            <li> I prefer to shampoo every other day but other leave-ins were a little too heavy and my hair would look super oily</li>
            <li> While I waited for the other products, I kept using the leave-in product daily, and watching my hair texture improve with each passing day.</li>
            <li> You only need a few squirts and this size bottle will last 6 months at my house when myself and my daughter use it (and we both have long hair).</li>
            <li> Since they were little (they are 11 now) comb-through has been a constant daily challenge</li>
            <li> I tried the leave in with keratin and other brands, I always come back to this one time and time again.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical after the first, second, even third time using this.</li>
            <li> I will totally be buying it again when I run out of other detanglers.</li>
            <li> The other product I use to ensure that is PhytoSpecific Moisturizing Styling balm for Ultra-dry hair, only on the ends - that stuff is not joking around.  </li>
            <li> This stuff simply works well on my hair, I used it combination with one other product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a really big fan of this product, and would recommend giving it a shot to other buyers.</li>
            <li> it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> love the product just way too expensive!</li>
            <li> I have used 4 other products and the only one I recommend is the \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Its above &amp; beyond all the other detangling products Ive tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying this as long as I have hair - hopefully a Long time!!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very very long and brittle.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> It takes very little of this product to de-tangle one&#x27;s hair; using too much runs the risk of weighing it down.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Seriously: if you have dry hair, curly/dry hair -- this is the stuff.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this for my dry hair about 2 years ago</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> just squeeze my hair with a towel to ring out the water and then apply the spray before I blow dry.</li>

            <li> I got this because it&#x27;s supposed to protect your hair from the blowing dry, etc.</li>

            <li> , I just let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I spray it in after I wash, then just let my hair air dry or blow dry.  </li>
            <li> but I have lots of ballayage style highlights, so it can feel dry and tangled a lot.</li>
            <li> I spray this in while my hair is mostly dry but still damp, scrunch my hair up with my hands and then brush it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 or the solution which seems to turn my dry hair into silk.  </li>
            <li> I use this product and air dry my hair, I still get some frizziness and waviness, but</li>

            <li> I will literally never live a day without this hair product again.  </li>
            <li> It might be that this product is not nearly as new as I would have thought.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair except less shiny than usual.  </li>
            <li> I changed to this original formula when the Blonde stuff ran out because it is less expensive.</li>

            <li> have very curly but thin, middle aged hair with about 10-20 percent gray.</li>
            <li> At any rate, this was the least expensive price, both locally and online, that I was able to find the product at.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick and coarse blonde hair thats been bleached and dyed to hell and back</li>
            <li> I hardly loose any hair when combing through after washing and rinsing with conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is way less poofy now, but it&#x27;s not flat and lifeless; there&#x27;s still some volume to it.</li>
            <li> and I knew It&#x27;s a 10 was loaded with silicone, which would likely weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> With the knock-off product, you can literally hear that it has been obviously watered down.</li>

            <li> if I wanted to wear a scent, there are numerous other products that provide that ability!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, curly hair and this detangles very well.</li>
            <li> gave it four stars because it makes my wet hair manageable after a shower, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down (when sprayed only on the ends), and has lasted me a very long time.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t crazy unruly, but it certainly isn&#x27;t easy to style.</li>
            <li> but I found that it also works on dry hair!</li>
            <li> But remember to spray this stuff on BEFORE you towel dry your hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 for daily use, and it works so well that I put it in a small spray bottle, spray about 4-6 into my palm while still in the shower and give it one splash of water to get overall coverage.  </li>
            <li> Yes, you pay a premium, but you have several less products to use in exchange.  </li>
            <li> I kept my small travel size and went back and got a big one.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s odorless (which is weird because my hair is so fine, it usually attracts every smell in the book, especially smoke).      </li>
            <li> I usually follow up a bit of some sort of argan oil or whatnot, but this product is the central, unchanging key to my hair styling regimen.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest trying the smaller bottle first if you don&#x27;t have a chance to test it out because it is expensive</li>
            <li> So although it is more expensive than I would usually pay for a product, I&#x27;m also getting lots of uses in one spray.</li>
            <li> For long hair it takes a few sprays; for short to median lengths a couple sprays.</li>
            <li> I put it when my hair is still wet, let it sit for 5 minutes, and then blow dry.  </li>
            <li> After applying and scrunching my curls, I would let my hair dry, then fluff with my fingers.</li>

            <li> I have super curly, frizzy, thick hair and its hard to brush through even after conditioning in the shower.</li>

            <li> It made such a mess in the tub.</li>
            <li> I spray just a few pumps into my hair (a little really goes a long way) and comb it through my towel dried hair.  </li>
            <li> I just got back from Aruba where my hair is usually a mess of tangles and frizz</li>
            <li> I have wild freezy hair and this product helps tame it down.</li>
            <li> No more frizzies and my hair stays in place, especially after I have flat ironed it.  </li>
            <li> Even with regular use, I noticed little to no difference with this product.</li>
            <li> One spray wasn&#x27;t enough to do anything to my hair that I couldn&#x27;t with a little moroccan oil, but two made it shiny and oily.</li>

            <li> The product&#x27;s viscosity should always be very thick, and so, when you vigorously shake the bottle, you should not hear a whole lot of sloshing around - if that makes sense.</li>

            <li> I love the scent I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s bad, but I don&#x27;t like it when it became stronger than my perfume.</li>
            <li> There should be at least a clear strip for viewing purposes.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that you can not see what is left and have to go by weight.</li>
            <li> I tried a small travel size of this product first and it lasted at least a couple months, so</li>
            <li> It literally felt like rough straw.</li>
            <li> Looks like i spent hours using a spiral curling iron.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> I used this until the bottle was empty</li>
            <li> &quot; But I was curious, intrigued, so I bought it.</li>
            <li> It came a few days later, and after washing and drying my hair I sprayed it in.    </li>
            <li> It also helps with letting me comb it when still wet with minimal breakage.  </li>
            <li> We used it for roughly 5 days a week for 4 months.</li>

            <li> I use this when my hair is wet and before I blow-dry.</li>
            <li> It also made my hair harder to comb.</li>
            <li> Spray it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> and I spray this on my ends when my hair is still wet after the shower.</li>

            <li> Not much keeps the knots out of my hair but</li>

            <li> This hair concoction may be a bit expensive, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> : be careful who you order from because there are some counterfeits of this product being sold.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for roughly about a year now</li>
            <li> and it is a nightmare to work with when wet.  </li>
            <li> If your hair still feels rough after you thoroughly soak it in a shower, try this product out.</li>
            <li> My hair is not really wavy and curly, but it&#x27;s also not straight, if that makes any sense.  </li>

            <li> After only a few uses, the product no longer sprays but rather comes out in creamy lumps.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday, it makes my thick curly hair so much smoother and detangles my hair with only a few sprays.</li>
            <li> , we got her hair straightened out with minimal breakage.</li>
            <li> It leaves a heavy build up and in my opinion is not for daily use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Mask\\&quot; and after using both just a few times, my hair is back to being manageable,strong, and shiny.</li>
            <li> UNTIL NOW, OMG this product is so beyond what I expected.  </li>

            <li> My hairdresser gave this stuff to me for the first time and I am addicted!</li>
            <li> Other leave in conditioners I have used have required a generous amount to work and then leave my hair flaky.  </li>
            <li> My salon doesn&#x27;t sell this product, but it can be found at &#x27;Hair Cuttery&#x27; and other lower-end</li>
            <li> so I only use a small amount</li>
            <li> I am giving up ALL of my other leave ins in favor of this one.  </li>
            <li> There is no more need for daily conditioner, I just use the 10.</li>
            <li> I thought it was too expensive at first</li>
            <li> Given the price I was hesitant to order but went out on a limb with this after reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Now after having tried at this point I agree with the nearly other 1,000 customers that this stuff gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I was without this product for a month due to a seller on Amazon messing up my order.</li>
            <li> i only have to trim my hair every few time i get my hair done because it protects it from a lot of heat damage!</li>
            <li> in case it arrives his way a second time :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on trying out other products in their line.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super expensive in the stores though, so I always buy on Amazon, and a big bottle like this will last me about 4 or 5 months if I spray a little after each shower (I have shoulder length, thin hair).</li>
            <li> I comb this through my wet hair, then never comb or brush my hair after it&#x27;s dry,  This product seems to help tame the frizzies.</li>
            <li> It does not necessarily do much for keeping the frizz down for me</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A LITTLE EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse (texture) and thick (I have a lot of it), and its a ten DOES do miraculous things to tame and beautify my hair.</li>
            <li> This product does not weigh her hair down, but obviously she&#x27;s a little little kid</li>
            <li> I feel like it de-frizzes my hair as well because my hair doesn&#x27;t get fluffy or frizzy after I blow dry.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-50s and have had trouble with hair loss, dry, tangly and damaged hair from hair dye products.  </li>
            <li> , comb through, and squeeze a few pumps of this product into the curls and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I towel dry and squirt a few pumps into my hand and apply (except for roots).</li>
            <li> After a few months my stylist even noticed a difference withy hair not being as dry.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair managable without any harsh alchol to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I hate paying so much at the hair salon, so buying it here really helps with the pricing.</li>
            <li> , a LITTLE goes a long way, if u spray very much on (its very thick) your hair will be sticky, thick kind-of-feeling.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and my hair is never heavy or weighed down!!!</li>
            <li> I am not a professional and not offering this as advice, but I water this down into a sprayer half and half.</li>
            <li> All of it&#x27;s other claims are about average.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews that it is watered down</li>
            <li> Just a few sprays of this on damp hair, blow dry, and go!</li>
            <li> Be careful when ordering this product because the photo is a little misleading.  </li>
            <li> I just recently bleached my hair and it&#x27;s so hard brushing it compared to the virgin hair I did have.</li>
            <li> also - I do believe this brand is highly overrated, so unless your hair is in desperate need of conditioning, I would just stick with anything you can get at your local stores.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, long and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small and fits in my gym bag, and one bottle goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> at least the smell was ok.&lt;br /&gt;product was very fluid in consistency.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the sprayer cannot reach the bottom of the bottle, leaving  lot of product in the bottle.</li>
            <li> For the money, the product I got was not worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it really does work.</li>
            <li> This stuff, sadly, went straight in the trash bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the weight and quality of the product, but the spray applicator is difficult to use.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Really hurt to throw this EXPENSIVE product out.</li>
            <li> No  more tangles when I comb out my long hair after washing.  </li>
            <li> Also, a bottle lasts at least six months for me because I only use three to four pumps a day.</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is - that it took over 1 month to get my product.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark brown</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have thick curly hair and was hoping that with regular use, it would reduce frizz and restore shine.</li>
            <li> It does that annoying thing where it sticks up and looks frizzy on top.  </li>
            <li> I am caucasian with coarse, thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with thick medium length hair</li>
            <li> I hate using crusty gel or most hair products.  </li>
            <li> This crap sucks makes my hair more gross than</li>
            <li> Its the only thing that controls my curly/wavy thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, color-treated, Asian hair.</li>
            <li> I am Japanese-American and have thick, coarse hair that&#x27;s nearly down to my waist.  </li>
            <li> I am blessed/cursed with very thick curly wavy coarse and now dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thin and naughty hair, prior to using this product it would take me an hour to brush out my hair!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> I can swim in the morning and still have my hair settled down during the day at the office.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a product that feels greasy or slicks my hair down</li>
            <li> Gives shine, body and luster without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Felt like they watered it down or something.</li>
            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look greasy</li>
            <li> I have wavy curly hair and this keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li> This has weighed my hair down.  </li>
            <li> It shines, protects, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> This stuff smooths it down and makes it manageable in the mornings when the time comes to straighten it.</li>
            <li> so we need to cut it down, and that saves us money too.  </li>
            <li> Works well without weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I have problems using conditioner because they all seem to weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and lasts for months.</li>
            <li> (that eliminates my John Frieda smoother product..1 down).  </li>
            <li> But, with time, it seemed to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> it helps keep my friz down in my hair</li>
            <li> This product has cut the combing time down to just under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I saw someone posting about watered down ones being shipped - maybe I had that issue, i don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> all it did was weight my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have to used both hands while pushing the button down.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue (or have a smell after I apply it).  </li>
            <li> that your press down to use.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Wish the price can go down</li>
            <li> does the job without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> , I coat my hair with this after a shower and it never feels oily or weighed down.  </li>
            <li> Keeps flyaways down.  </li>
            <li> It prevents frizzies and split ends &amp; seems rather nourishing, without weighing my hair down or making it oily.</li>
            <li> Product came a week before expected!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but i have had this for almost a year now, and it&#x27;s not even close to empty!</li>
            <li> I usually let it air dry from there.</li>
            <li> I do an all over spray application, then style as usual with Bed Head&#x27;s Foxy Curls and blow dry with diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair, medium length and need just a few sprays over the entire head to go a long way.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested I use this leave-in conditioner to help my curly hair be less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have since purchased it on the internet for much less money, and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  </li>
            <li> (See previous note about Cthulhu and the tentacles that have possessed my head.)</li>
            <li> Lo and behold, my hair immediately felt softer, smoother, much less brittle.</li>
            <li> , I subject it to heat drying and ironing.  </li>
            <li> then I would dilute it a bit with water until you get a slight watery texture</li>
            <li> less buildup?)</li>
            <li> My hair is smoother, softer, and I have less flyaways.  </li>
            <li> Was at my door in less than 2 days.</li>
            <li> that makes a world of difference for less than a quarter of the cost.</li>
            <li> the cost is less than at Ulta.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I needed the formula with keratin, so I&#x27;m not currently using this, but once the keratin treatment starts to go, I&#x27;ll go back to using this.</li>
            <li> and I continue to purchase it through Amazon as it is less priced than she can sell it.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look and feel softer with less damage from hair dryer or iron.</li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;re air drying your hair, you&#x27;ll notice less frizz and fly-aways.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed a lot less breakage since using this product.</li>
            <li> It would have typically tangled but this time it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed my hair getting any softer or less frizzy</li>
            <li> I buy one once a month, even though I could never make it through a bottle in less than a year (and I&#x27;m talking the 4 ouncer - not the 10 ouncer.)</li>
            <li> This stuff provides no shine at all and in fact makes my hair look LESS SHINY.  </li>
            <li> This spray cuts my hair care time in half.</li>
            <li> Start with less and work the product through the hair.  </li>
            <li> I do believe that it is slightly overpriced.</li>
            <li> have seen less hair in tub which</li>
            <li> and I hate for my hair to feel dry, I mix AG Hair Cosmetic Fast Food and Sta Sof Fro Hair &amp; Scalp spray together for extra moisture and protection while my hair is still moist.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my hair stylist is having difficulty finding this particular one.  </li>
            <li> Highly mixed-race hair (well, and the rest of me), as in my family tree looks like my ancestors got bored and went on a seven-continent sex tour.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time also, and you need hardly any to see results.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with a couple other hair products to tame my over processed-back-to-blonde-damage-fest of hair that&#x27;s going on at the moment.</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair when it is a tangled mess and in less than 3 minutes it is perfect,smooth and its like</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by no means bad, but it&#x27;s nothing at all special.</li>
            <li> The product gets gooey and it makes a mess around the nozzle.)</li>
            <li> Anyone who gets their hair highlighted knows that all of that processing makes your hair a tangled mess when you wash it.</li>
            <li> This product I purchased left my hair feeling rough, dirty, oily and doesn&#x27;t even have the same smell.</li>
            <li> I usually spray it on after I shower, wrap my hair up in a turban and leave it like that for 5-20 minutes, and then use a wide tooth comb to comb it out.</li>
            <li> but all I&#x27;ve ever gotten is a sticky crunchy mess that did nothing.  </li>
            <li> Usually takes 15 minutes just to comb all my wet hair out.</li>
            <li> The first time that I used it, I noticed that my hair felt like it had an artificial, almost waxy coating.</li>
            <li> .. I was expecting to use it but its just a mess i don&#x27;t want to scoop product from the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually coming out of this quite confused as I feel like plenty of other products</li>
            <li> I have to use a lot at once, but I have long, thick</li>
            <li> My hair is also long and thick</li>
            <li> If you have long thick hair you need this.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair...very long, thick and curly</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thick, and color-treated, so it&#x27;s prone to tangling when I wash it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered here and it seems to work a little less reliably as a detangler and smoother.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little less frizzy than before.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel weighted down or heavy either.</li>
            <li> My hair is still dull and dry.</li>
            <li> I have dull and dry hair and have been using Moroccan oil for a couple of years now.</li>
            <li> and it is very difficult to find right product for it.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair...</li>
            <li> The bottle is a poor design for average female hands.  </li>
            <li> less dead hair</li>
            <li> Then I blowdry/style it when my hair has just dried to a slightly damp stage.  </li>
            <li> think the smell is a little ooky too.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a little in shock at the results.    </li>
            <li> A little backstory: I have mixed-race hair.</li>
            <li> It even looked a little shinier in the mirror.    </li>
            <li> I just spritz a little at night and in the day.  </li>
            <li> but no better than other products on the market.  </li>
            <li> but I put about 10 sprays in my hand, mix it with a little water and work it in</li>
            <li> Give me shiny silky hair when used, but can make my hair a little static-ey.</li>
            <li> I call this my &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s a little pricey but</li>
            <li> I was experiencing a little hair breakage between relaxers, and purchased this leave-in product at the suggestion of my hairstylist.  </li>
            <li> I need so little.</li>
            <li> And of course too little will just not do the job all over your hair.</li>
            <li> But it seems to make my hair a little greasy feeling</li>
            <li> i use little amount but the flakes build up at the edges.</li>
            <li> Product was a little thick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No matter how little use it is greasy</li>
            <li> Wish it were a little cheaper</li>
            <li> I use it in my little girls hair to get out tangles.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey but a little goes a looong way.</li>
            <li> I color my hair so its always very dry and dull.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is the pump button on this bottle is very hard to dispense.  </li>
            <li> ONE PUMP DILUTED WITH A LITTLE WATER GOES A LONG WAY ESPECIALLY ON BLACK HAIR</li>
            <li> My daughter has thin white blond tight curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I can go to sleep with my messy, moist hair, after I&#x27;ve spritzed it a little with this product, and wake up with</li>
            <li> I think it might be a little too heavy, or I may being too liberal with the application.</li>
            <li> My sister has hair down to her butt!  </li>
            <li> I know that sounds extreme, but I am black with coarse hair, and this is a trusty detangler and moisturizer that has never ever failed me.  </li>
            <li> A few sprays will do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep using it for a few months</li>
            <li> I just spray a few squirts of this on after the shower</li>
            <li> but i waste a lot by doing that.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I also tried using it when I straightened my hair with a round brush and hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years and switched to Unite based on a recommendation from my hair stylist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must for my hair, but was trying to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it over the course of a few days.</li>
            <li> After about 3 days of use I&#x27;ve used up about 20% of the bottle and my hair is still frizzy and fluffy.</li>
            <li> and I always bought at cvs for $38.00 dang what a waste.</li>
            <li> I use this product after shampooing - no conditioner - followed by a few volumizing products.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying its a 10 for a few years now.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair look like it was done at the salon everyday...</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff on my daughter&#x27;s hair for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works, not too heavy even for oily hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for quite a few years and</li>
            <li> After washing my hair while in the shower I spritz on and massage in, wrap my hair in a towel for a few minutes (I leave it on while I do my make-up</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago and have used it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have an enclosed in ground heated swimming pool that I swim a mile in every day all year round</li>
            <li> We have well water and the minerals in it are harsh to my hair.</li>
            <li> A few sprays</li>
            <li> I stopped using this spray for a few months</li>
            <li> /&gt;Running it through my hair, it felt a bit sticky and dried that way too.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I got the hair spray and it was missing the tip</li>
            <li> Plus I just use a round brush with my hair dryer</li>
            <li> and I used it for a couple years, but they changed their formula a few years ago and now it makes my hair feel tacky and no longer</li>
            <li> Not stickey and does not leave a film or heavy feeling on your hair.</li>
            <li> Used along with Dr. Bronners castille soap, this is my everyday conditioner.</li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy on my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Sprayed on towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get oily or heavy, and doesn&#x27;t look like it has any product in it.</li>
            <li> Mine is also on the thin side, and I get regular keratin treatments to protect all the curling and spraying I do to my locks.  </li>
            <li> After years of spending about $50 every few months for Moroccan Oil</li>
            <li> Conditions my hair without it feeling greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles preventing our girls from crying when we brush their hair after washing it.  </li>
            <li> Over - spraying will build up if you don&#x27;t wash your daughter&#x27;s hair everyday.</li>
            <li> USE IT EVERYDAY, WEIGHTLESS AND IMPROVES DAMAGED HAIR</li>
            <li> not too heavy, not too watery.</li>
            <li> However the bottle was broken and it just inn&#x27;t the same when you have to spray it on you hand and massage into hair.</li>
            <li> Well, I got up to look in the mirror and the hair was a dark gray green!</li>
            <li> Would not use again until hair is toned, dried and sealed with an after-treatment.</li>
            <li> Dead ends?</li>
            <li> And why waste?</li>
            <li> I can get a comb through it and put off chopping it off for another few months.</li>
            <li> Sadly the bottle was completely busted and the cap was dangling with product bursted throughout the box and over the bottle</li>
            <li> and I have turned quite a few people to use it</li>
            <li> I spray it on towel dried hair and let it sit for about 5 minutes then when I go to comb my hair</li>
            <li> A few squirts after the shower, brush and your done.</li>
            <li> I am not a HUGE fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff calms it down without making it greasy, and makes morning hair a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> However, I am not able to spray the product on my hair unless I put it on the counter and bend down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a typical product junkie, and when it comes to my hair, I&#x27;ve tried everything!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s softer, less frizzy and it holds curls longer without hairspray!</li>
            <li> Either way, my hair is in no better shape now than it was previously.</li>
            <li> was not as expensive as other prod.that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old has very thin hair.</li>
            <li> I probably purchase this at least every other month or two</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not exactly a conditioner, though, at least not on my hair.</li>
            <li> This had such high reviews, I don&#x27;t hate it.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it could be a little less thicker than my last bottle that was bought in a store, but I might just be paranoid because I have bought fake products online before..</li>
            <li> I tried a friend&#x27;s bottle and it holds with being sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry and dull until I used  &amp;#34;Its a 10 Leave In Product&amp;#34;  I will never go without it !</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying this but not necessarily as a strong repair agent.</li>
            <li> While it does help to tame my &amp;#34;after shower hair fluffs,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s nothing that a bit of hair oil cant do</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money you will be so disappointed just spend the couple extra dollars at ulta or walmart and get it.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t always tame the frizzies</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but it WORKS like no other conditionar or de frizzer or anything i have ever used.</li>
            <li> Since they shampoo 2-4 times a month, it can leave a little build up over a week&#x27;s time, so I usually pour 50% water into a 10 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever even bother trying to comb through my mess of hair without it!  </li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive because of the price, so I bought the small bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s A 10 than with any other product I&#x27;ve tried in the past!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly, long (~16&#x27;)</li>
            <li> The quality is the same as if you were buying it from the company itself, just SO much less expensive.</li>
            <li> It has been sitting underneath my sink for the past few months.  </li>
            <li> Well, it took a few roller sets to realize that it was this product that was leaving my hair very dull with absolutely no shine, after drying and styling.  </li>
            <li> It works nicely, is not sticky and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt weigh your hair down, is not greasy, oily or thick like others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have very long thin hair.</li>
            <li> 5 stars because I noticed it helped my poor, dry hair after just after one use.  </li>
            <li> My sister was truly amazed, so I gave her some for her 4-year old daughter who screams bloody murder whenever her hair is combed or brushed (</li>
            <li> It weighs my hair down a bit, so NO MORE FLYAWAYS at all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but you get what you pay for, I won&#x27;t use anything else after using it&#x27;s a 10!</li>
            <li> My daughter has thin dry brown hair, so this product gives her some leave in moisture help without being heavy, greasy or smelly!  </li>
            <li> Again it takes very little.</li>
            <li> Very little product needed to keep my ends from splitting.  </li>
            <li> I use very little of the product each time so the bottle lasts forever</li>
            <li> Very little is needed</li>
            <li> this is a little thick feeling</li>
            <li> use this everyday!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of past experience buying it from my salon.</li>
            <li> NO MORE TANGLES  YEAH</li>
            <li> I got a small bottle of this from the hair salon and tried it on my twin grandaughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> To think that all of this comes out from one small bottle blows my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps that terrible frizz and keeps strays from sticking up, for the most part.  </li>
            <li> I usually just pour it out</li>
            <li> - I usually end up using a bit of good-old Frizz Ease in addition to this.</li>
            <li> No More Tangles and brute force to detangle my rat&#x27;s nest.  </li>
            <li> and I usually buy them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it now for 6 months and my hair shows no more signs of breakage, or split ends.</li>
            <li> The small 4 oz bottles are upwards of $20</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use this for the past three weeks to see if I noticed a difference</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at the salon for around 35 dollars plus tax.</li>
            <li> I usually spend 15 minutes after bath brushing through my kids hair.</li>
            <li> I usually do 4-5 pumps</li>
            <li> Just buy a small bottle and give a chance to try if it works for you.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 from amazon and I am not sure why it does not work</li>
            <li> I like it but have not seen any miracles for my hair and am not sure if it is even benefiting it.  </li>
            <li> Every two weeks I was having to use expensive products that had to either be left in overnight or heat just to have manageable hair.  </li>
            <li> still had frizz and no more volume than before.</li>
            <li> Mom&#x27;s of girls here is your lifesaver for NO MORE TEARS.  </li>
            <li> this stuff has the most awful chemical smell -it</li>
            <li> It did nothing for the frizz and the smell is awful it did detangle, but I have used many products that can do that.  </li>
            <li> The only miracle I see here is product build up that might fake us to believe it is doing something</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky, smoothed out any frizz, and tangles are a thing of the past</li>
            <li> I was never able to comb my hair upon getting out of the shower</li>
            <li> I even keep a small bottle in my make-up bag for emergencies.</li>
            <li> After one my friend&#x27;s first shower, she was disappointed to find that she&#x27;d forgotten to bring her usual</li>
            <li> Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I purchased a small bottle from the place I get my hair cut.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I learned my lesson and next vacation</li>
            <li> Usually my hair just poofs and frizzes as soon as I walk out the door.</li>
            <li> call me lazy but</li>
            <li> Usually it&#x27;s a bit pricey for me</li>
            <li> I adore this product (usually) but the one I received had the plastic bottle scratched up.</li>
            <li> Waste of money !</li>
            <li> i usually buy from walgreens, but there isnt one in the town</li>
            <li> No more tangles</li>
            <li> Im not sure it they shipped it this way</li>
            <li> A disappointment ..., product was old and didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair.</li>
            <li> Cue a move to Chicago, a climate change that my hair didn&#x27;t like, and three years of going out of my bloody mind trying to keep my hair straight for longer than half an hour.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product because conditioners and the like leave my hair flat and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair that is very difficult to comb after showering but after discovering this product my problems are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> Also very expensive so probably won&#x27;t buy again unless it is less money next time.</li>
            <li> I used to be unable to grow it out long for it looking brittle</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but I use maybe 3 squirts on my long hair, so it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> When I say a lot, I mean that it had been dyed in 2 month intervals for the past 11 years.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> my hair was dull and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I still have the frizz, looks dull and the scent is nonexistent.</li>
            <li> Dull hair?</li>
            <li> and my hair is so hard to comb</li>
            <li> It made my hair &amp;#34;too soft&amp;#34; which made it hard to style.</li>
            <li> This product came highly recommended to me by a friend, but I have to say that I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Ulta doesn&#x27;t allow coupons for this product and that really sucks.</li>
            <li> Tolerable, at least.</li>
            <li> and I have crazy thick coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> Some people complained about the smell</li>
            <li> I purchase this product at least once a month.  </li>
            <li> Some times I have to shower at the gym and their shampoo sucks</li>
            <li> Larger size like this was awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I spray at least 10 times before brushing.</li>
            <li> at least 6 month.</li>
            <li> Works overall, just a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> My hair is twice as thick after using this for 2 years.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair, and I straighten it.</li>
            <li> The product is thick and a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> So after washing my hair, I sprayed this thick lotion substance on my hair</li>
            <li> but I have a TON of them, giving the illusion that I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t tested it in real heavy humidity as of now.</li>
            <li> Works well on thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, like a conditioner, so you have to prime the pump</li>
            <li> I have thick but damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it myself for my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> What can I say, other than....Love It!!!!</li>
            <li> No more tears when combing their hair!</li>
            <li> I mean it.  </li>
            <li> and* save you money because you can cut out other expensive products you use.</li>
            <li> Well, and in other countries, where they are illegal.  </li>
            <li> Mine usually lasts me almost a year as long as I don&#x27;t use it excessively - and so the price isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> hair that couldn&#x27;t grow are now growing past my shoulders!</li>
            <li> In fact, the product, when shaken hard, should sound/feel very thick - almost hard to believe a liquid that thick can be &amp;#34;sprayed&amp;#34; out of the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was way unpleasant and led to a ridiculously short Dorothy Hamill style haircut in 5th grade.  </li>
            <li> It did nothing, in fact my hair looked worse than usual.   </li>
            <li> I have been using this product about 2-3 years, and usually after a while of use, some products will lose their effectiveness or your hair develops tolerance or it builds up in an unhealthy way on your hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought it and first use I hated.</li>
            <li> I have this horrible thin, stringy, thinning, fine hair that runs in my family.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for a less expensive option to detangle my daughters hair</li>
            <li> My hair is seriously like in a dreadlock after I wash it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously a miracle with my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Haircare For Less, who fulfilled my order, must not be an authorized retailer.  </li>
            <li> (Seriously-</li>
            <li> Bed Heads Maxxed out hairspray which provides some serious hold...</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t be ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> So mad at myself for waiting so long.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and sometimes it can be hard to manage.</li>
            <li> I have medium frizzy curly hair and this 10 miracle product made my hair feel dirty after applying it while my hair was wet.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it was always difficult to tame it until I found this product.</li>
            <li> First it smells horrible , and 2nd it made my hair feel &amp; look so dry ,I hate it and won&#x27;t use it again!</li>
            <li> This product is crazy expensive for a tiny bottle where my wife gets here hair done.  </li>
            <li> There are at least 10 reasons why I like this product!</li>
            <li> Not sure why so expensive</li>
            <li> This product is small and expensive.</li>
            <li> My hair is in recovery mode because last time I got highlights the lady fried my hair. :(  </li>
            <li> Not good for thin hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard about this product from several people and I have to admit I am disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> and I have used it every day since on both mine and my daughter&#x27;s tough to comb hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anybody with Tough hair to brush.</li>
            <li> Does the job in tough knots in damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair &amp; I like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> I have very thick unmanageable hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick, frizzy, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair that takes a lot of maintenance.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, course and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> but then I noticed some shedding, then EXCESSIVE shedding, and now my hair is falling out in clumps!!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I find this bottle hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Because my hair is so thin, I don&#x27;t like using a lot of products, but I need something to protect my hair.</li>
            <li> I am totally addicted to this product.</li>
            <li> and the worse dryness and frizz is gone....</li>
            <li> But hey, it ain&#x27;t broken, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted.  </li>
            <li> My hair follicles are thin</li>
            <li> hair is shoulder length, wavy, thin, and oily.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave behind a filmy oily residue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything else on my hair (coconut oil treatments made it worse, BS/ACV no-poo made it worse) and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> This product smells terrible, my whole family is trying to get away from me</li>
            <li> When I found out I was pissed and annoyed because once again I had to start the search for something to help with my knotty hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 &amp; looked worse than any teenager.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> I hate to wash it because it is such a chore to comb through it.  </li>
            <li> Spray bottle came broken.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> I will never stray away from using this product again; THAT was frustrating.</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying I have extremely frizzy, poofy, wavy hair that has been bleached (bad idea).</li>
            <li> Seriously, you won&#x27;t regret using it!</li>
            <li> For as long as this crap is taking to get here</li>
            <li> saw a dramatic change in her hair health after using this product for a week.</li>
            <li> Even after a home blow dry (which is usually the worst option in terms of how my hair feels when it&#x27;s done)</li>
            <li> The sun and chlorine killed my hair, and was painful to brush.</li>
            <li> but it also makes my hair extremely vulnerable to breakage and drying because the follicles are thin</li>
            <li> Made my hair soft, but MADE MY SKIN BREAK OUT HORRIBLY!!</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but if you struggle with tangles and impossible knots or have a little one with it, you&#x27;ll appreciate the peace after using this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair eventually got to the worst case scenario possible: my salon made a mistake and over bleached my hair by approximately 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product went bad</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
            <li> You will NOT BE SORRY.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed and will not be wasting money on this product again.</li>
            <li> I would purchase again if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fake?</li>
            <li> think \\&quot;oh cool\\&quot;, and then they go in the \\&quot;ill</li>
            <li> My friend is a hair stylist at an expensive salon</li>
            <li> All these chemicals we put on our bodies in just questionable.</li>
            <li> My daughter is one for hating to have her hair brushed, resulting in nasty tangles, so someone recommended this product to me.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, it is a bit difficult to use.</li>
            <li> And so expensive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy</li>
            <li> I have horrible breakage, especially when the seasons change and this product helps eliminate almost all breakage.</li>
            <li> but they are so expensive in salon.</li>
            <li> Obsessed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an expensive product and some places will not give you a refund of your money.</li>
            <li> I am a mix woman and finding a product the works for my type of hair has been difficult.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using it wrong</li>
            <li> I went to target and couldn&#x27;t believe how expensive it was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to get a grip.  </li>
            <li> its expensive</li>
            <li> I no longer need the expensive shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive...</li>
            <li> but it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> I know it seems unfair to her,  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I am addicted!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is difficult to get started.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Clearly, based on the reviews, I could be wrong about what this can do for which hair types, etc....</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I do not recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> WRONG...</li>
            <li> and it was quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it contains parabens</li>
            <li> and she was skeptical</li>
            <li> Cons: too expensive but can be purchased through Amazon.com for a discoutnt.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I checked it online and found that it was expensive for someone who doesn&#x27;t like to wear stuff in her hair.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a try because I was using another product which made my hair look weird after couple of months on using it and made my face oily.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Well Ive never been so wrong in my life.</li>
            <li> The product works well but is expensive</li>
            <li> This product has a weird smell and contains parabens too.</li>
            <li> this item is fake</li>
            <li> How ever, I think the bottle I have received is a fake.</li>
            <li> Getting a comb through it after washing is difficult, but not when I use</li>
            <li> Sadly, I believed the hype.</li>
            <li> And didn&#x27;t leave grease behind!</li>
            <li> Even after that, I could detect a faint hint of it wherever I went all day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useless now</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin</li>
            <li> my duaghters hair is very thin and knots.</li>
            <li> i just dont know why the price has been slowly going up its annoying</li>
            <li> The tangling is especially bad when my hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed based on all the raving reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next!</li>
            <li> Some guys can pull off a crazy hipster fro.</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t had it cut in 11 months, so the ends are split and in need of cutting or ....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a life saver during the swimming season with the harsh pool water and at the beach with that nasty sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It leaves a weighted dirty feeling on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day, my niece with crazy curly hair uses it, and my sister in law too.</li>
            <li> Yeah, Princess Diana dealt with her hair by cutting it off.  </li>
            <li> As a last-ditch effort before cutting it,  I decided to give It&#x27;s a 10 a try.  </li>
            <li> I am afraid of loosing hair from my tangles</li>
            <li> I sprayed this stuff into damp hair and combed through like the directions advised but the result was just downright disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I was suffering from split ends and was contemplating cutting my hair off.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every 3 days, this never gives it that greasy, dirty feeling.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Just so expensive!</li>
            <li> I stopped using this since and no more disgusting grime washing out of my hair.</li>
            <li> For a while, my hair was on the verge of falling out in clumps and this was useless!</li>
            <li> it stinks so bad.</li>
            <li> Because of those problems, the pump is very difficult to push.  </li>
            <li> my daughter has spirally curls that are very difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> Because I never, in my wildest dreams, would have imagined anything so idiotic.</li>
            <li> Smoothing and adds softness that my brittle hair needs badly.</li>
            <li> too bad i got home and noticed i just noticed</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> , I won&#x27;t buy it again  :(</li>
            <li> I m absolutely disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Not making it silky or smoother or any of the things it should be doing :(</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s expensive!!    </li>
            <li> Before you did any crap to it.</li>
            <li> This morning I used my Miracle Leave-In and HOLY CRAP</li>
            <li> and it is TRIPLE the price which is annoying because everything here is DOUBLE/TRIPLE the price.</li>
            <li> My hairfalls about 4-5 inches below the base of my neck</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCTS IS VERY BAD</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed and will be returning the item.</li>
            <li> This product is a must-have for me, but store prices are outrageous.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, over the weekend I had a horrible dye job done on my hair.</li>
            <li> terrible combination for tangles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tresemme&#x27;s smoothing spray was awful</li>
            <li> I have awful hair.</li>
            <li> I was horribly embarrassed, couldn&#x27;t wear my hair in a ponytail, tried to cover to hide my face.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> This made my hair feel horrible.  </li>
            <li> My weekend wasn&#x27;t horrible to begin with</li>
            <li> This was one of the worst treatments I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Absolutely love it - gives you hair such a smooth soft feeling without any greasiness or residue.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this by my Ulta Salon stylist. All of the stylists there swear by this stuff. It is expensive, but considering that this one product replaces 3 products that I normally use I&#x27;m actually either breaking even or saving money. I used to use an anti-frizz serum, and a flat iron spray for flat ironing, and a leave in strengthening conditioner spray for blow drying. Now all I use is this. My stylist usually uses the light formula for all of her clients, but told me I could use the regular formula be a use my hair is so thick. I have used the regular formula twice and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. My hair is sleek, shiny, and bounces when I walk.  For reference I have relaxed, color treated hair that I flat iron 2 to 3 times a week. I usually alternate between straightened hair and roller sets. I&#x27;m so glad that I can buy the product here cheaper than at Ulta. Ulta doesn&#x27;t allow coupons for this product and that really sucks.</li>
            <li> I have thick mexican hair and its always tangled beacause its so long. This stuff cuts the brushing time in half, its amazing. Its definately worth the price! Smells great, and leaves hair super soft!</li>
            <li> I use this daily and I love it, this is the best leave in conditioner ever! I have been using this for a few years now and Amazon is the only place for the best price!</li>
            <li> I use this after every shampoo/hair wash! I can really tell a difference from when I use this product and when I don&#x27;t. I dye my hair often, so my hair is very dry on its own, even after using conditioner.. this however makes my hair smooth and shiny! I get compliments on my hair after using this! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using too much of the product though, or it&#x27;ll leave your hair feeling sticky for awhile. A few sprays will do.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I bought this to use with my new Karmin straightener and use this after straightening my hair, it really helps reduce any frizz.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  In local stores this is $50+  Great savings and find</li>
            <li> Been using for a long time</li>
            <li> Works great on my curly hair. Leaves it soft and curly. The only problem I had was that the spray pump was difficult to pump after the first few uses. I think it got sticky. But the product itself was great.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so soft and shiny. It smells really good too and the scent lingers for awhile. I love using this when I don&#x27;t want to style my hair and let it dry naturally as well.</li>
            <li> use this everyday! i have bought it more than once!</li>
            <li> It is okay, but not as good as I expected. I feel like I have to spray a lot to really feel the difference when brushing, and my hair is not that difficult since I have straight and fine hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is a  miracle! I will never be without it! Leaves my hair silky, soft, and smooth!</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin so it breaks very easily, giving me lots of split ends, but this product keeps my hair  very soft and strong and healthy. I love it. Also, I go to the beach a lot, and I use this to try to prevent my hair from getting damaged by the sun and it works too.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is a 10. I normally don&#x27;t splurge on hair care products for myself, but when my sister in law gave me hers to sample, I fell in love with it. It makes my hair silky, smoothed out any frizz, and tangles are a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very curly but thin, middle aged hair with about 10-20 percent gray. I color my hair at home and use a blow dryer daily. There is some damage from the daily heat and coloring, and the ends are pretty dry. When I spray this stuff on my wet hair, the brush glides right through it. It protects my hair from the daily heat of the dryer, and my hair is so soft that it feels like a little kid&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and I never want to be without it, but......Being the thrifty person that I am, I started looking around for a cheaper alternative. I tried something called &amp;#34;7&amp;#34; from a beauty supply store because the sales lady said it was just like &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34;. Nope. She lied. &amp;#34;7&amp;#34; should be called &amp;#34;Zero&amp;#34; because that&#x27;s what it was. It turned my hair to straw. It literally felt like rough straw. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I came across Pantene Repair Light Conditioner. It comes in a spray bottle and you use it just like &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34;. WOW! It&#x27;s wonderful and it softened my hair, detangled it, and took away all the frizz just like &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; but costs about $3.00 a bottle. I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two products. &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; is a fantastic spray, but it&#x27;s so expensive. If you can afford it, that&#x27;s great. But if you need a less expensive, but just as great alternative, give the Pantene a try.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling overly greasy.</li>
            <li> I swim daily and have very long hair. This product works. I get out of the pool, spary my hair and continue with my day.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to put too much in your hair or it will get too limp.  It seems to be great in protecting your hair when blow drying and has eliminated my need for Moroccan oil.  It makes my hair very soft and shiny so I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This product is crazy expensive for a tiny bottle where my wife gets here hair done.  So instead of bleeding money we picked up this larger bottle for a much better price than in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Would give it full 5 stars but it is loaded with Parabens! Parabens are cancer causing and NO company should be putting these in their products. These ingredients should be banned! It&#x27;s a cheap chemical ingredient that is VERY harmful to us. The product itself does all that it claims it does but won&#x27;t be purchasing again unless they take the Parabens out.</li>
            <li> I started using this product after I got a perm that major fried my hair.  The difference was amazing from the first time I used it and just got better with each use.  Recently I ran out and did not use it for about 4 weeks and I noticed the difference in my ends they were dryer towards the end of the 4 weeks.  So I bought some more and way nice again.  I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product...Again it takes very little.</li>
            <li> Now that my hair has &amp;#34;matured&amp;#34; pool water frizzes it even more than when I was younger. With this leave in conditioner I can swim in the morning and still have my hair settled down during the day at the office. Same is true showering after work at the gym;  I can go out to dinner  and my hair will dry flat. The bottle is small and fits in my gym bag, and one bottle goes a long way.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My hair is not only thick, it is dry. This spray does a great job by itself but it also tolerates additional moisturizing leave-in products without making a sticky or flaky mess.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of past experience buying it from my salon. I found it on Amazon for 1/2 the price, it is a great detangler and hair softner.  Smells great too</li>
            <li> Works very well on long hair.</li>
            <li> my hair feels so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Not only does this smell fantastic but it moisturize my hair and it&#x27;s super soft. I love this so much! I have no regrets~</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I spray it on after every shower and my hair is now soft and shiny. I also purchased the It&#x27;s a 10 hair mask, which when I have a bit more time to take care of myself in the morning is fantastic as well. But for day-to-day maintenance, this stuff is amazing! Your hair will thank you.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, color-treated hair. This product is wonderful, in that I can now comb my hair while damp!  Keeps hair tangle free and shiny. I am totally sold on this product...use it daily!!Highly Recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Bigger is better! I wish I kept my 4oz bottle around for airport travel though. I&#x27;m thinking this one will last me a while!</li>
            <li> I used to have dry hair from years of bleaching and dying. But I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 months now and my hair has never looked better. I used to be unable to grow it out long for it looking brittle but now I have super long hair and it doesn&#x27;t fade my color. I use it every day, best thing I was ever recommended to use, plus it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length blond hair and this was a little too heavy for daily use but great for weekly or dry hair days.  PERFECT for putting in your hair before going into chlorinated pools, ocean or even when just pulling your hair back for a day in the sun.  I use the white bottle It&#x27;s a 10 for daily use, and it works so well that I put it in a small spray bottle, spray about 4-6 into my palm while still in the shower and give it one splash of water to get overall coverage.  Squeeze out excess water and it&#x27;s incredibly soft!!</li>
            <li> Used as directed after every shampoo. After a couple of weeks, restored and revitalized hair damage caused by blow dryers and curling irons. I have used this product for 1 - 1.5 yrs. and will continue to do so to keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> this is my absolute favorite hair product. i put it on my hair after i get out of the shower and it leaves hair feeling so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it&#x27;s great. Detangles hair quickly and leaves it soft &amp; smooth. Glad it was easy to purchase this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product works great with my hair, but I prefer to rinse it out after it has been on my hair a few minutes. I don&#x27;t like a product that feels greasy or slicks my hair down, my hair is very fine and this works very well for me. I has a clean smell not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Product arrived before estimated delivery date and it lives up to it&#x27;s name: it&#x27;s like a miracle product. Leaves my hair smoother than ever, all while conditioning and strengthening. I&#x27;ve definitely seen a big difference just in the couple of weeks I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the great reviews.  My hair is quite long these days and I was looking for a detangler to avoid hacking thru it post shower.  In addition to being an awesome detangler, I find that my hair is less greasy after 2 days and much softer.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My 2 daughters and I use this product everday. It does not way your hair down and our hair feels so soft after using this leave in conditioner. i&#x27;ve tried so many other products and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!!! It has truly changed my hair--gone are split ends and breaking hair--if you color or process your hair in any way, buy this product now!</li>
            <li> I used this for many years for my thin, straight blonde hair.  It worked well to condition, smooth and give my hair shine.  I ran out one time and my hairdresser recommended something else that also worked well.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for about five minutes.  I have curly, color treated hair with extensions and  I straighten it a couple of times a week.  Usually, when I use a hot air brush my hair is straight until I wash it again, and the extensions mix well with my real hair.  Two or three spritzes of this did nothing.  Neither did 8 or 9.  Nothing.  My hair didn&#x27;t seem protected from the heat.  As soon as it was dry it was completely frizzy, even after drying it with the hot air brush.  I had to pull out my straightening iron, and even after that my hair would frizz within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;I had the same experience as the woman who had her&#x27;s solidify in the bottle.  Mine did too.  After using for about a week I noticed that it felt too much like water in my hand. I looked into the bottle and the solution had indeed separated.  But even shaking the bottle until all of it was remixed this stuff did nothing to help my hair.  It now feels extremely dry.</li>
            <li> What can I say, other than....Love It!!!!</li>
            <li> LIQUID GOLD FOR MY HAIR AND MY DAUGHTERS HAIR. NO MORE TANGLES  YEAH</li>
            <li> I received the leave in treatment with Keratin.  That is not what I ordered.  I ordered the product shown here.  I have ordered it before and gotten the correct item</li>
            <li> I got a small bottle of this from the hair salon and tried it on my twin grandaughter&#x27;s hair.  One has fine and one has coarse.  It works great on both.  No more tears when combing their hair!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I have very long, fine hair and it&#x27;s the only stuff that gets my tangles out.</li>
            <li> My friend raved about this product so I just had to try it!  Indeed, it is the best moisturizer and detanlger I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I am fortunate that my hair is \\&quot;nice\\&quot; so I never had to worry about taking care of my hair.  That being said, I always try to take care of myself by using good products.  This product smells wonderful and is amazing at detanlging your hair and keeping it that way through the next morning. I have long hair and was pleasantly surprised the following morning that my hair remained tangle free.  My hair smelled great, had great shine, and felt soft and silky to the touch.  I told my coworkers and they too fell in love with this product!  I really like the fact that it also works to protect your hair from the damage from heated styling tools! Love the fact that it does not feel heavy or greasy!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this and see a \\&quot;Miracle\\&quot; with my hair.  Very Dissapointed!!!  This product left my hair frizzy.  I tried it for a couple of days hoping the frizz was something I was doing.  No, it&#x27;s the product.  I have fine but thick wavy hair.  My hair (curls) did so much better without this product.  My best bet is using a leave in creme conditioner and gently drying my hair.  Sorry. but I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product on wet or dry hair. Gives shine, body and luster without weighing it down. It also helps very much to detangle.</li>
            <li> I have always used this product.  I6t does so much more than condition you hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this prodcut for years and still love it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!!! You never expect the result is instant!! I have a permed curly hair n I do not like to apply styling product, this product can be acted as a styling product n yet it provide the nutrient that needed for my hair.... I have a beautiful n natural curly hair that I wanted after I hav using it...totally love it</li>
            <li> my hairdresser recomended it. i balked at the price, but got some anyway. It is expensive, but it WORKS like no other conditionar or de frizzer or anything i have ever used. I have very long, very thick, very wavy hair. if i wash, put it in my  hair, and leave it to air dry, it turns into beauitiful, lush, gorgeous soft shiny curly hair. Looks like i spent hours using a spiral curling iron. i was amazed. I had more than 10 strangers comment on how pretty my hair was that first day im not joking. If i straigten it, it looks sleek and shiny. My 7 year old has very thin hair. It makes her hair thick and full, and her natural waves end up smooth and shiney at the end of the day, where before if it wasnt pulled up she looks like she has been in a tornado by the time school is over. Love it love it. WORTH THE HIGH PRICE.</li>
            <li> My hair is twice as thick after using this for 2 years. It really is a miracle on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 from this product but receive on only and the ather one was with keratin(without head cover)</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this product last summer and I thought I would give it a try. Since then it has become a family favorite. With two young swimmers in the house, we need all the help we can get. Their hair is always tangled up and abused with all the chlorine in the water. This product is everything it claims to be! It takes so little to make our hair smooth and manageable. Since then, I have started buying \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; for my extended family when I need a quick and easy gift. Everyone has been happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Best detangler for naturally curly hair out there!!!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this at a salon and loved it. I ordered here and it seems to work a little less reliably as a detangler and smoother. I wonder if my hair builds tolerance or if this is an inferior product in comparison to the salon sample. At any rate, this was the least expensive price, both locally and online, that I was able to find the product at.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It really protects my hair.</li>
            <li> It does minimize the frizz without the same flattening effect that you get with silicone products, but you have to use a fair bit of product to get the best results. And it gives a great shine. I am not certain whether the product has the ability to penetrate the hair shaft though. So the results may be truly temporary and only achieved with consistent/daily use. (They could also improve upon the spray nozzle. The product gets gooey and it makes a mess around the nozzle.)</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It smells wonderful and has mad my hair so much softer!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/wavy hair that can be a little rebellious &amp; my ends tend to get ragged pretty easily. It lasts forever &amp; makes my hair feel awesome. I just bought my 2nd bottle &amp; will definitely keep using it daily.</li>
            <li> been using product for a year of so, love the product, smells great</li>
            <li> Love this product! Have never found anything else as good as this! Quick delivery too!</li>
            <li> Good product. Good service. Thx</li>
            <li> Really Like This Product,</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair really soft and its a great detangler. Arrived on time and as expected. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Best leave-in ever! Makes my hair super easy to brush and helps it dry light and shiny. And this is the absolute best price I have ever paid for a huge bottle like this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took so long for me to try this product.  Honestly this is one of my best leave ins so far.  Holy Grail.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it and try other products from this line.  You will not regret this purchase if you choose to buy.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested I use this leave-in conditioner to help my curly hair be less frizzy.  So I purchased it from the salon and used the whole bottle.  It has tamed my frizzy curles and enabled me to grow my hair longer and have it look &amp; feel healthy.  I have since purchased it on the internet for much less money, and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Not my 1st time buying!</li>
            <li> Love it, can&#x27;t live without it. Really helps out with dry and damaged hair that would normally dry frizzy.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works well!</li>
            <li> I used this until the bottle was empty but I probably wont buy it again. I have naturally thick and coarse blonde hair thats been bleached and dyed to hell and back and it can suck up moisture like a desert. While it does help to tame my &amp;#34;after shower hair fluffs,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s nothing that a bit of hair oil cant do (Chi&#x27;s oil is the best, plus I can use on dry haired as well, which I cant with this stuff). Maybe I was just expecting more after reading the rave rewiews.&lt;br /&gt;I think the smell is a little ooky too. Nothing too unpleasant and definitely a scent I could deal with if I had loved the product. Ah well.</li>
            <li> I have the frizziest hair ever! I tried several &amp;#34;anti-frizz&amp;#34; products from several brands such as tresemme, ausie, garnier, etc and nothing. Miracle 10 controls the frizz beautifully!!! I love it and it also helps to define my natural wavy hair. It truly was like a miracle to my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally gush about products, so this is going to sound a little bit like a shill piece written by a salesperson, probably. It&#x27;s not. I&#x27;m probably just talking like a giddy dip**** because I just finished styling my hair with this stuff and I&#x27;m a little in shock at the results.    A little backstory: I have mixed-race hair. Highly mixed-race hair (well, and the rest of me), as in my family tree looks like my ancestors got bored and went on a seven-continent sex tour. Unfortunately \\&quot;Dry, frizzy, and curly\\&quot; won the lottery as far as hair texture, though when I lived in Louisiana I was fine as long as I got relaxers and touch-ups every few months and used the right products. Cue a move to Chicago, a climate change that my hair didn&#x27;t like, and three years of going out of my bloody mind trying to keep my hair straight for longer than half an hour. Whether I put the relaxer in myself or had a stylist do it, it never straightened fully; flat-ironing would finish it off, but the second I had to put any type of moisturizer in my hair (and with my hair type, I have to) it would immediately curl back up. Flat-ironing it again did nothing but make it frizzy and crunchy, even using the styling products recommended at various salons. They&#x27;d leave my hair waxy, gummy, tangled, partially straightened but mostly just a bushy mess that snapped combs in half like the hungry tentacles of Cthulhu. Not to mention repeated flat-ironing damaged my hair, even using protective products. Wrapping? Nothing. I&#x27;d just end up with a funny-shaped &#x27;fro. I can&#x27;t exactly afford to spend $200 every other day and four hours in a salon for them to go through the whole process for me, only for it to bunch up the second I walked out of the climate-controlled environment. I pretty much gave up, cropped my hair short, hid it under a do-rag, and thanked whatever was listening that I worked from home so I didn&#x27;t have to see people very often. Some guys can pull off a crazy hipster fro. I&#x27;m not one ofthem.    I ran across It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-in Product as a product recommendation when I was shopping for a multi-pack of combs. (See previous note about Cthulhu and the tentacles that have possessed my head.) I read the product description, read the reviews, thought \\&quot;Yeah, right, but these people don&#x27;t have hair like mine. It won&#x27;t work. Nothing works.\\&quot; But I was curious, intrigued, so I bought it. It came a few days later, and after washing and drying my hair I sprayed it in.    Lo and behold, my hair immediately felt softer, smoother, much less brittle. I combed it through my curls and was pretty surprised at how easily the comb went through, like the spray changed my hair type and texture immediately. It even looked a little shinier in the mirror.    \\&quot;Well, so great. Now I have manageable curls. I don&#x27;t want curls, dang it.\\&quot;    But I was even more intrigued. I decided to order the repair mask (&#x27;cause really, I needed it after months of neglect since I gave up on my hair), the shampoo, and the conditioner. If I was going to experiment with this stuff, I was going to do it right. While I waited for the other products, I kept using the leave-in product daily, and watching my hair texture improve with each passing day. Finally the rest of the products came. Moment of truth, right? Wash my hair, condition it, then use the repair mask. Spray the leave-in product in, blow-dry, then use the leave-in product again as a flat-iron aid. First thing I discovered: don&#x27;t use more than a light spritz per section of hair, unless you enjoy the sound and smell of moisture steaming off your hair at high temperatures. (It sounds like bacon on a griddle. It smells like...well, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.) Second thing I discovered:    I have straight hair now, it&#x27;s staying that way, and I think I&#x27;ll be spending way too much money on this stuff, but it&#x27;s still cheaper than thrice-weekly salon visits.    It&#x27;s not perfect. My hair isn&#x27;t perfectly glossy-smooth, yadda yadda. I don&#x27;t look like a Pantene commercial. But my hair&#x27;s straight and soft, it moves when I turn my head instead of hanging there in a stiff, fried mess, it&#x27;s got a fairly decent shine, and it looks healthy. It&#x27;s been about a day now and it&#x27;s holding, too. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll curl back up when I wash it, but that&#x27;s fine. It won&#x27;t take me long to fix that. There is a bit of a waxy residue when I run my fingers through it, and I don&#x27;t really like the feel of that, but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried. Tolerable, at least. Using a boar-bristle brush after flat-ironing helps get rid of some of the waxiness, and also adds shine and helps settle a bit of a cloudy/floaty \\&quot;poof\\&quot; effect caused by separating the hair with a fine-tooth comb to straighten in sections.    Short version of the review: if you have mixed-race, frizzy, or otherwise problem hair, this stuff could be a lifesaver, though it works better in conjunction with other products from the same brand. It&#x27;s not going to fix your hair overnight, especially if it&#x27;s damaged, and it&#x27;s still going to take some work--but it&#x27;ll make that work a lot easier than it was before. I&#x27;m going to keep using it for a few months and if I see noticable repair and improvement that&#x27;s worth crowing about, I&#x27;ll come back with an update to my review.</li>
            <li> Just received it. As soon as I used the first pump of the spray onto my hands, I felt an immediate difference. I had a few pumps left of the real product, which I purchased from a hair salon, and the comparison was obvious. This one I ordered was a lot thinner than the actual product. Felt like they watered it down or something. Never buying it from Amazon again. I&#x27;m gonna stick to actual salon retailers.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years, stores locally either stopped selling it or the price went sky high!  Amazons prices were what I was used to paying and don&#x27;t have to worry about it not being available!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is mixed (white/black). She unfortunately got my hair (white) in the genetic gift bag, however, either due to being young or mixed she is less oily than me... So this product is used every morning in my house!  My daughter has thin dry brown hair, so this product gives her some leave in moisture help without being heavy, greasy or smelly!  We love it!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; is such a great product for your hair, it protects against heat and makes your hair less frizzy. My product came very early as well which is fantastic. I&#x27;d recommend this seller and product again.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I love the price.</li>
            <li> Its a 10 miracle product is awesome!!! It works so well on my hair and my daughters hair. Especially when we have been at the pool all day.....spraying it after being in the water helps keep my hair and my daughters hair healthy. I would recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Awesome prices and product</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff to use when I set my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair. Leaves it feeling soft and looking shiny.</li>
            <li> Well I could if I HAD to, but I&#x27;d rather not.  Makes combing out very easy, and my hair feels so soft and healthy!  I take it snorkeling with me to comb out my hair after being under salt water for hours, and it works like a charm.  I HIGHLY recommend It&#x27;s A Miracle products. Even my stylist loves it!</li>
            <li> I am wondering if the reviews are real or fictitious advertising after using this product.  I have wavy frizzy hair and I have sprayed quite a bit of this onto my wet hair and left it to dry naturally.  It barely does more than just regular conditioner.  I&#x27;ve already ordered a different product to try and should have returned this one.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about this product, my hair was dry, brittle, breaking and damaged like no other. Years of dying my hair out of a box had completely wrecked havoc on my once-gorgeous hair to the point where I couldn&#x27;t even run a brush through it when I got out of the shower. In fact, I once broke the handle right off my brush attempting to.  My friend gave me this product to try out when I was on the market for a helpful hair product to turn my damaged locks around and I haven&#x27;t even glanced back since. THIS PRODUCT SAVED MY HAIR. Within two or three uses I could see a noticeable difference... my hair was shiny, smooth, vibrant and full of life. But, it wasn&#x27;t just the look or the appearance of the hair that sold me, my hair actually FELT like it was healthy, gorgeous new hair. There were no traces of dryness or damage at all. It completely transformed my hair and I am soooo thankful for this product. I plan on stocking up and telling every one I know about this. Could not be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have tried every condition/hair product known to man. I saw an ad in Glamour and decided to buy \\&quot;Its a 10\\&quot;. Let me tell you. This is the BEST leave in hair product I have ever used. It does exactly what the bottle says. I color my hair so its always very dry and dull. It is now VERY, VERY silky, soft, shiny and wonderful. Stop whatever your doing and buy it. You will NOT BE SORRY.</li>
            <li> I normally LOVE this product...that is..when I get it from ulta. This stuff is definitely not the same thing. Do not waste your money you will be so disappointed just spend the couple extra dollars at ulta or walmart and get it. This stuff did nothing for my hair. Normally with a small amount of this stuff I am able to brush my hair out with ease. With this particular bottle I bought on Amazon I had to use a ton of product and still could barely get the brush through my hair!</li>
            <li> An absolute miracle in a bottle. Works wonderfully on my daughters naturally curly hair. Especially when she wakes up with tangles.&lt;br /&gt;We saw a dramatic change in her hair health after using this product for a week.</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of leave-in products, and this one is by far the best.  Instant detangling, frizz control and heat protection.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all.  I am hooked!    Try their hair mask too - it is awesome!</li>
            <li> I got the product fast and I love it!  It came quickly and there was no problems.  This product is amazing and I would recommend it to everyone.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair and this stuff is really the only way I get a brush through damp hair without ripping all of it out. I spray it on the brush and work from there. Unlike some other products it does not make my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair had been through a lot. When I say a lot, I mean that it had been dyed in 2 month intervals for the past 11 years. Even worse, I have been light blonde for 8 years - I have naturally black hair; I&#x27;m Chinese and my hair is super dark and pretty coarse. To get to this stage, I have to go through a double process where I must work with bleach, then with toner. My hair eventually got to the worst case scenario possible: my salon made a mistake and over bleached my hair by approximately 30 minutes. Hair was falling out because the bleach had started \\&quot;melting\\&quot; my hair, and the slightest touch would break tons of strands off. I was living my nightmare, and every day, I would see a huge handful of broken hairs in my shower drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product had been no less than a miracle for me. My hair was extremely dry on the ends, and very oily on the scalp. Somehow, this product made my hair feel evenly moisturized throughout. It helped stopped major breakage due to bleach, although I would also have to attribute some of that to the Aphogee Two-Step Protein Treatment, too. I had to stop and check to make sure that my hair was really my hair when I first put this product on and finished blow drying. I have not had such soft and beautiful hair since I was a child. In fact, my hair is now softer than I&#x27;ve ever felt before! Another bonus is that it adds shine, manageability, heat protection, and some volume. To think that all of this comes out from one small bottle blows my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first purchased the 4 oz. bottle because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work and because it&#x27;s pretty costly. I had spent a lot of money on other products with great reviews (think upwards of $3,000), which just didn&#x27;t work for the problem I had with my hair breakage from bleach. This product worked so well (I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now) that I have just purchased the 10 oz. bottle without caring at all about the price because this absolutely works.</li>
            <li> Really great product!  I have really frizzy, born with real curly hair - and this totally does the job!  No more frizzies and my hair stays in place, especially after I have flat ironed it.  I just spritz a little at night and in the day.  More than plenty in this bottle!  Very happy customer!</li>
            <li> Well I haven&#x27;t noticed any change for my hair for some reason it didn&#x27;t control my frizz at all. but it did gave it some shine and I like the smell XD that&#x27;s all what it did for me</li>
            <li> This stuff is MAGIC!!  I am amazed at how my hair looks and feels when I use it - which is every day!  I was a bit taken aback by the price, but it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have really bleached hair from the summer sun and chlorine. i have tried a TON of leave in products and deep conditioners. NOTHING helped. It&#x27;s a 10 is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look greasy (I have fine hair so it gets weighed down very easily). It also conditioned my hair well enough that it looks incredibly healthy even after all of the summer damage.</li>
            <li> Great product, work recommend to anyone with fine hair that tangles easily. Would buy product again, great price point and size</li>
            <li> This stuff works really good on my hair. It softens it up and makes it shiny. The only issue I have with it is that it makes my face break out where my hair touches my neck or face. I&#x27;ve tested it multiple times to make sure it really was this product, and it is. So I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft after using this. The first time I used it I let it air dry, then a few hours later when I had time I flat ironed... my hair felt so soft and silky. I didn&#x27;t feel greasy until after the 3 day of not washing my hair, I wanted to know how quickly my hair would be greasy and it made it to day 3.</li>
            <li> This product will be really good if the smell won&#x27;t be this strong. I just keep sneezing that I can&#x27;t use it as often or as much as I want to.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the product and even happier as this was the lowest price that I have found it for anywhere I&#x27;ve looked!  It is lasting quite a while, so it was well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I had my hair professionally done by a natural hair specialist. This product used with a good quality blow dryer got my hair completely straight from root to ends. I used this on myself at home and my hair wasn&#x27;t as poofy as it normally is when I blowdry it. It&#x27;s a good product, but the price is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this product. All of the It&#x27;s a 10 products I have used have been great. I have super curly, frizzy, thick hair and its hard to brush through even after conditioning in the shower. I just spray a few squirts of this on after the shower and I can brush right through my hard to manage hair! It smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily or weighed down. I use this product daily and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best hair care product I&#x27;ve come across. I have thick curly hair, and I straighten it. If I want to get a brush through my hair I have to use this stuff! My hair barely frizzes and it feels and looks healthier!</li>
            <li> my hair was dull and lifeless. mom, 86-yrs old, said it was a fact of life for older women. i guess it was for her generation but this product brought my hair back to life and have only used twice! shinny, body, fullness. buy!</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and I&#x27;ve tried numerous products to get the kinks and tangles out of my hair. This is the only product that has worked for me. It&#x27;s on the pricier side, but so worth it! It smells great and leaves your hair soft. I have repurchased this over and over and will continue to do so. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This has been a MIRACLE! Yes, you pay a premium, but you have several less products to use in exchange.  Do not over spray your hair with product.  I have very thick, curly hair, medium length and need just a few sprays over the entire head to go a long way.  Breakage has decreased significantly, soft hair, smells great and I can brush through easily.</li>
            <li> I use this product every time I wash my hair. It lasts for a very long time for many uses. It is very good for detangling hair.</li>
            <li> Great leave in conditioner, smells good, helps control frizzing and leaves hair smooth</li>
            <li> This stuff is pure miracle in a bottle.  I swear by it and my hair lives by it :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have thick curly hair and was hoping that with regular use, it would reduce frizz and restore shine. Maybe even allow me to air-dry my hair sometimes. I was disappointed. Even with regular use, I noticed little to no difference with this product.</li>
            <li> great product . will buy again</li>
            <li> Great for my curly hair!</li>
            <li> I think this works pretty good. My hair is still frizzy though.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in product. My hair stylest suggested it to me. It makes my hair shiny and very soft. it also smells amazing. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a typical product junkie, and when it comes to my hair, I&#x27;ve tried everything! I&#x27;m so blessed to have long, healthy hair at age 44 (and after a round of chemo, to boot!).  But \\&quot;It&#x27;s a Miracle\\&quot; - the name for this product - applies to my hair as well.  I have color-processed my hair for so many years, I&#x27;m not really sure what&#x27;s there except at the roots.  On the days I don&#x27;t let my hair go curly and natural, I subject it to heat drying and ironing.  I also haven&#x27;t had it cut in 11 months, so the ends are split and in need of cutting or .... some kind of miracle. Enter said product! After just one use, I can honestly say my hair feels healthy and silky.  Even those stubborn ends feel more like \\&quot;tresses\\&quot; than \\&quot;hair.\\&quot;  I also love that you can use your regular products if you wish, then just finish off with a spray of this on your towel-dried hair.  From there, you can dry it and iron it or let it dry naturally (and more softly).  It also works beautifully as a pre-heat spray (like before you go over a section of hair with your flat iron).  I&#x27;m on day 2 and my hair is as lovely as it was yesterday! A+ for this product, C+ for the price .... but I have to give it 5 stars overall because it truly is a winner.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  It does a really nice job of detangling.  All of it&#x27;s other claims are about average.  Does it help with frizz?  Yes...but it certainly doesn&#x27;t eliminate it.  Does it provide leave-in conditioning? Yes...but no better than other products on the market.  If you use it for an extended period of time it does begin to leave a layer of build-up on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a nice product, but definitely not worth the price. (Though, on a positive note...Amazon has the cheapest price anywhere by FAR.)</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair,  &amp; this product smooths it without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> keeps the frizzies away without making my hair greasey.  It is very easy to use with no noticeable residue. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product works well but it sometimes feels like a residue is on my hair once dry.  I don&#x27;t get that with other leave in conditioners.  And the smell is strong.  Not unpleasant but heavy.</li>
            <li> Hair feels and looks great, sleek, soft and moisturized.  Great product a bit pricy but work it.  Buy for summer.</li>
            <li> We were introduced to this product at our salon. My daughter and I have fine thick hair that is a bear to untangle. Over the counter products did not perform nearly as well as this one. While pricey, the bottle lasts a long time. It has been several months between orders. I use it on my daughters hair after we wash it and I use it on my before I blowdry--my hair is short and takes about 5 minutes to style. We like the scent and makes combing out long hair much less of a burden.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair care product ever. So good at detangling without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> Wow I&#x27;m a guy and never have I used a leave-in conditioner that does EXACTLY what it says it does!! FYI don&#x27;t use a lot cuz it could make your hair feel kinda greasy especially with short hair and I use until it&#x27;s mid way done then I would dilute it a bit with water until you get a slight watery texture, u use too much water it&#x27;s still good u just have to use more.</li>
            <li> I use it every day.  It takes the frizz out and makes it so manageable, soft and tangle-free. You can comb right through while it&#x27;s still wet.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair looking soft and shiny.  I&#x27;m a male, in my 60&#x27;s, with more gray hair than brown (now) and this product makes the hair more manageable and cleaner looking.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!! My overly highlighted hair really appreciates having this treatment after each shower. Its light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, all while really helping to improve the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> item as described, fast shipping, thank you!</li>
            <li> Amazing product no more dead or split ends</li>
            <li> The word miracle says it all.  One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used in my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product as always.</li>
            <li> It is working well ,my hair has a lot more body and  is great for styling my hair.</li>
            <li> I got the larger bottle of this after trying a smaller version.  I have this horrible thin, stringy, thinning, fine hair that runs in my family.  It does that annoying thing where it sticks up and looks frizzy on top.  When I spray this stuff in it when my hair is still a bit damp, it works wonders.  It helps that terrible frizz and keeps strays from sticking up, for the most part.  It also helps with letting me comb it when still wet with minimal breakage.  All in all, worth every cent.</li>
            <li> This is a must for my hair.  It gives dry hair a chance to look amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My hair responds very well to this product without weighing it down ... just shiny with great body.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product instead of using conditioner in the shower because I was having issues with too much oil build-up and getting small white bits coming off my scalp. It has helped some although has not completely removed the problem. I was worried it would not detangle well enough because I have long curly hair but I put about 10 sprays in my hand, mix it with a little water and work it in and it has been just fine for tangles. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for my frizz though, I&#x27;m still using other products for that.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry or so so hair.  It leaves it soft, smooth and silky.  No oily residue like some products.</li>
            <li> I really like the convenience of a spray for my long curls.  It helps it to stay healthy and has a really great fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot. Good smell. Good amount. Works great when styling. Only concern is the spray nozzle. It doesnt work for me no matter how much i shake the bottle and press down. I usually just pour it out but i waste a lot by doing that.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  It does everything it says. Even use it on my 2 year old daughter!</li>
            <li> best detangler. very conditioning.</li>
            <li> She couldn&#x27;t find this product in stores. She is very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. No effect on my frizzy hair. I should have bought a smaller bottle to try out first.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the recipient was very happy</li>
            <li> Not as great...it takes me long time to dry after I spray this. Now I found a great shampoo that I don&#x27;t need to use this anymore.</li>
            <li> Excellent leave-in product. Great to help manage texture.</li>
            <li> My hair is typically dry and frizzy. This works really well managing that and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy like most other similar products.</li>
            <li> This is an ok leave-in, but definitely isn&#x27;t worth the hype I&#x27;ve seen in so many reviews. It does make my hair feel nice and soft and has a pleasant smell, but doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate frizz - I usually end up using a bit of good-old Frizz Ease in addition to this.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure whether this product just had a whole lot of hype or if it was actually true to all the claims until I had enough points to get if free with my Ulta Rewards. I love it. I don&#x27;t think I can ever live without this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background on my hair, I have been dying my hair blonde every summer, and then darker in the fall for years. My hair hates me. It&#x27;s drier than the Sahara and pretty lackluster, using this for 2 weeks, my hair has bounce, shine and my highlights look brand new! Buy it. Buy it all. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product however a little too pricey fora detangler.</li>
            <li> The only difference i noticed between this product and the $2 Suave leave in conditioner that I usually use is that this one costs $25 dollars more. I was not impressed and will not be wasting money on this product again. It did not do anything special for my hair and has a chemical smell in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I moved from the desert to a cool humid climate. In the desert my hair was perfect. Long strait, and no flyaways. As soon as I moved my very straight hair is only mostly straight, and there are many flyaways and it&#x27;s frizzy. I&#x27;ve been looking for something to bring my hair back to what it once was for several years.&lt;br /&gt;My aunt is a hair dresser and suggested I try this. She said she had many clients that loved it. However, my aunt is a hairdresser in the desert :P&lt;br /&gt;So I gave it a shot and used it after every hair washing for about two months. It leaves a slight residue in my hair that makes it tangle much more throughout the day. I would say it does help with the frizz, but only very very slightly. So given that it makes it tangle more, looking worse, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not a product for me. The search continues.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried lots of products (ca baby, k&amp;m, Paul Mitchell). This works the best on the kids wo much build up and we get compliments on how their hair smells; although it could be a little strong for some its not really overpowering</li>
            <li> Love this makes your hair like Silk! best on market! Fast shipping!! Will buy more in future. Thank you :)</li>
            <li> I am Japanese-American and have thick, coarse hair that&#x27;s nearly down to my waist.  I also color my hair.  So please do trust me when I say this product works miracles!  Prior to using \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Product\\&quot; my hair was brittle on the ends, so much so that it would break off when I flat-ironed it.  After using this product a few times I noticed how much softer and healthier my hair seemed.  Plus no breakage on the ends.  I don&#x27;t use this Leave-In product every time I shower, more like every third time.  And just a dab goes a long way.  Yes, it is expensive but it will last longer than you think and the results are so worth it!  My teenage daughter uses this stuff too, and her hair is super long and hangs below her waist.  When we are nearing the bottom of the container and running low on product, she is the one that insists I order some more right away so she won&#x27;t have to go without!</li>
            <li> I tried this product at my Mom&#x27;s and fell in love with it.  It makes my hair feel so nice with just 3 sprays.  I have shoulder length hair.  She had a free sample bottle, so I came to amazon with the hopes I&#x27;d find it and voila!  A bit spendy, but then you get what you pay for :)</li>
            <li> This product is better than i can possibly put into words. PLEASE keep in mind though, a LITTLE goes a long way, if u spray very much on (its very thick) your hair will be sticky, thick kind-of-feeling. When used correctly its a fabulous product. I know with other products you are prob used to spraying your hair 10x or more but its not neccessary with this product. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I have very curly hair that is prone to drying out and this makes my hair so soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything. I am blonde and color my hair at home. My ends always looked like straw. This product has transformed my hair. My end look healthy and my hair is soft and silky. Definitely try it!</li>
            <li> I spray this on the ends of my long, wavy hair when I get out of the shower before combing through my hair (it makes your hair greasy/lifeless if you spray it higher but just on the ends it&#x27;s great!). I like it because instantly untangles my hair and makes it very easy to get the comb through it. However, I think it is a glorified Johnson &amp; Johnson &amp;#34;No More Tangles.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t really see any benefit or difference between the two. My ends are hydrated and healthy, but I don&#x27;t think anymoreso than if I had used No More Tangles or any other leave-in conditioner. I would purchase again if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive but it just isn&#x27;t worth the price IMO. It&#x27;s not a bad product and I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily steer people away from it, I just think it&#x27;s overpriced for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because it makes my wet hair manageable after a shower, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down (when sprayed only on the ends), and has lasted me a very long time. I&#x27;m half-way through the bottle and I&#x27;ve had it around 10 months. I spray 3-4 squirts on ends. Will use it up but probably won&#x27;t repurchase unless it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Makes my hair sleek and smooth and I have crazy thick coarse hair.  I would highly recommend this.  We live on the lake and I always use it after I get out of the water.  I also use it after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff and much cheaper than the drugstore.</li>
            <li> It came exactly as I ordered it, and fast too!  It makes brushing my wet hair much easier.  It must be really protecting it. :)  I&#x27;m just waiting for hair like Rapunzel now. lol</li>
            <li> I have wavy curly hair and this keeps the frizz down. I use it everyday.  it helps keep my hair soft</li>
            <li> Love the way this product makes my hair feel. It leaves it soft and manageable. I have natuaral hair and have been looking for something to help me untangle my curls, this is it!</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this product is great at getting out all the tangles after a shower! Also nice to have one product for detangling, heat protectant, and extra conditioning.</li>
            <li> Besides the nice scent, I did not like this product at all. I have very thick, coarse, long and wavy hair. It&#x27;s a 10 did nothing to help manage it. I&#x27;ll stick with the much cheaper Frizz-Ease products from now on.</li>
            <li> Beauticians have commented on how healthy my hair looks. Makes it easier to comb through after washing.</li>
            <li> love this product, use it every day, better than using a conditioner. detangles immediately and leaves hair feeling soft and nourished, would recommend for all types of hair</li>
            <li> This is not the same product.  The one I bought at the salon made my hair much softer and silker.  This has weighed my hair down.  Amazon, shame on you.  I have bought several items through Amazon.  Will not be returning for this and will be more cautious with other purchases on this website.</li>
            <li> My favorite been using this for years.</li>
            <li> Really like this product</li>
            <li> Great product. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love  this stuff. It is great to use before blow drying or for straghtening. The product is thick and a bit pricey. My hairstylist actually  suggested that  I add some water to the bottle like she does. It makes it thinner, last longer, and doesn&#x27;t  effect the performance of the  product.</li>
            <li> Takes out all the tangles and makes hair more manageable. I have been using it for years and plan to keep on using it.</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as promised.  It is a great leave in conditioner as well as general hair product.  I recently got a digital perm.  I use this product after I shower in my wet hair and the next day as a styling product in my dry hair.  It makes my hair soft and manageable.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> after i use it, my hair dry and sticky. it&#x27;s fake? i try to put spray more but it still the same.</li>
            <li> I have always had long, bone-straight, fine hair and I have always had tangles from hell.  As a child, my Mom used Johnson &amp; Johnson No More Tangles and brute force to detangle my rat&#x27;s nest.  This was way unpleasant and led to a ridiculously short Dorothy Hamill style haircut in 5th grade.  I like my hair long, so I explored alternatives over the years.  Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle, Infusium 23 leave-in conditioner and Bed Head Ego Boost all worked pretty well and I&#x27;ve used them on damp hair with a wide-toothed comb.  There is a reason why there are over 440 reviews on It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Product.  It truly is a miracle.  The first time I used it, I only sprayed a minimal amount and got fantastic results!  I actually wore my hair down after it dried (waist length) and drove 90 miles to my sister&#x27;s house.  Without combing or brushing my hair a second time, I ran my fingers from the nape of my neck all the way through the length of my hair as if it was water.  My sister was truly amazed, so I gave her some for her 4-year old daughter who screams bloody murder whenever her hair is combed or brushed (plus, she plays rough and gets it tangled beyond belief)!  Her whole family loves it and uses it on the 4-year old&#x27;s hair everytime they brush it.  Her hair smells great and that&#x27;s one happy kid!  That&#x27;s the best endorsement.  It is expensive, but if you struggle with tangles and impossible knots or have a little one with it, you&#x27;ll appreciate the peace after using this product.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I am that person who reads reviews for almost every beauty purchase. I love to try products and I usually buy them think \\&quot;oh cool\\&quot;, and then they go in the \\&quot;ill never use this again\\&quot; drawer. Not this product! I was hesitant at first because of the price, but I am telling you, completely worth it! I am caucasian with coarse, thick, wavy hair and it just loves to do its own thing! This product not only conditions it so it feels much softer, but makes it easier to manage. I have curled my hair with this product and it protects my hair in addition to my heat styling product and gives it silky texture and bounce. I hope you find this helpful!</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and recommend this product to all my clients with dry, frizzy and unruly hair. Of course, I tested this product myself before recommending it. I love it. I had a full head of overly-processed highlights leaving my hair very dry and damaged. After shampooing and conditioning, I sprayed It&#x27;s a 10 throughout my hair and it is quite magical. My hair instantly became soft, detangled, frizz less, and so shiny! Just like the bottle says. I hope this has helped someone else choose to save their hair as well.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and love it! Worth the money for a great product, lasts a few months with everyday use on medium/long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 01/17/2013: I have very thin hair that is damaged easily. Because my hair is so thin, I don&#x27;t like using a lot of products, but I need something to protect my hair. This does the job amazing! It shines, protects, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I absolutely love this product! Can&#x27;t beat amazon&#x27;s price either.</li>
            <li> this is a miracle product for fine or damaged hair!</li>
            <li> this is a must have for every girl i just dont know why the price has been slowly going up its annoying but it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> My friend is a hair stylist at an expensive salon and she recommended that I start using this. I am totally addicted to this product. I have gotten so many compliments on my hair since I have been using it and after I tell people what it is they always go and get it and love it as much as I do. Now when my friend cuts my hair she says that she can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> You already know this stuff is awesome, I am just here to confirm that it is.  Love this stuff, makes your hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Anyone who gets their hair highlighted knows that all of that processing makes your hair a tangled mess when you wash it. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that lets me detangle my hair without ripping it out. I highly recommend It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle! It&#x27;s a little costly, but it&#x27;s much more affordable on Amazon than the salon.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff! I am blessed/cursed with very thick curly wavy coarse and now dry hair. This stuff smooths it down and makes it manageable in the mornings when the time comes to straighten it. I&#x27;ve found my HG!</li>
            <li> This is by FAR the best detangler there is in the market. It works wonders on my 7 year olds knotty hair. It&#x27;s great for after the pool too. I have NEVER had to worry about knots or tangles when using this product, even when my daughter &amp;#34;forgets&amp;#34; to use conditioner. The best price you will find is on Amazon, almost $20 cheaper than salons. You only need a few squirts and this size bottle will last 6 months at my house when myself and my daughter use it (and we both have long hair).</li>
            <li> This stuff is like addictive for my hair. My mom was a hair stylist my entire life, and through all those years of her taking me to the fancy beauty supply stores, I&#x27;ve never found a product that gets my hair PERFECT without a HINT of stickiness or oiliness like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years now, and I don&#x27;t ever plan to stop. It&#x27;s super expensive in the stores though, so I always buy on Amazon, and a big bottle like this will last me about 4 or 5 months if I spray a little after each shower (I have shoulder length, thin hair).</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product after my stylist recommend it over 5 years ago.  Got my sister and my mother hooked on it as well!!  Absolute must have and highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite hair products in the world. I have been using it&#x27;s a 10 for about 6 years. Whenever I run out, I can tell a difference in my hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky, shiny, greasy texture in your AT ALL. I am picky with hair products because I really don&#x27;t like greasy hair or that yucky feeling that some products leave. This product doesn&#x27;t do any of that. I spray it in my hair after I get out of the shower and I let it sit while I do my makeup. Then I brush through my hair with ease, never a tangle or knot. I feel like it de-frizzes my hair as well because my hair doesn&#x27;t get fluffy or frizzy after I blow dry. I was my hair every other day and it&#x27;s a 10 keeps it looking amazing. I also love the fresh smell; not overbearing. One 10 ounce bottle lasts me about 2-3 months depending on how spray happy I get. It is definitely worth every penny especially with how long it lasts. I don&#x27;t think I can live without this product...lol I could but I don&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and very satisfied. Will def Order again.</li>
            <li> I love It&#x27;s a 10 products but the product I ordered from this place was not It&#x27;s a 10. I&#x27;ve ordered this same item in the past on Amazon and it was great. Made my hair feel like I just left the salon. After the first pump I sprayed on my hair I knew this was not the right product in the bottle. It&#x27;s a 10 smells great and this stuff stunk like a previous bottled conditioner I tried. I&#x27;m going to make sure I order from the same seller as my previous purchase.</li>
            <li> I am about to buy 100 of these things right now so if they ever discontinue it, I&#x27;ll be good for the rest of my life. Let me start out by saying I have extremely frizzy, poofy, wavy hair that has been bleached (bad idea). My hair is naturally wavy, but not the nice soft wavy you see on lots of girls. Instead, my hair is kind of thick and wiry (I&#x27;m South Asian and unfortunately didn&#x27;t get nice hair like all the other South Asians). Because I had highlights done, the bleach has damaged my hair even further, making the waves not very pretty to look at. I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING. Although I love Chi&#x27;s Silk Infusion, this works WAY better. It weighs my hair down a bit, so NO MORE FLYAWAYS at all! I have brittle hair, so my hair always breaks off and I have tons of flyaways in addition to the frizz. This product has solved everything. My hair is way less poofy now, but it&#x27;s not flat and lifeless; there&#x27;s still some volume to it. The frizz is diminished when I use this product and the flyaways are almost nonexistent! If you&#x27;ve tried tons of products to no avail, definitely try this one!</li>
            <li> This is great, specially for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> A couple of sprays does a great job styling my hair.</li>
            <li> Whether this product does the job for me or not remains to be seen, as I&#x27;ve had other issues with my hair and cannot judge it fairly until a normal baseline is again established.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I&#x27;ve been using it religiously, playing with the amount each time,while trying (hoping - with fingers crossed) that my results will be as good as so many are saying. It would be a sweet relief, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT ... I think the packaging leaves a lot to be desired. It is REALLY hard to get a good grip around the rather large top of the bottle so that you can spray with ease. It is for me, in fact, quite problematic. I don&#x27;t want to have to fight a bottle to use product.  So maybe the next time around something more practical can be designed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who is biracial with hair type 3a. Her hair is curly and very dry but with the right products can be managed pretty easily and has the type of curls that turn into pretty ringlets as hair dries. After reading reviews of this product it really sounded like it would be perfect for her hair type but after using it for 4 months, her hair was left in even drier and more brittle condition than we started with. We used it for roughly 5 days a week for 4 months. I started noticing that she was having a lot of hair breakage and a significant amount of frizz at the top of her head. I discontinued use of product and am now using coconut oil on most days or just water with a little conditioner mixed in. Her hair seems to have recovered after 2 months of this. I am not a hair expert by any means but I really think that the product was coating her hair so much on the outside that any other moisture was unable to penetrate the hair and thus resulting in a drier appearance than we started with. With that said, in my opinion, this should be used on occasion and make sure you use a clarifying shampoo with it every so often. It does have a nice light smell that I really loved. And, as for the actual results after applying, it looked and felt much softer but it wasn&#x27;t anything that blew me away or made me think that i would be a long time buyer. I&#x27;m starting to realize that simple ingredient products are the way to go with her hair. All these chemicals we put on our bodies in just questionable.</li>
            <li> I use this product in my wet hair every morning and it leaves my long hair feeling soft. It makes brushing long hair easy and gives my hair a great scent. If you need softer hair, definitely try this.</li>
            <li> After using &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; for over a week now, my hair looks 5 times thicker. It actually seems like the split ends went away, and so did the frizziness! My curls are defined. I have a lions mane of curls now! Excellent product!</li>
            <li> After I bleached and dyed my hair, it became very dry and a bit straw-like. I bought this product and has been using for 2 months, but there&#x27;s no effect. My hair is still dull and dry. If I use more, it leaves a greasy look on my hair (as if I haven&#x27;t washed my hair for days). I don&#x27;t want that either.  I give 2 stars because of the nice smell, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I love this! Just so expensive! Hence the 4 stars.. Otherwise it&#x27;d be a lifesaver. Still helps smooth out the hair!</li>
            <li> Love this product, works so great at detangling and making my hair sofy and healthy, i dont even have to style my hair after i use a few spritz of this. And one bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product came highly recommended to me by a friend, but I have to say that I am disappointed. I have long, curly, frizzy hair.  My hope was that this product would leave my hair frizz-free when I want to leave my hair curly. My curls were very frizzy when I used this product. I also tried using it when I straightened my hair with a round brush and hair dryer. The product was not bad, but I went back to using BioSilk instead.  Bottom line, this product is not worth the high price.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I&#x27;ll keep buying this as long as I have hair - hopefully a Long time!!</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair!!  Very little product needed to keep my ends from splitting.  Keeps my hair looking healthy between styling and getting cuts.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and great price!  This product is not only a leave in conditioner - it also helps in styling your hair ..it&#x27;s almost like you have used a mousse on it as well as a conditioner but not all of the buildup.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after my hairdresser recommended it in the salon. Wow! This product is fantastic! I&#x27;ve used it now for 6 months and my hair shows no more signs of breakage, or split ends. As an avid \\&quot;pony tail\\&quot; wearer, this is a must for the constant \\&quot;pull\\&quot; my long hair endures after workouts. This repairs the damage and leaves hair silky, soft and shiny without being too \\&quot;heavy.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The best hair product for dry, snarly or tangled hair.  I have tried everything and this actually smoothes out my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I have colored blonde hair and it is brittle and doesn&#x27;t grow. With my thyroid disease it is necessary to soften the hair because it can get brassy. This product is light and doesn&#x27;t seem to build up all with smoothing my frizzy curls and taming my hair.</li>
            <li> I went for a haircut and the stylist use this product on my hair. I was so impressed i had to find some. My hair is very long and i am always looking for something to keep it looking healthy. Local retailers carry this product but it was much more expensive. $20 for 4 oz. This is an awesome deal, i love it.</li>
            <li> THIS IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE HAIR PRODUCT. I DONT NEED TO USE ANY OTHER PRODUCT WHEN I HAVE THIS. IT&#x27;S A LITTLE EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH THE PRICE. LASTS QUITE A WHILE EVEN THOUGH MY HAIR IS PROBABLY ABOUT 2 FEET LONG. MY HAIR IS SUPER SOFT AND SHINY NOW!! WOULD ABSOLUTLEY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I have knotty hair on a daily basis no matter what I do. As soon as I get out of the shower I spray this a couple times and it works perfectly! I have tried every leave in conditioner out there and none compare. It detangles my hair without leaving it greasy and leaves it soft instead. It&#x27;s a little pricey but you get what you pay for, I won&#x27;t use anything else after using it&#x27;s a 10!</li>
            <li> The cheapest place that I found to but this product  I been using it for over 2 years and I love it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is simply amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was pretty much messed up because I bleached it too much and blow dry it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for 5 days every night, it was transformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooth, silky and healthy again!</li>
            <li> A previous hair stylist had used this product and as usual, my hair felt great after my appointment. I always try to see what type of products they use so that I can continue to keep my hair protected, smooth, etc. when I&#x27;m taking care of my own hair at home. Since this product was about $30.00, it took me awhile to finally convince myself to order a bottle - so I threw it in with my christmas shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well..I just received it and tried using it this morning and it wasn&#x27;t even a spray!!! The product inside was almost as though it was an actual hair conditioner or maybe more of a cream consistency (almost like the baking ingredient &#x27;shortening&#x27;). No way was that going to spray out of this bottle. Not sure if the product went bad but I wouldn&#x27;t think that the liquid would turn into that type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew it definitely wasn&#x27;t my mistake for what the item was supposed to be, when the directions on the bottle say it is so easy to use - &amp;#34;Shampoo, condition, towel dry and then spray!&amp;#34;  VERY disappointed and will be returning the item. I don&#x27;t even want to bother with a possible replacement if they couldn&#x27;t get it right in the first place.</li>
            <li> I USED THIS PRODUCT BUT BE SURE NOT TO USE TOO MUCH IT MADE MY HAIR FEEL LIKE STRAW....ONE PUMP DILUTED WITH A LITTLE WATER GOES A LONG WAY ESPECIALLY ON BLACK HAIR</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair, and this is one of the only products that detangles my hair wet or dry! its wonderful , i recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> My daughter is one for hating to have her hair brushed, resulting in nasty tangles, so someone recommended this product to me.  The salon sticker shock almost made me pass out!  Here, the price is still up there, but there are distinct and definite savings.  Plus, it works like magic on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair that is fine and straight. I think I must be the only person that hadn&#x27;t heard of this product, but the reviews convinced me to try a small bottle, first. It works magic with my hair! With long, straight hair, conditioning can be too heavy. With It&#x27;s a Ten, I spray the product into my hands and work it through my hair. My hair has the appearance of being fuller, the shine comes through, and I can also scrunch it while damp if I choose.  The price from this seller is exceptionally good. Four ounces at Wally World is $18.00.  I&#x27;ll stick with the 10 ounce bottle for a few dollars more. Many thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 4 years now. The price is great on Amazon, I just saw it in Target for $36.00. I have thick hair and this makes it so easy to brush my hair with just a few sprays. It leaves my hair smooth with no buildup.</li>
            <li> at store same price works okay</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.  It keeps the static out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have course, wavy hair. It&#x27;s a 10 made my hair feel dry and brittle and made it more frizzy than usual. After using this product, my hair felt like I had doused it with hairspray. I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out of my hair. It&#x27;s a 10 is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> if you color your hair especially light colors that strip your hair/bleach this is the product for you, it has done wonders on my hair. i definitely recommend giving it a try you&#x27;ll be sold for life. ITS THE BEST. you pay lots of money to have the color services done on your hair you need to buy quality products to keep it up and believe me i&#x27;ve learned from experience. its a 10 products are worth every penny</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Now I can&#x27;t imagine not using it. Cuts down on frizz, smells great, and gives my hair nice shine and workability.</li>
            <li> Stuff has to get cheaper---GREAT PRODUCT, but, we go through it quickly--</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to get my hair under control and my stylist gave me a sample of this product- I was truly amazed.  My hair transformed back to its old self- soft, maneable and just wonderful.  SOOOO glad I found this product - it is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Same as from professional but a lot less.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing I love what it has done for my hair</li>
            <li> My sister has hair down to her butt!  She is EXTREMELY picky with her hair.&lt;br /&gt;She ABSOLUTELY FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Works great, but after finally looking up all my beauty products on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database, I realized it is full of a bunch of scary chemicals. Stick with organic Argan Oil!</li>
            <li> My hair was so damaged from bleaching and flat ironing but this has revived moisture to my curly/fine hair and does not make it sticky or flat.</li>
            <li> Best leave-in product ever. No seriously, EVER. Did I say ever? Really really good! It works miracles! It goes everywhere with me and my daughters. We all have different types of hair and it works for all of us. It&#x27;s a life saver during the swimming season with the harsh pool water and at the beach with that nasty sunscreen. Also, it allows me to brush through their sensitive hair with much less screaming and grouching than normal. Fabulous product!!</li>
            <li> This product is great...was having a problem in one section of my hair curling up...this seems to have corrected that.  It really works !!!!thanks... I&#x27;ll use this with confidence.....</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law told me about this product. Now my beauty salson carries a full line of it&#x27;s a 10 products. I will try them all. Hope they are as great as 10 Miracle.</li>
            <li> This is the best leave-in conditioner and detangler.  I used to have to buy several products (detangler, shine lotion, styling product, and leave-in conditioner) to do what \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; does in one.  I have been using it for a few years and switched to Unite based on a recommendation from my hair stylist.  Unite is not a bad product, so I used it for a while, but as my bottle was running low I decided to go back to \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot;.  After one use of \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot;  I quickly remembered why I loved this product. I gave the remainder of Unite to my 7 year old daughter to use.  I will never make the mistake of using anything else again.</li>
            <li> The quality of my hair has improved exponentially; I struggled with dry and brittle hair for so long. Now, I get compliments on my hair all the time- it took a complete transformation. After a shower, I spray this product through my hair and it feels smooth, soft and healthy. This is the best hair product I have ever come across.</li>
            <li> I have a curly frizzy dry hair and I was dreaming about this product to do the magic. However, the smell is overwhelming which makes me unable to use the amount that my hair needs. I love the scent I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s bad, but I don&#x27;t like it when it became stronger than my perfume. I would recommend using it if you are planning on blow drying. I found that blow dryer takes off most of the smell.</li>
            <li> I tried both the regular 10 &amp; the one w/ keratin.  I have fine, thin hair &amp; this one did not seem to weight it down like the keratin one did, so I will stick w/ this one!</li>
            <li> I had been using It&#x27;s a 10 as a leave-in conditioner for awhile. My first purchase was from a salon, and my second was from Target. It detangled my hair and left it looking smoother, but the 3rd bottle I bought went into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a week after I started using the last bottle that I got from Amazon, I began losing and/or breaking off a ton of hair. My comb and brush were full of hair every time I used them. This has never happened to me before, and I was terrified that I was going bald.  I stopped using this product, and within 2 weeks things were back to normal. I now have lots of short hairs growing back in and sticking straight off the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think that this product was to blame for all of the hair damage, and I&#x27;m scared to try it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product! About a year ago I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism which makes my hair super dry.  After about a week my hair actually felt like normal again -- soft and not like straw!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I had some with Keratin but ran out of it. I would certainly purchase again. Makes my hair feel fabulous!!</li>
            <li> Great deal. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to be impressed with this product.  It arrived in one of my subscription boxes, a 4 ounce size, and I hadn&#x27;t wanted to try it because I thought nothing could be as good as what I was already using (Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Primer) and I knew It&#x27;s a 10 was loaded with silicone, which would likely weigh my hair down.  However, at the height of the Florida summer I decided to throw caution to the wind and gave it a go.  To my surprise, it controlled frizz as well as my much beloved BB and it made my hair look shiny and healthy.  I will likely stick with BB but it&#x27;s nice to know that there&#x27;s another product out there, just in case BB decides to discontinue its primer potion.  I will use up the 4 ounce spray of It&#x27;s a 10, so there&#x27;s no need to relegate it to my closet of hair product failures.  But I do think it&#x27;s heavier than BB but it smells nice and did help my style to last through the summer heat and humidity.  So I consider the experiment a success.  It&#x27;s a 10 is more expensive per ounce than BB, so that&#x27;s also a consideration.  But as far as true conditioning goes, BB is a much better product because it&#x27;s not laden with coating silicone so the treatment ingredients actually do penetrate.  Plus BB has a blend of beneficial oils that make my hair naturally shiny and healthy looking.  So I&#x27;m giving It&#x27;s a 10 four stars, whereas I gave BB the full five.  I didn&#x27;t like it well enough to change my regimen, but it&#x27;s always a good thing to have a decent product on stand-by.  If your hair likes silicone and you don&#x27;t have fine hair, then this product may be a godsend.  It does control frizz, even when the humidity reaches 90%, like it did today.  But for the health of my hair, I&amp;#34;ll stay with BB, which I think is a superior product.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product ever.</li>
            <li> A great product and a great seller. :)</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and this price is UNBEATABLE!! The small 4 oz bottles are upwards of $20 so I will continue to buy this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> All-time favorite hair product. Recommend it for any type of hair. It detangles without leaving hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Great price. Great product.</li>
            <li> Totally works just wish it had less chemicals!</li>
            <li> I love watching Laura in the Kitchen on YouTube ,and on her beauty channel called Vitale Style. She recommended this product on a hair care routine video. I bought a travel size to give it a shot and this stuff is absolutely incredible. Truly the bomb dot com! It does not take much at all; a little goes a long way. It makes my hair feel so soft and bouncy. The other great thing is buying this product on Amazon is so much cheaper than getting it at a store. My local Target/ Walgreens sells this for 40 bucks and getting it here for almost half the price you can&#x27;t beat it! This will last me for a good while til I&#x27;ll need another one and will definitely order it here again. Delivered right on time also.</li>
            <li> It is amazing for my daughters hair and it makes her hair smell and feels wonderful so thank you much</li>
            <li> I use this product everytime I comb my hair after showering. Great detangler, not too heavy, doesnt leave any residue or bad scent.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and I still love it! It makes my hair less frizzy, more manageable, and super soft!</li>
            <li> I like this but there are 2 drawbacks. First, I can&#x27;t comb or brush your hair after it&#x27;s on because it just gets sticky and non-shiny. I use it by putting it on my hands and stroking it on the outside of my hair.  It&#x27;s great when I&#x27;m having a flyaway bad hair day. But whew, it stinks so strongly! yuck!  It will not work for anyone who is sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> Liek this product. I have very thick hair &amp; I like this product a lot. It smoothes my hair as my hair can be frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly as a guy, with my current haircut being shorter on the sides and little longer on top to do a sort of natural comb over. This product has been amazing for me, and I will continue to use it until they change the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product solo as a styling product (coat hair while slightly damp after a shower), as well as applying a light amount to damp hair before putting in a different product on top that will give my hair more of a style and hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed in the last month that my hair is much smoother and softer, with less dandruff and frizz. 10/10</li>
            <li> Great product.  tried others and came back.  Leaves hair soft, tangle free and especially leaves hair with a clean feeling unlike others that leave a heavy feel in your hair.  Worth the $$</li>
            <li> My mom uses this product and loves it so I thought I would try it out. I&#x27;ve used it about 3 times now and I&#x27;ve already noticed a HUGE change in my hair. It&#x27;s softer, less frizzy and it holds curls longer without hairspray! I have a lot of hair and I color it so it&#x27;s usually really dry, so I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair is after using this product. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Smells great, light, and leaves my hair manageable! Really love this little miracle. I&#x27;ll be getting more once I run out for sure!</li>
            <li> I love Its A 10. I have thick unrulely hair and it makes it so easy to get through. It does very well at detangling my hair.</li>
            <li> Give me shiny silky hair when used, but can make my hair a little static-ey.The smell is good but not something I would rave about, as I am very picky. All in alll I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My five year old has ratty, unmanageable hair.  This stuff calms it down without making it greasy, and makes morning hair a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now and it brings my shine back. I have lost the shine because of my grey hairs and it makes me feel young again. Helps reduce the frizz too. Truly a miracle product!</li>
            <li> I used to purchase this product thru salons or beauty stores. The large bottle is cheaper thru Amazon, and I really love this stuff. I spritz it on my hands and run it thru my hair. I don&#x27;t spray on roots, bc I noticed it caused some flatness. Keeps my hair pretty frizz free, straight or curly. High recommend, especially if you use a lot of heat.</li>
            <li> For as long as this crap is taking to get here I&#x27;d say its a rip off. 9 days after I ordered this, they finally shipped it. For the price being as high as this was, I could&#x27;ve gone to Walgreens &amp;saved myself some money &amp;time. Never again. Still haven&#x27;t gotten my itsa 10 years before u get it stuff</li>
            <li> Buy from this seller! The quality is the same as if you were buying it from the company itself, just SO much less expensive. Worth the price. I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks, I use it every night, I have super long hair and I have barely made a dent in it. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> by far this is the best product that I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I will be re ordering&lt;br /&gt;very satisfied. its a 10 is amazing</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!! Awesome service!! Awesome price!!</li>
            <li> It does make my hair shiny and soft.  The detangling is great, but like most products-- I need to add gel and some type of spray to manage the frizz.</li>
            <li> I put this on my hair, then comb through ~ then scrunch - perfect for drip drying naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have ringlet curls that come to just below my jawline.  I always blow dried and flat-ironed my hair straight until curls came back a few years ago.  My hair has repaired after cutting off most of the heat-damaged length.  I&#x27;ve been using TRESemme curl moisturizer for years, but it didn&#x27;t create definition and my 2nd day hair was so oily at the roots.  My stylist suggested It&#x27;s a 10 and after the first day I really fell in love.  It tames the frizz, makes my hair super soft, creates that light &amp; bouncy curl definition and super cute ringlets, without weighing it down and leaving an oily residue the next morning.  I&#x27;m very impressed!  It was seized by the Mexican TSA this weekend in my carry-on (oops) and I ran out to a 24 hour drugstore when I got home and bought more-- it&#x27;s that good!  I haven&#x27;t tried it with blow drying straight or flat-ironing, but I did use it when I dried with the diffuser and it was light and bouncy curls, no frizz or flyaways.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is a life saver for the winter months when you don&#x27;t want to have dry, static hair. Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Love this product fory long hair!</li>
            <li> I really like the way it made my hair feel. It was very soft to the touch no matter how I styled it.  I have very curly, course hair,and could use this wearing it natural,straight, or curled.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioning spray for me and my kids.  Smooths frizzy dry hair and makes combing wet or dry hair much easier.  Smells great - all my kids like it.  Just a couple sprays is enough.  It is expensive, but I think it is more effective than some of the other detangling/conditioning sprays I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This product has improved the overall look and feel of my hair just after a few uses.  Some people complained about the smell but I don&#x27;t find it overpowering or offensive at all.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I would buy again..fast delivery too! I would use this seller again too. My granddaughter loves it and has thick curly hair and it leaves it so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Just like the it&#x27;s a 10 that I got from my hairdresser, just a lot cheaper.  Yay!  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> LOVE!!!!! This is my most favorite product!! Thanks to my hairdresser :) I would highly recommend this leave in conditioner... Works great for my thin, long, color treated hair....</li>
            <li> This stuff is really the best. I tried to switch products recently to find something cheaper that would hopefully work just as well, after using this product for years. All of those other products are now in the trash and I won&#x27;t be straying again...there is no substitute for this product. It just works wonders on my hair. I can use 8+ products in my hair to make it presentable... or just this and maybe some shine spray.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> My hair says thank you when I use any its a 10 product, this leave in keeps my hair looking healthy from all the coloring I do to it.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!!! Especially, if you have fine hair. It isn&#x27;t heavy and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> This is a great leave leave in product.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product one day at my stylist.  She sprayed the It&#x27;s a 10 Leave-In product in my hair before blow-drying.  I didn&#x27;t think anything of it at that moment as she always sprays things in my hair in the process.  After she was finish drying it and styling it I was amazed at how soft and shiny my hair looked.  I asked her what had made it that way and she showed me this product.  I immediately purchased this product and have been really happy with it since then.  I don&#x27;t know what it is but as long as it keeps giving me soft and shiny hair then I am a believer.</li>
            <li> Compared to drugstore leave-in conditioners such as pantene, this one really does a great job. I love the smell and the immediate results after 4-5 sprays. It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or feeling yucky at the end of the day. Hair looks smoother and healthier. Will never use another brand again. After using this one, I also purchased the conditioner which works well too.</li>
            <li> This product was a stocking stuffer for my daughter who uses this all the time so it must be good.  She straightens her hair a lot so it helps to reduce the damage.</li>
            <li> This product protects my hair from the blow drying and curling irons damage and does not leave it greasy and flat!</li>
            <li> Just what I order. I love it&#x27;s a 10. It&#x27;s a must for my hair, but was trying to save a few bucks. I recieved it very quickly! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I got this product a month ago,, and I love it,so much. even my coworkers see the difference between my hair now and my hair before I used this. :)))))</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  It works immediately and does what it says for a relatively inexpensive cost.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product at my local salon for a few years and it always leaves my hair soft and smooth.  I decided to order from Amazon  since I used it so much.  The first time I used this I knew something was not right.  It leaves a weighted dirty feeling on my hair.  I am convinced this is not the &#x27;true&#x27; It&#x27;s a 10 product.  I ended up throwing most of this bottle away and buying from my salon.</li>
            <li> This has made a huge difference in the way my hair feels. I use this after my shower and spray a generous amount on my curly hair and then comb it through. I noticed when I do not use it my hair feels more rough than I would care to admit. Just remember to shake it up before use because I noticed that everything tends to settle on the bottom of the bottle. For the days I blow dry my hair I will use with the Paul Mitchell Skinny Serum and my hairs just feels gloriously soft. I am always getting compliments on it and I always credit this product in helping me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement for Nioxin Bliss, and finally settled with Its&#x27; a 10.  It quickly removes tangles and does not add weight to fine hair.  The only problem is the spray nozzle.  For some reason, it is a bit difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a while. I went to a hot springs and swam with the little children in my family. They have long hair. This product worked so well in their hair after swimming. It pulled the tangles right out. I use it every day and my hair feels better.</li>
            <li> I received this very fast. The packaging was excellent! I highly recommend this company.  Its a 10 product is really a miracle worker. It does not leave a residue, it erases frizzies and styles so well!  I love that even when my hair gets damp, I can re style quickly and my hair still looks great!</li>
            <li> I have dull and dry hair and have been using Moroccan oil for a couple of years now. IT does make my hair look shiny and soft. However, this product not just makes my hair look healthy but gives it a nice wave as well (I have naturally wavy hair). I wake up every morning with nice curls somehow :)</li>
            <li> This is a must for my hair.  Not only does the product smell great it also does an excellent job with keeping my hair soft and shiny.  It is also easy to use.  Since it&#x27;s a &#x27;leave in&#x27; conditioner you spray it on right after you have washed your hair and its still wet.  I have extremely long hair so I just spray one at the top, one spray at the middle and ends of my hair.  I go around my hair in this fashion and then I brush it through my hair.  Quick, easy, and looks great.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for +2 years along with the volumizing shampoo and conditioner. Great product! Helps provide needed volume</li>
            <li> I love this product.  After years of keeping my hair short, I decided to grow it out.  If it weren&#x27;t for this product, I would of had to go back to short.  My hair tangles easily and becomes brittle even easier.  When I use this along with the Miracle rinse out conditioner, my hair combs out easily and is very soft to the touch.  It also adds a little body to my very fine hair.  Lovely stuff!</li>
            <li> good price.........only product my daughter uses. she has long, wavy hair which get dried out very quickly.  she swears by it</li>
            <li> My hair is a light brown color that can easily look drab and limp so I&#x27;ve been looking for a good leave in conditioner that helps my hair look healthy.  This does a fantastic job doing just that.  I usually put a couple of spritzes on the ends of my and and comb it through right before I blow dry my hair.  I use very little of the product each time so the bottle lasts forever and I can rationalize the high price to myself.  This stuff leaves my tangle prone hair easy to brush, very smooth, and very healthy looking (shiny not greasy).  I highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to invest in their hair to keep it looking good.</li>
            <li> My daughters have hyper-curly, so also hyper-dry, hair.  Since they were little (they are 11 now) comb-through has been a constant daily challenge (I look forward to when they can manage and care for their own hair!)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything I can find has a good review:  Mane and Tail (ok, but leaves a residue that starts to crunch; and can be oily); Deva Curl (can&#x27;t even remember if this one was memorable for hyper-dry); Just For Me conditioning sprays (too oily and not enough friz control); Hawaiian 12 something-or-other (left crunch and little friz control), Mixed chicks (shampoos mostly, but didn&#x27;t help with dryness at all); Loo Poo or No Poo (shampoos mostly but also didn&#x27;t help with conditioning or dryness for hyper curly girls; store stuff (good de-tanglers, but no friz control for curly girls).  (BTW: for superior conditioning \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; shampoo -- Hair one cannot be beat!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a 10 leave in hair spray product stands alone!  I have been using it for years on their hair.  So far, they are just too young for daily showers/hair washing (and curly girls should not be doing anything close to daily hair washing!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a daily detangler on their AM comb-through (dry hair). Since they shampoo 2-4 times a month, it can leave a little build up over a week&#x27;s time, so I usually pour 50% water into a 10 oz bottle. If you are shampooing more often, this thinning out of the mixture will probably not be necessary.  I&#x27;d have to assume as a full-strength, out of the shower, spray, it cannot be beat!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I use it on their hair every day for dry detangling so we need to cut it down, and that saves us money too.  I have not tried the \\&quot;lite\\&quot; version yet because I assume it will be less effective (but less buildup?) and so more expensive to us over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously: if you have dry hair, curly/dry hair -- this is the stuff.  It is worth every penny it costs since I&#x27;ve not really found anything that even compares to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do shop at Amazon for it solely to find super savers shipping savings and I buy about 6 bottles at a time (two kids, daily, lasts me about six months).  I also have not found that the keratin version is an improvement for daily use.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, hasn&#x27;t found anything that works as well.</li>
            <li> I started using this product after I bobbed my hair. And I have to say even months later my hair looks shiny, and sleek. Its not frizzy with flat iron. Its an amazing product that lasts a LONG time. And purchasing here was ten dollars cheaper then the local salon.</li>
            <li> I just love what this does to my hair.  even when I use the best conditioners, i cant brush through.  so i use this and i can brush right through my hair.  and the worse dryness and frizz is gone.... I would recommend this product highly!  I mean it.  My niece got this for me in Florida cause i am an outdoor girl.  I have used it for 4 months and will never stop.</li>
            <li> I tried to find a cheaper alternative that does all this things this does.  I could not find anything similar.  My hair is smoother, softer, and I have less flyaways.  it looks much healthier and seems to protect my hair from the daily heat of tools and blow drying.  I about died when my local Target changed the price to $42 fort he 10 ounce!  Thankfully amazon had it for $29.  Their price changes but it seems to stay under $30 most days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep buying it and come here first!</li>
            <li> Love it product and it&#x27;s much cheaper here than in stores. I use it almost everyday. The product shipped fast. The sprayer is a little stiff but works fine. I&#x27;ll definitely reorder when I run out. This big bottle should last me 6mos or longer.</li>
            <li> Amazing product have always used this product. Was at my door in less than 2 days. Never hesitate to buy from this seller. Product was by no means tampered with as I had to Crack the seal. A+ seller and product</li>
            <li> Great leave in.  Very moisturizing.  Cheaper on Amazon than in the store</li>
            <li> This is a wonder drug for my hair!  I love it and it works great before blow-drying, using any kind go heating tool.  I also use it when it is rainy and I need some help w/frizzy fly-aways!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! It really is a miracle. Smoothing and adds softness that my brittle hair needs badly.</li>
            <li> Bought mine at a grocery store...only used it once (today) but can&#x27;t stand the smell!!! It smells nasty!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used It&#x27;s a 10 with keratine before, that one is awesome, but now i didn&#x27;t want to tame my waves so bought the regular one. I used it after shower this morning, my hair is now dry, not damped anymore) and still smells really bad.&lt;br /&gt;It might make your hair healthier but can&#x27;t it smell good?? Or even better, no smell at all?</li>
            <li> love this stuff. It makes my curly frizzy hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Product was expected.  Delivery was on time. I have used this product for several years and I like it for the heat protection. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it recently because I&#x27;ve been testing other products and wanted to the see the individual results of the new products, but this is my face detangler/leave in product. Leaves my hair smelling good and feeling clean. Lightweight but effective. I am on like my 6th bottle or something now. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever re-bought the same product so many times before. But hey, it ain&#x27;t broken, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> no difference when applied to my hair - only made it thicker and sticky... at least the smell was ok.&lt;br /&gt;product was very fluid in consistency.</li>
            <li> Best hair product, by far!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!! Have been using it for a few years now.  Leaves my hair feeling soft and makes it a lot easier to brush my hair when it is wet.  I started to buy this product online because it&#x27;s a better deal than at stores or salons.  This seller is great and product always comes as promised!</li>
            <li> Sprayed it on and it seemed to be good leave-in right before my roller set. Not amazingly better than any of the other dozens I&#x27;ve tried, but a good one with a nice scent. Well, it took a few roller sets to realize that it was this product that was leaving my hair very dull with absolutely no shine, after drying and styling.  I scaled back on the amount I was spraying in and had much better results, but it&#x27;s still not a miracle product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 is a must have for 90% of the population and I was thrilled to save $14 on the big bottle!!!</li>
            <li> I bought the 4oz. I have long, mid-back length curly dry hair. I&#x27;ve tried using it over the course of a few days. I followed the directions where you spray on after a shower and comb through. I&#x27;ve tried styling a few different ways. Blow drying, air drying, and also blow drying while continuing to add in product for extra smoothness. None of them worked. After about 3 days of use I&#x27;ve used up about 20% of the bottle and my hair is still frizzy and fluffy. Doesn&#x27;t hold my curls together when damp drying, doesn&#x27;t hold flatness from a blow out. I applied after/during blow drying to see if it would control more frizz that way and it will eventually weigh your hair down enough, but won&#x27;t make it lay together nicely. My hair feels strangely waxy and soft, like doll hair. Pretty gross. And so expensive. There are other products that do the job for curly haired people, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, smells good, tangles come out and feels light on the hair. Hair feels silky and there&#x27;s no residue when it dries- it feels natural.</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s a 10, I have been using it for a couple years now and wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it does what it says on the product.  my hair is healthier and fuller since the time I started using it.  i recommended the product to my family members and friends and they all are thankful that I introduced the product to them.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is light and works well on mixed hair.  We use it daily without a lot of build up between washings.</li>
            <li> Target $16.00 and I always bought at cvs for $38.00 dang what a waste. I&#x27;ll go to the store next time</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is NOT the product I paid for! I have used &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; for 2 years. This product is not the same. &#x27;Its a 10&#x27; will leave my hair easy to comb, soft, silky, all the things it claims to do. This product I purchased left my hair feeling rough, dirty, oily and doesn&#x27;t even have the same smell. I wish I knew how to report an inauthentic seller. I would like my money back.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works well without weighing my hair down.  Love the way it makes my hair shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have long wavy hair and it tends to get dry towards the ends.  I use this daily as a detangler and it keeps my ends from becoming too dry.  I would be lost without it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy it&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner from amazon because the price is just too good to be true. The 2 oz bottle from a popular pharmacy where I usually buy it cost $10 plus the tax. This 10 oz bottle was $24. I easily saved $40 because there was no tax and free delivery. The scent is identical, the effect  on my hair is the same. This is really a great buy for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> great product I&#x27;ve used it for years now and leaves hair being able to combine it must buy for any type of hair must buy it</li>
            <li> I love the way It&#x27;s a 10 makes my hair feel.  Yes, it may be a little pricey, but it lasts a really long time.  Just a few spritzes is all it takes, which is a good thing when you have two daughters who use it too.</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight hair that tangles all the time no matter the condition used and  tends to get oily with too much product. My hair dresser recommended this. I am hooked. It does not make your hair heavy or flat like most of the other leave-in products I have tried does. I still have body all day long as well. Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot. It makes my hair very manageable and soft</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Detangles my long thick hair and acts as a good heat protectant before blow drying and straight ironing.  The value was great, as opposed to buying it in store.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Hair is very well moisturizers and frizz controlled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for product. I really liked it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves my hair soft and straight.</li>
            <li> Love the product, a bit expensive though.</li>
            <li> I have horrible breakage, especially when the seasons change and this product helps eliminate almost all breakage. I use it year-rond and probably always will!</li>
            <li> BOUGHT FOR THE WIFE AS IT IS CHEAPER THAN WHERE SHE BUYS IT LOCALLY,WORKS OUT GREAT FOR HER AND SAVES US MONEY</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, It didn&#x27;t work on my hair, made it very flat and no volume! Good product not for me.</li>
            <li> I am not at all adept at hair styling and have never had much luck working with product. But THIS spray is a bottle of miracle. I spray in on my wet hair and go and my hair is soft, smooth, and tame. Love, love, love.</li>
            <li> I have accumulated a closet full of hair products for my problem hair which is fine, brittle, thinning,  and often frizzy.  Most of my inventory is expensive, and professional grade.  I was skeptical about this product because conditioners and the like leave my hair flat and unmanageable.  I use this product after shampooing - no conditioner - followed by a few volumizing products.  My hair is fuller, more manageable, and it  looks and feels healthier.  I was put off by the price at CVS - almost $40 with tax - fearing the addition of another disappointment to a shelf full of them.  I found &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; here on Amazon for about two-thirds the price. I cannot be without &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a10.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s a 10 but the bottle I purchased does not work. It will not spray.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I blow dry my hair every day and use a hot curling iron as well.&lt;br /&gt;This product keeps my hair shiny, tangle free and extremely manageable.  Very little is needed&lt;br /&gt;with each application.&lt;br /&gt;Excellet product.  Great results!</li>
            <li> Your hair will love this! Please stop wasting money on anything else. Buy this from this company!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot a minimum quantity works miracles.</li>
            <li> I have always used it&#x27;s a 10 products but they are so expensive in salon. When I found them on amazon for so much cheaper at first I was hesitant to order. But I have to say I am thrilled I did, exact same salon quality product at a fraction of the price... Shipping was fast as well received in two days...</li>
            <li> I have been buying its a 10 for a few years now. It is a leave in conditioner that comes out in a light spray. I love that it isn&#x27;t too heavy and really leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> This product is a must-have for me, but store prices are outrageous. This was a great deal, and it&#x27;s a big bottle, so it will last for a while.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this for me years ago and I&#x27;ve never turned back. My hair is naturally very very long and brittle. This product makes my hair look like it was done at the salon everyday...shiny, thick, and healthy. Simply finger comb through your hair after you wash it. And the best part is that one small bottle like this will last almost a year!</li>
            <li> This product is great, and makes your hair SO SOFT, but am I the only one who can&#x27;t stand the smell of it?  And, I can smell it all day long.</li>
            <li> I have very long very damaged fine hair. It&#x27;s so difficult to manage because it tangles so easily. When I started using this product it transformed my hair! It&#x27;s literally tangle free and so easy to manage. Obsessed.</li>
            <li> It leaves a good smell and also my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weird, it gets a very soft texture, but like extremely clean, but not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this stuff I tried others as this one is kind of pricey but found it to be worth every penny. Will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> The best leave in conditioner.  It addresses all hair problems</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this for my dry hair about 2 years ago and I have used it every day since on both mine and my daughter&#x27;s tough to comb hair. It&#x27;s fantastic - not too heavy / greasy but definitely works!</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft.  Smells great.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a less expensive option to detangle my daughters hair yet I keep going back to this.&lt;br /&gt;Works the best. Maybe doesn&#x27;t smell that great but who cares. Less tears is worth it.</li>
            <li> Just bought this product and it&#x27;s great. I recommend it highly and it works as described.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I could not go without this stuff now that I have been using it; I think I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year, and its so much cheaper on amazon than in the stores. I have *really* thick, long, kind of wavy hair and this stuff keeps the frizz down and makes my hair overall more manageable and what I would consider normal. I usually spray it on after I shower, wrap my hair up in a turban and leave it like that for 5-20 minutes, and then use a wide tooth comb to comb it out. I really makes a huge difference! When I went traveling in Mexico this summer I even put some in a tiny travel bottle and brought it with me.</li>
            <li> I have problems using conditioner because they all seem to weigh my hair down.  It&#x27;s a 10 NEVER does!  My hair is soft but so manageable.  I am beginning to turn gray, and so I color my hair and it is course.  This product makes my hair feel like it did when I was younger.  It&#x27;s like I have new hair!  I will never be without this product again.  And..it only takes like 2 pumps of product, so it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Very powerful leave on conditioner. I have tried so many and this is the best. I spray on my finger tips and apply it on my hair. Did not try to spray on my hair thinking that it may be too much.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! I never go a day without it.it is so good for your hair.One thing I really love about it is it don&#x27;t weigh your hair down which is a huge plus when you have fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and lasts a very long time, I have especially dry hair and it is a light leave in conditioner that smooths dry hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite product!!! Use it daily and helps a lot with de tangling</li>
            <li> I call this my &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s a little pricey but worth it&#x27;s weight in gold. I have thin hair with an oily scalp and dry ends and this product helps keep my hair soft &amp; healthy.  You can spray it on dry or wet hair, it&#x27;s not heavy or oily in any way. I love this in my 8 yr old daughters hair, it  gets out tangles with ease. I&#x27;ve recommended this to many friends and everyone loves it and uses it regularly. I buy it on Amazon because it&#x27;s the best price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser gave this to me to try. My hair is naturally coarse and curly. I had my highlights and low lights done which can really do a number on it. Luckily I didn&#x27;t pay for it. So after washing my hair, I sprayed this thick lotion substance on my hair (It&#x27;s a 10) and worked it through. Why they package this in a spray bottle is beyond me. It should be in a tube or squeeze bottle. My hair felt gross. It felt like I had put shampoo conditioner in my hair. I couldn&#x27;t even run my fingers through my hair without yanking them through and pulling hair out in the process. I let my hair air dry and it was left feeling knotted and greasy. This was my first attempt at using It&#x27;s a 10. My second attempt (this time using less product) went pretty much the same way. A little product does NOT go a long way. I couldn&#x27;t wait to shampoo this JUNK out of my hair. Why it gets raving reviews? I have no idea. Maybe this works for people with thin, flat, straight hair because it sure didn&#x27;t work for me. My advice is to find a sample of the product or ask your hair person for a hook up just so you know whether or not this will work on your hair. It&#x27;s an expensive product and some places will not give you a refund of your money. Surely it must be good for some people since it has such a high rating.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair look amazing. I am a mix woman and finding a product the works for my type of hair has been difficult. After using this product the complements don&#x27;t stop. The hair is easy to comb even when it is dry, is strong and it looks healthy.</li>
            <li> Best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever bought!! I recommend this for anybody with Tough hair to brush. Also great for kids if their head is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I really love this product for my color treated fine hair!</li>
            <li> Love this product! My curly hair is definitely more manageable since I started using it!</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff on my daughter&#x27;s hair for a few years now.  This stuff truly is a miracle.  It is much cheaper on here than in the local stores</li>
            <li> If you have very dry hair or treated hair, this is a great product. I use it every other day or so to keep my hair healthy looking and it makes coarse hair feel so soft. I am sure it is good for all types of hair. My hairdresser introduced me to this and I am so grateful.</li>
            <li> 5 stars because I noticed it helped my poor, dry hair after just after one use.  For whatever reason, my hair on the left side (only) would start flipping out in a different direction and my hair stylist suggested that I purchase this on Amazon.  So glad I listened to her.  Fortunately, the combination of it&#x27;s a 10, Chi straightening product &amp; biotin has made my hair look more than halfway decent.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using it wrong however I spritz a good amount and brushed it thorugh my hair. Let it air dry, and it didn&#x27;t do much. Tried to do the same routine and straighten after as well. Didn&#x27;t notice a difference. I&#x27;ve tried to use this for the past three weeks to see if I noticed a difference but I dont see more bounce, or less frizziness. (Mind you I have curly spanish hair as well) Type 3A</li>
            <li> I am African American with Type 4A hair.  It tends to tangle especially after I wash the conditioner out, so I needed something to detangle.  I&#x27;ve only used it once after I washed and conditioned, and it seems to be doing the job.  I just got a relaxer two weeks ago, so my hair is still relatively straight.  I&#x27;ll update this review as I get closer to needing my next relaxer as that&#x27;s when the tangles really start to set in!  Oh, and because I like my hair to have a softer feel and I hate for my hair to feel dry, I mix AG Hair Cosmetic Fast Food and Sta Sof Fro Hair &amp; Scalp spray together for extra moisture and protection while my hair is still moist.</li>
            <li> I was experiencing a little hair breakage between relaxers, and purchased this leave-in product at the suggestion of my hairstylist.  It has almost eliminated my breakage problem.  It really works and has a great smell!</li>
            <li> I think this is perfect, love the results of my hair, less frizzy and so much cheaper than in the salons.</li>
            <li> Greatest hair product ever!  Best de-tangler and super shine for hair. I use on granddaughters long, knotty hair for no-tear combing.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase!  I usually buy this at the salon for around 35 dollars plus tax. What an incredible bargain and fast shipping! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> i was expecting magic and didnt get it.  but what i have found after trying several brands of products and some of them in combination that claim to do just some of the things this on does in one bottle is that it actually does them all in one bottle.  i have eliminated needing to use 3 products that are supposed to do similar things.  it smells good, conditions my hair, keeps frizz down, and is heat safe.  i have very curly frizzy hair and so far in my 26 years i have found one that works pretty good.  you should try it you might love it.</li>
            <li> I have very damaged hair from heat and highliting. A friend raved endlessly to me about this product. I thought I would give it a try. I have not seen any great improvements, but I will say it works pretty well. Still not entirely sure if it&#x27;s worth the price though.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and shiny. Cuts out the frizz. It is much cheaper here than in the mainstream grocery stores and pharmacies.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this product. My hair is usually frizzy but now it just smells and looks great. I will order more when my current is finished.</li>
            <li> This is the only leave in conditioner I will use. It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and lasts for months. I use it in my hair every day. It makes blowdrying my hair a breeze and I cant live without it. I have tried cheaper leave in conditioner products, but this one is by FAR the best.</li>
            <li> I bought this to get the tangles out of my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  It makes her hair soft and does the job well.</li>
            <li> I have been using leave-in products for many years now, instead of blow drying my hair to make it manageable, or straightening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the absolute best of the bunch. I can go to sleep with my messy, moist hair, after I&#x27;ve spritzed it a little with this product, and wake up with gorgeous, shiny, silky smooth straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and curly, I straighten my hair everyday, this product definitely makes my hair smooth and very soft. This is by far the best moisturizing product I have used yet for my hair. This product is highly recommended and shipping was very fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> The price was good on the recommended product and it seems to work. Only negative is that you can not see what is left and have to go by weight. There should be at least a clear strip for viewing purposes.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt what it says it is, a miracle!  I used to use this when I bleached my hair, once it was healthy again, I stopped.  I purchased it a few years later, and couldn&#x27;t believe how much difference I saw.  I remember exactly how soft my hair used to be and how shiny it is!  I don&#x27;t think I will even stop using this again!</li>
            <li> The same bottle runs for $65-80. I went to target and couldn&#x27;t believe how expensive it was. No way would I pay that much. I&#x27;ve had this product for months and not even a quarter is gone!</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t buy hair products so I had no idea where to begin looking. My hair type is a little wavy, very fine hair. This was recommended to me by my sister-in-law who uses it on her daughter. My kid&#x27;s hair is exactly like mine. And no matter what I do it has a rats nest at the back of it. I usually spend 15 minutes after bath brushing through my kids hair. After buying this product, with three squirts, it took me barely two minutes to comb through the rats nest. All clear. And the next morning, it was silky and smooth. And two days later it was still great. So far I&#x27;ve used it once or twice a week and my kids hair looks presentable and combing through isn&#x27;t a chore.&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Worth the money. It&#x27;ll last me long enough for my kids to learn to comb through their own hair. :)</li>
            <li> I use to help detangle my hair and protect from heat (straightening iron).  It works nicely, is not sticky and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> works good and smells nice</li>
            <li> I love it and this bottle lasted me 2 years ! I use it everytime I get out of the shower. It leaves my hair nice and smooth with no tangles.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff.. I was getting some stuff at Ulta and got a coupon to try a travel size of this Its a 10 Miracle Leave-In Product. I cannot believe how much I like it. I have thinner wavy to curly hair. I let it air dry most of the time. After using this product my hair felt fuller, softer and my curl was cuter. It was a bit more coiled than normal and looked really good. I am so happy that this doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell too and it is easy to apply because of the pump. I kept my small travel size and went back and got a big one. They even gave me another sample size so I gave to my mom and she loves it as well and got herself a big bottle!&lt;br /&gt;I was visiting my sister in CO and guess what.. she used it too!! I had no idea. I totally love this product and would recommend it to anyone. She has very different hair than mine and she love it too - my sister that is.&lt;br /&gt;I also will use this other voluminous product in my roots and than this on the rest of my hair.. FANTASTIC RESULTS!</li>
            <li> I purchase this product at least once a month.  I&#x27;m addicted.  It is awesome!  It smells wonderful, works great as a detangler (on my very long hair), and keeps my hair from getting frizzy.  It is expensive but worth the price.  I do, however, caution you to check the price at different times over different days.  Price on Amazon routinely varies from approx. $24 to approx. $32 (which to me is an enormous variation for this price point).</li>
            <li> This stuff is unlike any other product I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it every day, my niece with crazy curly hair uses it, and my sister in law too. It&#x27;s an absolute must. As in, I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and I have straight thin hair.  I need so little.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best! if you have bleached,dry colored, damaged hair. Then get this. It makes your hair the way it felt when u were a kid! awesome. Before you did any crap to it.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner the best of all I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin, naturally curly medium length hair that can get pretty dry and frizzy.  I&#x27;ve tried finding products that would define my curls but all I&#x27;ve ever gotten is a sticky crunchy mess that did nothing.  Twice now my hairdresser has tried It&#x27;s a 10 on my hair. First time I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed but I think it was because of how my hairdresser styled my hair. This second time it left an impresson because my hair felt SO soft, silky, and smooth!    The first day I tried it myself I didn&#x27;t use conditioner (since some ppl&#x27;s reviews said conditioner wasn&#x27;t necessary) and used 2 sprays of the products directly onto my head.  It did nothing, in fact my hair looked worse than usual.   So second day I used conditioner AND 3 sprays into my hand, rubbed it together than distributed it evenly througout my hair.  I noticed a big difference in the feel of my hair. It was much easier to comb through, actually felt silky wet if that&#x27;s possible!!  Having dried it straight today it looks pretty good and I have A LOT less flyaways than when I normally straighten my hair (that eliminates my John Frieda smoother product..1 down).  I only gave it 3 stars because I wouldn&#x27;t say it has WOWed me enough to give it 5...YET.  That&#x27;s not to say it won&#x27;t because today it was better than yesterday. I think I need to experiment with it a little bit more with the amount I use in my hair. Plus it&#x27;s expensive!!    Also, I&#x27;ve noticed some people can&#x27;t stand the smell of it.  I don&#x27;t even smell anything!! Yeah if you put your nose directly into it sure, but on my hair it&#x27;s odorless (which is weird because my hair is so fine, it usually attracts every smell in the book, especially smoke).      So give it a try! Remember you might need to try it for a week and experiment on the amount you use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go a day without this stuff. Certainly makes controlling my curly hair much easier.</li>
            <li> My hair just looks better when I use this and it is so much easier to brush.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple brands of leave-in conditioners and nothing has worked as incredibly as this product.  While It&#x27;s a 10 isn&#x27;t the cheapest it is definitely worth the expense for any woman that wants to take care of her hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff--makes my hair much less frizzy and smells great.  I decided to get the bigger bottle after going through the smaller one.  Unfortunately, I find this bottle hard to use.  It is too wide at the top, so it is very hard to hold on to it and pump at the same time.  If they would change the shape of the bottle, this would be 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 is amazing.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years as I&#x27;m the kind of woman who loves her snooze button too much which gives me very little time in the morning.  I use it mostly for the length of my hair, avoiding my bangs as they tend to get a little stringy at the end of a 20 hour day.  It detangles and leaves my long hair so so so shiny and soft.  I always use it when I blow dry my hair which just brings out the lovely oils and makes my hair all the more luxurious, and it keeps my fly-aways tame if I flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;I would agree and say this may not be the product for thin hair, but you&#x27;re good to go otherwise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff.</li>
            <li> At first, I loved this stuff. But, with time, it seemed to weigh my hair down. I have fairly thick hair that&#x27;s gotten more unruly as I get older. So it seemed to really do the job for a while but after a month it started to really stick to my hair and just got gunky. I gave it to a friend who has thinning, wiry hair and he likes it still.</li>
            <li> The BEST hair product I have ever bought in my life.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is extremely long and this makes it easy to keep it long!  You spritz a little on after the shower and you can comb right through it which is just amazing because my daughters hair tangles so easy.  It has restored it and has made it thick and beautiful.  I am sold.  They sent me a sample of the shampoo and it is just as good.</li>
            <li> it helps keep my friz down in my hair</li>
            <li> One of the few products I can use on my baby fine hair. Leaves my hair strong, shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li> This is the best product.  I use it after I wash my hair, so there are no knots!</li>
            <li> Do not know WHY people are talking about &amp;#34;counterfeit&amp;#34; products?  I have NEVER had that problem on AMAZON as long as I buy products that are &amp;#34;fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!  It&#x27;s the only one I need to use.  I am over 65 with platinum hair and it works beautifully!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery great price!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I bought it mostly for a detangler because I have very knotty hair. But my hair is shinier &amp; healthier too. I use it every day. Great product</li>
            <li> The price you can not beat..,..my hairdresser sells this for $35.00 I love this product if you have curly hair you will NEVER go without it again ever!!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves no dandruff like some other leave-in conditioners despite me using it daily, so I&#x27;m really happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> [--Type of hair: Wavy, and lots of it (lol), but abused by an old/rough dye job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Weather: Hot &amp; humid (Puerto Rico)]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that makes my hair absolutely smooth, except extra virgin olive oil... and that&#x27;s always bit of a mess. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best leave-in I&#x27;ve ever had. I have REALLY long hair and this is the only de-tangler that genuinely works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on after washing my hair and it makes a HUGE difference once my hair naturally dries and humidity tries to strike.&lt;br /&gt;It helps against the frizz, makes it smooth and shinny.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the ONE \\&quot;must\\&quot; I have to have for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> This is definitely an all-in-one product.  It is great for my hair. help keep it moisture and frizz-free, as well as, gives it a shine.</li>
            <li> great leave in conditioner with a great smell!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize how much I paid for a smallish bottle; I was expecting it to be bigger. For 32 bucks I almost returned it when i opened the box and saw the size. Anyway I have bleached blonde highlights over dark brown hair which is super damaging. My hair is seriously like in a dreadlock after I wash it. Usually takes 15 minutes just to comb all my wet hair out. This product has cut the combing time down to just under 5 minutes. I can really feel a difference in my hair. I really like the smell of this product too. I can&#x27;t describe it but it smells great. It definitely does a better job at detangleing my hair than the infusium spray. Depending on the price I may buy it again. Does the job in tough knots in damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this bottle! It really is a miracle, a ten indeed! Buy it now if you want great hair!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t a problem with the product; it works okay for detangling and it does not leave a heavy-leave-in-feeling.  However, I am not able to spray the product on my hair unless I put it on the counter and bend down so I can use two hands.  The bottle is a poor design for average female hands.  It is difficult to get a grip.  The bottle is smooth and slippery.  Because of those problems, the pump is very difficult to push.  Wish I bought the 4 oz. bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this leave in conditioner all the time.  I have fine hair that tangles when you look at it.  This product really is a miracle for me.  I can&#x27;t get a comb or brush through it without this product.</li>
            <li> Sprayed some in, and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference. It MAY have been a bit more smooth, but nothing that warrants the raving reviews here. However, my issue with this was the smell. It smells cheap and is way too strong. I could smell it on my hair for about 3 hours after I sprayed it on.</li>
            <li> I have re-bought this leave in product probably five times. I tried it once and was hooked. I tried the leave in with keratin and other brands, I always come back to this one time and time again. It&#x27;s really lightweight to the point where you can put as much as you want in your hair and it won&#x27;t get greasy. A little bit goes a long way and makes your hair smell amazing and sooo very soft!</li>
            <li> I will always use this!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does everything it claims and I don&#x27;t find split ends anymore. My hair stays soft and tangle free.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> after I received this product I felt the consistency and smell was off. it also wasn&#x27;t doing much for my hair. I went to the beauty store and purchased this and noticed the color and smell was way off. today I took both to my hairdresser who initially recommended this to me. she said &amp;#34;this is nothing like the stuff ive been using on my clients&amp;#34;. too bad i got home and noticed i just noticed i missed my return deadline by just a couple days.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Makes my hair soft and shiny.  I don&#x27;t use anything else. Just a few sprays of this on damp hair, blow dry, and go! I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, easy ordering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a ten for even the finest hair.</li>
            <li> Love this - helps my hair stay healthy while blow drying</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair in the summer humidity..so I heard about this and looked it up on Amazon. It is very helpful in this humidity and well worth the money. It only takes a small amount and my hair is half way down my back. Again, this order came within 4 days..great service.</li>
            <li> My son and I use this product every day...LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best. I&#x27;ve been using it every day for a couple of years, and my hair is in great shape. With regular use, this product really conditions your hair well.</li>
            <li> Great product to detangle curly or wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and was very happy with how well it worked for my hair. I will continue to buy this, as the price is so much more reasonable than through my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Product&amp;#34; leaves hair soft and moisturized, great for use when hair is regularly dyed.</li>
            <li> fast shipping!! everyone needs to use this product</li>
            <li> I have fine semi wavy, damaged hair. This stuff works, not too heavy even for oily hair. use sparingly and focus on ends for finer hair :)</li>
            <li> Excelent product, excelent delibered</li>
            <li> It really does all the things it claims to do - it&#x27;s a great detangler, makes my hair much softer (my hair is bleached so that&#x27;s a challenge), adds shine, and all that. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product - I use it daily for over 5 years now. Detangles and leaves hair feeling softer and sleeker. Recommend for any hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with thick medium length hair and I don&#x27;t use any product but texture sprays or leave in conditioners. I wanted to try a product that left my hair smooth and not frizzy. This product did good taking away the frizziness, but it left my hair feeling oily and I even had small clumps of product that didn&#x27;t soak in. In the picture I left is what it looks like when I spray it up close to give you an idea of the thickness.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell is not for men either. It&#x27;s a very strong flowery scent I wanna say that is pretty strong when you aren&#x27;t using anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can see this product working for woman but as a teen male It left me only using the product 2-3 times cause the scent and clumps</li>
            <li> Love this product. Made my hair silky and reduced frizz</li>
            <li> I really love this product. Some times I have to shower at the gym and their shampoo sucks but I spray on this conditioner and my hair feels like silk. I dont even need to use any other product.</li>
            <li> best hair product ever! I love this so much. its expensive but I will still keep buying it! it works better than any other curly hair product I have ever bought. my daughter has spirally curls that are very difficult to manage. This is the only product that has worked! thanks!</li>
            <li> I have long hair that tends to tangle easily, so when my beautician began using it on my hair during appointments -- I had to purchase it for my personal use. It quickly detangles and softens my hair without weighing it down. Very happy with this product and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, detangles my hair, makes it smell nice, prevents frizz and it feels much healthier. Definitely worth every penny</li>
            <li> Buy it. Just buy it. This stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks but today really sealed the deal and inspired me to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly: I have funky curly, wavy hair that blows smooth with relative ease. My hair follicles are thin but I have a TON of them, giving the illusion that I have thick hair. This is generally a good thing but it also makes my hair extremely vulnerable to breakage and drying because the follicles are thin but I need to apply a lot of heat to get everybody in line. I blow dry my hair and either flat iron it, curl it, or twist it into a bun, every single day. When I started using It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Product I was also using Redken All Soft shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s pricey stuff but it does make your hair noticeable softer. I ran out of the Redken and now I&#x27;m using $2 Suave shampoo and conditioner. My hair feels just as good as it did with Redken, I swear. The Miracle Leave-In Product makes my hair INCREDIBLY SOFT I no longer need the expensive shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just squeeze my hair with a towel to ring out the water and then apply the spray before I blow dry. I usually do 4-5 pumps but I&#x27;ve gotten out of control before and sprayed like 8-9 and my hair didn&#x27;t look or feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, over the weekend I had a horrible dye job done on my hair. I wanted to go auburn for fall and ended up with weird dark  burgundy overall color and kind of ambiguous pinkish highlights. First I cried, then I went and bought some Oops Color Remover (which is fantastic and a life saver, by the way). In a 24-hour period my hair was highlighted, dyed, chemically stripped, and re-dyed (with a box). It felt so straw like yesterday after I let it dry post dye-job. This morning I used my Miracle Leave-In and HOLY CRAP my hair feels so silky and healthy despite all the abuse I subjected it to this weekend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will make your hair feel amazing * and* save you money because you can cut out other expensive products you use. Get the big bottle.</li>
            <li> So far it is a five but I haven&#x27;t tested it in real heavy humidity as of now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products for my highlighted hair, yet none of them worked well. This is the first product that has actually worked to condition and make my hair soft to touch and shiny. Buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and have thrown most of my others out. It worked great for my hair (lots of wiry gray) and really cuts down on the time it takes to flat-iron it. It also is a better protection against humidity than any of the other products I&#x27;ve tried. I purchased the 2 oz, 4 oz, and this 10 oz bottle. The 2 oz is perfect for traveling, the 4 oz is my everyday, and this 10 oz is my refill for the other two. (It&#x27;s too big to fit comfortably in my hand and is hard for me to pump.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this as your refill stock, start watching the price when you have about 1/4 to 1/5 product let. The price fluctuates a lot and you&#x27;ll get a better deal if you have some wiggle room on when to purchase. :)</li>
            <li> Great price, quick shipping amazing product. Detangles quickly and leaves soft shiny hair.</li>
            <li> I hate using crusty gel or most hair products.  I&#x27;ve experimented with many leave in conditioners that give my hair some sculpt without stiffness.  This is by far the best.  Feels natural and doesn&#x27;t clump your hair.  Nice, not powerful scent.  I&#x27;m sure this is marketed to women but this guy will continue to use this product.  If you looking for a slight sheen and shape without the flakes and stiffness of most hair products, look no further!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this gem of a product.  I don&#x27;t ever even bother trying to comb through my mess of hair without it!  I have medium length fine hair, with super-long thicker extensions.  So, when I wash, it&#x27;s a whole lotta tangles and without a really good detangler, I am in trouble! But this stuff works like a charm.  I spray just a tiny bit on my natural hair because it will weigh it down if I use too much.  Then, I spray lots on the extensions which soak it up!  Then I just work through my hair with a brush with ease.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I have curly hair and it was always difficult to tame it until I found this product. I blow dry  after&lt;br /&gt;spray this leave-in conditioner onto my hair. It is very easy to get the style I like now.</li>
            <li> First introduced to me by my hairstylist I immediately fell in love with this product.  I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for quite a few years and the curls I used to have are just frizz now.  I tend to straighten my hair a lot because of this and It&#x27;s a 10 keeps it protected and sleek looking and then today for the first time I decided to blow dry and scrunch my hair to see what the curls would do and WOW I have beautiful curls again without a curling iron or any other product.  I love this stuff.....my hairdresser did warn me its like crack for hair and she&#x27;s right I am totally hooked!!!</li>
            <li> i got this one because of my fds told me this is an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;be honesty, it is such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;my hair feel soft .. and i bought one for my gf as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;strongly recommand.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical after the first, second, even third time using this. But suddenly today, the 4th try,  my hair is fabulous and looks so healthy</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair... This stuff is great.. Can&#x27;t live without it!!!!</li>
            <li> I have a bleached hair almost all my life and it is very difficult to find right product for it. I&#x27;ve tried a huge amount of products and I got conclusion it&#x27;s not exist! Once I watched some of hair products reviews on Youtube, and found this brand. I bought a travel size bottle to try. I was amazed!!! It is really work! This is a great detangler. You can comb your hair right after use easily. Hair looks shiny and alive. Just buy a small bottle and give a chance to try if it works for you.</li>
            <li> This crap sucks makes my hair more gross than before I won&#x27;t waste my time the only reason there&#x27;s a star is cuz it makes me</li>
            <li> This product is good for every hair type, but especially for thick, dry types like mine. It lasts a long time also, and you need hardly any to see results. It detangles hair, conditions it, and offers heat protection as well</li>
            <li> I love this leave-in spray! I have really long hair that gets tangled and frizzes up quickly. This is the first product that has been able to keep it under control. My hair feels so smooth, plus it looks shiny and beautiful. I would definitely recommend this entire line to any type of hair.</li>
            <li> This is stuff is ahhhhhmazing! I have super long, super thick hair. I have tried all sort of detanglers and leave in conditioners. Nothing has ever even come close to what this stuff does. It&#x27;s awesome!!! Since my hair is so long/thick I have to use quite a bit but it&#x27;s so worth it. Yes... I know... It&#x27;s expensive... But being the cheap skate I am... I can tell you it&#x27;s totally worth it!!! I swear by it</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> I bought a the same product from the hair salon I go to it worked really well no frizz, shine and smelled very good. I bought 2 from amazon and I am not sure why it does not work I still have the frizz, looks dull and the scent is nonexistent. I am returning one and will be buying the replacement for the hair salon.</li>
            <li> Great product! A little goes a long way. Gets tangles out of wet hair with ease. Has helped my dry, damaged hair feel soft and look healthy again.</li>
            <li> I use this when my hair is wet and before I blow-dry. I have straight asian hair, and this product leaves my hair feeling soft. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just received this product last week and am very impressed after only using it a few times.  My hair was just bleached, for lack of better word, and it felt damaged.  When I wash my hair and spritz this product on the ends, it is like my hair is virgin hair that has never been damaged at all.  This stuff is a miricle product.  I can not really say enough and it smells wonderful too.  I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair to get the tangles out.  I highly recommend this product and wish I could give it ten stars!</li>
            <li> This product beats the others by far. It is a leave in conditioner, heat protector, gives your hair great shine, and keeps your hair from flying away. Why buy multiple products when you don&#x27;t have to? This is the product for you if you don&#x27;t have hours to get ready. You can get this at the mall but it is so expensive. Amazon had it in a larger size and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the awesome reviews of this product. I have fairly normal hair, but it can be a tiny bit dry sometimes, so I thought maybe this would be great for that and whatever else benefits - i don&#x27;t even think I checked, just wanted to try it based on the reviews. I&#x27;m actually coming out of this quite confused as I feel like plenty of other products do exactly the same thing and even for cheaper. It certainly wasn&#x27;t a miracle for me. I saw someone posting about watered down ones being shipped - maybe I had that issue, i don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> After trying at least 4 different leave-in detanglers I&#x27;ve finally found one that works beautifully! Awesome product, does not weigh down my hair or make it appear greasy or limp yet it feels like silk, adds a bit of shine and the de-tangling actually works. After washing my hair while in the shower I spritz on and massage in, wrap my hair in a towel for a few minutes (I leave it on while I do my make-up BUT it actually only takes 30 seconds to work...) and then a large tooth comb slides right through my otherwise very fine, very dry, very tangled hair. LOVE it, cannot say enough! Last time I went to purchase it in a store the clerk said that every customer who purchases raves about it. I do recommend buying on line, it&#x27;s roughly $5 or more cheaper. It is a pricy product but worth every penny. Quick shipment as usual. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I really like 10.  It works.  Easier than conditioner and my hair is nicer when I use it.  Nice not to rinse</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 has been my favorite leave in product yet. I would recommend it to anyone! I bleach my hair and it always makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> Great product for long hair.  Highly recommended.  Great for getting tangles out of young kids hair.</li>
            <li> amazing! i love these stuff so much. alittle goes a long way, so don&#x27;t let the size fool you. best stuff i have used, hands down.</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite hair product ever!  I&#x27;ve been using this for years and its great.  Tangles are no match for this.  I use this on myself and my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair for her tangles.  It&#x27;s better than any detangling product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I also toss this in my beach bag and use it after swimming.  Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> Great product for leave in conditioner.  Good thermal protection on your hair.  Smells good and just works great.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Because of all the hype I really thought this would be a special product. My hair is normal - maybe slightly oily. It didn&#x27;t create any shine, it didn&#x27;t help detangle my hair, it didn&#x27;t make my hair stronger .... all it did was weight my hair down. It also made my hair harder to comb. I regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this daily!  I have thick curly hair that gets tangled easily.  I use this as a leave in conditioner and detangler.  Makes my hair feel great.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders.  I have very thick, curly, long (~16&#x27;) Mulatto-textured hair. It used to take 30 minutes to comb through my hair with other lotion detanglers or leave-in conditioners.  It takes ~5 minutes to brush through all of my hair with this product.  It works best with the Wet brush: [[ASIN:B000L596FE Brush Detangling Shower Colors Vary]]</li>
            <li> As advertised. Great for after shower.</li>
            <li> I have naturally frizzy hair and this product tames it into manageable soft waves... Even in rain and high humidity.</li>
            <li> Having fine fair this product does not make it greasy or oily, it just makes my hair smooth and healthy looking.  Also awesome on tangles. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before ordering this product.  It lives up to all the claims.  My hairdresser commented that my hair had gotten thicker.  That was totally worth the price of admission!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using It&#x27;s a 10 for several years, and it does wonders for my permed &amp; dyed hair.</li>
            <li> Love it works awesome especially if you have thick hair. Also works excellent on knots in the hair !!</li>
            <li> allways an excellent product, lives your hair soft, but not greasy. the price is also excellent comare to other stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago and have used it everyday. I thought it would make my hair look healthier but it hasn&#x27;t done a thing. Waste of money and far from a miracle. I agree with other reviews that it is watered down and it doesn&#x27;t smell good. I am using a much better product now that makes a world of difference for less than a quarter of the cost.</li>
            <li> Product came a week before expected!!</li>
            <li> Never go without.  Works well on thick hair. Also use as a detangler for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years already. it truly works. i always get compliments on my hair and this is ALL I ever use as far as &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; goes... I also use it on my niece to quickly untangle her hair.</li>
            <li> The best hair product fro my thick hair. Loving it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of It&#x27;s a 10! It makes my hair feel revived... kind of like the new hair cut feeling. It&#x27;s quick and easy to use- just spray on damp hair and comb through. I usually let it air dry from there. Definitely one to recommend!</li>
            <li> Amazing product for the hair, helps to feel very soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  I use this product daily.  I have very long hair so it is an excellent detangler, too.</li>
            <li> Like the way the conditioner makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My hair feels so much softer after using this.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Makes my hair look great!</li>
            <li> It is not so awesome as how the hype describe it. It is just okay I would say, for the quality and result, I would say it is pricey.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that keeps my hair really moisturised without making it look greasy. The price is better than if I was to go out and purchase separate products that do what this one does.</li>
            <li> I was recommended by my new hair stylist to try this product , it has been the best product i have used .</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product after every shampoo as a detangler and conditioner.  This particular size is over double the amount that I usually buy in the store for about the same price. Great value! Also worked very well as a quick conditioner after her swimming class at school, when she didn&#x27;t have time to wash the chlorine out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff ! The price is great,too ! My hair was so dry and dull until I used  &amp;#34;Its a 10 Leave In Product&amp;#34;  I will never go without it !</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!! Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to make their hair 100x better! Everyone should have this!</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot live without this leave-in conditioner. It really makes all the difference in my hair care routine. My hairstylist at a high-end salon also uses and recommends this product. It makes my hair so much more manageable and soft. I use it in addition to  the regular conditioner that I use in the shower. I enjoy the smell, which smells perfume-like in the bottle but not as strong on my hair.</li>
            <li> I buy this product all the time at my hair salon but when I found it online and at a much reduced price, I was all in!  Just have to plan ahead!</li>
            <li> Returning this IMMEDIATELY! I used the Leave in Conditioner for about 3 months. It was great at first but then I noticed some shedding, then EXCESSIVE shedding, and now my hair is falling out in clumps!!  I can&#x27;t even touch my hair without having 10-15 strands in my fingers when I pull my hand away. Is there a customer service number? I checked the bottle and the company website and couldn&#x27;t find any contact info.  That should have been my first clue right there...</li>
            <li> The best stuff in the world! No matter what my hair is fantastic when I use this product!</li>
            <li> Works fantastic!  I spray it on after washing my hair and my daughters hair and it makes it silky smooth, helps with tangles and smells great!</li>
            <li> So I decided to try this stuff and was really amazed at how it made my hair feel. This product really does live up to the hype. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell though, it does not have a very natural sent and it does linger, But over all its worth the money and i wish it came in an even bigger bottle</li>
            <li> Great for detangling and conditioning my fine, curly hair.  I comb this through my wet hair, then never comb or brush my hair after it&#x27;s dry,  This product seems to help tame the frizzies.</li>
            <li> I have an enclosed in ground heated swimming pool that I swim a mile in every day all year round and this is the only conditioner that prevents and repairs the destruction from chlorine to my hair.</li>
            <li> this is well worth the price for the product. makes it easy to brush and straighten hair after shower. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got this because it&#x27;s supposed to protect your hair from the blowing dry, etc. I think it might be a little too heavy, or I may being too liberal with the application. I don&#x27;t know yet if it&#x27;s provided protection, but it does make your hair feel smoother and silkier.</li>
            <li> Best leave-in product I&#x27;ve found - leaves hair tangle-free and soft.</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail hair product. I have been using this for nearly five years, and I immediately repurchase it whenever I run out.</li>
            <li> My hair is always frizzy and this has really helped tame the mane.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of leave in product but this one is the best, I really love this leave in, you can&#x27;t buy anything better than this one</li>
            <li> This is still one of the best products on the market when it comes to leave in conditioners! Will use it for many years to come!</li>
            <li> Love this product... Great to use prior to drying or ironing. Adds that extra shine and softness that our hair tends to lose over time from drying and constant hair damaging products and heating stylers. Use only on the ends, avoid the roots. The scent is pleasant and freshing. Perfect for kids or adults. Pricing is much better here than if you were to go to the salon.. Much cheaper.. My stylish recommended this product to me and now I recommend it to all of you.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because of all the great reviews. I&#x27;ve tried this product on several different occasions and seen no difference in my hair...but the following day I always ended up with a lot of pimples along my hairline that lasted days to weeks (I tried it a few times to make sure it was this product causing the pimples). I&#x27;ve never had this happen with any other product. I&#x27;m still waiting for these pimples to go away from using the product last week. Definitely not worth it. Will not be using or buying again.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look nice and shiny and silky. Feels like it&#x27;s protecting it from my heat stylers and my hair seems all around healthier. Cheaper than I could find at local salons, too!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this product to me, so I bought a 4 oz. bottle from the salon. I totally fell in love. Unlike so many products, it does what it says. I liked it so much that I came to Amazon.com to find a good deal and found this huge 10 oz. bottle! I&#x27;m completely happy with It&#x27;s A Ten Miracle Leave-In Product!</li>
            <li> product is the best and shipping was quick. will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  My hair has been damaged from color treatments.  I spray it on after washing my hair and I am able to brush through it.  A miracle!  It has also been wonderful as a detangler for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist said this is great.  I like it but have not seen any miracles for my hair and am not sure if it is even benefiting it.  Also very expensive so probably won&#x27;t buy again unless it is less money next time.</li>
            <li> THis stuff is the best!  Wouldnt use anything ele on my hair.  Now I also suggest the shampoo and conditioner as my hair stylist used it on my hair last time I was there and it works great as well.</li>
            <li> Awesome. I will keep buying it. My hair look beautiful and healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have naturally curly hair, tames my friz.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I have tried similar products but none did the job as well as this spray.  It smells amazing, too, which is important for something that doesn&#x27;t get rinsed out.  I purchased it from Amazon b/c the cost is less than at Ulta.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the BEST product available!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this bc so many people gave it great reviews but honestly for me it didn&#x27;t work out with my hair. I have baby fine hair and each time I washed my hair having this in it, I saw nothing but residue that was thick and grey in color resembling the consistency of the formula. It made such a mess in the tub. I stopped using this since and no more disgusting grime washing out of my hair. PERHAPS I need the Light version of this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have hair with a mind of its own and somehow this is the only leave in that tames it!</li>
            <li> Larger size like this was awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Worth the $ to get the knots out of my little girls hair!</li>
            <li> Let me say I have very damaged hair and have tried MANY products and have found any I could rate 5 stars so I&#x27;m still looking but I would say this is just ok.  It might work for someone with less damaged hair and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The best leave in HANDS DOWN! This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have very long blonde hair and this product is excellent for protection. This is the absolute lowest price I have found when shopping around. The first time I bought it a few years ago, I bought it from my hair salon and knew I couldn&#x27;t afford it at those prices, I was so excited to find it on Amazon. Product was as described and delivered quickly. This is my 3rd bottle purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nice to save a bit of money on amazon , we love this product .</li>
            <li> Brought my hair back to life! Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> This stuff was fabulous and gave my fine, thin hair excellent volume while maintaining softness. Unfortunately, I needed the formula with keratin, so I&#x27;m not currently using this, but once the keratin treatment starts to go, I&#x27;ll go back to using this. Using this eliminated all my other hair products. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ONLY used this product post-keratin treatment. My hair is naturally wavy, so I can&#x27;t speak to how well it works with wavy hair. But it worked great on the straightened hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves no tangles.</li>
            <li> I will literally never live a day without this hair product again.  I know that sounds extreme, but I am black with coarse hair, and this is a trusty detangler and moisturizer that has never ever failed me.  I have been using this product about 2-3 years, and usually after a while of use, some products will lose their effectiveness or your hair develops tolerance or it builds up in an unhealthy way on your hair.  I have had none of those problems with this product.  Every time I use it, which is usually after washing my hair, it effectively detangles, smoothes, softens, and moisturizes my hair.  I usually follow up a bit of some sort of argan oil or whatnot, but this product is the central, unchanging key to my hair styling regimen.  I am so happy to have found It&#x27;s a 10!  Also, to be specific, I don&#x27;t feel as zealous about their shampoos or conditioners or hair oils, but this Miracle Leave-In Product is hands-down a win.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair smell really nice too.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-50s and have had trouble with hair loss, dry, tangly and damaged hair from hair dye products.  Every two weeks I was having to use expensive products that had to either be left in overnight or heat just to have manageable hair.  My hair dresser told me about this product and I finally have normal hair again.  Thank you God!  I would definitely recommend this product to my family and co-workers.</li>
            <li> Love it! Came promptly also.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> Great product! Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> AS EXPECTED&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGED EXTREMELY WELL&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> My all time favorite!!!</li>
            <li> it makes my hair feels soft but this does not last for long!</li>
            <li> I knew this deal was too good to be true...This was not the real product I had previously bought at a salon...Made my hair greasy and dry at the same time. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair except less shiny than usual.  Used about eight pumps on my medium length hair. I&#x27;m really suspicious as to how this product could be getting so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser first told me about this product and I continue to purchase it through Amazon as it is less priced than she can sell it. I know it seems unfair to her,  but I have to budget my money. This is a WOW product.  I have color put on my hair and have had to have more of a process done as I get older.  We have well water and the minerals in it are harsh to my hair. This leave in conditioner makes my hair soft and manageable.  I don&#x27;t recommend products often but felt this is well worth the mention.</li>
            <li> Did not like this one as well as the Keratin Plus conditioner.  It seemed to go faster also.  It is a good product, but it didn&#x27;t work as well for me as the Keratin Plus version.</li>
            <li> Love this product,I use it all the time.I have curly hair and after washing it I get lots of tangles,this helps to get the tangles out.My hair dresser uses it all the time on my hair.</li>
            <li> Worked like expected!</li>
            <li> My hair is never been so manageable after my showers. A few sprays and I can brush my hair. It smells so awesome too.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product I&#x27;ve used for years.  It arrived on time, too.  The only problem I have is the pump button on this bottle is very hard to dispense.  I have to used both hands while pushing the button down.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. We buy it again and again. It&#x27;s great for de tangling and extra conditioning but it also protects against heat damage and strengthens your hair.</li>
            <li> I tried a friend&#x27;s bottle and it holds with being sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> I Love this product but i was a little surprised that the ones I bought on Amazon had a much stronger fragrance than the ones from Ulta.  Like the ulta ones much better.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get used to the right use for my hair, but once I did.....my hair is beautiful.  My hair is fine textured so I only need a small spray on the ends, gently massage it between my hands to distribute throughout the strands of hair before I dry it, and it&#x27;s perfect.  This products works well, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Saw jenny McCarthy review this on the view, and have been using it since then.  Have two young girls that use it too. That&#x27;s why we got bigger bottle.  Love how it keeps tangles out and keeps hair looking good.  Shipped with prime .</li>
            <li> I just recently bleached my hair and it&#x27;s so hard brushing it compared to the virgin hair I did have. This stuff is seriously a miracle with my hair. It&#x27;s helped get it back to a soft healthy texture and shine. This is the real stuff... Not tampered!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  As I get older, my hair gets more coarse, and this conditioner is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, I did not have great result as those have been claiming.</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; is an exaggeration, but this stuff is really great.  I like the smell (I can&#x27;t believe the others don&#x27;t), and it does what it says it does.  I have been using this for about a year and my hair has improved drastically.  I saw a picture from our vacation last year and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in my hair now versus then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is shoulder length, wavy, thin, and oily.  I used to use multiple products, but now I shampoo and use this for my conditioner.  I use no other products (except hairspray).  It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t not do nearly what I thought it would based on the reviews. I have pretty average hair with a moderate amount of curl (and frizz). The only thing this product did for my hair was make it shiny. I will give it that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still had frizz and no more volume than before. I was a little disappointed based on all the raving reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! It makes my hair so silky, soft, and manageable. I have very fine hair, and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. It&#x27;s lightweight yet very moisturizing. I love it!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and my hair is never heavy or weighed down!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I continuously order it. The only negative is it leaves my hair a little greasy, but it works quickly and effectively if you have tangled, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I found this on a list of top 10 hair styling products and I was definitely not disappointed. I love using it because it leaves my hair nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> This product, when purchased from an authorized retailer is amazing (I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year religiously).  Unfortunately, Haircare For Less, who fulfilled my order, must not be an authorized retailer.  For a couple of weeks, I noticed my hair was getting unusually dry - when I stopped using this product, my hair went back to normal.  Is hay-like hair worth saving a couple of bucks?  Not in my book.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter....she loves it..</li>
            <li> would not be without this product. Excellent. No downside - not sticky or anything. spray in and leave - makes combing after shampooing so much easier. Leaves a shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried before and absolutely recommend it. Leaves my hair perfect for a blow-dry. The best part to get it this time was the price, so much cheaper then the stores.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Does pretty much what it says on the bottle and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair which is great!</li>
            <li> Quick ship, product as expected</li>
            <li> Great product for the price...and it arrived a week earlier that it was supposed to :)</li>
            <li> Great service and customer follow up on their end, it just wasn&#x27;t what I thought I was ordering.  Be careful when ordering this product because the photo is a little misleading.  I thought it was the spray in conditioner that you put in after the shower and \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot;.  However, it is just a conditioner you use in the shower and rinse out.  It is not a spray like the bottle appears in the photo and it is not a \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. It is great for the hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair. For me, this spray doesn&#x27;t do much. It&#x27;s by no means bad, but it&#x27;s nothing at all special.</li>
            <li> Bought this on the recommendation of my daughter who was a stylist. Makes my hair look and feel softer with less damage from hair dryer or iron. Spray it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it daily to keep my hair in good condition.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Manages hair after shower. Detangles, smooths, primes hair for heating appliances and so forth. There are at least 10 reasons why I like this product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!! I live in miami where we live in constant humidity and this product tames the frizz and gives me that desired beach wavy hair look I just love.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product ever about 9 months now, and I love it. I have fine, thin, long hair and I spray this on my ends when my hair is still wet after the shower. I also spritz a little bit in my hair right before bed. Not only does this smell really good, but it provides the nourishment my hair needs without weighing it down. This product keeps my ends healthier for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the sprayer cannot reach the bottom of the bottle, leaving  lot of product in the bottle. I have to dump the rest of the old bottle into the new bottle.</li>
            <li> My bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed in any way and didn&#x27;t appear new. I wondered if it was a knock-off or perhaps used and refilled. For the money, the product I got was not worth it.</li>
            <li> My salon introduced me to It&#x27;s a 10.  I have been a faithful user for about 3 years. It untangles. Conditions.  And it is  a MUST USE product if you use a flat iron. Amazon&#x27;s price beats retail prices every time.  This is the one terrific leave in spray.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> Mom&#x27;s of girls here is your lifesaver for NO MORE TEARS.  I use this product everyday on my seven year old daughters hair.  Her hair is thick and fine....terrible combination for tangles.  Plus, she has a very sensitive head.  I would literally pull my hair out without this product...I have tried many but this is the only one that works for us.  The bonus is it smells good and makes her hair even more shiny.</li>
            <li> Even after using a creme rinse in the shower after washing my hair it can still be a bit knotty &amp; tangled when I go to comb it out.  Just a few sprays (less than you think) &amp; its very easy to comb out &amp; helps the calm frizziness while blowdrying</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years. It is the most wonderful leave-in-conditioner. This smells good and leaves my hair soft and healthy looking. One of my staples!</li>
            <li> This products is barely natural, in addition to that you would have to spray half of the container to do the job</li>
            <li> Wife has me buy this stuff for her and our girls. All I know is that its cheaper than in-store and it makes getting ready for them easier in the am. Sounds like five star product quality to me!!!</li>
            <li> I cannot sing enough praises of this hair product. It is AMAZING. I have type 2c curly hair that is thick but gets greasy easily. This miracle leave in conditioner does everything it claims to!!! It adds body, shine, completely eliminates frizz, protects my hair from heat and stops breakage and split ends. What more could a girl want?! Not to mention the great price Amazon sells it for. Very happy buyer</li>
            <li> Good product, a little pricey though but you already know that when you buy it :) but yes it works ;)</li>
            <li> Worked great great price</li>
            <li> Only a few sprays is all you need. I have very thick unmanageable hair and this works wonders on de tangling it! It does not leave behind a filmy oily residue so it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!! Smells amazing!!!! Keeps my curly unruley hair tamed and minimizes frizz!</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT A LOT, IT&#x27;S REALLY HELP</li>
            <li> I love It&#x27;s a 10!!! This is my favorite product in their line. It might be a bit pricy but well worth it!!</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about purchasing this online but it was cheaper than purchasing it in the stores. Received the product and it was the exact item I wa wanting. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Love it and will continue to repurchase and he scent is great also!</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on all of the reviews and the fact that my beautician (whom I go to quarterly) recommended it. For the sake of the review: I have extremely thick, natural, curly hair (Afr. Am. 3c/4a) that tangles easily and can be somewhat difficult to tame. I have been trying to love this product for a while, but have yet to find a way to apply and use it in my hair that gives me wonderful results - I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the product and my hair or just my application/use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this: do not let the pump bottle in the pictures fool you. This leave in conditioner has a very high viscosity. I expected to be able to mist this all over my hair and instead got a product that sprays out in thick streaks. Instead of having product disperse throughout my hair as I spray, I get concentrated areas where the product lands. I have found it more functional to remove the pump, squeeze product into my hand, rub my hands together and then rub the product throughout my hair. The first time that I used it, I noticed that my hair felt like it had an artificial, almost waxy coating. Since then, I&#x27;ve determined that this works better when using a minimal amount throughout my hair. In all honesty, the only of the 10 benefits that I&#x27;ve actually noticed on my hair is a slight shine, which is why I&#x27;ll give the product 3 stars. Unless something changes between now and the time that I finish my current bottle, I won&#x27;t buy it again. In all honesty, the only reason that I&#x27;m going to continue using it is because of how much I paid for the product. Maybe the miracle needs time to manifest...</li>
            <li> I friggin LOVE this product. This is my first ever Amazon review and it is well deserved! This product really is amazing, and does everything it says. I have thick frizzy wavy/curly hair and I used this the other day and literally people couldn&#x27;t stop complimenting my hair. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again as it is just the best thing ever. The price is really good as well. Considering I live in London, we can only get it online and it is TRIPLE the price which is annoying because everything here is DOUBLE/TRIPLE the price. Nonetheless whenever my friend goes to the states I will order this to her address. I am addicted! love love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the money. I ride and die by this product. Would recommend to anybody for any hair need! Split ends, humidity, frizz! Anything</li>
            <li> got this for my sister - her words the best thing she has tried in a while - leaves hair feeling smooth and sliky</li>
            <li> I love this product, and I love that I found it for such a great price.</li>
            <li> Eh, I wanted to like this, mostly because it was expensive, but I didn&#x27;t really see any difference in my hair. I have thick, dry and curly hair that frizzes easily and it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. I got a great hair cut and started using Hask Argan oil products (conditioner, oil and once weekly deep conditioner) and that seems to be a more effective (and cheaper) regiment.</li>
            <li> My hair is think and kinky. I always have a problem with my hair because it was tangled. I tried this one because of the awesome reviews about it. I’m happy that it works well on my crazy hair. I will always buy this product! I could fix my hair easier and faster now that I have this.</li>
            <li> Not much keeps the knots out of my hair but this stuff does, I love it, wish I had found it sooner</li>
            <li> I stopped using this spray for a few months and I could definitely see the difference. They spray makes my hair very smooth.</li>
            <li> This product helps detangle hair and keeps it silky.  While it&#x27;s expensive, I think it&#x27;s worth it.  It&#x27;s not a miracle product, but it sure helps a lot!</li>
            <li> I have very long thin hair. It gets tangled VERY easily. I got so tired of taking showers and leaving conditioner in for long periods of time, only to have my hair come out in a huge ball of knots. I dreaded washing my hair. My hair dresser recommended this stuff, so I gave it a try. I was a little apprehensive because of the price, so I bought the small bottle. I ended up LOVING this stuff. I no longer dread taking showers. I put it on my hair a little after getting out of the shower, and then my hair is actually easy to comb. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, somewhat dry, hair and I leave this in my hair every day, either after schampooing or just wetting my hair.  It gives definition without being crusty.  I have to have it!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair that is very difficult to comb after showering but after discovering this product my problems are a thing of the past. My hair has been so much healthier and manageable since using It&#x27;s a 10. Spray it on after washing your hair when it&#x27;s still wet and you&#x27;ll feel the difference right away. Amazon has the best price that I have ever seen for it.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over a year now.  My hair feels just like when I leave the beauty shop!</li>
            <li> This hair product is a must, especially if you have thick/unruly hair like I do. My hair is coarse (texture) and thick (I have a lot of it), and its a ten DOES do miraculous things to tame and beautify my hair. I used the &amp;#34;its a 10 miracle leave in product for blondes&amp;#34; for a few months prior to using this product. I changed to this original formula when the Blonde stuff ran out because it is less expensive. If you don&#x27;t mind the price difference (maybe 5-7 dollars more), and you are a blonde (especially with colored/highlighted hair), I would recommend the blonde formula... it does a little better job of addressing the straw-like texture/stringiness that can plague those of us with bottle-blonde locks. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who is willing to invest in a one-step way to improve the texture, manageability, shine, and softness of their hair. This is also- by far - the cheapest price-per-ounce I have ever found for an its a 10 product. Good value.</li>
            <li> A friend turned me on to this product last summer and I&#x27;v been using it ever since.  I am a swimmer and found that my hair was always dry.  My friend recommended this product and I like the way it makes my hair feel.  The only downside is the high price.</li>
            <li> best product ever!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair very soft and easy tho brush! I truly recommend it if you are looking for something after shampoo that really works</li>
            <li> My hair after several years of dying, straightening, blowing it dry, etc. Was VERY damaged. This product saved it! It was 1,000 times easier to comb out after washing, no breakage, and it makes my hair feel sooo soft. I highly recommend this product! The one con is that it does make roots slightly oily, just avoid directly spraying it in your root area.</li>
            <li> The best way to stop your stylist from recommending products to you. Just tell them you use this, and they have nothing more to say! It replaces so many products, leave- in conditioner, anti frizz, heat protectant, split end treatment...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product since it came out about five (?) years ago, and it&#x27;s all I use. I am not a professional and not offering this as advice, but I water this down into a sprayer half and half. I do it because it&#x27;s so rich and thick I feel like I&#x27;m using too much, and because my hair is so thick and coarse I feel like it works through my hair better. It may seem pricey, but it replaces like, four other products, and this size (10 oz) will last me a good three months or so.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product regularly. This is a much better value than you will find it the larger stores.</li>
            <li> this stuff has the most awful chemical smell -it is so strong that it overwhelms you and disturbs your consciousness-it must be toxic-it must be some left over waste from a monsanto plant</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years now. It is the best product I have ever used on my hair! Absolutely perfect for color treated hair, \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; detangles, repairs and adds protection for all those harsh styling processes that we put our hair through on a daily basis. A must have for all who care about the condition of their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002CMLHEC It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Product, 10-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be possible to top the &amp;#34;12 Benefits&amp;#34; leave in/detangling spray I tried recently, but this is at least as good.  Possibly even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is difficult to get started.  It&#x27;s thick, like a conditioner, so you have to prime the pump A LOT to get it to spray.  But once it does spray, it comes out as a fine mist so it very evenly distributes through the hair.  I have to use a lot at once, but I have long, thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My standard way of using this is to use shampoo and conditioner, then spray this on wet (well, towel-dried) hair.  After that, I comb through with a detangling brush and let my hair air-dry.  Sometimes the next morning I use a hair oil, as well, although it&#x27;s not strictly necessary as this product does quite a good job of conditioning.  It does not weigh my hair down and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue (or have a smell after I apply it).  I get a lot of shine and lasting manageability, as well as some frizz and flyaway control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely happy with this and so glad I was able to test it out.  I will totally be buying it again when I run out of other detanglers.</li>
            <li> As a detangler this product is great.  It&#x27;s really helpful when combing my hair out when it&#x27;s wet.  Other than that, I haven&#x27;t noticed any other benefits.  My hair doesn&#x27;t seem any different as far as silkiness and shininess.  I will probably continue to buy though, since the detangling aspect of it is good.  Otherwise, meh.</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy, not-quite-curly, definitely not straight.  Most notably, the ends of my hair, healthy or not, inherently spread out from each other so my hair always expands as it falls - no sleekness is possible.  My mom always said she was jealous of my hair when I was a kid because, in her words, I could do it like Princess Diana if I wanted to.  Yeah, Princess Diana dealt with her hair by cutting it off.  At any rate, this stuff is wonderful.  It doesn&#x27;t change the essential nature of my hair, but it just makes it WAY more manageable.  And it makes it possible for the ends to lie flat, in line with each other.  The other product I use to ensure that is PhytoSpecific Moisturizing Styling balm for Ultra-dry hair, only on the ends - that stuff is not joking around.  All in all, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is one of those &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; products.  The cost is a bit pricey but I find myself coming back and buyin git anyway especially after trying other products I have wasted my money on.</li>
            <li> Great product... Been using for years. Makes my hair healthy and no tangles. Great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff! My hair is so soft and I also use it for my daughters hair also. It smells really great! Buy this! My daugher and I would both get tangled hair from bed head but after using this product that is not an issue anymore. I have been using it for months now and my hair is healthier and happier!</li>
            <li> My wife likes how this makes her hair feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff. It tames my very full heads of thick hair.</li>
            <li> My husband has long, naturally curly hair and has been using WEN to tame his mane.  That gets pretty expensive, a stylist told me about this product, so I bought some and it is great for every hair type, but on my hubby, it really detangles and manages his wild hair wonderfully.  It works really great for long hair, especially if you can put a liberal amount on, then braid it and let it dry or almost, when you take out the braid, it is soft and wavy.  If you can&#x27;t afford to keep using WEN or can&#x27;t even give it a try, use this and I think you&#x27;ll be happy.  It&#x27;s expensive, but it really does work.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the reviews and I was looking for a good conditioner. I have medium frizzy curly hair and this 10 miracle product made my hair feel dirty after applying it while my hair was wet. It did nothing for the frizz and the smell is awful it did detangle, but I have used many products that can do that.  I can&#x27;t believe anyone would give this product a high review. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the product, it does what it says it&#x27;ll do, and it&#x27;s super easy to use. The ordering experience was great, came quickly, absolutely no complaints!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a leave in conditioner for a long time.  My hair is in the best shape ever, and the shine has come back too!</li>
            <li> Orderd this for my girlfreind,.....she&#x27;s used it before!......it&#x27;s allot easier to comb her long hair after she washes it......its like WD-40 for her hair brush......that&#x27;s how I see it anyways</li>
            <li> I love this product and all the products made by this company.  Maybe I would not use it if I wasn&#x27;t still working, but I have fine hair and it helps alot.  Thanks so much</li>
            <li> Wife says, &amp;#34;This stuff is amazing!  Great product.  Makes your hair extremely healthy.  I cant live without it now...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Husband says, &amp;#34;I accidentally purchased this for the wife and now she is hooked!&amp;#34;  hehe</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely fantastic! I use it every time I wash my hair and dry it. It smells AMAZING!! I think it&#x27;s a coconut type smell, but not bad at all even though I don&#x27;t care for coconut ! It leave your hair smoother and dries it much quicker. I just recommend not using too much, not too little, as it did become kind of thick and almost greasy the one time I did use too much. And of course too little will just not do the job all over your hair. I spray this on after I use It&#x27;s A 10 leave in conditioner. Works amazing!!!</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely amazing product!!! It hydrates and renews dry, brittle hair. It makes my hair so much softer and manageable! It also smells goos too!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, leave my hair in a really good shape. Super happy!!!!</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with static. I&#x27;ve grown my hair out for the first time and the static has only gotten worse. As a last-ditch effort before cutting it,  I decided to give It&#x27;s a 10 a try.  I used the leave-in product along with the Miracle Hair Mask and the static is gone!! I used to highlight the snot out of my hair, but recently went dark to give it a little break, but the static hung around. I feel like this stuff really is a miracle. I&#x27;ve tried everything else on my hair (coconut oil treatments made it worse, BS/ACV no-poo made it worse) and nothing worked. Now it&#x27;s soft and SHINY and manageable. I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.  I don&#x27;t have the shampoo, but will probably get it once my current shampoo runs out. I used to do things to cover up the static, but this seems to be an actual cure for static.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  I&#x27;ve tried many other protectants/leave-ins, and It&#x27;s a 10 is 100% my favorite.  It leaves your hair soft and shiny after styling without weighing it down or looking greasy.  Even if you&#x27;re air drying your hair, you&#x27;ll notice less frizz and fly-aways.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Its a 10&#x27;Miracle leave in conditioner. Wow!&lt;br /&gt;Does everything you want it to. Has left my hair soo healthy. It looks and feels great. Detangles, smooths and repairs. Doesnt weigh your hair down, is not greasy, oily or thick like others I have tried. (my cuboards are full of hair products that I have discarded because they just dont cut it)&lt;br /&gt;The price is a bit much and it did put me off. But after reading reviews and in search of a good product (for 15 yrs) I bit the bullet, and im soo glad I did. The search is over now thankfully :)</li>
            <li> My hair dresser turned me onto this product and it is wonderful.. My hair is naturally curly/frizzy.  When I use this product, it tames my hair to the point where it is not necessary to straighten it.  Cheaper on amazon that at any store..including Target!</li>
            <li> My barber uses this product.  It worked well for me on a flat top haircut.  I bought a bottle and when my wife tried it, she loved it, so I bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li> I have interesting hair- the kind of hair that can break hairbrushes when using them. (Seriously- I break all of my brushes!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased probably every detangler and leave-in conditioner under the sun but didn&#x27;t like the results of others. Some left my hair too greasy, others made my hair feel like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m seriously in love with this product- After spraying it in my hair, I could run my fingers through. THAT NEVER HAPPENS!!!! My hair feels like silk and after using it once, my coworkers kept complimenting how healthy my hair looked, asking if I got a cut or color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So amazed with this product and so happy I listened to the other reviews on here.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products I&#x27;ve tried that actually lives up to its hype.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but I use maybe 3 squirts on my long hair, so it lasts forever.  I read about it on a beauty blog, but since then it&#x27;s everywhere - my new hairdresser uses it, friends recommend it, etc.  It really is as good as everyone says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair.  The people who are insisting this makes their hair flat or greasy are probably spraying the product all over their hair (including on the roots).  It&#x27;s a leave in conditioner, so only spray it on the mid lengths and the ends.  NOT THE ROOTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents, and I don&#x27;t find this to a strong smell (no stronger than any other hair product I use), and I&#x27;d describe it more of a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell than flowery.  Flowery always comes across as cloying and junior-high-ish to me.</li>
            <li> I have been using It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-in Product for years.  I use it to style my hair.  Leaves no heavy conditioner feeling and smells great. It will smoke up with hot dryer or flat iron.  My hair feels wonderful and healthy. Amazon&#x27;s pricing is typically the best. Supermarkets &amp; CVS sell this 10 oz, Bottle for $35 or more!!!!</li>
            <li> Highlighted and colored. This product is amazing. The texture of my hair feels so healthly. Hard to put into words how amazing my hair feels. I will back again.</li>
            <li> I love this product and was very, very happy to find that I could order it on line and pay less than I would if I purchased it in stores.</li>
            <li> I have long color treated hair (blonde) My hair stylist recommended this product. I spray it lightly all over after washing and towel drying my hair.  It makes my hair very managable, shiny and healthy looking.  I only have to wash every 3-4 days since using this product!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome product&lt;br /&gt;Changed my hair around&lt;br /&gt;Everyone asks me what i used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great time delivering...I have ordered numerous times!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loveeeee it!! :)</li>
            <li> My 2 year old has very fine, fairly thin, and VERY curly hair. I don&#x27;t like using a lot of product on her, for obvious reasons, but I do have to use something to keep her hair from frizzing into one giant puff ball and becoming a tangled nightmare. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of products, and this stuff is hands down the best. It does have parabens, which I don&#x27;t like, but I justify it as ok since it doesn&#x27;t go directly on her skin where it&#x27;s absorbed, just on the length of her hair. That&#x27;s why the 4 star instead of 5. No toxic ingredients please! It just works so well I tolerate it for now, unless I find something that works better without the parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my kiddo, this product keeps her curls together and formed, keeps her hair soft, and the scent is not overly strong (though a little more grown up than I&#x27;d like for a little girl). I use it on her hair daily and wash it only about 1-2x a week with a sulfate free cleanser (Mixed Chicks kids line). This product does not weigh her hair down, but obviously she&#x27;s a little little kid and I don&#x27;t really style it. I just wet it, comb through, and squeeze a few pumps of this product into the curls and let it air dry. I tried a small travel size of this product first and it lasted at least a couple months, so I think this big bottle will last me til she graduates high school. Or at least kindergarten. :)</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel. It makes it soft and silky. I has a real nice smell as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 is by far the best product to moisturize and protect your hair. It is available in many salons but this price beat competitors by 1/3 of the price!  It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I buy this product and for fine hair it works wonderfully.  I am very pleased and I like that I can get a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!! Has helped get my hair back in normal condition (my hair was extremely dry).  It is easy to work with and is not heavy on the hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly a year and I love it. I have fine hair that tends to frizz easily and this spray is pretty much the only thing that helps calm it. I spray a little on my wet hair and then blow dry it. My hair looks smooth, silky, and shiny. If you&#x27;ve got finer hair like mine you probably won&#x27;t have to use too much of the product to get good results. One of these bottles can last a long time. And obviously buying it on Amazon is way cheaper than in a salon.</li>
            <li> This product smells terrible, my whole family is trying to get away from me it stinks so bad. It works good, but smells bad. In many reviews it seems to smell fine, I think i might&#x27;ve gotten a bad product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!  It&#x27;s great for my hair and this size bottles lasts a long time! I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> If your hair has been traumatized or damaged in any way, this is the leave-in product that you HAVE TO HAVE!</li>
            <li> Smells good and it works!  Received on time. Great product. It does what it is suppose to do, hair feels manageable, soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and the wifey now uses it as well. You can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon which beats Target by about $10. They both rave how this product makes their hair straight and smooth. My wife has very natural curly hair just below the shoulder length hair and says only two squirts does the trick with taking out the curl and giving her relatively straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative is I still feel the price while better here is still to $$.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this a long time ago and am just now writing a review.  I purchased from Amazon directly (not another seller) and had ordered this based on the solid positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regretfully, I did not take the time to look over the ingredients as I generally would. I was out of my usual products and in a hurry to get something but too busy to shop around.  So when it arrived, I tore open the packaging and immediately after my next shower, warmed this up in my palms and applied it to my wet ends...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running it through my hair, it felt a bit sticky and dried that way too. I did not care for it at all and thought maybe I would see if another family member but like it better with their hair.  Until later, when I read over the bottle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this product is not paraben free and that alone is a deal breaker for me. This stuff, sadly, went straight in the trash bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the first 2 ingredients say a lot about what we are paying for and how good it is for our hair.......&lt;br /&gt;Water and Cetearyl Alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fail! The only miracle I see here is product build up that might fake us to believe it is doing something good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, based on the reviews, I could be wrong about what this can do for which hair types, etc.... But this is what I generally find with an ingredient list that starts like this one does... Not to mention that parabens are found in breast tumors (see ingredients: Methylparaben, Propylparaben, etc). They are hormone disruptors, and our skin being our largest organ, this is a problem, in my book.  Well, and in other countries, where they are illegal.  It&#x27;s a shame, in my opinion, that they are in American products in general!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, off my soapbox.  Needless to say, I do not recommend this product.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I am not a product junkie and rarely use hair products.  I will make an exception with this one.&lt;br /&gt;I blow dry my hair every other day and also curl it once in a while.  Even after the first use, I have noticed a difference in my hair.  More sheen and just looks more overall healthy.</li>
            <li> Like I always say, what it works for most people, doesn&#x27;t mean it works for everyone!!! I have been looking for a good product, to help me out with my frizzy hair, to define my curls, and to leave my hair soft, my hair is naturally curly, I used this product according with instructions on the label, I always use a good sulfate free shampoo, and a good conditioner, it wasn&#x27;t enough for this product to deliver the desired results, when I applied it my hair was soft and I thought it was going to be the top 10 miracle for my curls, WRONG... my hair was as frizzy as if I didn&#x27;t use any conditioner, or any leave in miracle 10 product!!! Vatika coconut oil is 100 times better for me than this product and for a fraction of it&#x27;s price, thank goodness I bought the small bottle to try it at first, I won&#x27;t buy it again  :(</li>
            <li> Great product .  3 sprays leaves my hair soft and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product! I use it everyday and have noticed a huge difference in my hair since I began using it. Makes my thick curly hair easy to brush after washing and protects it from heat and styling.</li>
            <li> Really works. Easy to comb through the tangles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for just about a year now and it is worth every penny. I have long hair and this is perfect for getting knots out after the shower. It also leaves my hair feeling great and protects it from blow drying. I have also noticed a lot less breakage since using this product. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended that I buy this product so I did. I am very glad that I took her advice. My hair is much softer nowadays. Additionally, it is a great detangler and has helped with my split ends. It creates very manageable hair, preventing breakage,  making my hair look much better than any other product I have used (and I have used a lot).</li>
            <li> HEY THIS STUFF WORKS SO WELL WHEN U WANT TO LEAVE THE HOUSE WITH WET HAIR. IT REALLY IS A MIRACLE PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> This had such high reviews, I don&#x27;t hate it.  I don&#x27;t love it.  I just find it alright.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair silky smooth.  It does detangle it.  Nothing really special!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so soft! It is a really expensive product if you buy it at a store, so it is a great idea to get it online.</li>
            <li> Three years ago, my stylist suggested this for my wavy, thick, long hair that we double process color every 6-8 weeks. Within days of use I could tell the improved difference!  My hair is so happy.  I have minimal split ends (even with the intense coloring, and daily heated styling).  My 14 year old daughter is also a fan. If we run out of the spray, it is almost a family emergency :-)&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love looking for deals so this Amazon price is the best price per ounce I&#x27;ve found over the three years of searching. Hope you have the success we&#x27;ve had with It&#x27;s A 10!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this at the bueaty shop so now I buy it fir me the first time i fell in love with it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my short hair. It&#x27;s a leave in conditioner. I apply after a wash to semi damp hair and in the morning my hair isn&#x27;t standing up all over the place.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair knots up pretty quickly.  This helps a great deal with that.  This is our fourth bottle of this product.  We can&#x27;t seem to find anything else that works as well as this for her hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly (fuzzy) hair, so go course, i always want to use my flat iron on it th most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This summer, I used.its a 10 leave in product and stayed away from the blow dryer and flat iron..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell a BIG difference in my hair and I&#x27;ve been fighting the battle for 30 years. would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Was as expected. Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I used it right after the shower and brushed my hair. It would have typically tangled but this time it didn&#x27;t. My hair is still kind of frizzy after using it however, it is much less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Works great!  As described</li>
            <li> I love this hair conditioner.  Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used.  My hair is so dry and it always makes it feel softer right after spraying it on.  I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> i was introduced to this product from my hairdresser and I fell in love with it! It literally does 10 things without making hair look and feel greasy. It works great on wet or dry hair when brushed through thoroughly. It does not have overpowering smell. Sensitive skin approve. No itching after application.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this at the local discount store for $17 for the small bottle twice because I love the way it makes my thin, straight hair feel. I also use about 12 sprays each time...more than the four sprays recommended...ooops! I guess now I know why I go through it so fast...still, it is worth it!</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law  uses this product on my grandchildren&#x27;s hair--the smell was very fresh and enticing.  I&#x27;m 72 years old and find my hair texture is changing.  I use this product immediately after washing my hair and find that my hair is shinier and smells lovely.  A real plus.  I highly recommend IT&#x27;S A 10--LEAVE IT IN.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product - can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I got the hair spray and it was missing the tip that your press down to use. So I can&#x27;t use the hair spray at all. I didn&#x27;t know if I could get a replace tip sent to me. So I can use the hairspray?</li>
            <li> THis product is terrific! I love the way my hair looks and feels after using It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Great Hair Product! Love How My Hair Feels At The End Of My Daily Hair Care Routine (Matrix Biolage Shampoo &amp; Conditioner FollowedBySome Cebu Oil And Finally It&#x27;s A 10.</li>
            <li> my daughter thinks it is the best treatment she has ever used on her hair it does not make her hair sticky feeling</li>
            <li> I started using this product as my hair was so dry and based on the reviews on amazon, thought it would be a good chance for it to work. I love the way it has helped repair my hair and it is not heavy or oily - plus the price on amazon is great.</li>
            <li> I put this in after showering daily. It leaves hair soft and shiny, as well as protects your hair from frizz, fly-aways, humidity and any heat (straightener, curler, hair-dryer). it really is 10/10.</li>
            <li> My  wife loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> I was buying this at my salon when I got my hair cut and it was quite expensive. But then I found iton here for a great value.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy, wavy hair and I love this product! It enables me to put down my hair, and it makes my hair soft and shiny, unlike other things products I have used in the past! A bit pricey though</li>
            <li> love this product will buy again and recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> Have not seen an incredible difference with this product alone. Smells good though.</li>
            <li> Great conditioning for fine hair. Doesn&#x27;t get greasy if you spray into hand and smooth into ends instead of spraying where it can get to the scalp.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I love it. And would love to buy sgain</li>
            <li> This stuff really is a 10.  I fell in love with it. It makes my hair silky, smoothed out any frizz, and tangles are a thing of the past</li>
            <li> Love the smell!  Leaves my hair soft and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a little more than 5 years and swear by it! My hair type is thick with a slight wave, I have very long hair past my shoulders that has been color treated blonde for more than 10 years. I put my hair through a lot of stress with heat styling and being in the sun a lot through my job and recreational activities. I use It&#x27;s a 10 after every wash before I brush my hair out. It is so light that it does not weigh it down when I dry it. The spray is easy to use to get an even distribution. I can notice a difference with this product. It is easier to brush with less tangles, it dries light and smooth, less split ends, and less dead hair I have to cut off when I visit the salon. My stylist recommended this product when it first came out and I plan using this original version for a long time!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I have long hair and this product helps to keep my hair shiny, silky and tangle-free. I towel dry and squirt a few pumps into my hand and apply (except for roots). I think spraying directly on the hair might be a little too much, so I spray into my hands, then apply. I use this in conjunction with my regular shampoo and conditioner products. This gives my hair the extra moisture, shine and control it needs. I find it helps keep the frizz and split ends at bay and my hair styles better. Excellent product and I would highly recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;Please click yes below if you feel this review was helpful to you:)</li>
            <li> love it I use it every day no matter what it seems like I pump a few extra squirts extra every day and it lasts forever. Pump gets clogged easily.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have used it for years and now buy it on Amazon because I can save some money. This product protects the life of my hair against heat products like none other.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this only two weeks ago so it may be too early to tell but seems to work very well.  she applies it to her hair after washing it and her hair looks fuller and shiny.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My hair has always been super knotted when I get out of the shower. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried different shampoos, conditioners, detangling sprays, the list goes on and on. I did use this one detangling spray for years but of course the company stopped producing it last year. When I found out I was pissed and annoyed because once again I had to start the search for something to help with my knotty hair. Luckily my hairstylist recognized my knot problem and said she had this new stuff called It&#x27;s a 10 and tried it on my hair. It was amazing! Once I got home I immediately started searching for it online to see where I could buy it. Amazon was the obvious choice for searching and luckily it was available. I definitely recommend this product to people who have dry or knot-prone hair. I would suggest trying the smaller bottle first if you don&#x27;t have a chance to test it out because it is expensive but I just bought my second bottle and I&#x27;ve had the first bottle for 7-8 months, using it 3-4 times a week and 7-10 pumps each time.</li>
            <li> but I read all of the reviews and decided to buy this product. It smells great and better yet IT WORKS. I have thick, kind of dry, curly hair. I just followed the directions and let it air dry. My hair is soft, shiny, and smooth. It isn&#x27;t frizzy at all. I usually have to use 2 or 3 products in my hair, but now I only have to use one! I&#x27;m very happy with this product. It may seem kind of expensive, but the 10 oz bottle is worth it. You will also save money in the long run since you will only need one hair product now!</li>
            <li> Great product..and once again Amazon has it the cheapest! Leaves your hair feeling smooth and knot free after the shower. I have long hair and it was always knotted post-showering.</li>
            <li> Words cannot express how much I love this product. I have very color damaged hair and have been searching for a product to help counter that damage. This product works as a diet angler, leave in conditioner, and heat protectant. So although it is more expensive than I would usually pay for a product, I&#x27;m also getting lots of uses in one spray. Plus it smells good. A must in any hair product in my house. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Loved this product.  I am in the process of letting my hair grow out and it was recommended by the person who cuts my hair.  So glad I bought it.  In less than one year, my hair went from extremly short and cropped to down between my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> The product was packaged very well and I received it quicker than I though I would.  Love it and plan on ordering it again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I have very coarse, curly hair. My mom is a beautician and I have tried a lot of very high end products to try to make my hair smooth and manageable. Some others worked well but this stuff blows them all of the water. My hair is also long and thick so I run out of smoothing creams and such, very quickly. About 4 sprays of this and my hair is sooo soft and shiny. All the girls that I work with went out and bought a bottle when I told them what I used. Really, really great product!!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  It truly is a TEN......I have course and curly hair and this product seems to soften the curls and protect my hair from the flat iron and blow dryer.  All in one product!!!  I am never without this product.</li>
            <li> perfect product, have been using it for over 8 years now and it helps my hair smooth out perfectly and protects it against heat</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter. She loves it, says it&#x27;s a great product &amp; well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Truly a great product that does a number of things....for me, it is one of the few products that can actually detangle my hair successfully, without my hair getting stuck in the comb or brush.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly and was brand new as advertised.</li>
            <li> good product i like it</li>
            <li> Love this product. I can not comb my hair with out it after a shower. Well worth looking into for tangled hair. A must have staple.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it... Calms my wavy hair. And, this is one of the best prices I have ever seen for it.</li>
            <li> Hair seem smoother but can&#x27;t really tell if is the humidity or the product. Keep in view!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, I use heat on my hair almost everyday and not only does it help untangle but it heals my hair and keeps it replenished. Best product hands down.</li>
            <li> Seriously amazing as a detangler. This in conjunction with the Macadamia Oil hair mask has really made such a huge difference in my hair. I have thick long hair, tons of it really. I was never able to comb my hair upon getting out of the shower and I couldn&#x27;t understand how other people could do it, either. My hair would dry (naturally, no hair dryer) into this big frizzy fluffball with knots and...it was not cute.&lt;br /&gt;Now my hair is just so much better. I use the hair mask on the lower half of my hair, then when I&#x27;m out of the shower I use a SMALL amount of this on the top half of my head and a bit more on the lower half. Boom, hair that is soft and comb-able...dries into a wavy mess because that&#x27;s just how my hair is but its soft to the touch and not frizzy and crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this stuff has a very nice smell that isn&#x27;t too potent or perfumey. A &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; kind of scent. If you don&#x27;t go hog wild/don&#x27;t have tons of hair - this stuff can last you a long long time. Mine usually lasts me almost a year as long as I don&#x27;t use it excessively - and so the price isn&#x27;t bad. I&#x27;d rather splurge for this awesome stuff than keep buying inferior products that I have to use more of more often...ya dig?</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff.  My hair has been really dry from years of flat ironing my naturally curly hair straight.  3 months ago, my sister who is a cosmetologist, recommended this to me when I decided to stop fighting my natural curl.  I originally bought the smallest size because of the price, I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money in something I wasn&#x27;t sure would work for me or not.  I use this after shampooing and conditioning.  I do an all over spray application, then style as usual with Bed Head&#x27;s Foxy Curls and blow dry with diffuser.  I had thought that my curl just wasn&#x27;t the same anymore after hormonal changes from pregnancy, but my sister insisted that it was from my hair being overly dry (which didn&#x27;t feel dry to me).  She said this was a miracle product, and it is.  3 months later and my curls look like they did 15 years ago.  I am once again receiving so many compliments on my curls, just as I did through my early 20s.</li>
            <li> Best product for getting rid of tangles in long hair.  Smells terrific!  I&#x27;ve tried other products and this one exceeds all the rest.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. My 4 year old daughter&#x27;s hair can be hard to comb after a bath. When I use a few sprays of this then it makes it soooo much easier. She loves the smell of it too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two years. I have very thick, frizzy, wavy hair. This product has allowed me to grow my hair to my waist, because it is now so easy to care for. I don&#x27;t even blow dry it, or flat iron it anymore, I just let it air dry. It smells great, and leaves my hair so soft and takes the frizz right out without weighing it down. I have lots of body now, and my hair has volume at the roots. It is the only product I use in my hair, I don&#x27;t even use hairspray anymore! If when my hair is dry, and I put it back, I just spray a little and it keeps fly aways down and baby hairs back. I just cannot say enough, it&#x27;s the perfect product!</li>
            <li> I started using this product probably around a year ago now. My mom introduced it to me when I was home visiting. It detangles the most tangled hair when applied after washing - makes combing a breeze! But the biggest thing is that it leaves your hair so soft! I couldn&#x27;t believe it that first time I used it how smooth and soft my hair was. This hair concoction may be a bit expensive, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed my hair getting any softer or less frizzy but I do feel like it works as a heat protectant pretty well. I would recommend buying this but not necessarily as a strong repair agent.</li>
            <li> Absolutely this is a &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;.  I have long thin hair which always seems to look kinda frizzy and fly away after blow drying.  I used to have to use a straightener to get the nice shiny smooth hair....not any more.  I use this and its like a miracle.  My hair looks shiny, healthy and fabulous.  Plus I just use a round brush with my hair dryer and I still get the fullness I like instead of always flattening it and damaging it with a straightener.  I will definately be purchasing more....this is my miracle hair product.</li>
            <li> I love how It&#x27;s a 10 makes my hair feel.  I spray it in after I wash, then just let my hair air dry or blow dry.  Makes my hair soft and shinny and does not leave any &amp;#34;product feel&amp;#34;.  My good friend who is a hair dresser recommended this product to me.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but lasts a long time and is well worth it!</li>
            <li> First of all the shipping on this product was crazy fast. I had it within 3 days! Kudos to the seller for that. This is the largest sized bottle you can buy and this is a GREAT price for it. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it really is great for all hair types and styles. I have curly hair that&#x27;s prone to frizz and it&#x27;s the perfect thing for styling with moose AND for protecting against the heat when I have to straighten. I even keep a small bottle in my make-up bag for emergencies. Try it! You&#x27;re guaranteed to love it!</li>
            <li> Wife loves the stuff and uses daily so when she runs dry i am often having to search for a good deal and usually Amazon is the place to go. It is rather expensive, but Amazon seems to have some of the best prices on it. Not sure why so expensive (you&#x27;d think they put gold flakes in this stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: be careful who you order from because there are some counterfeits of this product being sold. If you look closely and compare the actual bottles (bottom), you will notice the knock-off is slightly different (almost unnoticeable) and also the packaging that it is wrapped in is also slightly different - but the dead giveaway is when you shake the bottle. With the knock-off product, you can literally hear that it has been obviously watered down. The product&#x27;s viscosity should always be very thick, and so, when you vigorously shake the bottle, you should not hear a whole lot of sloshing around - if that makes sense. In fact, the product, when shaken hard, should sound/feel very thick - almost hard to believe a liquid that thick can be &amp;#34;sprayed&amp;#34; out of the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, buyer beware. We ordered two of the smaller sized (I think 4 oz) - and one was good, but the other was a knock off. To my surprise, (maybe it was the vendor - shipped by Amazon) but there was no &amp;#34;return&amp;#34; link - since I guess the product falls in a non-returnable category. Had to dig around for a while to find an Amazon cust svc number to call - and when I got through they took care of the situation very professionally so we are pleased with Amazon - just be cautious with this product - even if ordering from an &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34; vendor.</li>
            <li> Awesome price. Awesome product. Makes my hair very smooth and soft. I have thin hair but it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Shipped quick. Packaged excellent. I will buy from this seller again and again.</li>
            <li> My aunt gave me a tester bottle of this after she said it made her fair too flat, so I sprayed some in after a shower and I was amazed. My hair isn&#x27;t crazy unruly, but it certainly isn&#x27;t easy to style. This makes my hair soft and detangled every time. It protects from heat styling and restores moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say what it works like for other hair, but for my normal type hair it works wonders.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist turned me on to this product. Its the only thing that controls my curly/wavy thick hair. I used to use Frizz ease but have replaced it with this. Its not super oily and it detangles very well. I use it on wet hair before combing/styling and it leaves me frizz free all day.</li>
            <li> Love it&#x27;s a 10! However this isn&#x27;t an authentic product. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price. Product is clearly not the real deal after weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product at a very good price.</li>
            <li> Incredible product. Whole family uses and loves this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 years. My fine straight hair is hard to comb out after its washed and this product is a great detangler. My hair was very damaged due to all the coloring and styling products I&#x27;ve used. After a few months my stylist even noticed a difference withy hair not being as dry. Good product.</li>
            <li> The best stuff ever!!! Detangles and stops hair breakage! Using this for life.</li>
            <li> This product truely is a miracle.  It detangles hair.  Leaves is managable, silky, and smelling great.  It&#x27;s a must have for all ages, and all types of hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that tangles, but also gets weighed down easily. The tangling is especially bad when my hair is wet. I like to be able to run my fingers through my hair and just feel soft, clean hair without any gross product feel. I&#x27;ve tried wash out &amp; leave-in conditioners as we&#x27;ll as mousse, gels, serums and creams. To name just a few:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene shampoo and conditioner are great, but their mouse created static in my hair and left a weird residue.&lt;br /&gt;Matrix made a really great leave-in called sleek look and I used it for a couple years, but they changed their formula a few years ago and now it makes my hair feel tacky and no longer soft.&lt;br /&gt;Tresemme&#x27;s smoothing spray was awful, it didn&#x27;t soften my hair at all and added static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened upon It&#x27;s A 10 a couple years ago in a salon.  Because I don&#x27;t have the best luck with most products, I started with the smallest size.  I am so happy I tried it. Even with wet hair, I&#x27;m able to run my fingers through my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any strange residue, and my hair is just soft and smells/feels clean. I prefer squeeze type bottles just so I know I can use every last drop, but the spray works surprisingly well. I am on my 2nd 10 oz bottle and the 2oz starter bottle has been perfect for traveling, it&#x27;s never leaked.  I use it every day and the last 10 oz bottle lasted close to a year, it&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m really loving this product!  I have naturally curly hair and finding a product that adequately moisturizes my hair is hard but this seems to be doing the trick.  It leaves my hair soft and frizz-free!  Much better price than the salon!</li>
            <li> This product makes my natural hair very soft and very manageable when I choose to sit under the dryer and straighten it. I also has a very nice scent.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe anyone would say this smells good!  It&#x27;s sooooooooo strong, and it&#x27;s giving me a headache.  It&#x27;s like an extremely pungent flower/citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a definite try before you buy thing.  Well, back to the mall to return it.</li>
            <li> Right when this product arrived at my front door, I ripped away the packaging and started spraying. Does that tell you how much I love this product? I cannot live without it! The smell is AMAZING. Let&#x27;s just say my hubby is stuck to my hair all the time smelling it. LOL! I love how it makes my hair detangled, smooth, smelling great, and revived! AMAZING PRODUCT! Thank you it&#x27;s a 10!</li>
            <li> loooove this stuff. great shipping.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve tried many other brands but none even come close to this product.  I love it because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and leave a tacky, stiff or oily residue.  I spray just a few pumps into my hair (a little really goes a long way) and comb it through my towel dried hair.  Then I blowdry/style it when my hair has just dried to a slightly damp stage.  It leaves my hair soft and styled and smelling great.  I have tried the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In with Keratin, but I did not like it.  It made my scalp break out a bit and it just wan&#x27;t as good as this (original) version.  I also recommend buying it here at Amazon because it is a lot cheaper than at retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;I recently turned my friend on to this product too.  A bunch of us recently took a trip to Hawaii.  After one my friend&#x27;s first shower, she was disappointed to find that she&#x27;d forgotten to bring her usual (non-It&#x27;s a 10) leave-in conditioner.  I offered her my It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In I&#x27;d brought (Note: I purchased this 10 oz. bottle, but poured some into a 2 oz travel spray bottle for the trip so TSA wouldn&#x27;t  confiscate it from my carry-on luggage.) and she ended up using it during throughout the trip.  At one point we gals were talking about how much we loved Hawaii and my friend commented how much she loved the water in the hotel because it was just doing great things for her hair; her hair was soft and styled great.  I had to stop her and let her know that I was pretty sure it was the It&#x27;s a 10 Leave-in and not the hotel water.  After we returned home, I received a text from her that she missed the leave-in so much she went to her nearest hair salon and purchased a bottle for full price because she just had to have it.&lt;br /&gt;I love this leave-in conditioner and will probably be a loyal It&#x27;s a 10 customer Leave-In indefinitely.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product exactly as expected. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love it, it does wonders for my hair</li>
            <li> This is the best spray in conditioner ever.</li>
            <li> love this product, fast service</li>
            <li> i can barely comb through my hair without this product.  not heavy for fine hair.  amazing!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, would recommend this to anyone...</li>
            <li> Works great for de-tangling my extra long hair...but its not my favorite scent.  I will continue to use to see if it does a miracle on my hair.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Gets rid of the frizz &amp; protects your hair from hot styling tools.</li>
            <li> EVERYONE SHOULD TRY THIS. THAT IS ALL IM GOING TO SAY</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about three years now.  There have been several other products I have bought, but these now sit in my cupboard and gather dust as I keep going back.  It does make my hair soft and helps with styling without making it stiff.  So far I have not found anything better.</li>
            <li> This product states it does 10 things for your hair. Even if it did 3 of the 10 I&#x27;d love it. It&#x27;s made my color treated hair feel healthy and normal. Use it every day.</li>
            <li> Great size for price! I love everything about this product!! My hair stylist back home uses this product on her clients. I use to get it from her but when I moved I didn&#x27;t have access to it. My local store sells it for too much. I&#x27;m so happy I found it on amazon!</li>
            <li> Silky, smooth, lightweight, tangle-free, shiny! How can I explain my hair now? My hair is naturally light brown but I have lots of ballayage style highlights, so it can feel dry and tangled a lot. My hair is also super fine which adds to how easily it gets tangled. This product works wonderfully. It de-tangles, prevents frizziness, adds shine, and protects my hair from getting split ends. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I highlight my hair and this makes my hair so soft. Sometimes I spray it in my palms and rub it into my ends.</li>
            <li> Hear some many glowing reviews of this product, I finally thought I give it a try. So mad at myself for waiting so long. It detangled my relaxed hair and my new growth better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. I have. Found a new staple hair care&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li> It leaves hair shiney, smooth, and natural.  Not stickey and does not leave a film or heavy feeling on your hair.</li>
            <li> Most of the people using this product are probably women, but I don&#x27;t care. Used along with Dr. Bronners castille soap, this is my everyday conditioner. Right after I get out of the shower, I spray it on and let my hair dry completely. Comb it through, and the result will be every bit of what the description says. Awesome product that I will continue to buy, even though I don&#x27;t want to be seen carrying this bottle around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using 10 since my hairdresser introduce it to me.  It works great and leaves your hair smelling nice.</li>
            <li> Got here fast and I love the product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product -  leaves my hair shiny and smooth! I have recently grown out my hair and living in south Florida my hair gets frizzy - this has been the only product that has helped calm my hair. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I do believe it&#x27;s worth it. I definitely will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Love....love....love this stuff!. My hairdresser gave this stuff to me for the first time and I am addicted! It is great. Helps split ends and dryness. Good heat barrier. All around great product. Worth the money. This bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, curly hair and this detangles very well. But it seems to make my hair a little greasy feeling</li>
            <li> Massive bottle and a DEAL for that price.  This product literally revives ANYONES hair.</li>
            <li> What a great deal for the amount of product</li>
            <li> I am not a HUGE fan of the smell. as far as hair products go there are nicer smelling things. with that said, it does smell decently nice. and it is COMPLETELY worth it. I have awful hair. It is wild, unmanageable, and always really dry and frizzy. This makes me hair soft to the touch and less frizzy so it is a 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> This is a great product... I have completely stopped combing conditioner through my hair and instead spray this in after washing and then comb it through.  It&#x27;s does an outstanding job de-tangling my hair and leaves it very soft.  It does not necessarily do much for keeping the frizz down for me so I smooth my mane with a very small amount of coconut oil after styling/drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. even my hair dresser agrees. and amazon is the lowest price I have found for this</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this product and I love it! I use it every day. It makes my hair softer and more manageable - can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I chose this prod.b/c a friend let me use hers,I would recommend it to anyone &amp; no dislikes!It was not as expensive as other prod.that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and makes your hair feel so good !! I use this in the Summer when I swim and love it!! Shipping was fast!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for roughly about a year now and I love it. I am sure a regular cream rinse would be just as good but I feel that this is a little better than that as you just spray it and then brush your hair. Whereas with a cream rinse you rinse out most of the conditioner. I spray this in while my hair is mostly dry but still damp, scrunch my hair up with my hands and then brush it out. It gets all the tangles out with minimum hair breakage and when my hair dries it is really soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it has proven to be the only leave in conditioner that doesnt leave my hair greasy or under conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine/wavy/frizzy hair and this really helps keep it silky. I even use this on days that I dont really style my hair and it helps keep my natural waves tame.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for years and it is great, would definately recommend if you need a good detangler... works great!</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product at a local salon over a year ago, used it and found it worked very well. When she ran out, I suggested we try to see if it was available on Amazon. She is still pleased with the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s A 10&amp;#34; product but much happier with the Amazon price - which was less than half the salon&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money. You can definitely see a difference (improvement) in your hair&#x27;s condition. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Look it. Makes hair soft and easy comb out</li>
            <li> It makes my bleached and brittle hair soft, smooth and shiny. I use this with the Its a 10 conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite leave in conditioner. It does a great job keeping my hair moisturized and soft in the dry Arizona climate. Unfortunately, it contains parabens and I try not to use products that contain them.</li>
            <li> I really like the weight and quality of the product, but the spray applicator is difficult to use. I ended up taking it off and pouring it.</li>
            <li> ugh! I&#x27;ve tried it twice, waiting a year between each try. Made my hair soft, but MADE MY SKIN BREAK OUT HORRIBLY!! I&#x27;m 44 &amp; looked worse than any teenager. I was horribly embarrassed, couldn&#x27;t wear my hair in a ponytail, tried to cover to hide my face. HORRIBLE! Took 2 months for my face to return back to normal after discontinued use. Sad, I read the wonderful reviews &amp; really wanted it to work for me. Ended up throwing both bottles away.</li>
            <li> This stuff simply works well on my hair, I used it combination with one other product. The bottle lasts almost all year and is well worth the money. Been using It&#x27;s A Ten for two years, my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I have thick but damaged hair. I am afraid of loosing hair from my tangles so I prefer to use a detangleizer. This is exactly what I need</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used.  I purchased a small bottle from the place I get my hair cut. to try and liked it so much purchase the larger bottle on Amazon.  This leave in conditioner makes my hair feel so soft without weighting my hair down.I have thin hair and I spay some on after my shampoo.  I brush my hair without tangles and then rub it in.  I don&#x27;t need to use very much...maybe 6 sprays around my head.  My hair is so manageable and styles very easy.  Good product.</li>
            <li> leaves hair completely tame, soft and shiny. great for detangling! can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to find a product that finally works. Since I started using it I hardly loose any hair when combing through after washing and rinsing with conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this with Chi Silk Infusion. She loves them both and they seem to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product! Does everything it says it does!! Never want to be without it again. It DEFINATELY is a ten!</li>
            <li> Best leave in EVER! Conditions and protects my hair and keeps it looking healthy! Get the bigger bottle because it will last you a lot longer!</li>
            <li> This is a good leave-in product i would recommand. It&#x27;s not that easy to find a leave-in type, and Amazon always got great deal.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I have ever found!  I have very thick/heavy hair and it is a nightmare to work with when wet.  It&#x27;s a 10 is the best detangler and leave in conditioner I have ever used.  It makes it easy to comb through my hair when wet and leaves my hair silky after drying.  Other leave in conditioners I have used have required a generous amount to work and then leave my hair flaky.  This product is light, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and you don&#x27;t have to worry about having to use so much that it dries on your hair and flakes off.  It is also a great heat protectant to use before straightening your hair.</li>
            <li> works great for frizz</li>
            <li> Used other high end products, keep on coming back to this product.  Works amazing to make my hair less frizzy, soft, and manageable and protect my hair from regular heating iron damage.  i hope this product will never get discontinued !</li>
            <li> Given the reviews I was expecting a lot from this product, admittedly unrealistically. It&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but finding the right amount to put in your hair is critical. One spray wasn&#x27;t enough to do anything to my hair that I couldn&#x27;t with a little moroccan oil, but two made it shiny and oily. Calling it a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; is definitely exaggerating, but the product would most likely work well for those of you with long dry hair, or textured hair. If your hair still feels rough after you thoroughly soak it in a shower, try this product out.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. However, my stylist said that products such as these should always be purchased at a salon since many online distributors dilute the original product to sell more. There was a noticeable difference between the bottle I purchased at a salon and the one I purchased online. The online bottle made my hair feel kind of sticky and it didn&#x27;t smell the same. My salon doesn&#x27;t sell this product, but it can be found at &#x27;Hair Cuttery&#x27; and other lower-end salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE of this online product.</li>
            <li> Truly a miracle, I recommend it to everyone I know. This is the only product that let me brush my hair after swim practice every day. And it smells good(:</li>
            <li> When my hair touched my face I started to break out.</li>
            <li> This really helps keep my hair form getting frizzy.  It makes the curls soft and helps them stay in ringlets.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this leave-in product for reducing frizz after I&#x27;ve washed and dried my hair. It&#x27;s quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried their other products, for example the orange cap with keratin in the product, that one has&lt;br /&gt;way too much perfume for me to wear. I have asthma &amp; allergies and though this product has fragrance,&lt;br /&gt;it does not trigger my allergies or asthma which is very important.</li>
            <li> I love it so far. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and love how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and do not plan on trying anything new anytime soon.  I have tried other detanglers before (much more expensive ones like the Moroccan oil products) and nothing compares to the scent of It&#x27;s a 10 or the solution which seems to turn my dry hair into silk.  I strongly recommend this to any person who blow dries a lot, shampoos a lot and or just wants tangle free hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product - it seems to make my hair a little more manageable and soft.  I had really high expectations, though, so I don&#x27;t think this is quite the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; I was expecting, but I can&#x27;t really complain.  If I were to air dry my hair with no product, it would be very frizzy and out of control with random waviness here and there.  My hair is not really wavy and curly, but it&#x27;s also not straight, if that makes any sense.  When I blow dry my hair with no product, I can get it straight pretty easily, but sometimes I still have to use a flat iron to help make it a little smoother and shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this product and air dry my hair, I still get some frizziness and waviness, but not *quite* as much as air drying with no product.  I was really hoping it would be a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; and make my hair smooth and straight with no other work needed.  However, when I blow dry my hair with this product in it, it does come out much more smooth and shiny.  I don&#x27;t need to flat iron my hair when I use this, which is great!  I love the way it smells, and it does a good job of detangling.  I&#x27;ve started using it on my daughters&#x27; hair, too!  The bottle seems to last quite awhile, too.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks, and I think it&#x27;s about 1/4 gone.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product - makes my hair look &amp; feel silky, shiny &amp; smooth!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! I use it on my curly hair and wow the curls! I also love it to straighten!</li>
            <li> OMG!!! It is amazing...No words needed. You have to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is a miracle!!</li>
            <li> Great leave-in conditioner! A little goes a long way in my hair. Smells so nice and leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> Since I use this product my hair is thicker, more manageable and more importantly repaired the dry ends.</li>
            <li> Sprayer works on this one this time. Thank you!</li>
            <li> After being introduced to me at a salon, I have been a faithful user of this product.  I have fine, limp hair. I am very tender headed and this product makes my hair, smooth, sleek, and easy to comb through. I&#x27;ve also used it on my daughter who also has fine hair and she loves it as well. It does not feel heavy on my hair at all. I spray at least 10 times before brushing. Once dry, it feels silky smooth. No tangles at all.  Great product for children and adults! Be sure and get the largest size as you will want more once you buy.  You get a better deal with the 10 oz size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it with you where ever you go. I once went to Florida for vacation and left it at home. The sun and chlorine killed my hair, and was painful to brush. Needless to say, I learned my lesson and next vacation I took with me. It&#x27;s amazing how even with all the elements (sun, chlorine, and salt water), my hair felt smooth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair product!  I tend to color my hair a lot and this keeps my hair looking silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I like it. I don&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;Wished it were the miracle everyone thinks it is. My hair is a little less frizzy than before. But for the price, I was expecting a little more bounce and a little less frizz. I still use it (hence the 4 stars), but I can certainly live without it.</li>
            <li> loved, and continue buying chefgou in record time.</li>
            <li> I am not going to buy this product again because it contains Parabens (chemicals) which have shown to contribute to the prevalence of cancer and disturb your hormones.  This product is not worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair becomes soft and shine, great product and smells nice too.</li>
            <li> First just let me start off by saying, I have never reviewed a product before. I was given a 2oz sample bottle at ulta when I bought my flat iron. I didn&#x27;t think anything of it, got out of the shower one day and decided to use it. Sprayed on towel dried hair. I have really thick hair but I still only used about 4 or 5 sprays and Instantly it smelled wonderful. It immediately made my hair feel like silk and detangled it. I blow dried my hair and flat ironed it like I always do. I am simply amazed by what this product does. It is a miracle in a bottle. My hair has never been softer, smoother, straighter. I know it is kind of pricey, but a 4oz bottle will last you months, if not the whole year! It only takes a few sprays. I don&#x27;t care if it was $50 a bottle, I would still buy it! I told my coworker how amazing it was and she was skeptical so I brought her in a tiny bit in a spray bottle for her to try and she is hooked! I will never be without this product again, I just wish I would have known sooner! P.s. I live in south fla in a very hot, humid climate. Usually my hair just poofs and frizzes as soon as I walk out the door. With this product in my hair, I literally never get the frizz and moisture absorption in my hair anymore from the humidity. It&#x27;s like I have a protective bubble around my head! Do yourself a favor and buy it!</li>
            <li> This little gem is AMAZING! It makes for super soft hair, the ability it has to detangled even the knottiest hair is incredible! It&#x27;s perfect for after your shower as directed but I found that it also works on dry hair! I had my hair a ratty mess after a long day. I needed a new due before hitting the town that night but had no time to shower. My hair was held together with Bed Heads Maxxed out hairspray which provides some serious hold... In desperation I just grabbed my it&#x27;s a 10 bottle and applied to my dry hair... Within minutes it was running my fingers through my hair. How is that even possible?! Yes, this product is pricey but my only regret is not buying a larger bottle. Beauty comes at a cost but it&#x27;s so worth it, just like this product!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, it must be good. She says it&#x27;s a 10</li>
            <li> this is a little thick feeling so I only use a small amount but I like the smell and it makes my hair feel a bit smoother.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair detangled instantly, smells great, leaves hair soft and smooth.  Cons: too expensive but can be purchased through Amazon.com for a discoutnt.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and tangles very easily.  I hate to wash it because it is such a chore to comb through it.  This helps a great deal and would not be caught without it.  The price is very good, too.</li>
            <li> Would absolutely purchase again! Highly recommended. We are very happy with our purchase. The product is high quality and the customer service was as well. AAA+++ Thank you... We will be back for more!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of all the great reviews it all ready had on here and it did not disappoint.  It works wonders on my hair and is by far the best after shower product I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s worth the extra money and you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot, so it does last a while.</li>
            <li> This product is used in my salon and very popular..It was fortunate to find this larger size and at a fair price.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser put me onto this product. Not knowing where to purchase it, I went to my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; Amazon and ordered it. It makes my hair managable without any harsh alchol to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I heard people raving about. I use it daily and it has made my hair so soft, smooth, and manageable. You won&#x27;t find a better price anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I read a comment below that says this leave in product &amp;#34;smells horrible.&amp;#34; That individual clearly needs a new nose. I actually bought this product because of how good it smells. My hair stylist used this product on my hair and I absolutely loved the smell, so I ended up buying a bottle.</li>
            <li> I have collarbone length hair that is relaxed, highlighted and permanently dyed.  It is fine, but I have a lot of it, and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for ways to combat dryness and breakage.  I am a product JUNKIE and always have been.  I have forever been in search of the next best \\&quot;hair thing\\&quot;.  I have NEVER abandoned everything in favor of one product until this leave in.  From the moment it touches my hair, it feels like a different head of hair.  It detangles, softens, and makes my hair easy to comb.  Even after a home blow dry (which is usually the worst option in terms of how my hair feels when it&#x27;s done) my hair is soft, shiny, and full of body.  I have been using it on and off (mostly on) for about 6 months now, and I notice a drastic difference from wash to wash when I use these products as opposed to when I use other brands - even for brands that one might consider higher end.  My hair is just worlds softer, more manageable, shinier and breakage is almost non-existent.  Best method of use is to spray into the hand, rub between the hands to coat, and *then* apply to the hair as opposed to direct application to the hair, as it is thick and does not spread easily or spray as a fine mist.  The price does not faze me.  It is absolutely worth it.  Because cosmetics companies are ridiculous and seem to wait until a product has a HUGE cult following to change the formula or discontinue it, I am on a personal crusade to collect and stash as many 10 ounce bottles of this as my wallet will allow. I buy one once a month, even though I could never make it through a bottle in less than a year (and I&#x27;m talking the 4 ouncer - not the 10 ouncer.) THAT&#x27;s how insistent I am on NEVER being without it.  I am giving up ALL of my other leave ins in favor of this one.  The same is true of the deep treatment which is also phenomenal.  Best product I&#x27;ve used in many many years.....</li>
            <li> Love this product. Pricey, but works well. Leaves my hair shiny and soft. I color and flat-iron my hair and it has helped keep it from damaging. My daughter also uses it on her permed hair and it is the only product that she has tried that leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My cousin Tiff&#x27;s stylist recommended this product for me since I have dry/damaged hair. I&#x27;m the type of girl that doesn&#x27;t like to put products in my hair because sometimes it feels heavy/oily. Anyways, I checked it online and found that it was expensive for someone who doesn&#x27;t like to wear stuff in her hair. One fine day, my husband and I went grocery shopping at Costco and there it was! It was meant to be, so we bought. I got it under thirty dollars from there. The ten ounce bottle lasted me 10 months, that&#x27;s close to a year. I have long hair and it only takes 4 - 5 sprays on each side of my head (from ears to ends), total 8 to 10 sprays after every showers. OMG! Again OMG! It works! My hair feels soft, silky, and so alive (of course you know, hair shaft is the dead part, live part is the root). But you know what I meant, when I said it feels alive! Whenever I straighten my hair with a flat iron, it protects and keeps my hair smooth. It changed my perspective on wearing products on your hair. It&#x27;s very light as long you don&#x27;t overdo it. For long hair it takes a few sprays; for short to median lengths a couple sprays. I am running low of it and college is about to start soon. So I am here to buy a new bottle as a replacement. I truly recommended this. It does what it says, which are the ten things listed on the back of the bottle, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called the ten miracle. The money is worth it. I am interested on testing out more products from this maker. Such as, shampoo, conditioner, and hair mask. I found a YouTube user who said that the hair mask works great. Again it is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> If you have colored hair that is coarse and tangles easily, this is the product for you!  My 3 girls and I use it every day, and 1 bottle lasts 3 months for all of us!  Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thick hair. My hair has been bleached and dyed many times. It&#x27;s even endured a perm once. Because my hair is fine, it gets oily easily which drives me insane, so I have to avoid most conditioners. This product sprays on lightly and evenly. It has a nice smell that reminds me of a hair salon. My damp hair brushes out smoothly and is silky and healthy-looking after being blow dried. It doesn&#x27;t get oily or heavy, and doesn&#x27;t look like it has any product in it. If you need a leave-in conditioner, this is the one. Look no further than It&#x27;s a 10.</li>
            <li> I refuse to do my hair without this product. It makes it so much easier to brush through &amp; MUCH less frizzy. It smells good plus it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down too much. Love it!</li>
            <li> Well this product is good, it&#x27;s not a miracle but it works in combination with others and taking care of your hair of course. I do recomend it.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this to me while I was at her salon.  I fell in love with the product.  I decided to go on Amazon and see if I can purchase it for a cheaper amount.  I bought this bigger bottle, but it seems different.  My hair isn&#x27;t silky smooth like the first bottle I purchased.  My hair feels dirty and gets easily tangled after a few hours.  I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels at the end of the day when I use this product.  I always have to take a shower before bed because I feel yucky and I don&#x27;t want my dirty hair on my clean pillow.  I don&#x27;t know if this one was expired or not.  Maybe it&#x27;s a fluke, but I rather not take the chance of purchasing another bottle.  It has been sitting underneath my sink for the past few months.  I guess I will just  give it away or throw it away.</li>
            <li> This is the best, it definitely has the right name - it is a 10!  My daughters and I love this as a leave-in treatment to protect our hair, eliminate frizz, as we go about our heat damaging routines.</li>
            <li> It actually works and the wonderful smell stays all day in your hair. I love this product because it repairs your hair.</li>
            <li> This is really good at protecting and fortifying your hair.  Especially if you have baby fine hair.  Mine is also on the thin side, and I get regular keratin treatments to protect all the curling and spraying I do to my locks.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it a GREAT rating is the price.  I think the company has a good product, but it is a little on the proud side.</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve used, it coats hair evenly without leaving it feeling stiff or oily. Hair stays straighter longer after straightening</li>
            <li> Nice product but this product with keratin is much better on taming frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;The keratin really makes the difference.</li>
            <li> Great product . Thanks</li>
            <li> my wife say&#x27;s that she loves this brand and that she will continue to use it. this is not my thing so I cant be of much help. I&#x27;m a dude so I get shampoo and condition in one. call me lazy but the guy how thought of that should have got a pay increase.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didnt know how to use it, but this stuff leaves flaky residue on the hair, can anybody tell me what to do to prevent the flakes. i use little amount but the flakes build up at the edges.</li>
            <li> and have been using it for about 2 years now (since I found it.)  I have curly hair and it works great to tame the frizzies and just enhance the curls without being heavy or crunchy.  Love it.  Bought from a variety of suppliers and have had good luck with all of them.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on a recommendation from a health &amp; beauty blog that I read suggesting that it was a more cost-effective alternative to hair serums.  After years of spending about $50 every few months for Moroccan Oil I was thrilled that Amazon offered this product for about $20...and for such a huge bottle too!  My experience with It&#x27;s a 10 really proved to me that you get what you pay for.  According to the bottle, this product claims to do just about everything from providing heat protection to giving you shiny silky hair...don&#x27;t be fooled, this only gives you the heat protection.  I sprayed this stuff into damp hair and combed through like the directions advised but the result was just downright disappointing.  Instead of glossy, shiny, and soft hair, I got slightly brittle, rough, flat, and matte-looking hair.  This stuff provides no shine at all and in fact makes my hair look LESS SHINY.  I naturally have very shiny hair and after using this for about a week my mother asked me if I was doing something different with my hair because my natural color looked muted and dull.  Additionally, when you blowdry with this stuff in, your hair doesn&#x27;t hold the body and volume that you spend so much time building with your round brush.  I stopped using this product and as of today I have an entire bottle sitting in my vanity.  When I tried to give it away to my friends they all laughed at me and just said \\&quot;you fell for that too, huh?\\&quot;  Ladies, if you want glossy, soft, Kate Middleton-esque hair, splurge and pick up a bottle of Moroccan Oil or Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s  Invisible Oil. Stay far away from this stuff!!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and flat, oily on the top, dry on the bottom, has split ends and is over-processed because of coloring. I&#x27;ve used this only three times and it&#x27;s amazing. Other products - especially leave-ins - made my hair flat and greasy. This fixed the frizz, added body, made my hair shine, and I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair. Seriously, amazing. I bought the shampoo and conditioner and the leave-in with keratin to try, but not sure it can get much better than this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Leaves your hair silky soft and tangle free. It&#x27;s the only leave-in product I&#x27;ll use, so far nothing else comes close....not even the fancy salon products</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years.  Great product to due frizz and due tangle.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I color my hair, so worry about it drying out.  My hair is wavy, but with this product I can comb it straight or leave it curly without any drying or excessive heat.  I don&#x27;t put it in dry hair, but it is the best thing ever for wet hair!</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair that takes a lot of maintenance. This spray cuts my hair care time in half. Absolutely wonderful. Will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so soft and manageable. Great product and wil continue to use but hope the price goes down.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and works great to prevent frizzy hair!  I use it when I straighten my hair or when I leave it curly!</li>
            <li> Excellent leave in conditioner.  Leaves my hair with more body and shine.  Will continue to order and use this product as long as it is available.  Easy to use and helps comb out after washing hair.  Acts a lot like a detangler.</li>
            <li> This product has been touted as a &amp;#34;wonder spray&amp;#34;. It works wonderfully as a tangle-remover, but when your hair dries WATCH OUT; It will be brittle, break off, dry out. My hair has NEVER had these problems. I tried this on 3 separate occasions, hoping to get different results. 3 times I had to get 1 inch trim to remove the split ends (withing a 1 month time period). Not sure why people love this so much. Really hurt to throw this EXPENSIVE product out. Is does not act as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is the best stuff ever for your hair.  Usually it&#x27;s a bit pricey for me this seller has it at I price I can afford.</li>
            <li> Miracle cream for my curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It really is a 10 for hair!  No  more tangles when I comb out my long hair after washing.  My hair feels soft after using It&#x27;s a 10.  I bought it after my hair dresser was using it in her salon.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 3 years. I switched from infusium 23. There is no more need for daily conditioner, I just use the 10.</li>
            <li> Essential for my hair</li>
            <li> After I had kids my hair went from perfectly smooth and straight where I could wash and go to wavy/frizzy where I have to blow it out with a round brush every time I wash it. Apparently pregnancy hormones can change the consistency of your hair. Who knew?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was recommended to me at a beauty supply store when I was asking about Brazilian Blowouts. This stuff works!!! My hair is smooth now and I can blow dry it very quickly. I only need a little bit of round brush work to get it perfectly smooth. I use it on my daughter&#x27;s fine little girl hair and it gets the tangles out so easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give it 10 stars I would!</li>
            <li> I received the shipment well-packaged and quickly.  The amount of product for the price is a HUGE value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product in my hair everyday right when I get out of the shower.  It&#x27;s great for controlling frizz and protecting my hair from my straightener.</li>
            <li> it says what it does i havent cut my hair and my hair looks amazing because of this product... i dont have any spilt ends. it helps my hair look healthy and shiny. it smells okay (i smelt better)but wow i love this product. it may not make your hair frizzy free but it helped a bit with my frizzy hair.. the last time i cut my hair was probably 1/2 a year ago maybe a full year i switch leave in products but this one is my FAVORITE :) 5 stars i dont see split ends in my hair</li>
            <li> I gave this product a try because I was using another product which made my hair look weird after couple of months on using it and made my face oily. But this A 10 has no problem. I use this when I am really lazy to straight my hair but this product makes my hair look better than my straight hair. I like how I can put my fingers through my hair without having it stuck or an oily face. This product is small and expensive. Wish the price can go down so I can buy more than one. Giving this product a try will not hurt :-)</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d get rid of the frizz or fly-aways unless I had my hair done professionally. My stylist turned me on to this product. I thought it was too expensive at first so I didn&#x27;t buy it. But then used it again at a friend&#x27;s house and WOW!! This stuff actually does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do!!! I have so many partially used products lingering in my bathroom closet, but now, I can get rid of ALL of them to fight the frizz and smooth my hair once and for all. Buy this!!</li>
            <li> This product is really the only product i have ever truly loved! it works amazing on my hair. I have very thick hair, and sometimes it can be hard to manage. I found that It&#x27;s A 10 really does keep my hair healthy and well maintained! I use it as soon as I get out of the shower and I am able to quickly transform my hair to do whatever I please. This price you pay for this stuff is really worth it. And of course Amazon has it for a great price. The first time I purchased this product was in a salon for about $15 for the 4 oz bottle! It took me almost a year to completely run out of it. I am extremely happy that I was able to get it on Amazon for a little over $21. This stuff truly is a miracle!</li>
            <li> I still have not found a product that works as good as this does.  Every product they make is just remarkable. I have very long, fine hair and this product does the job without weighing it down. I love the smell, too.  I hate paying so much at the hair salon, so buying it here really helps with the pricing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best. Keeps my hair healthy and strong</li>
            <li> Its a 10 Miracle Leave-In Product is one of those items that the gods accidentally leaked it to the earth by mistake. Once you tried this product, there is no going back to the other products that don&#x27;t really work. I tried thousands of dollars worth of leave-ins and conditioners. None come close to Its a 10 Miracle Leave-In. I also use the mask, the shampoo with KERATIN, and the Its a 10 deep conditioner with Keratin. Everyone who I know try it, loved it and can&#x27;t get enough of it. Its pricey, but its worth every penny. I first saw it at my salon 3-years ago.  I bought it at the salon for almost double the price. Thank god for amazon. I get it for half the price almost with no shipping charges on most its a 10 products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a 10 leaves my damaged breaking crunchy, dry, over-bleached hair into silky, soft, strong beautiful hair after the first use. it helps to use the entire line. The shampoo is sulphate free!!!! It works like a deep conditioner on your hair and thats just the shampoo. The deep conditioner with Keratin works miracles on dry, damaged hair. turns it into silk. I then use the Its a 10 leave-in spray. and then I use the Its a 10 Miracle oil. No matter what condition your hair is in , no matter how beyond repair it seems, this product will work for your hair. Its a 10 is a Miracle. If you want a hair transformation, this is the hair product you been waiting for. I stocked up on all its a 10 products so I will never run out.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference at all after using this. I have used literally dozen of products to help me control the frizz in my hair, and while some work more than others, this one didn&#x27;t seem to work at all. I tried it twice with barely noticeable results and so it went in the trash.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what all the fuzz is about. This product did absolutely nothing to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000TKH6G2 It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Leave In Product, 4-Ounces]]</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product.  I rarely use it.</li>
            <li> I gave it&#x27;s a 10, 5 stars, I will order again, price is great on the 10-ounce.  I was introduced to this product by my hair dresser.  This item truely works, no tangles, leave hair with a great shine and I have received many comments concerning how nice my hair smells and looks.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF ESPECIALLY FOR MY 7 YRS OLD. IT DETANGLES HER HAIR INSTANTLY AND LIKE MAGIC. IT CREATES SILKINESS AND ITS HEAT PROTECTANT WHICH I ALSO LOVE AND ITS CONTROLS FLYAWAYS. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. I WILL BUY THE BIGGER BOTTLE WHEN I CAN BUT RIGHT NOW IVE GOT THE MIDDLE SIZE TO TRY. I JUST LOVE THE SILKINESS, DETANGLING, SOFTNESS, AND FLYAWAY EFFECT THAT IT DOES. WILL BUY AGAIN AND RECOMMEND TO OTHERS. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Essential for great hair, especially for daily heat styling or blow drying.  My stylist introduced it to me years ago, and I have used it ever since. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great for detangling and leaves hair super manageable and soft. This is a product I&#x27;ll make sure I always have at home.</li>
            <li> I was horrified to find parabens in the ingredients. I used this for the last 2-3 years. It works well but I won&#x27;t buy a product with parabens. Shame on the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This is THE product I always have to have for my medium-thick wavy hair. A few spritz and my hair is detangled and soft. You can also spritz to smooth out dry/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Best leave in product I have used. This is my favorite product to use.</li>
            <li> very good product; much more expensive in the hair salon; good buy; would buy it again</li>
            <li> Love how soft my ahir feels after using it, and smells wonderful too!</li>
            <li> wife loves this stuff and it&#x27;s a lot better deal than in the stores</li>
            <li> THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED</li>
            <li> The best leave-in treatment I have ever found! My hair is very thick, course and frizzy. This product makes my hair feeling soft and frizz-free. It does not weigh my hair down. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Given the price I was hesitant to order but went out on a limb with this after reading the other reviews. I was really happy that I did because this works wonderfully. It was more expensive than I would have liked but after using it, I would definitely order it again. My sister-in-law will be getting a bottle for her birthday as part of her present for sure this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long wavy/curly hair that likes to tangle or become frizzy at a moment&#x27;s notice, so I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different products over the years but this really helps tame it down and make my hair soft and MUCH more manageable, plus it smells great. It&#x27;s definitely earned it&#x27;s name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a really big fan of this product, and would recommend giving it a shot to other buyers.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! my hair has gone from thin dry and stringy to thick full and healthy! This is a miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> If I could rate this product as a 10 star I would! Let me start by saying I have platinum colored hair an use a flat iron. Two no-no&#x27;s! Like a double whammy!. It was suggested to me to get this leave in conditioner after trying several. To be honest I was hesitant due to the cost, but then I thought the breakage on the ends of my hair was so bad it was worth at least 1 bottle of trying. I wash my hair &amp; I spray this in all over, especially on the ends, I then let it soak in for about 15 minutes after coming it threw. I do use a hairdryer so I put it on a low heat setting to dry and to be honest this stuff is amazing! I love it and it is always a part of my hair washing day staples. I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often, my hair is improved so much in breakage its unbelievable. I have used all kinds of different ones &amp; for colored hair this is by far the best. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel weighted down or heavy either. I hope this is one product they never stop making!!!!! Love It!</li>
            <li> Great product that leaves your hair feeling silky smooth and healthy. It also smells nice and is a great detangler!</li>
            <li> I have thick, color-treated, Asian hair. When finances are good, I visit my hairstylist-friend every 4-6 weeks. When I&#x27;m on a tighter budget, I don&#x27;t see her for about 2 months or so. I&#x27;m a wash-and-go girl and only use heat on my hair when I&#x27;m in a hurry (hair dryer) or when I go out (curling iron). Before using this product, I would start getting split-ends about 3-4 weeks after my last salon visit. But after using this product, even my hairstylist-friend commented on how soft my hair still was and how good of a shape it was in (read: no split ends).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product definitely works with taming frizz. When I don&#x27;t use this product, it&#x27;s very noticeable when my hair dries. With the product on, my hair is sleek, straight and shiny. Sometime it looks like I blew out my hair when I didn&#x27;t, so that&#x27;s a good thing, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend this product to everyone. In fact, I bought my sister and mom a bottle each and just bought a 2nd bottle for myself after making the initial purchase about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: instead of spraying the product directly into your hair, spray it into your hands and then just work it through your hair. That way you don&#x27;t have the product flying around in the air and all of it ends up in your hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this leave-in conditioner. She has very fine blond hair and other conditioners were just not detangling her hair so she was ripping it to shreds trying to comb it while wet. The &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; product has permanently solved that problem for her, thank goodness.</li>
            <li> Love it . Makes my hair soft and smell good</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my 6 year old daughter who despises the hair washing process, so I figured I could cut it in half by getting a leave in conditioner. Well, we&#x27;re now both avid users. My hair feels amazing, and my daughter loves how easily I can brush her hair out of the bath now. She has super long hair, so this is a godsend! Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a awesome product</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the first time last year and I will never switch back to anything else! It&#x27;s a little pricier than anything I would normally have used, but it&#x27;s so worth it! I have long, fine hair and this product reduced static in the winter and frizz in the summer. Always softens but never makes it greasy unless I use way too much. And it smells great too!</li>
            <li> Not only do O love this product, but my husband loves it too! Who knew that we would fight-over a hair product!! LOL!</li>
            <li> This product helped my hair feel softer, healthier and much more. I truly recommend this product for anyone who styles their hair on a daily basis. I have been even using it on my 10 year old daughters hair. She has super long hair with super curly hair. It makes it very easy to brush it.</li>
            <li> My hair are so fragile and fine. I tried to grow it for years and my back would grow long and hair in my front couldnt pass the shoulder length. I tried Miracle leave in product. Hers my opinion.Helps to amazingly easy to brush tangled up hair, leaves them silky. it really prevents them form breakage! i used it for the last year or so. 10 oz bottle last for a very long time.! at least 6 month. depending on your hair length. Anyway. hair that couldn&#x27;t grow are now growing past my shoulders! It also seem stronger and thicker. I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product every day for the last two years. I have baby fine hair that breaks off and I was getting scolded by my stylist every visit because the damage heat styling was doing to my hair.  Other heat styling protector products weighed down my fine hair, and after trying a ton of other products I luckily stumbled across It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In and it has been love ever since.  I put it when my hair is still wet, let it sit for 5 minutes, and then blow dry.  I knew that it made my hair feel fantastic, but when my stylist gave me praise for blow-drying my hair less, I had to smile and tell her that I hadn&#x27;t cut back, I just finally found my product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricey, but you are paying for what you get.  My hair is currently as long and healthy as it has ever been, and that is worth the price to me.  Also, a bottle lasts at least six months for me because I only use three to four pumps a day.</li>
            <li> Product is fine, but nothing special. There was nothing about it that made it any better than every other product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.It really makes my hair feel soft and very manageable.Will definitely order more when this runs out.Awesome price as well considering what a bottle half the size of this one cost in my hometown.</li>
            <li> After reading all these great reviews, I decided to get it, bad mistake! First it smells horrible , and 2nd it made my hair feel &amp; look so dry ,I hate it and won&#x27;t use it again!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Great price as well, much cheaper then in any store I have seen! I would recomend this to anyone</li>
            <li> My hair is in recovery mode because last time I got highlights the lady fried my hair. :(  After going through product after product I tried this and I wont live without it now!</li>
            <li> Pump its contents with about eight dabs onto your head of hair after a shower, and then comb it in so it spreads.  As it drys to holds your hair in place naturally, with no notice anything was ever added like one finds with hair sprays.  If your hair gets messed up, just run a dampened comb through it.  It&#x27;s not a product that holds your hair in place as your drive around in your car with the windows open.  But when you get to where you&#x27;re going, just run a damp comb through your hair to return to a natural look.  And if you leave it in, you&#x27;ll notice your pillow doesn&#x27;t show any stains.</li>
            <li> Not the real thing!!! Made my hair feel like plastic. Not the same consistency as the real thing. you can tell the minute you spray it...its thinner.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it in my book!! Great hair product and does last a long time with just a little use needed after a shower. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and will continue as I haven&#x27;t found anything close to the softness that this product leaves in my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells like fabric softener.  Conditions my hair without it feeling greasy or heavy.  I am hooked on this product!  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles preventing our girls from crying when we brush their hair after washing it.  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for tangles. Leaves hair silky and static free. It works wonder for long hair.  Would highly recommend this new product.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this on me and I really liked it.  I found it on Amazon for cheaper and purchased it.  It is the same thing as what my hairdresser uses.  I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product, would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I m absolutely disappointed in this product. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> Best detangler and heat protecter</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair so soft and healthy!  Has helped with increasing growth too!</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing it on &amp;#34;The View&amp;#34; (tv talk show). It truly is the best leave in product ever!</li>
            <li> Short Review- You need this in your life. Yes I already bought it again, and you prob will too.  I heard of this product before and when I would be in the store and see it I would be like &amp;#34;look at that old el cheapo looking bottle..it looks like drug store, or grocery store hair products-yuck&amp;#34;...Well Ive never been so wrong in my life. This stuff is amazing!!!! Im glad I decided to jump out there and try it even after having a certain amount of skepticism after reading the reviews. After asking a beautician about it, I said I would give it a try and bought the smallest bottle.....Now after having tried at this point I agree with the nearly other 1,000 customers that this stuff gets 5 stars. Im very OCD about my hair...And this stuff is amazing!!!!!Idk where to begin... First off I have used Biolage&#x27;s hair milk leave in for 8 years..its a good product hair was soft.. smelled good....set my hair...but my hair would still get frizzy. It wouldn&#x27;t always tame the frizzies but I would be like &amp;#34;hey what am i gonna do I sat under the dryer for 2 hours and my hair still does this, its just my hair, its what it does-whatever&amp;#34; However, with Its a 10, frizzies are a distant memory for me, okay not literally- pretty close though, and as much as they possibly could be. No other product has left my hair SO SHINEY and soft with such frizz control. After a few days(about 3 days or so) the frizzies can come back if you live in a  humid area like i do. But this stuff is as good as it gets! Only thing I would caution someone about is the amount factor... The beautician said less is more with this product, and I certainly didn&#x27;t want anything that would weigh my  hair down and make it look greasy, but I had no problem with this stuff doing that. Im mixed and have wavy hair  and use a very mild relaxer on it every 5-6 months or so just to try to control my frizzes. I have a very oily scalp, but cant wash my hair but every 4 days or it will dry it out on the ends. My hairfalls about 4-5 inches below the base of my neck and I apply 4 pumps as I comb it out after conditioning, and maybe a little more if necessary as i go to roll the other sections of my hair if I see it beginning to dry curly a bit, before I have rolled it and got under the dryer. So I would say this stuff is safe as far as not weighing it down...just don&#x27;t be ridiculous.  IT REALLY IS A 10...idk anything about the ingredients-doesnt matter this stuff does the job, and really is a 10!!  *****I also wanted to add that a lot of ladies have posted that this has &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; and that they are apprehensive about it, and write it off becuase of it. If you do your resesarch you will find that cetearyl alcohol is one of the good alcohols for your hair******</li>
            <li> Best recommendation in hair care products ever! It makes my hair silky soft and keeps it healthier looking between visits to my hairdresser.  I highly recommend - a 10 oz bottle usually lasts me about 3-months and I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this from my hair dresser and paid like $25 for the 4oz bottle.  When I ordered this from amazon I assumed it was going to be the same size but was pleasantly surprised to see how much bigger the 10oz bottle is.  This is a great product, I have a thick hair that&#x27;s fine in texture so it&#x27;s really hard to brush through no matter how much conditioner I use, I coat my hair with this after a shower and it never feels oily or weighed down.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> This product is great for my curly hair. It makes it very easy to come out my hair. Not only does it help detangle hair but it also makes it a little more shinier.</li>
            <li> For years I had used a salon product to enhance my natural curls and tame the frizzies. It worked, but this stuff is better! After applying and scrunching my curls, I would let my hair dry, then fluff with my fingers. The salon product left my curls &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;. Required a lot of fluffing! It&#x27;s a 10 leaves my hair very soft and manageable. It also adds shine, so I don&#x27;t have to apply another salon product for that. Note: I squirt the product directly into my hands to apply it evenly. Spraying onto your hair is spotty, and uses way too much stuff. The 10 oz bottle (used daily) lasts for about 4 months! Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, shoulder length hair.  This product immediately smooths and sets my hair for a great finish.  Keeps flyaways down.  Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner!!! My hair has been fried since I dyed my hair for a friends wedding 6 months ago, just a little of this leave in goes a long way to repair my hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best product for tangles.  Just a little&lt;br /&gt;and the knots come right out, no more pulling&lt;br /&gt;on your hair.  Great for kids that try and brush&lt;br /&gt;the knots out themselves. It will keep them from&lt;br /&gt;damaging their hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I have super curly hair and my hair rats easily. This stuff allows me to brush my hair out so easily. Also doesn&#x27;t take much to use so it lasts a long time! I will buy again. I&#x27;ve been using it now for 3 months and still love it!</li>
            <li> Works well. Protects hair.</li>
            <li> Product was a little thick.&lt;br /&gt;If you didn&#x27;t use it on wet hair it clumps.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any difference on how it helped with styling.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing, I have super thin hair and it tangles easy, but not anymore!!! ITS A MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> After only a few uses, the product no longer sprays but rather comes out in creamy lumps. I tried cleaning the nozzle of the pump to no avail. Also the scent is not unpleasant but too strong for my liking--once the product is on my hair that&#x27;s all I can smell for hours. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair when I use this.</li>
            <li> Nothing to complain. Smooth my hair instantly. I can forget to put conditioner, but I can&#x27;t afford to miss this spray. The big bottle can be used for more than a year. My long hair only needs 4-5 sprays after each wash.</li>
            <li> I bought this leave in treatment recently to make my hair more managable during the winter. It makes my hair look healthier and shinier and also helps with static. It really helps my hair look smoother after I blow dry it. I absolutely love it and recommend it to all my friends!</li>
            <li> This is a great product line. Leaves your hair silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is - that it took over 1 month to get my product. I ran out and had to purchase a small bottle (of course at more $$). I would never buy from this distributor again.</li>
            <li> This product is every mother&#x27;s dream!  Turns morning brushing sessions that used to end in tears into easy, fun, mother-daughter time.  Start with less and work the product through the hair.  Over - spraying will build up if you don&#x27;t wash your daughter&#x27;s hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Its a 10 Products!!!!  I perm my hair and because of that I am prone to split ends, but since Ive been using Its a 10 Leave in conditioner, I almost have no worries about that. My stylist always tells me my hair is so healthy looks great and I always tell her &amp;#34;Im still using Its a 10 leave in conditioner!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> As a hairstylist this is a must have!! My number one product that I recommend to clients!! I have bleached hair and it looks so silky smooth thanks to this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Makes my hair feel wonderful. Excellent price too - I have spent double at Target for the same thing!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, been using it for years and keeps my hair in great condition after flat ironing and blow drying!</li>
            <li> Have always loved \\&quot;it&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; and while it&#x27;s not the cheapest it is definitely worth the price for how much you get and what the product does. The shipping took a it longer than expected but only by a few days, very worth it would recommend any day!</li>
            <li> Love it and it works great..</li>
            <li> The product works well but is expensive</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it gets frizzy and dry. I was hoping this would help but I didn&#x27;t see a difference. This product has a weird smell and contains parabens too. For the steep price I thought it would do something but didn&#x27;t. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Like it-good product.</li>
            <li> I had originally bought this stuff from Bloom.com, but they stopped carrying it for some reason. I have very long hair and this stuff helps with frizz at the ends, and makes my hair smell nice and super shiny! Try even a small bottle of this and you will be hooked on how awesome your hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW the 10 ounce bottle is worth the extra cash if you can afford it. This bottle should last me about 6 months and it&#x27;s cheaper to buy here than in the mall or elsewhere. :)</li>
            <li> My daughter and wife use the product daily as a detangler and conditioner. They have tried similar products, but prefer this one. I do believe that it is slightly overpriced.</li>
            <li> This product was suggested by my hair dresser.  I love it.  I have naturally curlly hair and i spray it in before combing and it helps.</li>
            <li> This product helps me maintain healthy, shiny hair. I use quality, salon shampoo/conditioner but I can&#x27;t imagine shampooing and not using this product afterwards, even with conditioning. It prevents frizzies and split ends &amp; seems rather nourishing, without weighing my hair down or making it oily. My new hairdresser commented on how healthy my hair is, despite applying color every 6-8 weeks!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Best leave-in- conditioner I have used to date!</li>
            <li> I was without this product for a month due to a seller on Amazon messing up my order. I could certainly see a difference in my hair when I wasn&#x27;t able to use this product for that time. It does a great job detangling, makes my hair smooth and soft, and has a great smell. I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> This made my hair feel horrible.  I ended up giving the product to the friend that suggested this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!</li>
            <li> It is a miracle.  It turns my damaged hair into shinny silky hair.  It does not take much either.  Lasts a long time.  And smells nice.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It really does do 10 things!  I find it helps keep curl in my hair, which is fine textured.  My hairdresser recommended this, and I&#x27;ve now used it for 4 years.  BTW, this was recommended on The View by Barbara Walters&#x27; hairdresser:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;iaYbPl_QwUA</li>
            <li> Saved my hair! Great for extra conditioning without weighing done. Great smell too!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It makes my hair so soft and shiny. And it get the tangles out of my girls&#x27; hair too.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Always Makes my hair more manageable and soft!</li>
            <li> great value for the size!</li>
            <li> I love to use this product on wet hair as a detangler before brushing. It makes my hair feel very soft and nourished!</li>
            <li> awesome stuff, especially if you have any natural curl.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have wild freezy hair and this product helps tame it down. It also works as a detangler. When I blowdry it leaves my hair soft and freeze free.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works so well to detangle my fine hair and helps keep it smooth and shiny. Shipped fast! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> its wonderful and so easy</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> USE IT EVERYDAY, WEIGHTLESS AND IMPROVES DAMAGED HAIR</li>
            <li> My long hair is never tangled again!! Great product!</li>
            <li> Honestly heard amazing things about this product but it is doing nothing to my hair! Not making it silky or smoother or any of the things it should be doing :(</li>
            <li> Really amazing product.  It makes my hair supee soft and protects it. I love how it also keeps frizz away. I just wish it was a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> love the product just way too expensive!</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I adore this product (usually) but the one I received had the plastic bottle scratched up. Also, this leave in product has a very fragrant scent which this one seems to be lacking. It might be that this product is not nearly as new as I would have thought. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing the trick that several of the other purchased Its a 10 products of the very same variety have done. I wont be returning it as I feel like I am just settling with it. This is not to discourage you from buying the product altogether but maybe just make sure its not used or has been sitting on a shelf for some time.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.. my duaghters hair is very thin and knots. This works great.</li>
            <li> The best!! not too heavy, not too watery. this is perfect for my fine hair. I will repurchase this forever (or until they change the formula lol)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Product is truely a fantastic product. I use it almost everyday, it makes my thick curly hair so much smoother and detangles my hair with only a few sprays. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but i have had this for almost a year now, and it&#x27;s not even close to empty! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thin white blond tight curly hair.  This is the only thing that I can find that actually detangles her hair and doesnt rip it out.  A great product!</li>
            <li> I love this and the smell! Spray in conditioner, heat protector and so much more all in one bottle! Will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it for years. Great for short or long hair. I have a lot of hair so it helps with detangling after the shower and keeps hair healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Great product. I&#x27;m a happy customer :)</li>
            <li> After thousands of dollars spend on hair products, I&#x27;ve finally found something that works! For those reviews that say this stuff leaves the hair greasy/gunky, they&#x27;re not using it correctly. If you spray this stuff on while your hair is SOPPING WET, and then blot dry with a towel, you will not have that heavy/gunky feeling. I have never been so happy with my curls before I used this miracle product. My hair is curly, fine, and a lot of broken hairs that manifest into major frizz! NOT ANYMORE! But remember to spray this stuff on BEFORE you towel dry your hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a number of years now and still love it.  Unfortunately, my hair stylist is having difficulty finding this particular one.  I am very sensitive to odors and the other &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; products seem to definitely more fragrance, which I don&#x27;t tolerate well.  So I am very happy to have found a source for the original product.</li>
            <li> Makes you hair very soft.  Cheaper than I have seen in any store.</li>
            <li> and it smells divine!  I highly suggest everybody try this product.  It was originally suggested to me by my hair dresser, what a smart man he is!</li>
            <li> It is truly amazing for tangles in fine hair</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works will with my hair and for my hair.  I have very curly, African American hair.  It is a healthy product, easy to use, and an excellent price.</li>
            <li> So I had a issue a while back where my hair was super gross and I went to a hairstylist who recommended this stuff. She dealt with my hair which is pretty fine but due to heat damage is frizzy when air dried. I bought it and first use I hated. I thought that my hair was still gross but this is what made it that way this time!! Not good for thin hair. No matter how little use it is greasy and it does not help at all! Waste of money ! I have no use for it, just sits.</li>
            <li> love this product really does help the breakage of hair . have seen less hair in tub which before i used this product there was more hair in tub after shampooing</li>
            <li> My hairstylist used this stuff on my hair, and I really like it.  I think it&#x27;s a great deal, makes hair really smooth and soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> Love this makes my hair feel like silk without weighing hair down or making it look greasy like all the new oil scam products.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.would recommend it to anyone.leaves hair soft and easy to manage.will continue you to use it.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever.  I have horribly dry hair, and it works to moisturize it the best of any product I have ever tried (and there have been dozens, some much more expensive).  But what I like about it most is how it detangles my hair which is always in knots after I towel-dry my hair.  I cannot recommend this product enough.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This product is deftly a 10.  It works immediately to stop hair breakage.  It arrived earlier than I expected. Not a cheap product but worth the price.</li>
            <li> this item is fake you guys just go to the hair salon and buy a real one its much better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for excellent hair products for my hair that tends to be on the dry brittle side.  You see results after the first use....hair is bouncy and has swing.  No additional product required after using this....just a touch of Argan oil for added sheen.  This is a good buy for me</li>
            <li> Perfect for fine, damaged hair</li>
            <li> This product has saved my hair on so many levels. I have done so much damage to my hair and this has been my hairs life saviour! I use it in conjunction with a couple other hair products to tame my over processed-back-to-blonde-damage-fest of hair that&#x27;s going on at the moment. This stuff really is a 10, and works 110%  How ever, I think the bottle I have received is a fake. I have been using its a 10 for years and the bottle I got makes my hair even more dry and brittle and frizzy? (what?) It also smells off? It also doesn&#x27;t have an expiration or produced date. Lets just say I&#x27;m not buying this product online from now on. Go to Target, they have a two pack for only $20.99 or something.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Really helps my hair be healthy!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this spray....but don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. I love that it detangles, and gives my hair shine. Another reviewer complained that it left her hair flat. I have found that diluting it with distilled or filtered water (about 50/50) eliminates that problem for me and I also do not over-spray my hair with it. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Decreases frizz, increases shine and manageability.  Will definately re-order.  Nice size and price.  Good service.  My daughter uses this also.</li>
            <li> I would recommend any of It&#x27;s a 10 products.  They are great for your hair, really makes it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Totally transformed my hair from a frizzy mess to a much sleeker, more manageable mane. It&#x27;s one product that takes the place of 5.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  Besides how it smells, which is great, it works really well in your hair leaving it soft and helping w/ dead ends.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Price is really great considering it&#x27;s over $30 at the hair salon.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It makes my hair soft, manageable and less frizzy. I am hooked on this conditioner. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes a world of difference in my hair</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d known about this stuff before I cut six inches off my hair - it&#x27;s amazing at taking out knots when you get out of the shower! Easy to brush my hair through, and it leaves my hair soft and shiny all day. Smells great too! Wish it were a little cheaper - I&#x27;m not the kind of person to buy hair products or pricey personal care items, but this stuff is worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never rated a product before, but this stuff is really amazing. My hair is long and quite damaged. Getting a comb through it after washing is difficult, but not when I use It&#x27;s a 10 Leave-in Product. I also leaves my hair soft when I dry it.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and frizzy.  This product makes it soft and silky! I spray the product in my hand and distribute in mywet  hair evenly. I love it!</li>
            <li> I USED IT&#x27;S A 10 MIRACLE LEAVE IN PLUS KERATIN AND IT&#x27;S BURN MY HAIR, PEOPLE ASK ME IF MY HAIR WAS CHEMICAL TREATED....  THIS PRODUCTS IS VERY BAD AND IT&#x27;S ALSO CAN CAUSE CANCER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE AWARE !!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I tried it at a friends house, and I just had to buy myself a bottle. I have very long naturally curly hair... additionally, I just had heavy highlights done and my hair took a bit of a hit damage wise.....I knew it would, but I was having too much trouble finding the right product to condition my hair and make it easy to comb out after the shower.  This product is amazing!  I mist it on, work it through a bit by squeezing my hair and then I am able to run a comb through it.  It has also allowed my naturally curly hair dry in its curly state with little to no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price here is the best I have found!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> After trying all of the others, a friend suggested this product.  My 5 year old granddaughter has long, thick, wavy, causasian hair that tangles easily.  The hair has a bit of the wild Irish texture.  I hesitated to pay this much, but it has been worth every penny.  We now have fewer fights and fewer tears.  I tryed it on my own hair and I have been completely satisfied.  I have a cosmetologist liscense and grew up with a beauty shop in the back of my house.  You can imagine I have tryed every product out there and this one has become my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product.  It goes a long way, so the expense evens out.</li>
            <li> Greatest hair product for long and/or curly hair. Spray it on post shower and tangles just fall out. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. I&#x27;ve got long very curly thick hair. I would easily be spending 3 times longer brushing my hair without it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for all hair types. Leaves your hair feeling silky and prolongs the length of time it takes for hair to get oily. I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy this product sooner.</li>
            <li> This product has givenmy hair life. I was suffering from split ends and was contemplating cutting my hair off. I started using this product along with the \\&quot;it&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; mask deep conditioner and it mended those split ends and now my hair is healthy again. I have natural hair and it make my hair soft and shiny. I would definitely recommned this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get over how nice my hair looks with this product.  My color last longer and I don&#x27;t have near the breakage that I did before.  It really is a &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It keeps my hair feeling healthy. I probably purchase this at least every other month or two</li>
            <li> My young daughter, who has waist long blond hair, returned from a week at the beach with the biggest, nastiest tangles - basically dreds. I thought we&#x27;d have to cut the knots out. Thanks to a lot of conditioner and It&#x27;s a 10, we got her hair straightened out with minimal breakage. It&#x27;s now a mainstay in our house. Even better, just a little misting with water between shampoos reactivates the product, making daily brushing a breeze.</li>
            <li> I love the It&#x27;s a 10 product. However the bottle was broken and it just inn&#x27;t the same when you have to spray it on you hand and massage into hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I use it in my little girls hair to get out tangles.  I use it in my hair to take care of frizzy fly-aways.  Has a great smell too.  A staple in our beauty products!</li>
            <li> Some people are bothered by the smell. I personally like it. What I dont like is it didn&#x27;t leave my hair shiny or as soft as I was expecting based on reviews. I even ordered the big one - based on reviews. It leaves a heavy build up and in my opinion is not for daily use. Works overall, just a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> This product is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. My hair has more bounce, volume, and shine with It&#x27;s A 10 than with any other product I&#x27;ve tried in the past!</li>
            <li> Same product that you would get in the salon for a much lower price!</li>
            <li> I have really greasy hair and this stuff just de tangles it along with many other things but does not make it any heavier. Great price on Amazon compared to other stores.</li>
            <li> Smells great and really does the job it says it does</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard about this product from several people and I have to admit I am disappointed in it. My hair is still frizzy and tangled after using quite liberally. I get better results from drugstore Pantene conditioner. I really wanted to love this product too!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I love the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product for my hair , leaves it smooth, detangles great, awesome leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Super cheap and arrived extremely fast</li>
            <li> This is a hair staple of mine. If you have long thick hair you need this. It smells great. I also use it on my five year old who has a big head of unmanageable hair. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for quite a while now and it&#x27;s always worked very well for my long hair.</li>
            <li> Great price! I thought it was ok, the smaller bottle I purchased at Ulta seemed to feel different in my hair even though they are the same product, I liked that one better.</li>
            <li> Great product - much less than what I would pay buying it at the salon.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff alot but I just started to bleach my own hair, which is quite a story in itself - I am finding I need different hair products! After bleaching my roots, my washed hair being wet, fine and porous I put a good amount of this in my hair before towel drying so I can tone it. As you know if you are touching up roots it is only natural you are also getting some bleach on already over bleached hair. Well, I got up to look in the mirror and the hair was a dark gray green! I freaked, went into the shower to try to wash it out. Some of it came out, not all of it (gray-ish tint). Would not use again until hair is toned, dried and sealed with an after-treatment. Be careful if you are in the middle of coloring your hair, using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have begun using this regularly again after deep conditioning/shampooing. My hair has recovered enough so that this is working again as a leave-in. For a while, my hair was on the verge of falling out in clumps and this was useless! If your hair is THAT DAMAGED, you need professional keratin treatments, not this. Otherwise good product. Just don&#x27;t add it in hair during color processing!</li>
            <li> I started using It&#x27;s A 10 a few years back, and it works AMAZING! There isn&#x27;t anything it won&#x27;t do/help with. Snarls? Yep. Dead ends? Yep. Split ends? Yep. Dull hair? Yup. Seriously, you won&#x27;t regret using it!</li>
            <li> i love this product! i&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 years so far. i usually buy from walgreens, but there isnt one in the town im currently contracted in. i makes my hair feel smoother and detangles. also it smells great, but not overpowering, its just clean smelling. this size bottle lasts several months for me, i use it every two to three days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of person who always has to have their hair a different color. Well, my hair finally had enough and was fried nearly to the point where I thought I was going to have to shave it all off. It was literally melting in my hands from bleachings and dye jobs, so I was in need of a miracle. Well, this definitely is the miracle. I purchased this along with the \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Mask\\&quot; and after using both just a few times, my hair is back to being manageable,strong, and shiny. Of course there&#x27;s still some damage, but with just a few weeks uses I am completely amazed. My hair isn&#x27;t very tangly, so this product made my hair extra silky to comb through. The strength in my hair has improved drastically, and the shine is incredible. I definitely recommend this if your hair is at it&#x27;s breaking point(literally)!</li>
            <li> wife buys this stuff on my account. I keep seeing it so i guess she is happy with it. thanks</li>
            <li> This  product REALLY WORKS! I have such tangled hair that it takes several hours to brush it. With this, it takes 5 minutes. I am NOT exaggerating! It is the best de-tangler I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My sister gave this to me as a gift a year ago and when I ran out I purchased the larger size on Amazon. I&#x27;m not one to use hair products but this works! I primarily use it for detangling and defrizzing. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 10 years old and my dad got me this product. It is the most amazing thing. It is so much things but one of the big things it is is a  detangler. I put it in my hair when it is a tangled mess and in less than 3 minutes it is perfect,smooth and its like there were no tangles. I have used 4 other products and the only one I recommend is the \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot;. I LOVE this!!</li>
            <li> I love this product !</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my daughter and she just loves it.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I believed the hype. This leave in is as good as my Aussie leave in hair insurance conditioner which costs less than $4. My weekend wasn&#x27;t horrible to begin with so I assume maybe it I had horrid hair, I would feel more of a difference? Either way, my hair is in no better shape now than it was previously. I also have the It&#x27;s a 10 hair mask and that&#x27;s pretty average also - I do believe this brand is highly overrated, so unless your hair is in desperate need of conditioning, I would just stick with anything you can get at your local stores.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 years, and it is the best I have ever used! Tangle free, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> I am blessed with a huge amount of shoulder-length hair and have gone through 50 years of rinses, conditioners and de-tanglers in my time.  Not an option to go without them, as my shampooed hair looks like a rat&#x27;s nest otherwise. Periodically I&#x27;ve been required to use pretty astringent shampoos to clear off all the build-up that they&#x27;ve caused as a result. I was introduced to &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; about three years ago and it has truly been a &amp;#34;miracle leave-in product.&amp;#34; Now I give my towel-dried wet hair a very few spritzes of this stuff, massage it all through vigorously right down to the roots, and though it feels like I&#x27;m dealing with a lion&#x27;s mane, I can easily run a pick through it and voila! my hair&#x27;s perfectly de-tangled! Then I use a low-setting on my hairdryer and end up with a terrific result - beautifully shiny hair with great body!  Not a week goes by that I don&#x27;t have several compliments on how great my hair looks!  I do lots of traveling and &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; in a smaller bottle is so convenient to take along on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Don&#x27;t overdo it. It takes very little of this product to de-tangle one&#x27;s hair; using too much runs the risk of weighing it down. And why waste?</li>
            <li> I had a smaller version of the leave in product. It&#x27;s pretty expensive in stores, so I was happy to find this great deal online! I feel like it could be a little less thicker than my last bottle that was bought in a store, but I might just be paranoid because I have bought fake products online before.. Either way, it smells good and softens my hair</li>
            <li> My hair which is naturally limp had much more body after using this product.It&#x27;s easy to use and unless you are washing your hair daily should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this stuff is amazing. Wash, towel dry, spray it in and go. No frizz, curls are soft &amp; bouncy, amazing! If I wanna change my look, then I dry my hair spray it and use the iron... My hair looks really straight and pretty.</li>
            <li> Great stuff No more tangles</li>
            <li> I wish this product wasn&#x27;t so pricey, but really I love how it quickly makes my hair managable out of the shower. I can get a comb through it and put off chopping it off for another few months. Side note- I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s american girl doll since her hair was an absolute rat&#x27;s nest. It worked! And didn&#x27;t leave grease behind!</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel great and I love everything about it except the price is a little high for my wallet.</li>
            <li> Spray bottle came broken. Had to go out and buy a new spray bottle and transfer. Not happy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my niece and she loves it.</li>
            <li> My sistere recommended this product after several months finally bought some. I am so glad I did. Works awesome in my hair</li>
            <li> The 10 oz bottle spray-able conditioner is different than the 4 oz, which is a complete liquid and is weightless.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it really seems to control the fizziness of my hair even on those humid days.  My teenage daughter and I use styling products and I feel it&#x27;s great for heat protection as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 is one of the best hair products ever. It really can replace 4-5 different products because of all the issues it helps with. My cousin introduced it to me &amp; I introduced it to my Mom, who also swears by it. It is kinda pricey for such a small bottle, but it&#x27;s worth it because when the quality is so great, a little goes a long way. It makes your hair soft, shiny, manageable, smooth, healthier, helps w/ tangles/knots, etc.. It also leaves your hair feeling refreshed &amp; in a lovely scent. Plus, the bottle is pretty, so I don&#x27;t mind leaving it out on my vanity.</li>
            <li> A co-worker introduced this product to me and I immediately noticed that it tamed my frizz.  My hair can go curly, wild on the top layers and this product helps significantly.</li>
            <li> This has been the greatest product ever! It is going to save my hair from splitting and I&#x27;ll be able to grow it out now!</li>
            <li> I have always used this product in my hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all. Instead of moisturizing and making hair more manageable I found that this made my hair MORE DRY and sticky.</li>
            <li> The product works great and leaves hair so soft! Will keep buying in the future! Buying in bulk helps! Love</li>
            <li> use this on my 4 year old after swimming, or sometimes even for bedhead in the morning. Works great getting snarls out. doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy. Love the scent. I&#x27;ve used it myself for my thick curly hair. Have this auto delivery.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and smelling  great!  Seems to be helping with dryness and split ends.  A great buy at a great price.</li>
            <li> BUY THIS NOW! I am new to this product and it has done miracles for my hair! I have very long, thin and naughty hair, prior to using this product it would take me an hour to brush out my hair! And once I threw out my shoulder... The leave in conditioner leaves my hair silky and smooth, but NOT greasy. Seriously, a life-saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not find a better price for this product!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a gift for my stepdaughter - she LOVES it and is asking where to get more.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I would highly recommend it.  my hair is in much better condition now that I use it&#x27;s a 10.</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> This stuff really is a miracle. Gives me swirly hair without a curling iron and no frizz!! Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10.  That&#x27;s all you need to know!  Personally I like this better than the one with Keratin.</li>
            <li> I love this! I just had a baby and my hair is so hard to comb and this product is great!</li>
            <li> best stuff for dry hair</li>
            <li> My long time hair dresser recommended this I have long very colored thick hair and indont cut it often, it keeps my hair beautiful and silky truly a 10/10 !!</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much better when I use this product.</li>
            <li> this is a miracle product! My hair is naturally dark brown and i have colored it to pretty near butter blonde and it has kept my hair feeling like ive never even colored it at all! i only have to trim my hair every few time i get my hair done because it protects it from a lot of heat damage!</li>
            <li> I think the product has changed left my hair feeling a little waxie .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product! Great results and smells very nice too.</li>
            <li> The absolute best. My girlfriend loves this stuff! You do have to wash your hair more often, though!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Its above &amp; beyond all the other detangling products Ive tried. I will never stray away from using this product again; THAT was frustrating.</li>
            <li> you can get 2 of these for the price of 1 at a store. the product itself is awesome. must have, and not tested on animals!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 is the most fantastic product I&#x27;ve ever used. It literally works on all types of hair. It makes your hair soft and shiny &amp; easy to maintain and style.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works for my hair unruly and frizzly hair!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this in a salon. This was one of the worst treatments I&#x27;ve ever used and I returned it. My hair felt like it had a gritty,dirty feel. I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> miracle fot my hair will use forever</li>
            <li> Has done wonders for my hair. Absolutely love this stuff! If you aren&#x27;t using it, you should be. I plan to buy the hair mask soon too!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have been coloring my hair for 20+ years so it can become very dry since I live in a dry, hot climate. My hairstylist used it on my hair once and I couldn&#x27;t belive how soft it made my hair (natural curls) after blowing drying straight. Even when air drying my hair - it&#x27;s amazingly soft, full of shine, and \\&quot;touchable.\\&quot; I also use is very sparingly after blow drying to give my hair added shine. The only product comparable is a good morrocan oil, which can be pricey - so this is an excellent alternative. Morroccan oil tends to weigh my hair down if I use too much. This product does not weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t agree with the negative comment made about the smell being overpowering and very flowery. That person must be highly sensitive to smells because I find it very nice, mild and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any perfume I wear (Chanel mostly). You can&#x27;t smell it on your hair during the day either. Fresh smelling hair only. You only use a few sprays to do the job - don&#x27;t over due it, comb out then dry. Mine states it has a sunscreen in it, so bonus for this desert rose! Only issue I would note, it \\&quot;might\\&quot; be too much for oily hair - I just spritz my daughter&#x27;s ends because of her oily hair/scalp.</li>
            <li> Makes long hair so easy to comb through. Helps my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> love this product for curly hair.  Seller delivered item on time.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this product. Pricey.</li>
            <li> Ok, listen, I color my hair, not because I want to I have to.  I am too young to be the color my hair is turning into. I also live in Florida, the most humid climate on earth!!!  When I go outside POOF my hair looks like one of those trolls at the end of a pencil, I am not kidding.  I have tried EVERYTHING.  From salon high end products to cheap drugstore products.  Nothing was 100% effective.  UNTIL NOW, OMG this product is so beyond what I expected.  My hair is shiny, no frizz and oh so soft. It stays this way all day.  I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product the first day i used it. You actually see a diff when you put this on your hair, it makes your hair look really shiny and soft. I have curly hair and I love to straighten my hair, i put this on before and after to protect my hair from the heat and also to prevent split ends.</li>
            <li> Why in the ever-loving hell would anyone anywhere produce a leave-in conditioner and make the *sixth ingredient* a fragrance?! Does that somehow condition my hair? Control friz? Smooth? Detangle? Moisturize? No. It doesn&#x27;t. All it does is make the product stink to high heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey, I have an idea... if I wanted to wear a scent, there are numerous other products that provide that ability! It&#x27;s amazing! Yes, I could actually buy my favorite, and use it instead! But hey, I guess they&#x27;re right after all. Why pick an odor I enjoy, when I can get the free, revolting, side-effect of my-leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to wash my hair again to get the smell out. Even after that, I could detect a faint hint of it wherever I went all day. It made me want to throw up. Why didn&#x27;t I check before I bought it? Because I never, in my wildest dreams, would have imagined anything so idiotic. Does it say \\&quot;Leave in conditioner + perfume?\\&quot; Does it (wrongly) claim \\&quot;Great scent!\\&quot; as one of the ten things it supposedly does? No! So why does it double as perfume?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just... no. No. God, now my head itches. What other kind of magic does this horrible product perform?</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s easy to apply, smells nice (very light, clean scent), and helps keep your hair healthy without making it greasy. I prefer to shampoo every other day but other leave-ins were a little too heavy and my hair would look super oily but this stuff is definitely lighter.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I ever have, I have repurchased this products 3 times, and I gave it to my mom on her birthday because I know she will love it, and of course she did, this is the best, I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s the best anti-frizz treatment in the world. [...]</li>
            <li> This is the best leave in conditioner ever! Leaves your hair super soft, without weighing it down. I wash my hair every 3 days, this never gives it that greasy, dirty feeling.</li>
            <li> I love this product this was going to be my second bottle and I received it today...Sadly the bottle was completely busted and the cap was dangling with product bursted throughout the box and over the bottle.. I was expecting to use it but its just a mess i don&#x27;t want to scoop product from the box. Im not sure it they shipped it this way or if the carriers might have busted it i dont want to point any fingers it&#x27;s just a bummer that i have this it&#x27;s useless now and I don&#x27;t want to spend more money on another in case it arrives his way a second time :/</li>
            <li> It is a great product and leaves my hair feeling very good, it was recommended by a hairdresser and I have turned quite a few people to use it</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey but a little goes a looong way. I&#x27;ve been using for over 3 years and swear by it.&lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic ,and works magic for my thin stringy easily tangled hair. my husband loves the smell too, it makes him want to get extra cozy :) It definitely has guy magnet attributes, maybe even pheromones? Love It!</li>
            <li> Love it! Leaves my hair silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big \\&quot;review writer\\&quot;...unless I really feel strongly about something.  This is one of those products - I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair...very long, thick and curly / get&#x27;s frizzy easily.  After the first use, I noticed her hair looked and felt a bit softer but nothing major in terms of change.  But after the 3rd use, I was truely amazed.  Her hair was very soft, shiny, and not frizzy at all.  I used to always put some type of mousse or gel in her hair to keep it from getting frizzy and to define the curl - I don&#x27;t use ANYTHING anymore except this stuff.  It&#x27;s even made her curls more defined.  It is by far the best detangler I&#x27;ve ever used...and I&#x27;ve tried alot!  The results were so great on her hair that I began using it on my own and after a few uses, it really does look healthier.  I love this stuff...kind of expensive though...but a little goes a long way and for something that I&#x27;ve seen such great results with, I&#x27;m willing to pay for it.  I&#x27;m planning on trying out other products in their line.  I would definately recommend this to anyone looking for a good detangler...anyone with frizzy hair...and someone who, in general, just wants their hair to look and feel healthier.</li>
            <li> I have used a LOT of detangling products in my life, but I think this is the best.  My hair is long, thick, and color-treated, so it&#x27;s prone to tangling when I wash it.  I used to put detangler in after I shampooed in the shower, then rinse it out, and apply ANOTHER leave-in detangler after I towel-dried my hair.  But with the It&#x27;s A 10 I can skip the rinse-out detangler, wait until I towel dry my hair, then spray in the Miracle Leave-In Product.  Tangles comb right out.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for dry hair.  It turned my hair around.  It is not greasy in any way, it is light and you can apply as much as you want.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft yet with body...there have been days when I simply blow dry my hair ... no need for even a comb or brush ... my fingers do the work.  Have recommended it &amp; purchased the product for others.  Found that ordering it through Amazon is cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li> I think it would be good for someone who doesn&#x27;t bleach their hair as much as I do. I originally started using this, and was really happy with it, but then I tried &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave -in Plus Keratin,&amp;#34; and it works much better.</li>
            <li> This product is not as effective with colored, permanented hair as it Wella&#x27;s Liquid Hair Restructurizer.  Both are leave-in conditioners that one sprays on one&#x27;s hair but only Wella enables a nice crisp curl with a curling iron.  If only Wella hadn&#x27;t discontinued their wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I know this product works well for many people, but it didn&#x27;t fulfill my hair need--moisturizing and styling by blow drying to straight hair. It made my hair &amp;#34;too soft&amp;#34; which made it hard to style. My hair felt good!</li>
            <li> I bought this spray yesterday, not on Amazon but I will definitely be buying this one once I run out of the smaller bottle I got, and it is the most amazing product that I have ever used! I have tried my fair share of products for frizz, leave in conditioner, and heat spray and by far this is the best. It leaves my hair feeling smooth, soft, sleek, and very light. Also, it cut my blow drying time in half and makes my hair smell fantastic! I am ecstatic about this product and I would highly recommend it for everyone :)</li>
            <li> Works as my salon recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I spray it on towel dried hair and let it sit for about 5 minutes then when I go to comb my hair it is virtually wrinkle free. After my hair dries it always smells fresh and leaves a clean look which is important because no one wants to look like they have product or residue in their hair. Highly recommend! (plus side was that I saved by being able to get this in a larger quality then drug stores sell)</li>
            <li> This spray helps me maintain my color very well. I dye my hair red which fades easily,. especially in sunlight, however It&#x27;s a 10 keeps my hair shiny, silky, and fade free much longer.</li>
            <li> I love that this product does so many things for my hair! It combines most of your hair care products into one.  I had to use a product before I dry my hair, another before I flat iron and then yet another to control frizz.  This stuff takes care of all of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is pretty reasonable since it does so much, also you don&#x27;t need much with each use so it lasts for awhile.  best hair product I&#x27;ve used in a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no issues.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like it, but it really is great after using it a little while. For the first few times, it didn&#x27;t seem to affect my hair very well, but now it&#x27;s silky, soft, and shiny. It has a creamy, waxy texture and something that gives the hair bounce (probably the alcohol). In your hands, it feels very creamy, but when it dries, it&#x27;s not heavy at all. It works well on my coarse, dry, extremely thick, wavy hair. It also is good for my sister&#x27;s finer, smoother hair--gives her hair body and shine too, and she can&#x27;t use anything the least bit heavy. The alcohol in it will definitely enhance any curl you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not exactly a conditioner, though, at least not on my hair. The alcohol dries out my hair after a time, so I alternate with alcohol-free leave-ins. Also, I use a rinse-out conditioner by Joico, and I just make sure it&#x27;s rinsed really well, so I don&#x27;t have build-up on my hair. After it&#x27;s dry I use the Joico shine serum. It&#x27;s a very light serum and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s something at Sally&#x27;s called \\&quot;Miracle 7 for heavenly hair.\\&quot; It&#x27;s supposed to be a copy, but the ingredients are not identical and it really doesn&#x27;t feel the same as \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have coarse, dry hair, you&#x27;ve probably already learned the basics:  Use a gentle shampoo and avoid heat (hot water, direct sun, and hot hair appliances, especially). I&#x27;ve found that blow-drying on cold air really does a nice job; it just takes longer, but it&#x27;s worth the patience.</li>
            <li> Possibly the best product ever!!</li>
            <li> I have used countless hair products trying to tame my wavy, frizzy, processed hair. This stuff works and it&#x27;s amazing. I just got back from Aruba where my hair is usually a mess of tangles and frizz and my hair looked great. I think Amazon is truly amazing in some ways because you can find great products here that you might never hear about. This stuff works very well-it truly lives up to its name!</li>
            <li> I first discovered this product when getting my hair cut and the stylist used it on my hair before drying and I&#x27;ve used nothing else since.  I love this stuff and it really does what it says.  My hair is soft and silky and it protects against heat.  The cheap hair products do not compare and are totally not worth your time.  This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair for over 20 years and am a blonde..I have to say, the dryness, dullness and fryed look goes away with this product.  I have not found the 10 oz size anywhere and this is a huge bottle that will last probably 6 months when used daily.  I cannot tell you how many products I have tried, and this is the one that I am using forever.  Five Stars.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  I have tried so many and this makes my hair look the healthiest!</li>
            <li> I love this spray.  It&#x27;s the only thing that works on my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s curly hair to get the tangles out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. Yes, it is a little pricey but is the best leave in conditioner out there as it does so much. Amazon prices are better than stores such as Ulta, even w/ a coupon.</li>
            <li> I was given this product as a gift a couple years ago and I couldn&#x27;t imagine being without it. I have curly hair and if I put it up in a bun, my hair completely knots up. However, with this product it does not matter; not only does it detangle but it leaves my hair soft. I have tried numerous products over the years, but this one has stuck.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for a large It&#x27;s a 10.  Great product, keeps hair healthy and keeps the frizz away.  A few squirts after the shower, brush and your done.</li>
            <li> This product once applied stays in your hair even after swimming. Makes combing thin hair much easier and pain free.</li>
            <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I have ever used! My hair is beyond damaged and this saved it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is frizzy, brittle, and hard to brush. This product makes my hair so smooth, easy to brush, and no frizz! Absolutely love this product! Completely worth the price.</li>
            <li> A disappointment ..., product was old and didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair. Completely different then when my stylist uses it at the salon . I think their inventory needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time fan of this product.  It gives good moisture without being greasy.  Very easy to use.</li>
