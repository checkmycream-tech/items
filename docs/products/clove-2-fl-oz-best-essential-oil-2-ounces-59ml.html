            <li>Clove oil is one of my favorite EO to use in my diffuser because I love the way it blends with cinnamon bark and vanilla.</li>

            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>nice oil, fast shipping</li>
            <li>Clove oil is fantastic for menstrual cramps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a fantastic anti bacterial and anti microbial oil that works well for wound care.</li>
            <li>I did receive this 2oz bottle free for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and opinions having tried this oil.</li>
            <li>Leaves my breath fresh and my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>If you have ever had a toothache and used Clove essential oil, you would always be sure you had some on hand!</li>

            <li>The Sun Essential Oils Clove Oil is very potent and just really brings out all of the feelings of family and togetherness that you get around the holidays.</li>
            <li>The label is really simple and easy to read, which is a huge plus for people using the oil for crafting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re new to clove oil this 2oz bottle makes a fine introduction.</li>
            <li>This small 2oz bottle is great when I&#x27;m traveling as it helps me reflect on everything.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to find more uses for this essential oil</li>

            <li>There&#x27;s really no need to pay more for a brand name when this clove oil is just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer</li>
            <li>and it really helps.</li>
            <li>A few drops can be added to your favorite cleaning solutions to add a fresh fall scent.</li>
            <li>Clove is one of the main ingredients in thieves oil and mixes well with many other scents for aromatherapy.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not satisfied...definitely not 100% as advertised...i know real clove oil...:-(</li>
            <li> nice oil, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Worked well with the other oils I was using.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. There is no flow regulator in the bottle, fyi. I didn&#x27;t expect one with a bottle of this size, but I know some might.</li>
            <li> Not as high quality as I expected, but still  worth the price of admission.</li>
            <li> Quality product.  I use it as an addition to my homemade toothpaste. Gives it a nice refreshing and healthful boost. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> We have used this with good results with the promise of many more happy results. I will be looking to this company and label for future purchases.</li>
            <li> Smells like a holiday.</li>
            <li> Amazing product and it came with a long plastic dropper. I have a wisdom tooth growing in and I swear this helped more than anything else! I can&#x27;t wait to find more uses for this essential oil and I will definitely purchase from seller again!</li>
            <li> This small 2oz bottle is great when I&#x27;m traveling as it helps me reflect on everything.&lt;br /&gt;When I need to reflect on my life after a depressed/stressed day, I like to use clove essential oil in my diffuser to reflect.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to using clove as a way to reflect and for depressing, it is also great to use it for toothache, muscle ache, under eye puffiness as it promotes blood circulation while helping to reduce the puffiness. I like to add a couple drops to a cotton swab and rub onto toothache or instant relief. This helps kill infection-causing bacteria. In addition clove is great for digestive Aid when adding a drop to herbal tea to help relieve nausea. Muscle Ache: Mix eight drops of clove oil in two ounces of carrier oil (try jojoba or almond) and massage onto affected area.Under Eye Puffiness: Add one drop to your eye cream and apply sparingly in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure: This product was received at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased, review.

            <li> Great price. Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> We are always looking for ways to improve our health. This essential oil is good for so many different uses. I use it in our diffuser at night. This is a very generous size bottle. Definitely will last a long time. I have received this product at a reduced rate to write an honest review. I have received no instructions and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> Lots of uses and the price is wonderful.  It was far less than anywhere else and the oil is high quality.</li>
            <li> loved it, but it did leak in the package. Think it was a fluke because this companies other products were perfect</li>
            <li> It came broken with half of it drained out.</li>
            <li> I use it to ward off mosquitos! Works!</li>
            <li> Strong and spicy scent. Clove oil is a wonderful product for indigestion and vomiting. I personally use clove oil for toothaches and arthritis pain. I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I like to use clove oil with coconut oil yo do oil pulling. Leaves my breath fresh and my teeth feel so clean. Will reorder and the price was great.!!!</li>
            <li> i give this one star because I purchased it to use on my gums for tooth health. but when i got the bottle today it says that it is not for internal use. so can i still use it on my gums? if i can&#x27;t this will remain a 1 star. but if i can i will upgrade this up to a 4 star or 5 star.</li>
            <li> Clove oil has a wonderful fall scent that reminds me of pies, fallen leaves and Thanksgiving. It&#x27;s just a very homey aroma. The Sun Essential Oils Clove Oil is very potent and just really brings out all of the feelings of family and togetherness that you get around the holidays. The oil is perfect for candle making or diffusing and the smell is long-lasting. The 2-ounce bottle sounds small, but it&#x27;s actually a really good size. Just a warning, it&#x27;s a screw-top cap, thought he company does provide a plastic dropper. You may want to have a few extras on hand just in case you lose the dropper or need to replace it over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the little amber glass bottles that the company uses to package their oils. The screw top caps are really easy to use and the thick glass prevents the smell from penetrating the bottle. The label is really simple and easy to read, which is a huge plus for people using the oil for crafting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product gets 5 stars because it&#x27;s wonderful quality and very affordable. This is an excellent introduction to essential oils for those that aren&#x27;t familiar. There&#x27;s really no need to pay more for a brand name when this clove oil is just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product for free or at a reduced cost in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Clove oil is one of my favorite EO to use in my diffuser because I love the way it blends with cinnamon bark and vanilla. It&#x27;s most beneficial topically but I always end up using most of it in the diffuser just because I love that scent. It&#x27;s great for headaches and helps me stay energized throughout my day. Like I said though it&#x27;s benefits topically can&#x27;t be ignored. Clove oil is fantastic for menstrual cramps. You can mix it with cinnamon, rose, lavander and a carrier oil and massage it on your lower abdomen and it really helps. There have been many many studies done on its medicinal qualities and are easy to find with a quick Google search. It&#x27;s also a fantastic anti bacterial and anti microbial oil that works well for wound care. Wiping baseboards with a cotton swab soaked in this EO will help keep many insects and dust mites away. With so many uses it only makes sense to purchase the larger 4oz bottle but if you&#x27;re new to clove oil this 2oz bottle makes a fine introduction. I have used many of Sun Organics essential oils and have never had any issues with the quality I&#x27;ve received from them. I did receive this 2oz bottle free for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and opinions having tried this oil. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I used it for tooth pain, worked great. Not recommending anyone use it like that, but look it up, it works in that manner.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fall season scents. It reminds me of closet freshers my mom &amp; I used to make as gifts when I was a kid. Clove is one of the main ingredients in thieves oil and mixes well with many other scents for aromatherapy. A few drops in boiling water will help clear the sinuses when inhaled. I prefer the 4 oz bottle on this one because it has so many around the home uses. A few drops can be added to your favorite cleaning solutions to add a fresh fall scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for incase I have any fish that need painlessly put down. I have a large koi pond and 3 aquariums and my daughter is attached to all of the fish.  This way she can see that they don&#x27;t suffer if they need put down.</li>
            <li> If you have ever had a toothache and used Clove essential oil, you would always be sure you had some on hand! My neighbor had a toothache and I put some on a cotton ball and had him put it on his tooth. He said it was instant no more pain! He used it for 2 days until he could get into his Dentists Office. I received this product in exchange for writing an honest review.</li>
            <li> I love the product and the price. It was the shipping speed I was not happy with. It was gauranteed 2 day shipping. I got it in a day late. Otherwise, I would&#x27;ve given a 5 star.</li>
