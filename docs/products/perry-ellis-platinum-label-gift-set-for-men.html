            <li> Mmmm smells so good ...</li>
            <li> Best buy on Perry Ellis. Colongne alone is more than the entire package offered here on Amazon. The shaving balm really was a suprise, it sooths and cools your face after a close shave. The deoderant and the shaving balm help enhance the colongne. A+++++</li>
