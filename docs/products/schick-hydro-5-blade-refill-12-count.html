            <li>I have had excellent results with this product.</li>
            <li>This item was a birthday gift and the receiver was very happy tor receive it.  </li>
            <li>They work great and a good price!</li>
            <li>This is a great option to save money.</li>
            <li>Also said what a great product it was/is.</li>
            <li>A great deal on razors that in store cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>my dad really liked these things, and now  I do to!</li>
            <li>We love them!</li>
            <li>My husbands favorite blade and what a deal!</li>
            <li>Amazing</li>
            <li>but they fit the handle, have the hydro strip and have five blades.  </li>
            <li>Large  count for a good price, got it much faster than I thought it would take</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured/described!</li>
            <li>a razor is exactly what you expect and if you buy this item it almost 100% means that you have the handle part and have used Schick Razors before.</li>
            <li>This is great and based on my previous useage it might last all year.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look exactly the same</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find them in packages like this, which I love.</li>
            <li>I normally purchase a 3-pack of these blade refills at the grocery store and they last me forever.  </li>
            <li>Wet it first and your skin feels like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>The Hydro band across the top usually dries out fast but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from using the blades until they are dull.  </li>
            <li>But, I received these and on the very first use the blade seemed dull.  </li>

            <li> I love this razor but hate the cost of replacing the blades.  </li>
            <li> By buying the 12 count for a little over 30 bucks I save almost 3.50 a refill.  </li>
            <li> Hard to mess this product up....</li>
            <li> I hardly care about looks if it will save me 3.50 a refill</li>

            <li> My husband, teenage son and I (40yr old woman) have been using these razors and blades for a few years. We love them! It&#x27;s hard to find them in packages like this, which I love.</li>
            <li> I love this razor but hate the cost of replacing the blades.  This is a great option to save money.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase a 3-pack of these blade refills at the grocery store and they last me forever.  I figure I shave 4 times a week and one of these refills can almost last me a month.  The Hydro band across the top usually dries out fast but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from using the blades until they are dull.  The 3-pack at the store was costing about 18 bucks so that is a whopping 6 dollars a refill.  By buying the 12 count for a little over 30 bucks I save almost 3.50 a refill.  This is great and based on my previous useage it might last all year.  But, I received these and on the very first use the blade seemed dull.  They don&#x27;t look exactly the same but they fit the handle, have the hydro strip and have five blades.  I hardly care about looks if it will save me 3.50 a refill but the blades just don&#x27;t seem sharp.  I am not sure what is wrong with these but something is definitely off. I wonder if anyone else has seen this problem.</li>

            <li> Exceeded my expectations&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable. Wet it first and your skin feels like a baby&#x27;s butt. Amazing</li>
