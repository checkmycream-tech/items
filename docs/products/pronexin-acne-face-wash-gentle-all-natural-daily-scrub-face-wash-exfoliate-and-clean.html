            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s probably not the best thing for your face.</li>
            <li>Worked great, but I didn&#x27;t see any kind of a difference for a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m conviced that all of the good ratings are from employees of this company just trying to get this product sold.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li>It smelled good too.</li>
            <li>This is an effective exfoliating face wash that is good for acne prone skin, but also aging skin and turning over the skin cell growth.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Pronexin!</li>
            <li>Soooo turns out this stuff is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>but it made my face break out even more!</li>
            <li>but my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>These 2 products are amazing together.</li>
            <li>Our daughter has been using it for about a month and is thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>Her face is clearing more and more every day!</li>
            <li>The best part about this product is that it is all natural and does not irritate or burn your skin.</li>
            <li>It dose a awesome job, makes your face feel fresh, treats acne scars, cleans pores, and dose great job at treat current acne.</li>
            <li>and I have to use more because of the runniness.</li>
            <li>Since I started the insanity workout, I started sweating alot more, and I started to get more sweat pimples that were now on my knees.  </li>
            <li>This stuff strips most of the oil off while leaving a healthy layer in tact.</li>
            <li>Better to go for the reputable items out there.</li>
            <li>When she uses it at a regular bases she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Have recommended this product to many and will continue to purchase for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I have used this about 6 weeks now, and am SO GLAD I did.</li>
            <li>glad it works for some people, but want it to be heard it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li>I found Pronexin on an independent website for best acne solutions and it recommended it for me.</li>
            <li>And it really works great for us.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But the part that bothered me most was the return policy.  </li>
            <li>Worked ok.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE This</li>
            <li>well I&#x27;m sure I will continue to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>works better than anything else we have found.</li>
            <li>better than proactive.</li>
            <li>Works very well and makes me happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really refreshing</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I have even more breakouts than ever.</li>
            <li>hope this helps anyone who was debating on whether to try this product or not. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t come up with a better term for it at the moment</li>
            <li>, I like to think that it just helps the soap get into the pores and exfoliate more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I use it as body wash now and love  it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased so many different products for my daughter and son and this one has been the best.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of the product - It was a shock at first to have the exfoliating, but after a while it felt good.</li>
            <li>I now have beautiful, clear skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great all natural product.  </li>
            <li>and I have very mild acne.</li>
            <li>It arrives super quickly too, which is nice when she runs out and forgets to ask me to reorder it.  </li>
            <li>Huge clusters of zits, all over.</li>
            <li>This is a huge improvement for me.</li>
            <li>I have light break outs</li>
            <li>Being that I am currently a broke nursing student, (which adds to the breakouts because of stress lol)</li>
            <li>Good natural face wash.</li>
            <li>I will continue using as it is a good natural face wash.</li>
            <li>You only need a dime sized amount and with this taken into consideration, the price is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>but now it makes my acne more smaller and more better looking</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product and love having an all natural face wash.</li>
            <li>Use a good exfoilient type face cloth and tea tree oil (found at local pharmacy) for spot treatment/breakouts.</li>
            <li>as far as it helping my acne, I didn&#x27;t see a diference, but I think this works well as some kind of exfolliant..</li>
            <li>What they advertise IS TRUE.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that worked this good on my face</li>
            <li>I was using Skin ID prior to becoming pregnant but stopped during my pregnancy because my skin was amazing</li>
            <li>Seller mailed it quickly.</li>
            <li>I would not suggest this for anyone wanting to rid themselves of mild acne.</li>
            <li>Between the gentle abrasive scrubbies and the moisturizing properties, it leaves my skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>but my skin has never been more clean and soft.</li>
            <li>first off, this product has great ingredients, theres not really any chance that it could irritate your skin,</li>
            <li>anyway, this is an overall good product, but I think it is just meant for certain types of skin...</li>
            <li>Made my skin more clear, but it did not remove blackheads like product claimed</li>
            <li>Give this product a try, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>my pores are kind of big too..</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t completely get rid of my breakouts after three days, but there was a noticeable difference for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get giant cystic zits everywhere that would take a month to disappear on their own and</li>
            <li>As soon as I put it into my hand it runs right off.</li>
            <li>then once right before bed.</li>
            <li>make sure you use this product TWICE daily to get the full effect.</li>
            <li>Normally I would wait longer, but they advertise it&#x27;s suppose to show significant improvement in 72 hours.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on your skin, doesn&#x27;t over-dry.  </li>
            <li>works pretty well on keeping acne away</li>
            <li>Prior to purchasing, I was able to sample Pronexin for about a week when I borrowed my sisters&#x27; that she got online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid runner and during the summer I got sweat pimples on both of my thighs.  </li>
            <li>Instead my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love Pronexin.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what my face looks like after a whole bottle!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t order this product again and wish I hadn&#x27;t in the first place.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to pay it if it helps her.</li>
            <li>It had helped my acne at first when I washed every day with it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if using this product everyday is good or not because it has exfoliants in it</li>
            <li>I gave this product two stars because it came in the mail quickly and undamaged, and I can at least say this is a really good exfoliator.</li>
            <li>First I wash my face with the clean and clear and then with the pronexin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s most likely a very helpful product.  </li>
            <li>I was most surprised by how soft my face feels and makeup is easier to apply.  </li>
            <li>I always like to try natural products before going to ones full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t strong enough for my acne on my face</li>
            <li>I recently broke down and purchased a bottle after reading some great reviews and figured what else do I have to lose at this point.</li>
            <li>My face is clear for the first time in years!</li>
            <li>It even makes your face feel fresh and clean all day long.</li>
            <li>I would definetely recommend both if you are suffering with huge deep set pimples that wont go away.</li>
            <li>which is kind of bad news for those of us with oily skin, because we need that extra oil absorbed...after rinsing it off, your skin kind of feels soft, but in a greasy kind of way...</li>
            <li>I really wish this had worked.</li>
            <li>This seller however, had incredibly fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Really really oily.</li>
            <li>I it really did was clarify his skin tone.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
            <li>It has really changed my face.</li>
            <li>I tried to continue using it but by the time the month ended, I gave up because it wasn&#x27;t really doing anything.</li>
            <li>haha...</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>I really like this face wash.</li>
            <li>then by then the whole viscous cycle just starts all over again.</li>
            <li>It took about a week for my daughters face to clear but it definitely made a significant improvement!  </li>
            <li>When my Amazon ordered bottle of Pronexin arrived, I was so excited to use it; however, the texture was not the same quality and consistency...</li>
            <li>I was on the fence about trying this product at first because it claims to clear breakouts in like three days, which is what like every freaking product says it will do, and it is about $25 for one bottle.</li>
            <li>I like the other design better, and it had more fluid ounces, for the same amount of money I&#x27;m paying now.  </li>
            <li>So gentle on my sensitive skin but really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older and have strictly hormonal acne.  </li>
            <li>it is like almost a mud color and has a decent smell...</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t realize that it had actually prevented my skin from getting better later on because exfoliating your skin</li>
            <li>The unaffected areas of my skin seem to look really soft and healthy, so this might be for someone with mostly clear skin that&#x27;s just trying to get a glow, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for that purpose with the price as it is.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to someone who has had problems with acne as well as myself.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel very clean, and my pores are noticebly less visible.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the product was easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early thirtys with really oily skin...</li>
            <li>Immediately I was turned off by the brown color and unusual smell, however knowing it was an all natural product I decided to give it a try anyway.</li>
            <li>so it leaves your skin feeling real soft after using it.</li>
            <li>It is not the ultimate solution though as acne will still appear, but cant complain, you get your moneys worth out of it.</li>
            <li>I still have breakouts and even got some in new areas using this face wash -</li>
            <li>and she says she can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>It gets super oily during the day and overnight (even after I scrape all the war paint off from the day), but if I use too strong of a cleanser my face will flake up and get extremely dry, especially in the T zone, and you could practically see my pores near my cheeks from outer space since they were so gross.</li>
            <li>And it also leaves your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>Not satisfied with the product but will give it more time</li>
            <li>The walnut shell makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>But, did help clear out the new break outs.</li>
            <li>It was good at first, but then, my skin started breaking out like crazy after a while.</li>
            <li>On top of that, my skin would get really oily and other products just dried out my face and did absolutely nothing for my zits.</li>
            <li>My acne is not full blown and my pimples are not as huge as they used to be</li>
            <li>anyway, just as a precaution to those of you with oily skin, because this stuff doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals in it (like the harsh kind), it wont in any way dry up your skin...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t control or clear acne.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product a month &amp; it has not helped clear my face at all.</li>
            <li>However, it did not help clear up my acne which it is marketed for.</li>
            <li>im almost 80% clear of acne, in a month of use .</li>
            <li>Bought it for my 15 year old.</li>
            <li>I was using proactiv since I started getting horomonal acne in my early 20&#x27;s,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been battling adult acne for 15 years</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>It started in my early 20s.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin soft.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m liking the results I have now.</li>
            <li>I recommend you try this before any of the more harsh facial products and cleansers or prescription medications.</li>
            <li>When it did arrive, I didn&#x27;t wanna let the clean and clear exfoliating scrub go to waste</li>
            <li>Not sure this is worth the money didn&#x27;t help out so much with acne as promised.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if that makes a huge difference with this</li>
            <li>I have 1 little pimple left that used to be huge.</li>
            <li>However, when I do use it, it makes my skin feel really soft and not dry at all.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s on par with all other type products I&#x27;m aware of.</li>
            <li>Within days I noticed a major difference.</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t had any giant or new zits but then again, I&#x27;ve only been using the face washes for a week or two.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about two or three weeks now and it seems to have barely had any effect.</li>
            <li>I barely notice it now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for nearly 90 days and noticed zero difference at all between this and my last face wash.</li>
            <li>I never really was sold on the whole proactive, pay a lot of money for a five step system idea.</li>
            <li>I buy this for my teenage daughter (who&#x27;s almost an adult now) ...</li>
            <li>I have mild acne and pronexin didn&#x27;t make my face worse, but it didn&#x27;t really help either.</li>
            <li>After finally working past the angry skin when I switched, my skin is now softer and looking beautiful using only one product, it&#x27;s like a completely different face.  </li>
            <li>None of the salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide products really do much for my skin anymore either, so I&#x27;m starting to get a little hopeless.</li>

            <li> , I like to think that it just helps the soap get into the pores and exfoliate more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but I use it as body wash now and love  it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased so many different products for my daughter and son and this one has been the best.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of the product - It was a shock at first to have the exfoliating, but after a while it felt good.</li>
            <li> I now have beautiful, clear skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great all natural product.  </li>
            <li> and I have very mild acne.</li>
            <li> It arrives super quickly too, which is nice when she runs out and forgets to ask me to reorder it.  </li>
            <li> Huge clusters of zits, all over.</li>
            <li> This is a huge improvement for me.</li>
            <li> I have light break outs</li>
            <li> Being that I am currently a broke nursing student, (which adds to the breakouts because of stress lol)</li>
            <li> Good natural face wash.</li>
            <li> I will continue using as it is a good natural face wash.</li>
            <li> You only need a dime sized amount and with this taken into consideration, the price is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> but now it makes my acne more smaller and more better looking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product and love having an all natural face wash.</li>
            <li> Use a good exfoilient type face cloth and tea tree oil (found at local pharmacy) for spot treatment/breakouts.</li>
            <li> as far as it helping my acne, I didn&#x27;t see a diference, but I think this works well as some kind of exfolliant..</li>
            <li> What they advertise IS TRUE.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that worked this good on my face</li>
            <li> I was using Skin ID prior to becoming pregnant but stopped during my pregnancy because my skin was amazing</li>
            <li> Seller mailed it quickly.</li>
            <li> I would not suggest this for anyone wanting to rid themselves of mild acne.</li>
            <li> Between the gentle abrasive scrubbies and the moisturizing properties, it leaves my skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> but my skin has never been more clean and soft.</li>
            <li> first off, this product has great ingredients, theres not really any chance that it could irritate your skin,</li>
            <li> anyway, this is an overall good product, but I think it is just meant for certain types of skin...</li>
            <li> Made my skin more clear, but it did not remove blackheads like product claimed</li>
            <li> Give this product a try, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> my pores are kind of big too..</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t completely get rid of my breakouts after three days, but there was a noticeable difference for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get giant cystic zits everywhere that would take a month to disappear on their own and</li>
            <li> As soon as I put it into my hand it runs right off.</li>
            <li> then once right before bed.</li>
            <li> make sure you use this product TWICE daily to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> Normally I would wait longer, but they advertise it&#x27;s suppose to show significant improvement in 72 hours.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on your skin, doesn&#x27;t over-dry.  </li>
            <li> works pretty well on keeping acne away</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing, I was able to sample Pronexin for about a week when I borrowed my sisters&#x27; that she got online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid runner and during the summer I got sweat pimples on both of my thighs.  </li>
            <li> Instead my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love Pronexin.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what my face looks like after a whole bottle!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t order this product again and wish I hadn&#x27;t in the first place.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m willing to pay it if it helps her.</li>
            <li> It had helped my acne at first when I washed every day with it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if using this product everyday is good or not because it has exfoliants in it</li>
            <li> I gave this product two stars because it came in the mail quickly and undamaged, and I can at least say this is a really good exfoliator.</li>
            <li> First I wash my face with the clean and clear and then with the pronexin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s most likely a very helpful product.  </li>
            <li> I was most surprised by how soft my face feels and makeup is easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> I always like to try natural products before going to ones full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t strong enough for my acne on my face</li>
            <li> I recently broke down and purchased a bottle after reading some great reviews and figured what else do I have to lose at this point.</li>
            <li> My face is clear for the first time in years!</li>
            <li> It even makes your face feel fresh and clean all day long.</li>
            <li> I would definetely recommend both if you are suffering with huge deep set pimples that wont go away.</li>
            <li> which is kind of bad news for those of us with oily skin, because we need that extra oil absorbed...after rinsing it off, your skin kind of feels soft, but in a greasy kind of way...</li>
            <li> I really wish this had worked.</li>
            <li> This seller however, had incredibly fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Really really oily.</li>
            <li> I it really did was clarify his skin tone.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
            <li> It has really changed my face.</li>
            <li> I tried to continue using it but by the time the month ended, I gave up because it wasn&#x27;t really doing anything.</li>
            <li> haha...</li>
            <li> haha)</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash.</li>
            <li> then by then the whole viscous cycle just starts all over again.</li>
            <li> It took about a week for my daughters face to clear but it definitely made a significant improvement!  </li>
            <li> When my Amazon ordered bottle of Pronexin arrived, I was so excited to use it; however, the texture was not the same quality and consistency...</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about trying this product at first because it claims to clear breakouts in like three days, which is what like every freaking product says it will do, and it is about $25 for one bottle.</li>
            <li> I like the other design better, and it had more fluid ounces, for the same amount of money I&#x27;m paying now.  </li>
            <li> So gentle on my sensitive skin but really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older and have strictly hormonal acne.  </li>
            <li> it is like almost a mud color and has a decent smell...</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t realize that it had actually prevented my skin from getting better later on because exfoliating your skin</li>
            <li> The unaffected areas of my skin seem to look really soft and healthy, so this might be for someone with mostly clear skin that&#x27;s just trying to get a glow, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for that purpose with the price as it is.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to someone who has had problems with acne as well as myself.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel very clean, and my pores are noticebly less visible.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the product was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early thirtys with really oily skin...</li>
            <li> Immediately I was turned off by the brown color and unusual smell, however knowing it was an all natural product I decided to give it a try anyway.</li>
            <li> so it leaves your skin feeling real soft after using it.</li>
            <li> It is not the ultimate solution though as acne will still appear, but cant complain, you get your moneys worth out of it.</li>
            <li> I still have breakouts and even got some in new areas using this face wash -</li>
            <li> and she says she can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> It gets super oily during the day and overnight (even after I scrape all the war paint off from the day), but if I use too strong of a cleanser my face will flake up and get extremely dry, especially in the T zone, and you could practically see my pores near my cheeks from outer space since they were so gross.</li>
            <li> And it also leaves your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> Not satisfied with the product but will give it more time</li>
            <li> The walnut shell makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> But, did help clear out the new break outs.</li>
            <li> It was good at first, but then, my skin started breaking out like crazy after a while.</li>
            <li> On top of that, my skin would get really oily and other products just dried out my face and did absolutely nothing for my zits.</li>
            <li> My acne is not full blown and my pimples are not as huge as they used to be</li>
            <li> anyway, just as a precaution to those of you with oily skin, because this stuff doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals in it (like the harsh kind), it wont in any way dry up your skin...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t control or clear acne.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product a month &amp; it has not helped clear my face at all.</li>
            <li> However, it did not help clear up my acne which it is marketed for.</li>
            <li> im almost 80% clear of acne, in a month of use .</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 15 year old.</li>
            <li> I was using proactiv since I started getting horomonal acne in my early 20&#x27;s,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling adult acne for 15 years</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> It started in my early 20s.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin soft.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m liking the results I have now.</li>
            <li> I recommend you try this before any of the more harsh facial products and cleansers or prescription medications.</li>
            <li> When it did arrive, I didn&#x27;t wanna let the clean and clear exfoliating scrub go to waste</li>
            <li> Not sure this is worth the money didn&#x27;t help out so much with acne as promised.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if that makes a huge difference with this</li>
            <li> I have 1 little pimple left that used to be huge.</li>
            <li> However, when I do use it, it makes my skin feel really soft and not dry at all.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s on par with all other type products I&#x27;m aware of.</li>
            <li> Within days I noticed a major difference.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had any giant or new zits but then again, I&#x27;ve only been using the face washes for a week or two.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two or three weeks now and it seems to have barely had any effect.</li>
            <li> I barely notice it now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for nearly 90 days and noticed zero difference at all between this and my last face wash.</li>
            <li> I never really was sold on the whole proactive, pay a lot of money for a five step system idea.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my teenage daughter (who&#x27;s almost an adult now) ...</li>
            <li> I have mild acne and pronexin didn&#x27;t make my face worse, but it didn&#x27;t really help either.</li>
            <li> After finally working past the angry skin when I switched, my skin is now softer and looking beautiful using only one product, it&#x27;s like a completely different face.  </li>
            <li> None of the salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide products really do much for my skin anymore either, so I&#x27;m starting to get a little hopeless.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work at all and actually caused much worse acne than I had originally.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend the money on one bottle, but I have wasted away so much cash on other soaps and treatments such as Proactiv (which i actually liked, but they kinda screw you with weird payments and long story short</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this cleanser, the inflammation calmed tremendously, and after a few months  her skins continues to improve.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned above I did not have acne but was looking for a product to help overall skin appearence/balancing and clear up blackheads in trouble spots.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first bought this face wash, especially when the site reviews said clear skin in 72 hours or something along those lines.</li>
            <li> and I really feel like it cleans my face, but I hardly noticed a difference in my face.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that the product is very watery this time.</li>
            <li> but my skin is to say the least, very picky.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 13 year old daughter and she has been using it for a few weeks with no results at all; no change is the amount of acne.</li>
            <li> The container is actually much bigger than I expected, if it keeps working</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, clean, and oil free without the terrible drying and peeling other products gave my skin, and the acne marks I had before even cleared up.</li>
            <li> Our skin is clear with regular use and unlike other acne wash products my skin does not feel tight and dry after use.  </li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes, I started suffering from acne on my face, neck, back and chest a couple years ago and as time goes on it only seems to get worse.</li>
            <li> This worked no different than any of the other products I have used.</li>
            <li> but i was now suffering with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Makes it difficult to get the full effect of it</li>
            <li> I bought clean and clear exfoliating scrub the day before, not at all expecting amazon to deliver the pronexin so fast and needed something to keep my face from breaking out horribly while I waited for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> And only one step so you can&#x27;t mess it up.</li>
            <li> It arrived a week before I expected it, and in pristine condition.</li>
            <li> I had never really had problems with my skin until after I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism.</li>
            <li> I never really had acne</li>
            <li> It exfoliates well but not too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any crazy chemicals (the Pronexin website has a complete list of ingredients) and has a nice scrubby feeling (due to little broken up walnut shells)</li>
            <li> Alright, so I have been trying to find a new face soap for the past few months.</li>
            <li> With other products, such as ProActiv, my face would get raw from all the scrubbing and rubbing.</li>
            <li> The only breakouts I get are when I get lazy and neglect to wash my face.</li>
            <li> however, it is EXTREMELY liquidy..</li>
            <li> I even went as far as washing my face with rubbing alcohol needless to say not only did it not help the breakouts</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of an odd odor to it but nothing too bad (unless my nose has been completely desensitized from nursing school haha).</li>
            <li> This cleanser has helped a bit but not worth the money.</li>
            <li> it was watered down, diluted.</li>
            <li> In fact it made my whole face worst and SUPER itchy.</li>
            <li> My breakouts are still as bad as ever, at most the swelling might go down a little sooner than usual</li>
            <li> I just wish the price reflected that you&#x27;re getting less product now.  </li>
            <li> My pores are softer/smaller/clearer and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed, because at one time this stuff had my skin glowing and acne free.</li>
            <li> No significant impovement.</li>
            <li> I am using this product with my Clearsonic Aria, which to those of you that don&#x27;t know is like a little spinning face cleaner thing</li>
            <li> I still get little breakouts</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just a little pricy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> So I tried Proactive, it only made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> I ordered this face wash and had it within a few days.</li>
            <li> There was a noticeable difference within a few days.  </li>
            <li> It looks like mud, feels grainy when you&#x27;re scrubbing it in, smells terrible, and while the whole 72 hours thing was complete bull as I expected, it does</li>
            <li> aweful.but works well if you can get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I also ordered acnepril and have been taking 4 pills a day for the past 5 days.</li>
            <li> Not sure what else is out there to use, but would not get this again since it did not help me.</li>
            <li> It has helped a small amount considering what the product says it will do.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not sure if its just the one face wash that works, or the combination of both</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with about 4 other acne products to keep my acne at least not getting worse.</li>
            <li> My face got a little bit dry where there were some bad zits, but nothing a little moisturizer couldn&#x27;t handle overnight.</li>
            <li> I broke out so bad and nothing would clear it up.</li>
            <li> Living with adult acne often causes me to make impulse purchases of promise products, and i always end up disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used to have a serious acne problem</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product, she had used a variety of other face washes for acne prone skin like Cetaphil, Dermalogica, and others, but her sensitive skin became terribly inflamed and painful beyond the discomfort of the acne alone.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t itch, but they were red ugly blotches of pimples.  </li>
            <li> She still has breakouts, but the bacteria comes to a head within a day or two rather than remaining deep and painful for weeks.</li>
            <li> every day is not good for your skin and can irritate it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed they no longer sell the 12oz bottles for the same cost</li>
            <li> but this actually made them go from whiteheads to cysts :(</li>
            <li> For the price per bottle I am not happy about this.</li>
            <li> It worked for a couple of days then made my face worse.</li>
            <li> Not going away, but not getting worse.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product it did not live up to the rep this website has given it</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild acne, it gets especially bad when my hormones are going crazy once a month.</li>
            <li> Ive been breaking out really bad around my chin area lately and no matter what product I tried the breakouts wouldnt seem to ease up.</li>
            <li> looking back was the worst choice for my skin.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> and it was getting worse!  </li>
            <li> It may seem expensive but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell HORRIBLE</li>
            <li> but it only got worst.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing that the bottle has changed.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s quite expensive. :(</li>
            <li> This product smelled so bad that my son refused to use it.</li>
            <li> I did not have bad &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; before using this product</li>
            <li> my face went crazy!</li>
            <li> Give this product a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I threw that crap away and did a TON of research.</li>
            <li> He has real bad acne.</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have ordered this product before and have never had issues until now. My biggest complaint is that the product is very watery this time. As soon as I put it into my hand it runs right off. Makes it difficult to get the full effect of it and I have to use more because of the runniness. For the price per bottle I am not happy about this.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne and pronexin didn&#x27;t make my face worse, but it didn&#x27;t really help either. I found that St. Ives Apricot scrub was cheaper and worked just as well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t control or clear acne.</li>
            <li> So gentle on my sensitive skin but really works. And only one step so you can&#x27;t mess it up. I was suprised it moisturizes so well with only one step but it works.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 13 year old daughter and she has been using it for a few weeks with no results at all; no change is the amount of acne. I always like to try natural products before going to ones full of chemicals.  I really wish this had worked.</li>
            <li> Smells aweful.but works well if you can get past the smell.</li>
            <li> works pretty well on keeping acne away but if i do get some it takes a while for it to go away</li>
            <li> Worked great, but I didn&#x27;t see any kind of a difference for a week. But I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  It&#x27;s disappointing that the bottle has changed. I like the other design better, and it had more fluid ounces, for the same amount of money I&#x27;m paying now.  But, Pronexin changed it&#x27;s packaging, so you&#x27;ll find that everywhere. I just wish the price reflected that you&#x27;re getting less product now.  This seller however, had incredibly fast shipping. It arrived a week before I expected it, and in pristine condition.</li>
            <li> The product is not working. I am still experiencing breakouts. Going on week three. Not satisfied with the product but will give it more time</li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes, I started suffering from acne on my face, neck, back and chest a couple years ago and as time goes on it only seems to get worse. I&#x27;ve been using this for about two or three weeks now and it seems to have barely had any effect. Normally I would wait longer, but they advertise it&#x27;s suppose to show significant improvement in 72 hours. My breakouts are still as bad as ever, at most the swelling might go down a little sooner than usual but that&#x27;s about it. None of the salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide products really do much for my skin anymore either, so I&#x27;m starting to get a little hopeless. I gave this product two stars because it came in the mail quickly and undamaged, and I can at least say this is a really good exfoliator. The unaffected areas of my skin seem to look really soft and healthy, so this might be for someone with mostly clear skin that&#x27;s just trying to get a glow, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for that purpose with the price as it is.</li>
            <li> The reason I ordered Pronexin was because of the reduced price Amazon offered rather than the more expensive retail price. Prior to purchasing, I was able to sample Pronexin for about a week when I borrowed my sisters&#x27; that she got online. When my Amazon ordered bottle of Pronexin arrived, I was so excited to use it; however, the texture was not the same quality and consistency...it was watered down, diluted. I did save money, however what you save in money, you will sacrifice with quality.</li>
            <li> It was good at first, but then, my skin started breaking out like crazy after a while. I was disappointed, because at one time this stuff had my skin glowing and acne free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid runner and during the summer I got sweat pimples on both of my thighs.  Ussually, shorts will cover up the pimples.  Since I started the insanity workout, I started sweating alot more, and I started to get more sweat pimples that were now on my knees.  They didn&#x27;t itch, but they were red ugly blotches of pimples.  I was thinking about seeing a dermatologist, but I went to an online forum and someone mentioned Pronexin.  I purchased the product and after one application, and I did say &amp;#34;one application&amp;#34;, all of the sweat pimples faded.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  For me, this product works.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very gentle on your skin, doesn&#x27;t over-dry.  I&#x27;m a big fan and recommend this</li>
            <li> Made my skin more clear, but it did not remove blackheads like product claimed</li>
            <li> Stuff works well, needs about two weeks for it to fully kick in but that&#x27;s on par with all other type products I&#x27;m aware of. I&#x27;m in my early thirtys with really oily skin... Really really oily. This stuff strips most of the oil off while leaving a healthy layer in tact. Use a good exfoilient type face cloth and tea tree oil (found at local pharmacy) for spot treatment/breakouts. Give this product a try, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product a month &amp; it has not helped clear my face at all. I think I will be sending this product back for a refund. I don&#x27;t know if using this product everyday is good or not because it has exfoliants in it.. I thought you should only exfoliate twice a week!</li>
            <li> Did not meet expectations  will never purchase again. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Better to go for the reputable items out there.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my daughter request. When she uses it at a regular bases she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews,  I had a lot of hope for this product. No difference in my skin.  I did like the smell though.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 15 year old. He has real bad acne. I it really did was clarify his skin tone. But, did help clear out the new break outs.</li>
            <li> Great product! Disappointed they no longer sell the 12oz bottles for the same cost</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for over 4 years!! I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> Good natural face wash. For acne - does not work. Go to your doctor before wasting your money on purchases. I will continue using as it is a good natural face wash. However, it did not help clear up my acne which it is marketed for.</li>
            <li> Ive been breaking out really bad around my chin area lately and no matter what product I tried the breakouts wouldnt seem to ease up. I even went as far as washing my face with rubbing alcohol needless to say not only did it not help the breakouts but i was now suffering with dry skin. It was gross. So I ordered pronexin. Ive only been using it for 5 days now but my skin looks amazing. I have 1 little pimple left that used to be huge. I barely notice it now. I also ordered acnepril and have been taking 4 pills a day for the past 5 days. These 2 products are amazing together. I would definetely recommend both if you are suffering with huge deep set pimples that wont go away.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see the slightest improvement. In fact it made my whole face worst and SUPER itchy. Neutrogena works great though</li>
            <li> Purchased this face wash for my teenage daughter who has been suffering with severe forehead acne. Prior to using this product, she had used a variety of other face washes for acne prone skin like Cetaphil, Dermalogica, and others, but her sensitive skin became terribly inflamed and painful beyond the discomfort of the acne alone. After a few days of using this cleanser, the inflammation calmed tremendously, and after a few months  her skins continues to improve. She still has breakouts, but the bacteria comes to a head within a day or two rather than remaining deep and painful for weeks. Have recommended this product to many and will continue to purchase for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I chose to try this to switch from Proactiv, wsnting to once and for all take the tine to wean my skin off of the chemicals and to finally get my skin on track. I was using proactiv since I started getting horomonal acne in my early 20&#x27;s, looking back was the worst choice for my skin. Any time I tried to use anything different I had the same result, regardless of the product, total face chaos. I comitted to switching and chose this as my way. I have used this about 6 weeks now, and am SO GLAD I did. After finally working past the angry skin when I switched, my skin is now softer and looking beautiful using only one product, it&#x27;s like a completely different face.  I&#x27;m in love with this product and love having an all natural face wash.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel very clean, and my pores are noticebly less visible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year now and it is amazing! I&#x27;ve been battling adult acne for 15 years and I found something that works and it&#x27;s all natural. Seller mailed it quickly. This product lasts me several months.</li>
            <li> This product smelled so bad that my son refused to use it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve been using for nearly 90 days and noticed zero difference at all between this and my last face wash. I still have breakouts and even got some in new areas using this face wash - I normally only get around my chin, but had on nose and forehead using this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad it works for some people, but want it to be heard it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. I&#x27;ll be trying another product when this bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the product - It was a shock at first to have the exfoliating, but after a while it felt good. The smell is definitely &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smelling. Took some getting used to. Other than that, the product was easy to use. Just wish it worked!</li>
            <li> Didbt work I was disappointed with this product it did not live up to the rep this website has given it</li>
            <li> Still have acne after using this for a month. Not sure what else is out there to use, but would not get this again since it did not help me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me.  I have light break outs but this actually made them go from whiteheads to cysts :(</li>
            <li> I never really was sold on the whole proactive, pay a lot of money for a five step system idea. Still ain&#x27;t. I found Pronexin on an independent website for best acne solutions and it recommended it for me. It dose a awesome job, makes your face feel fresh, treats acne scars, cleans pores, and dose great job at treat current acne. It is not the ultimate solution though as acne will still appear, but cant complain, you get your moneys worth out of it.</li>
            <li> It has really changed my face. I used to have a serious acne problem but now it makes my acne more smaller and more better looking</li>
            <li> Works!  Happy with this and would order again</li>
            <li> I am not going to bash this product like I should, but I used over three weeks and nothing change and I have very mild acne. I&#x27;m conviced that all of the good ratings are from employees of this company just trying to get this product sold. I will not change a think and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s probably not the best thing for your face. Do not buy and just go to a dermatologist and do as they advise.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this product for years! And it really works great for us.  Our skin is clear with regular use and unlike other acne wash products my skin does not feel tight and dry after use.  Instead my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The ingredient list is great.  I think for people whose acne is caused by oily skin it&#x27;s most likely a very helpful product.  I&#x27;m older and have strictly hormonal acne.  Pronexin didn&#x27;t help a bit.  My cystic acne and close comedomal acne is still rampant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the part that bothered me most was the return policy.  They rave all about their great return policy.  I called twice to try to return it, and was left on hold for over 20 minutes each time.  That screams scam to me.  Not impressed.</li>
            <li> It worked for a couple of days then made my face worse. I tried to continue using it but by the time the month ended, I gave up because it wasn&#x27;t really doing anything.</li>
            <li> Not sure this is worth the money didn&#x27;t help out so much with acne as promised. It has helped a small amount considering what the product says it will do.</li>
            <li> This was received in a white bottle with no markings.  No list of ingredients or directions.  This worked no different than any of the other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I had never really had problems with my skin until after I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. I broke out so bad and nothing would clear it up. I became a product junkie and tried everything out there. I happened upon Pronexin and decided I had nothing left to lose.  Immediately I was turned off by the brown color and unusual smell, however knowing it was an all natural product I decided to give it a try anyway. The walnut shell makes my skin so soft! My fiance is always complimenting me on it. My makeup even went on smoother. Within a couple of weeks I noticed my face was clearing up. I now have beautiful, clear skin. The only breakouts I get are when I get lazy and neglect to wash my face. Im a big fan that it is only a one step process too.. With other products, such as ProActiv, my face would get raw from all the scrubbing and rubbing. Also, one bottle lasts me several months! You only need a dime sized amount and with this taken into consideration, the price is AMAZING! I have been using Pronexin for a year now and just ordered my third bottle. I LOVE Pronexin! It is the only product that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Worked ok. No significant impovement.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE This!  I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love Pronexin.  I did not have bad &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; before using this product but I struggled with blackheads around my nose, chin, and T-zone and it was getting worse!  I&#x27;m on the 3rd day of using this product and I can already tell a difference.  My pores are softer/smaller/clearer and less noticeable.  I was most surprised by how soft my face feels and makeup is easier to apply.  As I mentioned above I did not have acne but was looking for a product to help overall skin appearence/balancing and clear up blackheads in trouble spots.  I think I found it!  The container is actually much bigger than I expected, if it keeps working well I&#x27;m sure I will continue to purchase it.  The best part about this product is that it is all natural and does not irritate or burn your skin.</li>
            <li> works better than anything else we have found. great in the shower or at the sink. cleans thoroughly. better than proactive.</li>
            <li> Works very well and makes me happy.</li>
            <li> first off, this product has great ingredients, theres not really any chance that it could irritate your skin, so that&#x27;s good...however, it is EXTREMELY liquidy..i didn&#x27;t expect it to be that liquidy..it is like almost a mud color and has a decent smell...but to the effectiveness, I have rather oily skin that tends to get red patches...my pores are kind of big too..anyway, just as a precaution to those of you with oily skin, because this stuff doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals in it (like the harsh kind), it wont in any way dry up your skin...which is kind of bad news for those of us with oily skin, because we need that extra oil absorbed...after rinsing it off, your skin kind of feels soft, but in a greasy kind of way...as far as it helping my acne, I didn&#x27;t see a diference, but I think this works well as some kind of exfolliant..you know, if you don&#x27;t have oily skin haha...anyway, this is an overall good product, but I think it is just meant for certain types of skin...</li>
            <li> This is an effective exfoliating face wash that is good for acne prone skin, but also aging skin and turning over the skin cell growth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really refreshing and I really feel like it cleans my face, but I hardly noticed a difference in my face. Its a GREAT FACE WASH. What they advertise IS TRUE.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that worked this good on my face im almost 80% clear of acne, in a month of use . And it also leaves your skin very soft.  My ratin is 4/5</li>
            <li> I have always suffered from severe acne for years. I would go to the dermatologist multipal times to get it treated and nothing worked until I started using Pronexin. I literally tried everything and this is the only thing that has ever worked for me. I love it. I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle now and it still works wonders. It even makes your face feel fresh and clean all day long. I highly recommend this to someone who has had problems with acne as well as myself.</li>
            <li> Alright, so I have been trying to find a new face soap for the past few months. I never really had acne but my skin is to say the least, very picky. It gets super oily during the day and overnight (even after I scrape all the war paint off from the day), but if I use too strong of a cleanser my face will flake up and get extremely dry, especially in the T zone, and you could practically see my pores near my cheeks from outer space since they were so gross. I have recently switched from one oral contraceptive to another and the hormonal change has been a wreck on my face and I have even more breakouts than ever. I was on the fence about trying this product at first because it claims to clear breakouts in like three days, which is what like every freaking product says it will do, and it is about $25 for one bottle. Being that I am currently a broke nursing student, (which adds to the breakouts because of stress lol) I was hesitant to spend the money on one bottle, but I have wasted away so much cash on other soaps and treatments such as Proactiv (which i actually liked, but they kinda screw you with weird payments and long story short it gets costly). I recently broke down and purchased a bottle after reading some great reviews and figured what else do I have to lose at this point. Soooo turns out this stuff is pretty awesome. It doesn&#x27;t have any crazy chemicals (the Pronexin website has a complete list of ingredients) and has a nice scrubby feeling (due to little broken up walnut shells) so it leaves your skin feeling real soft after using it. It does have a bit of an odd odor to it but nothing too bad (unless my nose has been completely desensitized from nursing school haha). It didn&#x27;t completely get rid of my breakouts after three days, but there was a noticeable difference for sure. I have been using it for a week and there are still some patches of breakouts but they are going away. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my face looks like after a whole bottle! My face got a little bit dry where there were some bad zits, but nothing a little moisturizer couldn&#x27;t handle overnight. I totally recommend this product, even though obviously everyone&#x27;s body is different so it may or not work as awesome on others..but if anyone out there has the same teenage girl issues with their skin I&#x27;d say go for it and make sure you use this product TWICE daily to get the full effect. hope this helps anyone who was debating on whether to try this product or not. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;side note: I am using this product with my Clearsonic Aria, which to those of you that don&#x27;t know is like a little spinning face cleaner thing (I can&#x27;t come up with a better term for it at the moment haha) so I&#x27;m not sure if that makes a huge difference with this, I like to think that it just helps the soap get into the pores and exfoliate more.</li>
            <li> I never had acne as a teenager. It started in my early 20s. I was using Skin ID prior to becoming pregnant but stopped during my pregnancy because my skin was amazing... must have been all those hormones. When I had my baby my face went crazy! Huge clusters of zits, all over. It was awful. I tried to order Skin ID again but they are no longer making it. I was so upset. So I tried Proactive, it only made my acne worse. I threw that crap away and did a TON of research. I ordered this face wash and had it within a few days. I use it every morning in the shower and then once right before bed. I love it. It exfoliates well but not too rough on my skin. Within days I noticed a major difference. Instead of getting 2 pimples a day, I was getting only 2 a week. This is a huge improvement for me. It may seem expensive but you get what you pay for. I tried everything else out there. I also started using a toner with salicylic acid twice a day. Give this product a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice a day every day and still have acne all over my face. I do like the smell and feel of this cleaner. It does make my skin soft. My acne is not full blown and my pimples are not as huge as they used to be but I still have acne all over. This cleanser has helped a bit but not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work at all and actually caused much worse acne than I had originally. I would not suggest this for anyone wanting to rid themselves of mild acne. I wouldn&#x27;t order this product again and wish I hadn&#x27;t in the first place.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash. It has helped my acne.  I still get little breakouts but I would purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product! Not only does it smell HORRIBLE but it made my face break out even more! I used it for a month hoping that I would see improvement with my acne but it only got worst.</li>
            <li> It really works! My face is clear for the first time in years! I have tried everything from soap to proactive and everything in between!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t strong enough for my acne on my face but I use it as body wash now and love  it</li>
            <li> I buy this for my teenage daughter (who&#x27;s almost an adult now) ... and she says she can&#x27;t live without it.  She has struggled with acne since the 4th grade ... this helps her keep it under control.  It arrives super quickly too, which is nice when she runs out and forgets to ask me to reorder it.  The ony reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was I think it&#x27;s just a little pricy - but I&#x27;m willing to pay it if it helps her.</li>
            <li> This definitely did not work for me as i&#x27;d hoped. Living with adult acne often causes me to make impulse purchases of promise products, and i always end up disappointed. I did not return it however because it works great as an exfoliant. I use this in conjunction with about 4 other acne products to keep my acne at least not getting worse. Not going away, but not getting worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased so many different products for my daughter and son and this one has been the best.  Our daughter has been using it for about a month and is thrilled with the results.  So I purchased it for our son and he has been using it for  about a week.  There was a noticeable difference within a few days.  This turned out to be a great purchase!</li>
            <li> This is a great all natural product.  Between the gentle abrasive scrubbies and the moisturizing properties, it leaves my skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first bought this face wash, especially when the site reviews said clear skin in 72 hours or something along those lines. It looks like mud, feels grainy when you&#x27;re scrubbing it in, smells terrible, and while the whole 72 hours thing was complete bull as I expected, it does it&#x27;s job well enough. I bought clean and clear exfoliating scrub the day before, not at all expecting amazon to deliver the pronexin so fast and needed something to keep my face from breaking out horribly while I waited for it to arrive. When it did arrive, I didn&#x27;t wanna let the clean and clear exfoliating scrub go to waste so I&#x27;ve been pairing it with the pronexin. First I wash my face with the clean and clear and then with the pronexin. Now, I&#x27;m not sure if its just the one face wash that works, or the combination of both but my skin has never been more clean and soft. I suffer from mild acne, it gets especially bad when my hormones are going crazy once a month. I&#x27;d get giant cystic zits everywhere that would take a month to disappear on their own and then by then the whole viscous cycle just starts all over again. On top of that, my skin would get really oily and other products just dried out my face and did absolutely nothing for my zits. So far, I haven&#x27;t had any giant or new zits but then again, I&#x27;ve only been using the face washes for a week or two. I&#x27;ll keep using both to see how they hold up against the horror that is my biological functions but so far I&#x27;m liking the results I have now. My skin is soft, clean, and oil free without the terrible drying and peeling other products gave my skin, and the acne marks I had before even cleared up. Anyway, here&#x27;s to hoping this stuff keeps doing an awesome job.</li>
            <li> It took about a week for my daughters face to clear but it definitely made a significant improvement!  Her face is clearing more and more every day! I recommend you try this before any of the more harsh facial products and cleansers or prescription medications.</li>
            <li> I like it as a scrub but it definitely shouldn&#x27;t be used every day. It had helped my acne at first when I washed every day with it but I didn&#x27;t realize that it had actually prevented my skin from getting better later on because exfoliating your skin (which is what this does) every day is not good for your skin and can irritate it. However, when I do use it, it makes my skin feel really soft and not dry at all. It smelled good too. However, it&#x27;s quite expensive. :(</li>
