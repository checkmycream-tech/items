            <li> thank much</li>
            <li> The only criticism I have is that it is a lot smaller on the inside than I expected, so if you need to heat a lot of towels at once, you might buy a larger one.</li>
            <li> Seemed a little loose out of the box, not solid.</li>
            <li> All of my clients say it was money well spent!</li>
