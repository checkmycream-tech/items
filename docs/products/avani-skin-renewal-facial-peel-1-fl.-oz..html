            <li>Does a great job and very gentle.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the renewal peel - it was great.  </li>
            <li>It plumped up my fine lines and evened out my blotchy tone...just one use!</li>
            <li>I bought it on Zulily and it leaves my skin very smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>Skin is very smooth and not irritated.</li>
            <li>This product is safe yet effective and easy to use at home or in the Beauty Salon or spa.</li>
            <li>It helps to keep the wrinkles in my face very light and for the most part un noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Great for large pores and blackheads.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been better or more luminous in appearance.</li>
            <li>Like many others I purchased this product as part of a promotion at Sam&#x27;s Club.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and works great over all parts of the body.</li>
            <li>And my trick is to use it on my brows if I want to encourage hair growth for fuller more youthful brows... or to regrow brows from overplucking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked on this stuff...such a great exfoliation, yet gentle.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff.</li>

            <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I also did the surface test as many reviews stated that the product balled up on surfaces too not just skin.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the product but pump on the product does not work.  </li>
            <li>I have found that I must use it more than once a week.</li>
            <li>However, the container could be made better.</li>
            <li>Best facial peel I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product ever.</li>
            <li>Now I have oily skin, and although I didn&#x27;t apply make-up today, I&#x27;m sure that I still had areas that still had traces.</li>
            <li>Even my son says my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>Some of the reviewers mentioned that the \\&quot;peel\\&quot; was not their skin, and that they could place a dab of the product anywhere and \\&quot;skin\\&quot; would magically appear.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I have to unscrew the top and pour the product in my hand.  </li>
            <li>so I ordered one more for me...</li>
            <li>Maybe there is better stuff</li>
            <li>I also love their citrus vanilla salt scrub for the bath.  </li>
            <li>; treatment:)</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find it here on amazon for a reasonable amount because I will be buying more to ensure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>I use this twice a week to give my skin a refreshing pick me up.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I use a reputable product I buy at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>kinda like it breathes better.</li>
            <li>Can buy better peels at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I applied it twice a week for two weeks and now once a week and the face looks much better at close look.</li>
            <li>I just LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Removes the top layer, but does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>but if you continue to put this on, after a while it doesn&#x27;t flake off any more skin......</li>
            <li>I have finally found my skin care soul mate &lt;3</li>

            <li>when I say, my face has never ever felt as clean as it did after that first application....never!!  </li>
            <li>thought about it, read reviews and decided it was worth the try!</li>
            <li>You will see significant changes.</li>
            <li>I use to use Image C until I saw a significant change on my friends face.</li>
            <li>While it hasn&#x27;t transformed my skin into blemish-free satin, it has dramatically changed the texture of my face and has reduced breakouts significantly.</li>
            <li>When I found it here on Amazon for a fraction of the price I was so excited I bought 2 bottles.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased this product elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It does NOT come off in one peel...which is what I was originally looking for....</li>
            <li>It does NOT come off in one peel...which is what I was originally looking for....</li>
            <li>Thanks for my new beautiful smooth face ;)</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the Facial Peel so far.  </li>
            <li>I got balls between my finger tips bit when I rubbed it on a clean countertop in my bathroom (marble)</li>
            <li>Great item to exfoliate face, elbows or anywhere that get dry.  </li>
            <li>Super quick and easy, painless.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended by a friend, it&#x27;s ok, not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 7 months and first discovered it Hawaii on vacation, but it is much easier being able to buy it from Amazon and is at a much better price.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and glowing; I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments in my life!</li>
            <li>That leads me to believe while it may not work for everyone, it certainly works for most.  </li>
            <li>Found this at sam&#x27;s club at one of those weekend special booths.  </li>
            <li>As I get older I am picky about how I look and more importantly feel.  </li>
            <li>Really works , my face looks better and feels clean..........</li>
            <li>It gives an amazing peeel that makes my skin feel incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I m using d full range of avani products.</li>
            <li>I tried out their theory, and it was true:</li>
            <li>It is much more reasonable here.  </li>
            <li>While this may be true, on your face, where it claims to work, it does.</li>
            <li>I try to use it several times a week on my face then use a good face lotion.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Face feels super fresh and clean...</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just like a super refined version of rubbing elmer&#x27;s glue on your hand: it picks up anything as it&#x27;s rubbed away.</li>
            <li>I hope my next order would be as good as the first,</li>
            <li>This is good stuff, I use it before applying my makeup to remove any dry skin.  </li>
            <li>the first day i received this product i tried it after taking a shower..and WOOWW!</li>
            <li>I am heading back to Sam&#x27;s club to get some more!</li>
            <li>how much i needed it before i tried it because before this i had always thought i had good clear skin, but this stuff showed me how much even softer it could be!</li>
            <li>It was true, it did form balls, however there were much fewer balls (like an 1/8 of the original amount)</li>
            <li>it really does work and gets rid of fine lines and makes your skin smoother.</li>
            <li>The most effective way to get rid of dry skin, removes it in seconds and leave skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It is great for cleaning dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li>The woman selling the product was very pushy and tried selling it to me for $100 (with 2 free gifts).  </li>
            <li>BUT this product makes my skin feel amazing and totally evens out my skin tones!</li>
            <li>I use this product regularly and the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>it into ur face and the dead skin just falls off in balls all over ur sink lol...</li>
            <li>Anyways, it&#x27;s worth the money even if you just use it for your face.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews...</li>
            <li>I put some of the peel on my freshly cleaned bathroom counter and rubbed it wearing a rubber glove.</li>
            <li>I think a soft plastic container that you could squeeze out would be more beneficial</li>
            <li>(nice if only for a couple of days).  </li>
            <li>you can use it more frequently...</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful exfoliate and leaves your skin like a baby&#x27;s behind.  </li>
            <li>I love this product helps to clear and improve the quality of your skin.</li>
            <li>I know for sure the makeup residue is completely gone.</li>
            <li>I love Papaya-Glycolic Gentle Skin Peel by Earth Science which I bought at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I liked this facial peel.</li>
            <li>I love how it removes the old skin and allows my face to breath.</li>
            <li>I have read some of the other reviews and was surprised at how many people loved the product.  </li>
            <li>As an older person, I also note a reduction of fine age lines.</li>
            <li>and it makes your other products go on better and your make-up just looks better.</li>
            <li>I am excited to find this product so reasonably priced here online.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a pretty site in the sink when your doing it, but your skin feels so good afterwards.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in a timely manner, the price was right</li>
            <li>I will be getting married in a few months and have been trying to find great skincare items.  </li>
            <li>it must be doing something to the dry skin because my heals feel and look so much better!  </li>
            <li>this stuff is great and the lil small bottle lasted 3 mths and going.</li>
            <li>The price is right and it gets to me in a few days which is  wonderful because I use the product daily  and tend to panic when I run out of the product.</li>
            <li>But it leaves your face super clean and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>takes so little and lasts a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>When sale&#x27;s promotion girl at Sam&#x27;s first demonstrated product on my wrist</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now and love it.</li>
            <li>and so glad I went back.</li>
            <li>This morning I keep touching my face and my nose, it feels incredibly smooth and soft and I cannot wait for my next application.</li>
            <li>Multiple reviews have experimented with rubbing this product on a counter top</li>
            <li>You can see a difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Just returned from a 3 week motorcycle trip with sun damaged skin and rubbed it on the first day I got home.  </li>
            <li>and I saw results after the first use.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day for the first couple of days, and followed it with the collagen face cream.</li>
            <li>If you like serums, I recommend using the Avani Skin Peel first and then apply the serum.</li>
            <li>I am amazed and glad I went back and purchased it.</li>
            <li>Just kept the watery consistency but just turned a tiny bit more viscous.</li>
            <li>HOW MANY TIMES I REAPPLY, HATS, TOWELS TO COVER MY FACE WHEN POSSIBLE ...</li>
            <li>NOTHING HAS WORKED THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li>I am just starting to get more into skincare than I ever have been.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless of whether I believed it at first, the results speak for themselves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansers, toners, scrubs, lotions, and prescription medications in my almost-thirty years, and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased that&#x27;s given me a tangible result.</li>
            <li>I bought it first in Sams club as a show product, and like it a lot.</li>
            <li>So while I do think the product is made to ball up, you can most definitely tell it&#x27;s not a scam type of product.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth after i use it.  </li>
            <li>used the peel for the first time today...</li>
            <li>I tried this at a friends house and it left my face so smooth I had to get some for myself!  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, there was the &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; sloughing off on rubber gloves!</li>
            <li>I did use it exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>but this peel definitely helps with my breakouts and allows me to have better and smoother skin.</li>
            <li>But, I am now doing better in those areas because of the transformation in my facial skin....not to mention toes and fingers</li>
            <li>But, I am now doing better in those areas because of the transformation in my facial skin....not to mention toes and fingers</li>
            <li>it does exactly what i needed it too</li>
            <li>I really love this facial peel.  </li>
            <li>Okay, enough already.</li>
            <li>and now I am wandering why because it is great or at least this one is.</li>
            <li>Using this makes my skin feel clean immediately, old skin clumps up and rolls off!</li>
            <li>I have tried the facial peel, I thought I was imagining the effects of my new glowing skin until I asked my daughters to try it, then I knew 100 per cent that this product is truly amazing their skins glow</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>a rip-off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[I posted this as a reply to the other 1-star comment, then decided to make it a review of my own.</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled I am looking at trying some of the other Avani product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost in shock over how clean and soft my face is.</li>
            <li>I thought that I would try it on the heals of my feet and was absolutely amazed at how much softer my heals were!  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this as a promotional item at a Sam&#x27;s Club and paid way too much for it</li>
            <li>like I normally do as this was an impulse buy (which is rare for me).</li>
            <li>It evens out your skin, makes it smooth and gave the 50+ yr old a new glow!</li>
            <li>, I love love love this line, you can&#x27;t go wrong with something all naturally based.</li>
            <li>this is easy to use, and is not abrasive at all, leaves a terrific glow to skin and prepares face for any makeup you might want to use.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin with large pores.</li>
            <li>It has helped reduce large pores and make my skin look smoother.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and it has reduced the large pores on my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good product for soft, smooth skin, but it&#x27;s not a good value.  </li>
            <li>your skin feels new and clean very soft</li>
            <li>Really is the safest, easy, cheap price, and u will feel the dead skin fall off in ur sink.</li>
            <li>My own little &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Amazing all the dead skin that comes off in just a week&#x27;s time.  </li>
            <li>V r very pleased.5 star product.</li>
            <li>It was smooth and in 1 use my pores were smaller and almost non existint</li>
            <li>This is much cheaper and faster.  </li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t have to spend so much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care if the gunk that comes off when you use this on your face also shows up on countertops, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This peel is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I was having issues with blackhead on my forehead and nose, and this really helped.</li>
            <li>Cure is acidic and really peels well</li>
            <li>It made my face so much softer and clearer, and the effect lasted for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>The price is so much cheaper on Amazon than any spa or cosmetic store.</li>
            <li>To much work.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t wear make-up on them, it didn&#x27;t really have a job to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so smooth after using it, and it brightens your skin tone (possibly because it helps exfoliate).  </li>
            <li>It is very pricy when bought from Avani or even at Sams when they have a booth there once a year.  </li>
            <li>I checked amazon and the same product (this one) and the moisturizers used, were available for less.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>purchased them and like the feel of this gentle exfoliant and the moisturizer used after it...</li>
            <li>It really does NOTHING for your sking..</li>
            <li>My pores are much smaller now and makeup goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my teenage son&#x27;s skin and it makes the skin smooth.</li>
            <li>The exfoliation is gentle.</li>
            <li>, that is not the whole story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>someone who&#x27;s gone through almost a whole bottle of the stuff</li>
            <li>Really like this product because it really cleans your skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Keeps it looking fresh and young.</li>
            <li>I dont know if it really does peel the skin.</li>
            <li>So much softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really matter to me.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>but you would never know it thanks  to this product,it has refined the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>No matter what beauty products you are currently using you can still fit this one in.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t harsh on your face either, though you can tell some of your skin layers came off, it doesn&#x27;t leave that harsh/rashy/raw kind of feeling</li>
            <li>I use it way more frequently than recommended, like every couple days, and sometimes daily, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It takes considerable more product for the facial peel and the pump mechanism does not work.</li>
            <li>The Amazon product has a high alcohol content, it is so high you can smell it in the product, It does not work near as well as the original product.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I use it along with the other two products (Refreshing Facial Toner and Timeless Advanced Micro-capsule Serum to protect my skin while I am deployed.</li>
            <li>Wow it rub right off.  </li>
            <li>I could practically leave the house again without wearing my normal tinted moisturizer PLUS foundation!</li>
            <li>It removes the entire top layer of dead skin gently and easily.</li>
            <li>this is the best product to get rid of dead cells especially for people who has dry flaky skin.without</li>
            <li>is in my humble opinion a more effective and much less greasy option.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anybody that wants to improve their complexion or hands.</li>
            <li>I use it every few days or when I feel my skin is looking tired and it makes my skin look so fresh and perfect!</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on here about the balls forming no matter what, I decided to try it again the next morning just to see if that was true.</li>
            <li>I was left with a face full of beaded gel.</li>
            <li>so I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon and for less!!  </li>
            <li>As previous posters have pointed out, this starts forming &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; from the moment it touches your face and then leaves an oily residue that also appears to be &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are definitely better options out there.</li>
            <li>Nicely helping to clear the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>I love using this product because you can see results tight away.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and it arrived quickly highly recommend the product and the vendor.</li>
            <li>matters to me is how soft this product makes my face feel and the significant improvement in the appearance of my face (smaller pores and reduced</li>
            <li>There is a little clumping, but there is much more when used on my face.</li>
            <li>have been using it every 5-7 days now for a little more than a month.</li>
            <li>have been using it every 5-7 days now for a little more than a month.</li>
            <li>my fingers/finger tips had major peeling going on when I first used it</li>
            <li>Like a review I read when I first ordered, I thought that the product was balling up giving the Impression of dead skin, but when I tested the product with a clean finger (one that the skin peel was used first to clear dead layers) and applied it to a smooth glass surface, it did NOT ball up!  </li>
            <li>It removes that scaly, filmy feeling when applied onto dry clean skin.</li>
            <li>It really makes me feel soft and pampered.</li>
            <li>instead of sitting on top of dead skin.</li>
            <li>that seemed like 10 minutes because it was SO MUCH FUN to watch THE CHANGE THAT INSTANTLY TOOK PLACE...</li>
            <li>/&gt;All was well until my little black kitty had a tif with the world and became her own version of a whirling dervish and knocked my precious, unused bottle of Facial Peel on the TILE FLOOR</li>
            <li>, the company is trustworthy and I am now obsessed with their products, thank you avani for my new skin and for your great service.</li>
            <li>When I use it more often, I get far less stuff coming off my skin.</li>
            <li>There is another product by Philosophy that really does peel the skin and leave it very soft that I by far prefer.</li>
            <li>( I used the Mineral Enriched Moisturizing Cream right after the Facial Peel).</li>
            <li>I immediately tried it on my face and was surprised at how many little balls rolled up.</li>
            <li>Kind of felt a little like tiny balls or rubber</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and my skin takes a beating from the sun.  </li>
            <li>Now I am stocking up because I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>It makes your face feel like brand new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 39, live in a sunny climate, have some sun damage and my skin looks like it is 20 again.</li>
            <li>I like the new design for dispensing the product.  </li>
            <li>My current bottle is getting empty and I&#x27;m freaking out and need to order more.</li>
            <li>my boyfriend uses it on his rough callused hands along with the salt scrub and the results are incredibly soft and smooth skin</li>
            <li>Having gone to the dead sea where this product was available, the price was a real bargain.  </li>
            <li>This facial peel is super simple to use, gentle on your skin, and leaves your face soft and glowing!</li>
            <li>My daughter has very sensitive skin and this stuff doesn&#x27;t agitate it.</li>
            <li>Love this product but you should only use a little especially on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time last night and this morning my skin looks like it did 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft after using this product!  </li>
            <li>I used the peel and cream for the first time last night</li>
            <li>The improvement was noticeable after the first application but improved with further uses.</li>
            <li>I even applied it on my 58 yr old mom&#x27;s face and she was amazed!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>also bought Avani Dead Sea Innovative Firming Eye Serum and Avani Dead Sea Timeless Advanced Micro-capsule Serum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty gross to see all the gunk roll off as your rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>Well, the tile was not in need of a peel, and the lovely product had sharp shards of glass mixed into it.</li>
            <li>BUT ALWAYS BEFORE I&#x27;M ABOUT TO GO ON A DATE...and lets just say, they always call me back ;)</li>
            <li>it produces these little pieces and this product becomes a very mild scrub.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive and incredibly dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Squeaky clean, I emerged and located my SECOND BOTTLE OF Facial Peel.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 18 months and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to look and feel younger.</li>
            <li>I use this 2-3 times per week and it leaves my skin incredibly soft and new feeling.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling extra soft and extra clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why it got so many negative and snide comments, but I love this peel.</li>
            <li>I have developed rosacea over the past few years and have really struggled to find good skin care products that work to help reduce my symptoms (and the $300 prescription cream my dermatologist prescribed</li>
            <li>skin that was dead was gone and nice pink new skin</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>IT IS NOW CLEAR.  </li>
            <li>It GENTLY peels off your old yucky skin and all the built up dirt instantly.  </li>
            <li>I put it on a dry, clean face, scrub it around, putting extra on the areas that are the flakiest, then rinse off immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also i noticed my acne starting to go away because finally my prescribed facial washes can actually go into my pores and work its magic..</li>
            <li>This facial peel renewal is the real thing.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>I have a grandson that can&#x27;t shed his old skin</li>
            <li>I far prefer the Obey Your Body.  </li>
            <li>I felt like I should have read reviews and gone to the Sephora directly across the way.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and sometimes my face gets a pinkish glow if I leave it on my face too</li>
            <li>It peels all of the old skin off of  your face.</li>
            <li>Use with the Enriched Moisturizer Cream, which helps give your skin that incredibly soft feeling.</li>
            <li>I have recently developed rosacea and a lot of products irritate my already blotchy skin</li>
            <li>Do not use if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use twice a week if you need to.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft after using this product.</li>
            <li>I have rosecea and was surprised to find the chemical peel in this Avani product doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, in fact it helps it.</li>
            <li>Also my skin is brighter and feels extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Not harsh if done the way the directions tell you.</li>
            <li>I could not get all of the product out with the old design.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews, because my face has never looked better since I started using this.</li>
            <li>somebody sells something that really works.i tried it all to have dry/flaky face and this is the only thing that helped.thanks</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this Skin Renewal Facial Peel really works.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the facial peel that really works....</li>
            <li>finally a product that really makes a difference</li>
            <li>I have naturally young-looking skin anyway, and this will help keep it looking that way.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>, people asking me if I had gone on holiday that I looked so alive and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I love the Avani Dead Sae Skin Renewal Facial Peel</li>
            <li>It really sloughs off those dead skin cells, leaving your face looking fresh and radiant.</li>
            <li>but she tested it on my wrists and gave me the full run down.</li>
            <li>You do noticed it after a while you won&#x27;t peel off as much Dead skin as in the beginning.usually I don&#x27;t get excited about a product.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and go most of the winter with dry flaky spots on my face, especially forehead.</li>
            <li>The salts are gentle enough to clean away impurities without stripping your skin raw.</li>
            <li>Meaninging you rub it onto clean skin and dead skin</li>
            <li>Plus, I sometimes would need to use more product on areas where dead skin was lifted, but not completely removed.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised that this did not dry out, irritate, or break out my skin.  </li>
            <li>The catch is that Sam&#x27;s Club only carries the SET occasionally, and that they must be purchased as a SET, so if one runs out, but not the other now they can be purchased separately and with free shipping if the Amazon order is large enough.  </li>
            <li>I had first encountered this product at Sam&#x27;s this lady was testing and it really does peel the skin away slightly and harmlessly!</li>
            <li>I only wish that the refreshing feel that it gives to my face would last a little longer.</li>
            <li>i have extremely sensitive skin that is dry beyond belief-no matter how much i moisturize.</li>
            <li>I came home, read reviews here and figured that more buyers than not loved it so I decided to buy.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li>But this product does exactly what is says it is a non abrasive peel that helps expose pores for a deeper cleaning for the other products you may use to reduce pore size or clear blemishes.</li>
            <li>So of course I could not hardly wait to get home and try it on my face last night.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was not certain what was occurring.</li>
            <li>I hardly use any make up, but this is good skin-cleansing stuff, not too harsh.</li>
            <li>This really works on dry skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any one who wants and extra facial peel.  </li>
            <li>I have ALWAYS had very sensitive skin and regularly break out with psoriasis...</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it was because of an offer at Sam&#x27;s Club and I was instantly hooked because I found it simple to use with instant visible results.  </li>
            <li>I tried the facial peel on my face and when I tried to wipe it off, the peel/dead skin (I question the dead skin part) stuck to the fine facial hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li>it left my face smooth, and dead skin-free!</li>
            <li>I kept thinking maybe I should go for a professional facial.</li>
            <li>(it was similar color to my make up that didn&#x27;t get completely washed off my face).</li>
            <li>I totally believe that it is NOT dead skin coming off at all.  </li>
            <li>Delivery is as expected and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so smooth and pores and imperfections are slowly fading.  </li>
            <li>Whence, I used it according to instruction....and...it would appear that A NEW AND YOUNGER VERSION OF MY FACE was smiling back at me.</li>
            <li>Now that I have used it regularily there is much less exfoliation than the first 2 weeks of use</li>
            <li>For Normal to Dry Skin</li>
            <li>I heard the other people that the sales lady was trying this on saying \\&quot;WOW, Oh my gosh\\&quot;!!!  </li>
            <li>some were negative stating that the gel beads up even if it&#x27;s on a clean surface.  </li>
            <li>It did seem to at least clean my skin somewhat.  </li>
            <li>When using the circular motion with your finger, it really does peel off old layers of dead skin.  </li>
            <li>What seems to happen is that the \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; component of the product gets absorbed into the face and then the supposed dead skin is just whatever&#x27;s left</li>
            <li>Be prepared to be amazed (and a little grossed out because your first application will probably shock you).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle taking the dead skin off.</li>
            <li>I used a pretty heavy cleanser Micro abrasion from Mary Kay and it still did not come off.  </li>
            <li>My lines are not gone but they certainly look softer and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have exceedingly dry skin because I live in the desert, do not drink enough fluids, or eat the correct foods, or use moisturizers as I should.</li>
            <li>I have exceedingly dry skin because I live in the desert, do not drink enough fluids, or eat the correct foods, or use moisturizers as I should.</li>
            <li>I initially got the whole break down from the rep then</li>
            <li>Pleased with the product, I negotiated the price down to $30 and received the single dead sea facial peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used a little drop of this serum on my dry skin and rubbed it until the top layer of my dead skin was gone.  </li>
            <li>It took a dry old face and made it look years younger in one try.  </li>
            <li>I decided to just discard the whole mess and went for gloves and dustpan along with short broom.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s easier to use than a facial scrub because you can apply it on dry skin, peel off the dead skin, moisturize fresh skin and go.</li>
            <li>Before you start rubbing this product on your skin you will already have little pieces of what looks like skin but is really something else.</li>
            <li>While this stuff does, indeed, create little flakes of itself no matter what you roll it on (much like glue)</li>

            <li> it is so worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I knew I should be sqeaky clean before using this on my face as the instructions...which I DID READ...said it worked best on a clean face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> An excellent product, works really well for exfoliating the skin, better than anything a physician could prescribe.</li>

            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE Avani products!</li>
            <li> Does a great job and very gentle.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the renewal peel - it was great.  </li>
            <li> It plumped up my fine lines and evened out my blotchy tone...just one use!</li>
            <li> I bought it on Zulily and it leaves my skin very smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> Skin is very smooth and not irritated.</li>
            <li> This product is safe yet effective and easy to use at home or in the Beauty Salon or spa.</li>
            <li> It helps to keep the wrinkles in my face very light and for the most part un noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Great for large pores and blackheads.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been better or more luminous in appearance.</li>
            <li> Like many others I purchased this product as part of a promotion at Sam&#x27;s Club.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and works great over all parts of the body.</li>
            <li> And my trick is to use it on my brows if I want to encourage hair growth for fuller more youthful brows... or to regrow brows from overplucking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this stuff...such a great exfoliation, yet gentle.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;</li>
            <li> This product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I have gifted it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> This only made me look and feel wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Love this product line.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Just be sure NOT to use it more than once a week.</li>
            <li> Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I also did the surface test as many reviews stated that the product balled up on surfaces too not just skin.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love the lotion.</li>
            <li> I love the product but pump on the product does not work.  </li>
            <li> I have found that I must use it more than once a week.</li>
            <li> However, the container could be made better.</li>
            <li> Best facial peel I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product ever.</li>
            <li> Now I have oily skin, and although I didn&#x27;t apply make-up today, I&#x27;m sure that I still had areas that still had traces.</li>
            <li> Even my son says my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviewers mentioned that the \\&quot;peel\\&quot; was not their skin, and that they could place a dab of the product anywhere and \\&quot;skin\\&quot; would magically appear.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I have to unscrew the top and pour the product in my hand.  </li>
            <li> so I ordered one more for me...</li>
            <li> Maybe there is better stuff</li>
            <li> I also love their citrus vanilla salt scrub for the bath.  </li>
            <li> ; treatment:)</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find it here on amazon for a reasonable amount because I will be buying more to ensure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a week to give my skin a refreshing pick me up.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I use a reputable product I buy at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> kinda like it breathes better.</li>
            <li> Can buy better peels at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I applied it twice a week for two weeks and now once a week and the face looks much better at close look.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Removes the top layer, but does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> but if you continue to put this on, after a while it doesn&#x27;t flake off any more skin......</li>
            <li> I have finally found my skin care soul mate &lt;3</li>
            <li> used it before and love the product</li>
            <li> I love the feel of my skin after using it feels like going to the spa.  </li>

            <li> I like this much better than using grains, seems like a better exfolication.</li>
            <li> All Avani products have more than met my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Have used this product before and love it.</li>
            <li> I got a much better deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> so I will have to buy more.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> wherever I could safely put product that had no shards in it.</li>
            <li> My skin is better everywhere.</li>
            <li> My skin is better everywhere.</li>

            <li> I love the way this product makes my face feel after I use it.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to use and buy more.</li>
            <li> Avani is the the best sea skin renewal facial peel.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I still love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> and my skin has had many compliments</li>
            <li> I LOVE AVANI</li>
            <li> I went back to buy more and the store was out!!!</li>
            <li> it was a great price and very quick and fast</li>
            <li> From the first day I used this product, I noticed that my skin looked refreshed and bright.</li>
            <li> My face has never been this soft before and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I feel as though it really exfoliates my skin good.  </li>
            <li> This was a perfect cleanser and all other products are real worth.</li>
            <li> Not too strong.</li>
            <li> Super lucky.. ahhhhh!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product today more out of curiosity than true belief.</li>
            <li> and my skin is remarkable soft and supple and my pores are virtually invisible</li>
            <li> Fine lines are gone.</li>
            <li> , the cost is much less if you order it from Amazon, and their service is great!</li>
            <li> Its fine.</li>
            <li> After one time, my dry skin was gone, my skin looked great and healthy.</li>
            <li> After this one use, I can see how much more clear &amp; smooth my face is...seriously!!</li>
            <li> On 3rd bottle love love and love!</li>
            <li> do yourself a HUGE FAVOR and try it for awhile.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product 3 times now and see a HUGE difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> Amazing how much difference I see and feel in my skin.</li>
            <li> After using this product each time, I have \\&quot;baby\\&quot; smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> She started by placing a dollop of the gel on my arm, let it sit for a moment, and then started lightly rubbing my arm with a cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> it leaves my skin feeling smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many as well as being economical.  </li>
            <li> Lol I hope im not the only one.</li>
            <li> SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> My skin become smooth and brighter.</li>
            <li> My skin was fairly smooth before I used this.</li>
            <li> No pain, no burning, just smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to waste a ton of time or cash - it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I too was conned into buying it in BJs club at a &#x27;fantastic discount&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Love how you can see it working and the fresh feel to my skin.</li>
            <li> I had tried this product at a store demonstration and loved how soft it made my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this  in a Sam&#x27;s store, loved the way it made my skin feel,so clean and soft, so I went online and reordered.</li>
            <li> my skin in beautiful, smooth and all the rough parts are gone...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very gentle and has no scent, which I love.</li>
            <li> when I say, my face has never ever felt as clean as it did after that first application....never!!  </li>
            <li> thought about it, read reviews and decided it was worth the try!</li>
            <li> You will see significant changes.</li>
            <li> I use to use Image C until I saw a significant change on my friends face.</li>
            <li> While it hasn&#x27;t transformed my skin into blemish-free satin, it has dramatically changed the texture of my face and has reduced breakouts significantly.</li>
            <li> When I found it here on Amazon for a fraction of the price I was so excited I bought 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased this product elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It does NOT come off in one peel...which is what I was originally looking for....</li>
            <li> It does NOT come off in one peel...which is what I was originally looking for....</li>
            <li> Thanks for my new beautiful smooth face ;)</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Facial Peel so far.  </li>
            <li> I got balls between my finger tips bit when I rubbed it on a clean countertop in my bathroom (marble)</li>
            <li> Great item to exfoliate face, elbows or anywhere that get dry.  </li>
            <li> Super quick and easy, painless.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend, it&#x27;s ok, not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 7 months and first discovered it Hawaii on vacation, but it is much easier being able to buy it from Amazon and is at a much better price.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and glowing; I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments in my life!</li>
            <li> That leads me to believe while it may not work for everyone, it certainly works for most.  </li>
            <li> Found this at sam&#x27;s club at one of those weekend special booths.  </li>
            <li> As I get older I am picky about how I look and more importantly feel.  </li>
            <li> Really works , my face looks better and feels clean..........</li>
            <li> It gives an amazing peeel that makes my skin feel incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I m using d full range of avani products.</li>
            <li> I tried out their theory, and it was true:</li>
            <li> It is much more reasonable here.  </li>
            <li> While this may be true, on your face, where it claims to work, it does.</li>
            <li> I try to use it several times a week on my face then use a good face lotion.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Face feels super fresh and clean...</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just like a super refined version of rubbing elmer&#x27;s glue on your hand: it picks up anything as it&#x27;s rubbed away.</li>
            <li> I hope my next order would be as good as the first,</li>
            <li> This is good stuff, I use it before applying my makeup to remove any dry skin.  </li>
            <li> the first day i received this product i tried it after taking a shower..and WOOWW!</li>
            <li> I am heading back to Sam&#x27;s club to get some more!</li>
            <li> how much i needed it before i tried it because before this i had always thought i had good clear skin, but this stuff showed me how much even softer it could be!</li>
            <li> It was true, it did form balls, however there were much fewer balls (like an 1/8 of the original amount)</li>
            <li> it really does work and gets rid of fine lines and makes your skin smoother.</li>
            <li> The most effective way to get rid of dry skin, removes it in seconds and leave skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It is great for cleaning dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> The woman selling the product was very pushy and tried selling it to me for $100 (with 2 free gifts).  </li>
            <li> BUT this product makes my skin feel amazing and totally evens out my skin tones!</li>
            <li> I use this product regularly and the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li> it into ur face and the dead skin just falls off in balls all over ur sink lol...</li>
            <li> Anyways, it&#x27;s worth the money even if you just use it for your face.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews...</li>
            <li> I put some of the peel on my freshly cleaned bathroom counter and rubbed it wearing a rubber glove.</li>
            <li> I think a soft plastic container that you could squeeze out would be more beneficial</li>
            <li> (nice if only for a couple of days).  </li>
            <li> you can use it more frequently...</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful exfoliate and leaves your skin like a baby&#x27;s behind.  </li>
            <li> I love this product helps to clear and improve the quality of your skin.</li>
            <li> I know for sure the makeup residue is completely gone.</li>
            <li> I love Papaya-Glycolic Gentle Skin Peel by Earth Science which I bought at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I liked this facial peel.</li>
            <li> I love how it removes the old skin and allows my face to breath.</li>
            <li> I have read some of the other reviews and was surprised at how many people loved the product.  </li>
            <li> As an older person, I also note a reduction of fine age lines.</li>
            <li> and it makes your other products go on better and your make-up just looks better.</li>
            <li> I am excited to find this product so reasonably priced here online.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a pretty site in the sink when your doing it, but your skin feels so good afterwards.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely manner, the price was right</li>
            <li> I will be getting married in a few months and have been trying to find great skincare items.  </li>
            <li> it must be doing something to the dry skin because my heals feel and look so much better!  </li>
            <li> this stuff is great and the lil small bottle lasted 3 mths and going.</li>
            <li> The price is right and it gets to me in a few days which is  wonderful because I use the product daily  and tend to panic when I run out of the product.</li>
            <li> But it leaves your face super clean and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> takes so little and lasts a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> When sale&#x27;s promotion girl at Sam&#x27;s first demonstrated product on my wrist</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now and love it.</li>
            <li> and so glad I went back.</li>
            <li> This morning I keep touching my face and my nose, it feels incredibly smooth and soft and I cannot wait for my next application.</li>
            <li> Multiple reviews have experimented with rubbing this product on a counter top</li>
            <li> You can see a difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li> Just returned from a 3 week motorcycle trip with sun damaged skin and rubbed it on the first day I got home.  </li>
            <li> and I saw results after the first use.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day for the first couple of days, and followed it with the collagen face cream.</li>
            <li> If you like serums, I recommend using the Avani Skin Peel first and then apply the serum.</li>
            <li> I am amazed and glad I went back and purchased it.</li>
            <li> Just kept the watery consistency but just turned a tiny bit more viscous.</li>
            <li> HOW MANY TIMES I REAPPLY, HATS, TOWELS TO COVER MY FACE WHEN POSSIBLE ...</li>
            <li> NOTHING HAS WORKED THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li> I am just starting to get more into skincare than I ever have been.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless of whether I believed it at first, the results speak for themselves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansers, toners, scrubs, lotions, and prescription medications in my almost-thirty years, and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased that&#x27;s given me a tangible result.</li>
            <li> I bought it first in Sams club as a show product, and like it a lot.</li>
            <li> So while I do think the product is made to ball up, you can most definitely tell it&#x27;s not a scam type of product.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth after i use it.  </li>
            <li> used the peel for the first time today...</li>
            <li> I tried this at a friends house and it left my face so smooth I had to get some for myself!  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, there was the &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; sloughing off on rubber gloves!</li>
            <li> I did use it exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> but this peel definitely helps with my breakouts and allows me to have better and smoother skin.</li>
            <li> But, I am now doing better in those areas because of the transformation in my facial skin....not to mention toes and fingers</li>
            <li> But, I am now doing better in those areas because of the transformation in my facial skin....not to mention toes and fingers</li>
            <li> it does exactly what i needed it too</li>
            <li> I really love this facial peel.  </li>
            <li> Okay, enough already.</li>
            <li> and now I am wandering why because it is great or at least this one is.</li>
            <li> Using this makes my skin feel clean immediately, old skin clumps up and rolls off!</li>
            <li> I have tried the facial peel, I thought I was imagining the effects of my new glowing skin until I asked my daughters to try it, then I knew 100 per cent that this product is truly amazing their skins glow</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> a rip-off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[I posted this as a reply to the other 1-star comment, then decided to make it a review of my own.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled I am looking at trying some of the other Avani product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost in shock over how clean and soft my face is.</li>
            <li> I thought that I would try it on the heals of my feet and was absolutely amazed at how much softer my heals were!  </li>
            <li> I first purchased this as a promotional item at a Sam&#x27;s Club and paid way too much for it</li>
            <li> like I normally do as this was an impulse buy (which is rare for me).</li>
            <li> It evens out your skin, makes it smooth and gave the 50+ yr old a new glow!</li>
            <li> , I love love love this line, you can&#x27;t go wrong with something all naturally based.</li>
            <li> this is easy to use, and is not abrasive at all, leaves a terrific glow to skin and prepares face for any makeup you might want to use.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with large pores.</li>
            <li> It has helped reduce large pores and make my skin look smoother.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and it has reduced the large pores on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product for soft, smooth skin, but it&#x27;s not a good value.  </li>
            <li> your skin feels new and clean very soft</li>
            <li> Really is the safest, easy, cheap price, and u will feel the dead skin fall off in ur sink.</li>
            <li> My own little &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Amazing all the dead skin that comes off in just a week&#x27;s time.  </li>
            <li> V r very pleased.5 star product.</li>
            <li> It was smooth and in 1 use my pores were smaller and almost non existint</li>
            <li> This is much cheaper and faster.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have to spend so much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care if the gunk that comes off when you use this on your face also shows up on countertops, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This peel is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I was having issues with blackhead on my forehead and nose, and this really helped.</li>
            <li> Cure is acidic and really peels well</li>
            <li> It made my face so much softer and clearer, and the effect lasted for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> The price is so much cheaper on Amazon than any spa or cosmetic store.</li>
            <li> To much work.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t wear make-up on them, it didn&#x27;t really have a job to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so smooth after using it, and it brightens your skin tone (possibly because it helps exfoliate).  </li>
            <li> It is very pricy when bought from Avani or even at Sams when they have a booth there once a year.  </li>
            <li> I checked amazon and the same product (this one) and the moisturizers used, were available for less.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> purchased them and like the feel of this gentle exfoliant and the moisturizer used after it...</li>
            <li> It really does NOTHING for your sking..</li>
            <li> My pores are much smaller now and makeup goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my teenage son&#x27;s skin and it makes the skin smooth.</li>
            <li> The exfoliation is gentle.</li>
            <li> , that is not the whole story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> someone who&#x27;s gone through almost a whole bottle of the stuff</li>
            <li> Really like this product because it really cleans your skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Keeps it looking fresh and young.</li>
            <li> I dont know if it really does peel the skin.</li>
            <li> So much softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really matter to me.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> but you would never know it thanks  to this product,it has refined the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> No matter what beauty products you are currently using you can still fit this one in.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t harsh on your face either, though you can tell some of your skin layers came off, it doesn&#x27;t leave that harsh/rashy/raw kind of feeling</li>
            <li> I use it way more frequently than recommended, like every couple days, and sometimes daily, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It takes considerable more product for the facial peel and the pump mechanism does not work.</li>
            <li> The Amazon product has a high alcohol content, it is so high you can smell it in the product, It does not work near as well as the original product.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I use it along with the other two products (Refreshing Facial Toner and Timeless Advanced Micro-capsule Serum to protect my skin while I am deployed.</li>
            <li> Wow it rub right off.  </li>
            <li> I could practically leave the house again without wearing my normal tinted moisturizer PLUS foundation!</li>
            <li> It removes the entire top layer of dead skin gently and easily.</li>
            <li> this is the best product to get rid of dead cells especially for people who has dry flaky skin.without</li>
            <li> is in my humble opinion a more effective and much less greasy option.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anybody that wants to improve their complexion or hands.</li>
            <li> I use it every few days or when I feel my skin is looking tired and it makes my skin look so fresh and perfect!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on here about the balls forming no matter what, I decided to try it again the next morning just to see if that was true.</li>
            <li> I was left with a face full of beaded gel.</li>
            <li> so I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon and for less!!  </li>
            <li> As previous posters have pointed out, this starts forming &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; from the moment it touches your face and then leaves an oily residue that also appears to be &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are definitely better options out there.</li>
            <li> Nicely helping to clear the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I love using this product because you can see results tight away.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and it arrived quickly highly recommend the product and the vendor.</li>
            <li> matters to me is how soft this product makes my face feel and the significant improvement in the appearance of my face (smaller pores and reduced</li>
            <li> There is a little clumping, but there is much more when used on my face.</li>
            <li> have been using it every 5-7 days now for a little more than a month.</li>
            <li> have been using it every 5-7 days now for a little more than a month.</li>
            <li> my fingers/finger tips had major peeling going on when I first used it</li>
            <li> Like a review I read when I first ordered, I thought that the product was balling up giving the Impression of dead skin, but when I tested the product with a clean finger (one that the skin peel was used first to clear dead layers) and applied it to a smooth glass surface, it did NOT ball up!  </li>
            <li> It removes that scaly, filmy feeling when applied onto dry clean skin.</li>
            <li> It really makes me feel soft and pampered.</li>
            <li> instead of sitting on top of dead skin.</li>
            <li> that seemed like 10 minutes because it was SO MUCH FUN to watch THE CHANGE THAT INSTANTLY TOOK PLACE...</li>
            <li> /&gt;All was well until my little black kitty had a tif with the world and became her own version of a whirling dervish and knocked my precious, unused bottle of Facial Peel on the TILE FLOOR</li>
            <li> , the company is trustworthy and I am now obsessed with their products, thank you avani for my new skin and for your great service.</li>
            <li> When I use it more often, I get far less stuff coming off my skin.</li>
            <li> There is another product by Philosophy that really does peel the skin and leave it very soft that I by far prefer.</li>
            <li> ( I used the Mineral Enriched Moisturizing Cream right after the Facial Peel).</li>
            <li> I immediately tried it on my face and was surprised at how many little balls rolled up.</li>
            <li> Kind of felt a little like tiny balls or rubber</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and my skin takes a beating from the sun.  </li>
            <li> Now I am stocking up because I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> It makes your face feel like brand new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39, live in a sunny climate, have some sun damage and my skin looks like it is 20 again.</li>
            <li> I like the new design for dispensing the product.  </li>
            <li> My current bottle is getting empty and I&#x27;m freaking out and need to order more.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend uses it on his rough callused hands along with the salt scrub and the results are incredibly soft and smooth skin</li>
            <li> Having gone to the dead sea where this product was available, the price was a real bargain.  </li>
            <li> This facial peel is super simple to use, gentle on your skin, and leaves your face soft and glowing!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin and this stuff doesn&#x27;t agitate it.</li>
            <li> Love this product but you should only use a little especially on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time last night and this morning my skin looks like it did 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft after using this product!  </li>
            <li> I used the peel and cream for the first time last night</li>
            <li> The improvement was noticeable after the first application but improved with further uses.</li>
            <li> I even applied it on my 58 yr old mom&#x27;s face and she was amazed!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> also bought Avani Dead Sea Innovative Firming Eye Serum and Avani Dead Sea Timeless Advanced Micro-capsule Serum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty gross to see all the gunk roll off as your rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> Well, the tile was not in need of a peel, and the lovely product had sharp shards of glass mixed into it.</li>
            <li> BUT ALWAYS BEFORE I&#x27;M ABOUT TO GO ON A DATE...and lets just say, they always call me back ;)</li>
            <li> it produces these little pieces and this product becomes a very mild scrub.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive and incredibly dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Squeaky clean, I emerged and located my SECOND BOTTLE OF Facial Peel.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 18 months and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> I use this 2-3 times per week and it leaves my skin incredibly soft and new feeling.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling extra soft and extra clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it got so many negative and snide comments, but I love this peel.</li>
            <li> I have developed rosacea over the past few years and have really struggled to find good skin care products that work to help reduce my symptoms (and the $300 prescription cream my dermatologist prescribed</li>
            <li> skin that was dead was gone and nice pink new skin</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> IT IS NOW CLEAR.  </li>
            <li> It GENTLY peels off your old yucky skin and all the built up dirt instantly.  </li>
            <li> I put it on a dry, clean face, scrub it around, putting extra on the areas that are the flakiest, then rinse off immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also i noticed my acne starting to go away because finally my prescribed facial washes can actually go into my pores and work its magic..</li>
            <li> This facial peel renewal is the real thing.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> I have a grandson that can&#x27;t shed his old skin</li>
            <li> I far prefer the Obey Your Body.  </li>
            <li> I felt like I should have read reviews and gone to the Sephora directly across the way.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and sometimes my face gets a pinkish glow if I leave it on my face too</li>
            <li> It peels all of the old skin off of  your face.</li>
            <li> Use with the Enriched Moisturizer Cream, which helps give your skin that incredibly soft feeling.</li>
            <li> I have recently developed rosacea and a lot of products irritate my already blotchy skin</li>
            <li> Do not use if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use twice a week if you need to.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after using this product.</li>
            <li> I have rosecea and was surprised to find the chemical peel in this Avani product doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, in fact it helps it.</li>
            <li> Also my skin is brighter and feels extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Not harsh if done the way the directions tell you.</li>
            <li> I could not get all of the product out with the old design.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews, because my face has never looked better since I started using this.</li>
            <li> somebody sells something that really works.i tried it all to have dry/flaky face and this is the only thing that helped.thanks</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this Skin Renewal Facial Peel really works.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the facial peel that really works....</li>
            <li> finally a product that really makes a difference</li>
            <li> I have naturally young-looking skin anyway, and this will help keep it looking that way.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> , people asking me if I had gone on holiday that I looked so alive and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love the Avani Dead Sae Skin Renewal Facial Peel</li>
            <li> It really sloughs off those dead skin cells, leaving your face looking fresh and radiant.</li>
            <li> but she tested it on my wrists and gave me the full run down.</li>
            <li> You do noticed it after a while you won&#x27;t peel off as much Dead skin as in the beginning.usually I don&#x27;t get excited about a product.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and go most of the winter with dry flaky spots on my face, especially forehead.</li>
            <li> The salts are gentle enough to clean away impurities without stripping your skin raw.</li>
            <li> Meaninging you rub it onto clean skin and dead skin</li>
            <li> Plus, I sometimes would need to use more product on areas where dead skin was lifted, but not completely removed.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that this did not dry out, irritate, or break out my skin.  </li>
            <li> The catch is that Sam&#x27;s Club only carries the SET occasionally, and that they must be purchased as a SET, so if one runs out, but not the other now they can be purchased separately and with free shipping if the Amazon order is large enough.  </li>
            <li> I had first encountered this product at Sam&#x27;s this lady was testing and it really does peel the skin away slightly and harmlessly!</li>
            <li> I only wish that the refreshing feel that it gives to my face would last a little longer.</li>
            <li> i have extremely sensitive skin that is dry beyond belief-no matter how much i moisturize.</li>
            <li> I came home, read reviews here and figured that more buyers than not loved it so I decided to buy.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> But this product does exactly what is says it is a non abrasive peel that helps expose pores for a deeper cleaning for the other products you may use to reduce pore size or clear blemishes.</li>
            <li> So of course I could not hardly wait to get home and try it on my face last night.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was not certain what was occurring.</li>
            <li> I hardly use any make up, but this is good skin-cleansing stuff, not too harsh.</li>
            <li> This really works on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any one who wants and extra facial peel.  </li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS had very sensitive skin and regularly break out with psoriasis...</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it was because of an offer at Sam&#x27;s Club and I was instantly hooked because I found it simple to use with instant visible results.  </li>
            <li> I tried the facial peel on my face and when I tried to wipe it off, the peel/dead skin (I question the dead skin part) stuck to the fine facial hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li> it left my face smooth, and dead skin-free!</li>
            <li> I kept thinking maybe I should go for a professional facial.</li>
            <li> (it was similar color to my make up that didn&#x27;t get completely washed off my face).</li>
            <li> I totally believe that it is NOT dead skin coming off at all.  </li>
            <li> Delivery is as expected and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so smooth and pores and imperfections are slowly fading.  </li>
            <li> Whence, I used it according to instruction....and...it would appear that A NEW AND YOUNGER VERSION OF MY FACE was smiling back at me.</li>
            <li> Now that I have used it regularily there is much less exfoliation than the first 2 weeks of use</li>
            <li> For Normal to Dry Skin</li>
            <li> I heard the other people that the sales lady was trying this on saying \\&quot;WOW, Oh my gosh\\&quot;!!!  </li>
            <li> some were negative stating that the gel beads up even if it&#x27;s on a clean surface.  </li>
            <li> It did seem to at least clean my skin somewhat.  </li>
            <li> When using the circular motion with your finger, it really does peel off old layers of dead skin.  </li>
            <li> What seems to happen is that the \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; component of the product gets absorbed into the face and then the supposed dead skin is just whatever&#x27;s left</li>
            <li> Be prepared to be amazed (and a little grossed out because your first application will probably shock you).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle taking the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> I used a pretty heavy cleanser Micro abrasion from Mary Kay and it still did not come off.  </li>
            <li> My lines are not gone but they certainly look softer and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have exceedingly dry skin because I live in the desert, do not drink enough fluids, or eat the correct foods, or use moisturizers as I should.</li>
            <li> I have exceedingly dry skin because I live in the desert, do not drink enough fluids, or eat the correct foods, or use moisturizers as I should.</li>
            <li> I initially got the whole break down from the rep then</li>
            <li> Pleased with the product, I negotiated the price down to $30 and received the single dead sea facial peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used a little drop of this serum on my dry skin and rubbed it until the top layer of my dead skin was gone.  </li>
            <li> It took a dry old face and made it look years younger in one try.  </li>
            <li> I decided to just discard the whole mess and went for gloves and dustpan along with short broom.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s easier to use than a facial scrub because you can apply it on dry skin, peel off the dead skin, moisturize fresh skin and go.</li>
            <li> Before you start rubbing this product on your skin you will already have little pieces of what looks like skin but is really something else.</li>
            <li> While this stuff does, indeed, create little flakes of itself no matter what you roll it on (much like glue)</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on other products.</li>
            <li> I doubt highly that they actually use salt from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> but it really is, as my husband who is a chemist said, just a chemical reaction that does very little for your skin.</li>
            <li> This product does truly remove dead skin cells, leaves skin soft and smoother than any other product, and I now don&#x27;t want to live without it.  </li>
            <li> I read reviews about it balling up on flat surfaces</li>
            <li> I am not 100% sold on the fact that the &amp;#34;goo balls&amp;#34; that form when you rub it into your face are REALLY dry skin though, which is why I only gave it 4 of 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> now common sense would tell you if that much skin came off than I should have been red or somewhat sore.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my heels and the dead skin just flaked off and left skin soft again.</li>
            <li> It helps with acne because it keeps the dead skin clear from pores!</li>
            <li> It removes all of your dead skin and makes you face so soft!</li>
            <li> I am so excited that I don&#x27;t have to pay the outrageous prices at the mall anymore for one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> The two pump actions I ordered arrived far earlier than expected and other than the boxes being kinda crushed and mishandled looking,</li>
            <li> You use the Skin Peel at least 2-3 times as much as the Moisturizer Cream though just to give people a heads up.</li>
            <li> Natural Cure Aqua, Aviani Dead Sea, and Obey Your Body).  </li>
            <li> A few years ago, I developed Seb Derm on my face.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S STAYED ON FOR THE LONG HALL ....</li>
            <li> I am a) a total skeptic about bogus marketing and b) an acne sufferer who has spent untold amounts of money trying to deal with my skin.</li>
            <li> , I suggest that maybe you might be leaving it on too long or something.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and just peels the dead skin for soft skin and then apply moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I was curious snd rubbed on a cardboardbox, mirror, counter and had same effect.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not supposed to use it around your eyes, but I find no sensitivity issues (I just don&#x27;t leave it on for long).</li>
            <li> You can use it anywhere to get that dead skin off and it makes your skin feel soft after.</li>
            <li> I have always had to use Almay or Clinique for sensitive pale skin.</li>
            <li> I actually decided to try it again about 2 weeks later, thinking maybe my face had been wet or some other &#x27;user&#x27; error.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the store only carries it at certain times, so I went to Amazon and found the same product for far less.  </li>
            <li> I will use this product as long as the sell it!</li>
            <li> I saw some other reviews that say they don&#x27;t feel this product works and that the product is only balling up.</li>
            <li> I have been experiencing some issues with my skin getting blotchy and it&#x27;s simply changing due to hormonal imbalances.  </li>
            <li> whereupon the bottle broke scattering sharp glass in all directions while leaving a residue of Facial Peel on the tile.</li>
            <li> 90% of the redness is gone and the dry skin/scaliness is also gone.</li>
            <li> The scrubs dry me out.  </li>
            <li> must just dry it up and it becomes skin like.  </li>
            <li> and it did dry out the product.  </li>
            <li> I tried it as I did have dry patches of skin.  </li>
            <li> if you are have dry skin problems on your face.</li>
            <li> but that may be because my skin is just too dry...</li>
            <li> if you are have dry skin problems on your face.</li>
            <li> but that may be because my skin is just too dry...</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of the Avani Dead Sea Skin Renewal Facial Peel.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is, the last time I ordered a few bottles, one of them i received the pump didnt work, so I had to take of the lid every time I used the product.  </li>
            <li> Well, like many others I am skeptical if all of those balls on my face are actually dead skin coming off....</li>
            <li> I also feel like I have less clogged pores and minor acne since using this regularly.</li>
            <li> the big name beauty lines) and retina products from my Dr., hands down..</li>
            <li> I have small dry patches all over my skin, and this is the only product I have found that actually removes them.  </li>
            <li> The women at work, some half my age, noticed the difference in my skin and were keen on knowing what I was doing to accomplish such a change.</li>
            <li> But, I will keep using it on my face and neck to help prevent pimples as well as white and black heads (even at 50 and post menopause).</li>
            <li> I just used the facial peel for the first time with some disturbing results.</li>
            <li> I then thought that I would try it on my arms and hands (both of which are very dry.</li>
            <li> I like how it turns into little hard ball-like substances that really cleanses the pores deep down.  </li>
            <li> The next day, however, I used it again (just to test this exact thing), and the results were much less dramatic.</li>
            <li> though I don&#x27;t look it, I was starting to see little signs of aging.  </li>
            <li> and as he rubbed it the same little clumps formed.  </li>
            <li> I spent AU$40 yesterday and bought this product.</li>
            <li> When I rubbed it off, the same dead skin looking gunk</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> -- I already wash it carefully anyway.  </li>
            <li> it is a tad expensive but so worth it.</li>
            <li> It came in on time and was all that was expected.</li>
            <li> It leaves quite a bit of product when it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> , I started to carefully mop the product up with some wipes.</li>
            <li> I must have spent two hours....</li>
            <li> The idea is too look nicer and get rid of dead facial skin.</li>
            <li> The idea is too look nicer and get rid of dead facial skin.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t help that I have rough hands.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll probably reduce when it&#x27;s less dry out.</li>
            <li> then some skin getting a little dry which I expected.  </li>
            <li> And reasonable...a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way to ridding your skin of the day to day &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I was still getting little white dabs of supposed skin - not true as I then rubbed it into the box</li>
            <li> Could have bought it at Amazon at the same &#x27;discount&#x27; or cheaper, and returned it when it failed to live up to its boasts.  </li>
            <li> So simple, just rub it in circles on your face and watch the dead skin fall away!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> other</li>
            <li> I bought it to help minimize small lines, but my teen daughter uses it too.</li>
            <li> Use once every weekend or every other weekend.</li>
            <li> I use every other weekend.</li>
            <li> some of the other skin peels leave you</li>
            <li> Regardless of other reviews where they say it balls up on countertops, plates, over, etc.</li>
            <li> Unsatisfied customers were talking about how they tried the peel on other surfaces and it still created the &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have tried lots of exfoliators and other scrub products, but this stuff beats them all hands</li>
            <li> and I can wash my face and scrub it with other cleaners and a wash cloth and then use this on it and</li>
            <li> The next thing I knew, I was like a small child...trying dips and dabs of product on my toes, my knees,</li>
            <li> put a little on my bathroom counter and let it dry.</li>
            <li> Normally I am not one to listen to any sales pitches...not even a little bit as sales people annoy the heck out of me.  </li>
            <li> I was having a lot of trouble with dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> The skin only partially rinsed odd and now my face is left with hard little balls of dead skin stuck to it and feels like sandpaper!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the last 1/4 of the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> If you rub this stuff on a hard surface you will get the same type of pieces.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth</li>
            <li> Was ripped off and not worth it.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the pump mechanism.  </li>
            <li> So yes, a gluey aftermath will form if you rub it together, but for me, my skin still feels extremely soft whenever I use it.  </li>
            <li> However this is not very important.</li>
            <li> It takes me fives minutes of turning the bottle upside down and taping it on something to get the inside out.  </li>
            <li> I usually try to stay away from anything expensive (my money is not my money, after all; it&#x27;s God&#x27;s), but when my dad offered to buy this for me as an early Christmas gift, I finally relented.</li>
            <li> However, it is little expensive but on Amazon it is priced well if you anyone wants to try it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I have purchased 6 bottles (a few as gifts) and half of them the pump didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> set you get at SAMs is less than the price of one product at the department stores.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s only been one use, I feel this product seriously made a difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on just half my face</li>
            <li> However, that&#x27;s not true.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I took note of the time, cleaned up the mess and hopped into the shower.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I received this as part of a gift set, and was sure that it was a rip-off.</li>
            <li> I could tell however there  was some dead skin in the balls just much less than before.</li>
            <li> It forms tangible little &#x27;balls&#x27; of skin.  </li>
            <li> But little pricey.</li>
            <li> I also got the little balls of rubber cement stuck to the little hairs on the side of my face as well.  </li>
            <li> It is little balls of rubber cement.....</li>
            <li> I see no difference, but maybe it makes my face a little cleaner</li>
            <li> So I tried a little experiment.</li>
            <li> have only used twice, not very impressed.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer isnt greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> Try the Dead Sea salt.</li>
            <li> def gets the dead skin off...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the amount of dead skin it removes.</li>
            <li> I bought this in a kit with the Avani Dead Sea Mineral Enriched Moisturizing Cream -</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like getting all the dead skin off your face once a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste.</li>
            <li> You can see the dead skin coming off of your face.</li>
            <li> It seems to be removing dead skin.</li>
            <li> - I have been using for a few years and has replaced my need to get facials.</li>
            <li> Kinda of dried up when try to wash face and pulled out peach fuzz did not like1 will not buy again</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with breakouts and needed to find a product that exfoliates to remove my dead skin.  </li>
            <li> but since there is nominal amounts of harsh chemicals (you&#x27;d have to apply a lot to give a chemical burn)</li>
            <li> You can feel the dead skin peeling off.  </li>
            <li> Proved it does work on dead skin.</li>
            <li> The stuff that you are getting when you rub on the peel, is not your dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW MUCH DEAD SKIN CAME OFF.....</li>
            <li> AND YES IVE DONE THE 600.00 HARSH TREATMENT</li>
            <li> It helps cleaning up my dead skin.</li>
            <li> I used it on my cuticles and the dead skin</li>
            <li> and OMG I had so much dead skin balls all over my face</li>
            <li> Yes, I know some people say it&#x27;s the product and not skin, however you can tell it was dead skin by the color of the balls</li>
            <li> it literally takes a layer of the dead skin cells off in seconds.  </li>
            <li> how it balls-up the dead skin and leaves the skin looking</li>
            <li> it comes along with the Avani Dead Sea Moisturizing cream as well</li>
            <li> It does nothing, it just makes you think it&#x27;s removing dirt and dead cells.</li>
            <li> I had to wash it off my face when dried because it would not peel.  </li>
            <li> Every women and man should get this and do it once a month to get all the dead skin cells off your face.  </li>
            <li> I know these don&#x27;t have dead skin...</li>
            <li> Dead skin just rolls off my face.</li>
            <li> So I couldn&#x27;t imagine how this product could be removing so much dead skin.</li>
            <li> So there&#x27;s an ingredient in the product that causes this effect as it dries, what you are seeing is not the dead skin at all.</li>
            <li> Of course, in the process I got the product on my thumb which had dried skin around the nailbed.</li>
            <li> Poof, off came all the dried skin.</li>
            <li> if if was dried skin....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money and time..............</li>
            <li> Where was all that dead skin before?</li>
            <li> So I tried it on other surfaces as well and sadly the same thing happened.  </li>
            <li> You will be shocked over how much residue and dead skin this takes off.  </li>
            <li> I got this after trying the vivo facial peel and expected it to work just as well, it was disappointing</li>
            <li> Sure it may not be dead skin , but I have cystic acne and that leaves nasty scars I used to product and stopped using my prescription retin a</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter loves it as well- very hard product to find!</li>
            <li> I have had dry, flaky patches on my forehead and nose all winter long because of this crazy weather...</li>
            <li> Dead skin has a way of building up to give a dull look to you skin if you do not exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t worry about it being fake, because I&#x27;ve used it the next day and there are hardly any balls or dead skin that forms</li>
            <li> IT TAKES THE DEAD SKIN WITH IT!  </li>
            <li> i was amazed at how much dead skin came off!</li>
            <li> The Avani products are unbelievable.</li>
            <li> It seems like this product contains chemicals that make a small layer of skin come off WITH the glue.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no better than a drugstore product.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if it was what they were telling me</li>
            <li> I thought this stuff would help my acne but didnt helped get dead skin pff tho!</li>
            <li> I never knew how much dead skin I had on my face and neck until I used this product!  </li>
            <li> For example, when I first used it, the white flakes that came off were insane.</li>
            <li> , anyone who has a acne problem should use this, product, it gets rid of the dead cells that bacteria feed on!</li>
            <li> You rub in circular motions in your skin and the bits and pieces that come off are dead skin!</li>
            <li> NO MORE BREAK OUTS AND GETTING RID OF ACNE SCARS.</li>
            <li> After washing and fully drying it, I did it again and found very few balls.</li>
            <li> I felt like this product was very gimmicky..</li>
            <li> very difficult to get facial peel out when its half way.  </li>
            <li> When I first bought this as an impulse purchase at Sam&#x27;s Club, I worried that I had just done a stupid thing.</li>
            <li> I also was skeptical of whether there could truly be that much dead skin coming off, and unlike some of the &amp;#34;haters&amp;#34; on here, I couldn&#x27;t make other surfaces flake and peel like my skin does with it on.....</li>
            <li> Also the pump is not very good, mine keeps getting stuck and is hard to push.</li>
            <li> It was next to impossible to remove, and looked like I had lint or dead skin all over my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> So what if it balls up on a hard surface?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle</li>
            <li> I rubbed quite hard.</li>
            <li> I considered keeping it my little secret but shared my find with them.</li>
            <li> This product DOES get a bit clumpy as the one negative reviewer stated but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the negative comments, and</li>
            <li> I used 1/4th of the bottle at least in one time.  </li>
            <li> To the negative review..</li>
            <li> Hate haha</li>
            <li> Really seriously buy both of these products.  </li>
            <li> and I have not had any serious breakouts since.</li>
            <li> I looked at page after page of web sites looking for bad reviews and found only the one on this site.  </li>
            <li> until I hit 20 and everything went down hill, I freaked out and made it 10 times worse with expensive products, peels, costing me crazy amounts of money that I even quit modeling for half a year, and then I bumped into Avani at Sams Club.</li>
            <li> The sale girl tested the peel on my wrist and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try because I felt really bad not to buy after her long explanations.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and my skin was looking tired and saggy and just awful.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware if you want to spend your hard earned money on a rip-off!</li>
            <li> I always HATED my pores, they were always huge and made my face looked really bad.</li>
            <li> I also asked the rep about it and her explanation was those surfaces are probably dirty with dead skin as well.</li>
            <li> tend to find that I use it approximately every 5 days.</li>
            <li> At least I know they are not selling a fake product</li>
            <li> I would keep it a secret except that it is already bottled and on the market for you to buy.</li>
            <li> I would keep it a secret except that it is already bottled and on the market for you to buy.</li>
            <li> I have a broken out chin that looks like zits and rashes all in one.</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> I was desperate and tired of my skin breaking out everyday!</li>
            <li> Its a joke, it doesn&#x27;t work at all, I was very disappointed with this product, If I could get my money back I would, but I threw the box and return info out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> If your skin reacted to the product I am so sorry for you.</li>
            <li> Sorry about the repeat.]</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical when recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, because like everyone else I have tried lots of lotions on my aging skin.</li>
            <li> I had a sample used at the sam;s club with an offer that seemed expensive.</li>
            <li> I was amazed but skeptical.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and buy when on sale as it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> It is awfully expensive to use on elbows and hands, but let me tell you...</li>
            <li> It is awfully expensive to use on elbows and hands, but let me tell you...</li>
            <li> I have very tough skin and have never had any difficulty using products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy and confused.</li>
            <li> They can be purchased at another company in bulk very in expensively.  </li>
            <li> really bad in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended by my beautician and have never had a bad experience with anything she has had me try.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything bad.</li>
            <li> bad cause</li>
            <li> I use this product with the mineral cream at least 3 times week, after a terrible, terrible, year of breaking out .</li>
            <li> I was very wrong!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Also one person to whom I gave this product used the scrub and body butter on a SERIOUSLY NASTY CASE OF PSORIASIS.</li>
            <li> I thought this peel was awful, that gunk is the peel not gunk from your face!</li>
            <li> The gunk that was coming off of my face, my just cleansed face, was disgusting.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible.</li>
            <li> it was terrible.</li>
            <li> IS A HORRIBLE RIP OFF...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend, it&#x27;s ok, not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> When sale&#x27;s promotion girl at Sam&#x27;s first demonstrated product on my wrist I was skeptical but I decide to give it a try and I am so glad I did. My skin has never been better or more luminous in appearance. Now that I have used it regularily there is much less exfoliation than the first 2 weeks of use but what a difference in my skin tone and texture! The women at work, some half my age, noticed the difference in my skin and were keen on knowing what I was doing to accomplish such a change. I considered keeping it my little secret but shared my find with them. Not everyone has had the same results but they like the product. By the way I recommend Avani mosturizer to enchance results.</li>
            <li> Wow! Like many others I purchased this product as part of a promotion at Sam&#x27;s Club. I have developed rosacea over the past few years and have really struggled to find good skin care products that work to help reduce my symptoms (and the $300 prescription cream my dermatologist prescribed did not do a thing). I just used this for the first time last night and this morning my skin looks like it did 5 years ago. 90% of the redness is gone and the dry skin/scaliness is also gone. I could practically leave the house again without wearing my normal tinted moisturizer PLUS foundation!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! So simple, just rub it in circles on your face and watch the dead skin fall away!</li>
            <li> Avani is d best peel.Works wonderful.My skin had pimples and roseacea.I m using d full range of avani products.My skin is smooth and glowing.Not one pimple left on my face.My MIL is using it too and my hubby too.V r very pleased.5 star product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to buy any of the Avani line, buy the facial peel. It&#x27;s gentle and works great over all parts of the body. I like using it on my feet. And my trick is to use it on my brows if I want to encourage hair growth for fuller more youthful brows... or to regrow brows from overplucking. Anyways, it&#x27;s worth the money even if you just use it for your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this stuff...such a great exfoliation, yet gentle.  Visible results! And reasonable...a little goes a long way. Amazing how much difference I see and feel in my skin.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of the Avani Dead Sea Skin Renewal Facial Peel.  After using this product each time, I have \\&quot;baby\\&quot; smooth skin.  It is great for cleaning dead skin cells.  I have not found another nonprescription product that is this effective.  I live in Florida and my skin takes a beating from the sun.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS had very sensitive skin and regularly break out with psoriasis...really bad in the winter months.  My skin has never looked or felt as good as it does since using this product. The salts are gentle enough to clean away impurities without stripping your skin raw. The moisturizer isnt greasy or heavy. My skin can breathe. It looks refreshed. And my deep forehead wrinkles are fading. I rarely write reviews...but this deserves my praises!</li>
            <li> I always HATED my pores, they were always huge and made my face looked really bad. Well I saw this at a store and decided to buy it. When I put it on and all this junk started to flake off my face as I was putting it on I could not believe my face! It was smooth and in 1 use my pores were smaller and almost non existint( I used the Mineral Enriched Moisturizing Cream right after the Facial Peel). I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff. I hope it does last me a year like the rep said, but I will be buying it again when I run out it is so worth it!!! Thanks for my new beautiful smooth face ;)</li>
            <li> Pumps would not work and could not get any reply from seller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now and love it. It works especially well after using RetinA or similar peel inducing protocols.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! Only thing is, the last time I ordered a few bottles, one of them i received the pump didnt work, so I had to take of the lid every time I used the product.  Other than that, I&#x27;m usually very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;Really dose a vary good job of cleaning and polishing your face</li>
            <li> An excellent product, works really well for exfoliating the skin, better than anything a physician could prescribe. The price is right and it gets to me in a few days which is  wonderful because I use the product daily  and tend to panic when I run out of the product.</li>
            <li> This product is phenomenal. The minute you  put it on your skin and rub it in and it starts to peel. I have used it on my face day and night and it is great. You do noticed it after a while you won&#x27;t peel off as much Dead skin as in the beginning.usually I don&#x27;t get excited about a product. But I have bought five bottles of this peel.I highly recommend it to anybody that wants to improve their complexion or hands.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 18 months and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to look and feel younger. I am 60 but no one can tell. Fine lines are gone. Pores don&#x27;t show at all. I had the same fear as anyone when I purchased it. About the bathroom counter. I must say that you folks must not know how this stuff works. WHEN IT BALLS UP IT TAKES THE DEAD SKIN WITH IT!  So what if it balls up on a hard surface?  do yourself a HUGE FAVOR and try it for awhile.  I have gifted it to everyone I know. It is SUPERB!!!!!  Also one person to whom I gave this product used the scrub and body butter on a SERIOUSLY NASTY CASE OF PSORIASIS. IT IS NOW CLEAR.  We go to Jamica each summer for the sea salt to treat her condition. This is much cheaper and faster.  If your skin reacted to the product I am so sorry for you. It is the gentlest and most effective treatment I have ever used..  Did I tell you I used to pay a fortune for Este Lauder and this is in my humble opinion a more effective and much less greasy option. Not that I won&#x27;t use Este or even Clinique.  As I get older I am picky about how I look and more importantly feel.  Try the Dead Sea salt.( just the salt) in your bath. It is so relaxing. No scents. Just a great treatment. They can be purchased at another company in bulk very in expensively.  If you don&#x27;t use it you will never know how great it is. I have always had to use Almay or Clinique for sensitive pale skin. This only made me look and feel wonderful.  And I don&#x27;t have to spend so much. As for it lasting a year. Yes it does if you use it sparingly and follow directions. I always have to remind myself that using extra won&#x27;t make it work faster!  Just try it if you already bought it. Don&#x27;t let your fear of being fooled keep you from a great product.</li>
            <li> This product saved my skin! i have extremely sensitive skin that is dry beyond belief-no matter how much i moisturize. once i found this product i decided to give it a shot, i had nothing to lose. the first day i received this product i tried it after taking a shower..and WOOWW! i was amazed at how much dead skin came off! it left my face smooth, and dead skin-free! also i noticed my acne starting to go away because finally my prescribed facial washes can actually go into my pores and work its magic..instead of sitting on top of dead skin. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost in shock over how clean and soft my face is. My face will break out over the smallest thing, I cant even use lotion, But this stuff is AMAZING! I have used it twice this week and no problems. NO BREAK OUTS! My face has never been this soft before and it smells great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  don&#x27;t worry about it being fake, because I&#x27;ve used it the next day and there are hardly any balls or dead skin that forms...........I keep trying to get my sister to get it, I&amp;#34;ll wash my face with a MIA Clarisonic, and then use this and am amazed at what it missed!!!!  def gets the dead skin off...your face which allow for potential breakouts.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!! This product does the job. It gives an amazing peeel that makes my skin feel incredibly soft. I&#x27;m not sure why it got so many negative and snide comments, but I love this peel.</li>
            <li> Great, would buy again. Love this product line.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care if the gunk that comes off when you use this on your face also shows up on countertops, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What matters to me is how soft this product makes my face feel and the significant improvement in the appearance of my face (smaller pores and reduced reddness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I spent AU$40 yesterday and bought this product. What seems to happen is that the \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; component of the product gets absorbed into the face and then the supposed dead skin is just whatever&#x27;s left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a little on my bathroom counter and let it dry. When I rubbed it off, the same dead skin looking gunk appeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a rip-off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[I posted this as a reply to the other 1-star comment, then decided to make it a review of my own. Sorry about the repeat.]</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It does work.</li>
            <li> This peel is the real deal. It removes the entire top layer of dead skin gently and easily. It removes that scaly, filmy feeling when applied onto dry clean skin. I was having issues with blackhead on my forehead and nose, and this really helped. Just be sure NOT to use it more than once a week. If you do, it may cause irritation and does not work as well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, It is AMAZING. I&#x27;ve already told some of my girl friends about it and they purchased some too!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I received this as part of a gift set, and was sure that it was a rip-off. I was very wrong! I have very dry skin and go most of the winter with dry flaky spots on my face, especially forehead. After one time, my dry skin was gone, my skin looked great and healthy. I also use the moisturizer cream afterward. I have recommended this to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I thought this peel was awful, that gunk is the peel not gunk from your face! It seems like when the product is exposed to air it becomes clumpy and thats the gunk that people think is coming off their face! Also the pump is not very good, mine keeps getting stuck and is hard to push. I don&#x27;t recommend it...doesn&#x27;t do anything for me at all!</li>
            <li> after using this line of product,Avani, my skin has improved drastically.. beat the big department stores(all the big name beauty lines) and retina products from my Dr., hands down.. my skin has not looked this good in years!! i wish i had taken a picture before i tried it.. it might not work for you, but it is a dream come true for me!!! Amazon also has the best prices for the \\&quot;Avani\\&quot; line of products..</li>
            <li> This facial peel renewal is the real thing. I was somewhat skeptical when recommended by a friend. Now I think what did I ever do without this facial peel. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product 3 times now and see a HUGE difference in my skin.  My pores look smaller, and as I am lighter skinned my skin looks almost porcelain like.  This product DOES get a bit clumpy as the one negative reviewer stated but when you rub your skin with it, there is definitely skin coming off.  I have had no adverse reaction to the peel other then some skin getting a little dry which I expected.  I looked at page after page of web sites looking for bad reviews and found only the one on this site.  That leads me to believe while it may not work for everyone, it certainly works for most.  Good luck!!</li>
            <li> I too bought this on an impulse buy at SAMs club. I was desperate and tired of my skin breaking out everyday! I initially got the whole break down from the rep then came home thought about it, read reviews and decided it was worth the try! I&#x27;m so glad I did. I immediately saw the difference in my skin and my skin stopped breaking out that day! I was very impressed and so glad I went back. I also did the surface test as many reviews stated that the product balled up on surfaces too not just skin. I have not had it ball up on the surfaces I&#x27;ve tried. I also asked the rep about it and her explanation was those surfaces are probably dirty with dead skin as well. Makes sense...</li>
            <li> your skin feels new and clean very soft</li>
            <li> Want a liquid chemical peel that goes further?  Try Cure Aqua Gel or ORG&#x27;s Organic Mineral Peel. Either pack a stronger punch. Cure is acidic and really peels well and the mineral peel is great for the neck and body.</li>
            <li> It made my face so much softer and clearer, and the effect lasted for a couple of days.  I don&#x27;t really care if it&#x27;s dead skin cells or the product sloughing off, the effect is still the same.  I use it maybe once a week and will purchase it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I love it. I can&#x27;t believe the amount of dead skin it removes. I bought it to help minimize small lines, but my teen daughter uses it too. It helps with acne because it keeps the dead skin clear from pores!</li>
            <li> I bought the facial peel from a demonstrator at Sam&#x27;s club. I brought it home and tried it on my face. I had lots of \\&quot;dead skin\\&quot; coming off of my face and was amazed at how much was there, but my skin didn&#x27;t feel any different from before the peel. I used the lotion that came with the peel and I love the lotion. After reading the reviews here, I kept thinking about the lady who tried the peel on her counter. I thought, like the commenter did, that the gunk she got from her counter was from her skin cells on her hand and from dust. I put some of the peel on my freshly cleaned bathroom counter and rubbed it wearing a rubber glove. The peel balled up and looked identical to what I was getting off of my face! With the rubber glove on there is no way my own skin cells were rubbing off! I feel ripped off for buying this peel! Buyer beware if you want to spend your hard earned money on a rip-off!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now.  I am on my third bottle.  I use it on my face, neck heels.  It makes my skin so soft.  My only complaint is I have purchased 6 bottles (a few as gifts) and half of them the pump didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Normally I am not one to listen to any sales pitches...not even a little bit as sales people annoy the heck out of me.  But as I was standing around the isle at the store. I heard the other people that the sales lady was trying this on saying \\&quot;WOW, Oh my gosh\\&quot;!!!  So of course it peaked my interest.  I stood and watched and next thing you know she is putting some on my wrist....and there I was saying the same thing \\&quot;WHAT IS THAT?  WOW!!! Is that my skin???\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely could not believe the dead skin and junk that was peeling off.  So of course I could not hardly wait to get home and try it on my face last night.  I am not joking when I say, my face has never ever felt as clean as it did after that first application....never!!  This morning I keep touching my face and my nose, it feels incredibly smooth and soft and I cannot wait for my next application. (The sales person said you should only use this product once every 2 weeks).  I bought this in a kit with the Avani Dead Sea Mineral Enriched Moisturizing Cream - For Normal to Dry Skin and that is a must to go with it.  Really seriously buy both of these products.  I am so thrilled I am looking at trying some of the other Avani product.  THRILLED!!!</li>
            <li> Multiple reviews have experimented with rubbing this product on a counter top and I did the same. There is a little clumping, but there is much more when used on my face. This product has cleared up my acne a substantial amount and I have not had any serious breakouts since. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and it turned out to be the best skin care product I have ever used.  I went back to buy more and the store was out!!! Now I am stocking up because I can&#x27;t live without it.  It GENTLY peels off your old yucky skin and all the built up dirt instantly.  You can see a difference after the first use.  Its cheaper than a facial and quicker too.  I have all my friends hooked.  Be prepared to be amazed (and a little grossed out because your first application will probably shock you).  It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> have only used twice, not very impressed.</li>
            <li> I do not think this peels. It does make skin softer.</li>
            <li> The price is so much cheaper on Amazon than any spa or cosmetic store. Always check before purchasing elsewhere! The Avani products are unbelievable. You will see significant changes. I use to use Image C until I saw a significant change on my friends face. I&lt;br /&gt;switched immediately.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff. My skin glows after using it. Just returned from a 3 week motorcycle trip with sun damaged skin and rubbed it on the first day I got home.  It evens out your skin, makes it smooth and gave the 50+ yr old a new glow!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive and incredibly dry skin.  I was very surprised that this did not dry out, irritate, or break out my skin.  I have small dry patches all over my skin, and this is the only product I have found that actually removes them.  The cream is really nice as well.  I use the combo about twice a week, and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this product works.  Amazing all the dead skin that comes off in just a week&#x27;s time.  This with the Moisturizing makes my face feel amazing.</li>
            <li> I love the product but pump on the product does not work.  It takes me fives minutes of turning the bottle upside down and taping it on something to get the inside out.  To much work.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Facial Peel so far.  I can definitely see improvement in my skin.  I have found that I must use it more than once a week.</li>
            <li> You will be shocked over how much residue and dead skin this takes off.  Great for acne prone skin. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have a grandson that can&#x27;t shed his old skin and I used it on his face and it did a wonderful job. I use it on my face and I get a lot of compliments on my complexion.</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome. There&#x27;s nothing like getting all the dead skin off your face once a week. It makes your face feel like brand new. I wish they sold this stuff in a gallon container. However, the container could be made better. It&#x27;s hard to get the last 1/4 of the product out of the bottle. It&#x27;s a waste. I think a soft plastic container that you could squeeze out would be more beneficial</li>
            <li> I use it once a month. The feeling of smooth clean skin is wonderful. You can actual see the difference in the skin.</li>
            <li> Best facial peel I have ever used. It is not course but very effective. Would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product ever. You can see the dead skin coming off of your face. You will not believe how your face will feel after using this.</li>
            <li> I bought this product today more out of curiosity than true belief. Since I&#x27;m turning 50 this month I figured it would be a treat. I immediately tried it on my face and was surprised at how many little balls rolled up. Now I have oily skin, and although I didn&#x27;t apply make-up today, I&#x27;m sure that I still had areas that still had traces. After washing and fully drying it, I did it again and found very few balls. It appeared to work. I then thought that I would try it on my arms and hands (both of which are very dry. If the product removed dead skin cells on my face it would really work on these places. Nope. Nothing happened. Since I don&#x27;t have oily skin on my arms and I don&#x27;t wear make-up on them, it didn&#x27;t really have a job to do.&lt;br /&gt;Am I a believer that it&#x27;s all that it says it is? No. I doubt highly that they actually use salt from the Dead Sea. But, I will keep using it on my face and neck to help prevent pimples as well as white and black heads (even at 50 and post menopause).</li>
            <li> Nice part of the trio. Works.</li>
            <li> I prefer the gel exfoliants over the scrubs.  The scrubs dry me out.  I have tried all three gels I could find (Natural Cure Aqua, Aviani Dead Sea, and Obey Your Body).  I far prefer the Obey Your Body.  It forms tangible little &#x27;balls&#x27; of skin.  Some people say that it&#x27;s a byproduct of the gel itself but if I reapply it doesn&#x27;t form the &#x27;balls&#x27;.  It seems to be removing dead skin.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price - I have been using for a few years and has replaced my need to get facials.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the cream with collagen and I saw results after the first use. I was skeptical, because like everyone else I have tried lots of lotions on my aging skin. I have large pores and my skin was looking tired and saggy and just awful. I kept thinking maybe I should go for a professional facial. Then I tried this and I was honestly amazed at how well it works. I am so happy! Even my son says my skin looks better. I used it twice a day for the first couple of days, and followed it with the collagen face cream. I have only had it for about 10 days and I am so impressed. I see the difference even in my 10x mirror. I could not be happier and I will continue to use this product. Thank you Avani for making it!</li>
            <li> The most effective way to get rid of dry skin, removes it in seconds and leave skin smooth and soft. I have been using it for 7 months and first discovered it Hawaii on vacation, but it is much easier being able to buy it from Amazon and is at a much better price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a mall kiosk.  The woman selling the product was very pushy and tried selling it to me for $100 (with 2 free gifts).  She started by placing a dollop of the gel on my arm, let it sit for a moment, and then started lightly rubbing my arm with a cotton ball.  It appeared that my skin was peeling off, as I had hoped.  Pleased with the product, I negotiated the price down to $30 and received the single dead sea facial peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I got home, I read the reviews on Amazon and felt robbed!  I felt like I should have read reviews and gone to the Sephora directly across the way.  Some of the reviewers mentioned that the \\&quot;peel\\&quot; was not their skin, and that they could place a dab of the product anywhere and \\&quot;skin\\&quot; would magically appear.  I tried out their theory, and it was true: skin kept appearing everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve used nearly my entire bottle...&lt;br /&gt;I believe that the product have a glue-like effect, and that is why you get \\&quot;skin\\&quot;.  It seems like this product contains chemicals that make a small layer of skin come off WITH the glue.  So yes, a gluey aftermath will form if you rub it together, but for me, my skin still feels extremely soft whenever I use it.  I have sensitive skin, and sometimes my face gets a pinkish glow if I leave it on my face too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product for soft, smooth skin, but it&#x27;s not a good value.  It&#x27;s no better than a drugstore product.</li>
            <li> My mother swears by this product. She must go through several mini jars of it per year. From what I understand, she coats her entire face with the product, and then peels it off like a mask... it seems to have helped with the crows feet and lines around her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ask her, she&#x27;ll say !! YES !! get it. You&#x27;ll love it. So, I write this review on her opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a package deal for $60 at Sam&#x27;s Club, I got the mud mask, the exfoliator, moisturizer and a 6 piece sonic care kit which includes body brush, 2 facial brushes, pumice and facial sponge.  I&#x27;ve only used the care kit, exfoliator and the moisturizer.  The exfoliator is a GIANT JOKE!  After using the facial brushes twice, my Epicuren facial scrub and then the exfoliator I was still getting little white dabs of supposed skin - not true as I then rubbed it into the box and it did the same thing so it is obviously something in the chemicals that once exposed to air must just dry it up and it becomes skin like.  The brushes are nice and I like them, the moisturizer is just ok.  I will stick with EPICUREN products.  My esthetician always uses Epicuren for my facials and I come out looking refreshed and 10 years younger (nice if only for a couple of days).  I had told the salesgirl what I used and she never heard of Epicuren - just goes to show you, she had not a clue either.</li>
            <li> stuff works amazingly. Use once every weekend or every other weekend. I use every other weekend. It peels all of the old skin off of  your face. It isn&#x27;t harsh on your face either, though you can tell some of your skin layers came off, it doesn&#x27;t leave that harsh/rashy/raw kind of feeling some of the other skin peels leave you face feeling like. Use with the Enriched Moisturizer Cream, which helps give your skin that incredibly soft feeling. You use the Skin Peel at least 2-3 times as much as the Moisturizer Cream though just to give people a heads up.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;pump top&amp;#34; does not pump the product out.  I have to unscrew the top and pour the product in my hand.  Bottle is in not.  I do like the product itself...just not the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have recently developed rosacea and a lot of products irritate my already blotchy skin BUT this product makes my skin feel amazing and totally evens out my skin tones! I am heading back to Sam&#x27;s club to get some more! I also had some callouses on my toes and I used it on them and it smoothed them out beautifully</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this at the SAMS club.  I was not sure if it was what they were telling me but I gave it a try... Oh my goodness... my skin in beautiful, smooth and all the rough parts are gone... It took a dry old face and made it look years younger in one try.  I felt like all my pores were clogged with years of makeup and use and now it is all gone and my face is wonderful.... I would imagine I would feel the same outside in the sun and would not hide if someone was close to me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just awesome so I ordered one more for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t see how anyone would not like this... Maybe there is better stuff but I have not found it.</li>
            <li> I got this after trying the vivo facial peel and expected it to work just as well, it was disappointing</li>
            <li> Kinda of dried up when try to wash face and pulled out peach fuzz did not like1 will not buy again</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with breakouts and needed to find a product that exfoliates to remove my dead skin.  This product was great!  I used a little drop of this serum on my dry skin and rubbed it until the top layer of my dead skin was gone.  My skin is so soft after using this product!  I only need to use it once a week.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I use is about every 7 to 10 days. I would recommend this to any one who wants and extra facial peel.  it leaves my skin feeling smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use this product.  It is the best and most gentle I have use and I have tried many as well as being economical.  Great value and wonderful for the skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I&#x27;ve never had smoother skin!  My teenage daughter loves it as well- very hard product to find!</li>
            <li> My daughter, who is in college, and I both use this.  It makes your skin feel so smooth after using it, and it brightens your skin tone (possibly because it helps exfoliate).  It is very pricy when bought from Avani or even at Sams when they have a booth there once a year.  It is much more reasonable here.  I also love their citrus vanilla salt scrub for the bath.  It really makes me feel soft and pampered.</li>
            <li> Good peel.  Not too strong.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have had dry, flaky patches on my forehead and nose all winter long because of this crazy weather...and I&#x27;m in Florida! After just one use, I am flake-free. The gunk that was coming off of my face, my just cleansed face, was disgusting. It plumped up my fine lines and evened out my blotchy tone...just one use! Seriously!</li>
            <li> I love the Avani Dead Sae Skin Renewal Facial Peel it was a great price and very quick and fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems with transaction and i will buy again.</li>
            <li> I had a sample used at the sam;s club with an offer that seemed expensive. I checked amazon and the same product (this one) and the moisturizers used, were available for less.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased them and like the feel of this gentle exfoliant and the moisturizer used after it...My own little &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; treatment:)</li>
            <li> This product definitely works. Do not use if you have sensitive skin. Great price too and got here on time. Only use once a every two weeks to once a month.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Freddy&#x27;s. I tried it on my skin and was amazed. Then it got on my sink and produced the same amount of &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34;. It also broke me out.  I do like the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This does not Work at alllll. Before you start rubbing this product on your skin you will already have little pieces of what looks like skin but is really something else. Definitely not worth it- seems like a scam if anything.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;ve read the one star comments before purchasing. It really does NOTHING for your sking..it will flake whether you scrub it on your skin or on a piece of furniture. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible. It took two days to get off of my skin even after scrubbing. I wish I could give it 0 stars.</li>
            <li> Very good for your skin are rated 5</li>
            <li> This is the second time I am purchasing this product. I LOVE IT! I have oily skin with large pores. A few years ago, I developed Seb Derm on my face. This product gently exfoliates the dead skin from my face and keeps my seb derm under control. My pores are much smaller now and makeup goes on smoothly. If you like serums, I recommend using the Avani Skin Peel first and then apply the serum. This way, your skin absorbs the serum and you get all the benefits. I will use this product as long as the sell it!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim at Sam&#x27;s club and like others was having buyers remorse.  I thought that I would try it on the heals of my feet and was absolutely amazed at how much softer my heals were!  Regardless of other reviews where they say it balls up on countertops, plates, over, etc. it must be doing something to the dry skin because my heals feel and look so much better!  I was so happy to find it here on amazon for a reasonable amount because I will be buying more to ensure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at an excellent price.  A little goes a long way to ridding your skin of the day to day &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.  I use this twice a week to give my skin a refreshing pick me up.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use twice a week if you need to.  The formula works well and you can see results instantly, but since there is nominal amounts of harsh chemicals (you&#x27;d have to apply a lot to give a chemical burn) you can use it more frequently... like in drier winter weather without worry.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to find that I use it approximately every 5 days. The first time I tried it was because of an offer at Sam&#x27;s Club and I was instantly hooked because I found it simple to use with instant visible results.  For me, it&#x27;s easier to use than a facial scrub because you can apply it on dry skin, peel off the dead skin, moisturize fresh skin and go.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and worth the money. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect cleanser and all other products are real worth. my skin feels real healthy and non flaky and non greasy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle</li>
            <li> Love it. Totally exfoliates</li>
            <li> I saw this product at SAMs. She tried it on my wrist. I was amazed but skeptical. I came home, read reviews here and figured that more buyers than not loved it so I decided to buy.&lt;br /&gt;To cleanse my face I use a reputable product I buy at the drugstore. I used the peel and cream for the first time last night and I cannot believe the difference in my face and neck. My pores are almost non existent. I&#x27;m 39, live in a sunny climate, have some sun damage and my skin looks like it is 20 again. My lines are not gone but they certainly look softer and less noticeable.I am amazed and glad I went back and purchased it. This product really works. It is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;The set you get at SAMs is less than the price of one product at the department stores. Before I bought, I thought about the balls that form from the peel. Unsatisfied customers were talking about how they tried the peel on other surfaces and it still created the &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34;.  While this may be true, on your face, where it claims to work, it does.</li>
            <li> Great product. this is 3rd repeat purchase of this item.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  It really works.  You can feel the dead skin peeling off.  By all means try it and you&#x27;ll be hooked.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the cost is much less if you order it from Amazon, and their service is great!</li>
            <li> Bought this at Sam&#x27;s club today. Thought it was a total joke but she tested it on my wrists and gave me the full run down. While I was checking out I pondered about returning it the next day. Lol I hope im not the only one. I read reviews about it balling up on flat surfaces so I gave it a try. I got balls between my finger tips bit when I rubbed it on a clean countertop in my bathroom (marble), there was nothing. Just kept the watery consistency but just turned a tiny bit more viscous. Proved it does work on dead skin. Not returning. Face feels super fresh and clean...kinda like it breathes better. This is just day one so I definitely will update if anything changes.</li>
            <li> it good, great, as good as I was expecting.  I hope my next order would be as good as the first, one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Used this product as directions said and I now have red burns on both of my checks. I have very tough skin and have never had any difficulty using products but this one is way below standards to put on your face. Was ripped off and not worth it. Can buy better peels at the grocery store. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried the product at Sam&#x27;s club and decided to buy it from Amazon to check it out.  I love this product!  My skin feels so soft after using this product.</li>
            <li> Nicely helping to clear the dead skin cells. I used it on my teenage son&#x27;s skin and it makes the skin smooth. Using it once or twoce a week. But little pricey.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I bought it on Zulily and it leaves my skin very smooth afterwards. I only use it about once a month.</li>
            <li> Great item to exfoliate face, elbows or anywhere that get dry.  It helps to keep the wrinkles in my face very light and for the most part un noticeable.  I have used this for years and buy when on sale as it is expensive.  I have not found anything else that works as well.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The stuff that you are getting when you rub on the peel, is not your dead skin cells.  If you rub this stuff on a hard surface you will get the same type of pieces.&lt;br /&gt;When the gel oxidizes it produces these little pieces and this product becomes a very mild scrub.  Get something cheaper and save your money!</li>
            <li> I CANT BELIEVE HOW THIS WORKS SO VERY AMAZING...  LIVING WITH MELASMA (ALSO KNOWN AS THE MASK OF PREGNANCY) AFTER MY 2ND SON WAS BORN AND IT&#x27;S STAYED ON FOR THE LONG HALL .... IN THE SUMMER NO MATTER WHAT PROTECTION I USE NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I REAPPLY, HATS, TOWELS TO COVER MY FACE WHEN POSSIBLE ...NOTHING HAS WORKED THE FIRST TIME I USED THIS PRODUCT I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW MUCH DEAD SKIN CAME OFF.....THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!! SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS...WONDERFUL SO VERY GREATFUL I FINAALY FOUND SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND DIDNT SPEND THE 600.00 TO GET IT...AND YES IVE DONE THE 600.00 HARSH TREATMENT TO NO AVAIL...RELIEF AT LAST..</li>
            <li> I have rosecea and was surprised to find the chemical peel in this Avani product doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, in fact it helps it. The two pump actions I ordered arrived far earlier than expected and other than the boxes being kinda crushed and mishandled looking, the bottles themselves were fine and work great.</li>
            <li> I read that the gunk is really the same product, I guess the gunk is a mixture of the product and the dead skin. However this is not very important. What matters to me is that while applying the product I could look to a magnifying mirror and see my pores disappearing. I rubbed quite hard. I applied it twice a week for two weeks and now once a week and the face looks much better at close look. The improvement was noticeable after the first application but improved with further uses.</li>
            <li> I saw some other reviews that say they don&#x27;t feel this product works and that the product is only balling up. However, that&#x27;s not true. I have bought 3 bottles of this because it&#x27;s so great. I have had acne scars that have disappeared from using this. Also my skin is brighter and feels extremely soft. Love this product!</li>
            <li> From the first day I used this product, I noticed that my skin looked refreshed and bright. The exfoliation is gentle.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I just received this item in the mail TODAY.  Used it this evening, and I can ALREADY tell that I am going to love this product!  After this one use, I can see how much more clear &amp; smooth my face is...seriously!! I went downstairs to tell my fianc√© how awesome this product is right after I used it.  I read several reviews before buying it - some were negative stating that the gel beads up even if it&#x27;s on a clean surface.  However, I saw a difference in the appearance of skin after 1 use.  I am just starting to get more into skincare than I ever have been.  I will be getting married in a few months and have been trying to find great skincare items.  Even though it&#x27;s only been one use, I feel this product seriously made a difference on my skin.  And I&#x27;m not one to write reviews on anything...but THIS, I felt like I just had to!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff, I use it before applying my makeup to remove any dry skin.  I am not 100% sold on the fact that the &amp;#34;goo balls&amp;#34; that form when you rub it into your face are REALLY dry skin though, which is why I only gave it 4 of 5 stars.  I only wish that the refreshing feel that it gives to my face would last a little longer.</li>
            <li> impulse buy from Sam&#x27;s club during promotion time . The sale girl tested the peel on my wrist and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try because I felt really bad not to buy after her long explanations. It cost me 56$ being a package promotion but in the bag, I got 5 products facial peel, facial moisturizer, body butter,body scrub, and a package of body mud). After using it, I must say you should give it a try :D . I can totally feel the difference. My skin become smooth and brighter.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I use it on my face once every week or so. It removes all of your dead skin and makes you face so soft! I recommend using their Mineral Mud Mask with this product for amazing results! LOVE LOVE LOVE Avani products!</li>
            <li> I thought this stuff would help my acne but didnt helped get dead skin pff tho!</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and find that it is terrific.  It has helped reduce large pores and make my skin look smoother. As an older person, I also note a reduction of fine age lines. I, too, had a pump that stuck and it did dry out the product.  I got another by talking to the company and the rest have been great.</li>
            <li> LOOOOOOOOOOVE! I use it every few days or when I feel my skin is looking tired and it makes my skin look so fresh and perfect! It minimizes my pores and gives me that porcelain skin look! I even applied it on my 58 yr old mom&#x27;s face and she was amazed! Works wonders!!!! Very easy to use and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I just LOVE this stuff.  It is a wonderful exfoliate and leaves your skin like a baby&#x27;s behind.  I have been using it for years and it has reduced the large pores on my face.</li>
            <li> I never knew how much dead skin I had on my face and neck until I used this product!  I turned 50 in January and though I don&#x27;t look it, I was starting to see little signs of aging.  This product family is wonderful.  My skin looks better and better with every skin renewal application!!</li>
            <li> I just used the facial peel for the first time with some disturbing results. The skin only partially rinsed odd and now my face is left with hard little balls of dead skin stuck to it and feels like sandpaper! I even tried reapplying the solution to see if that would help take it off with no luck. I&#x27;m very unhappy and confused. My skin was fairly smooth before I used this. Has anyone else had this happen?</li>
            <li> I am in my 50s.  I bought this product at Sam&#x27;s as part of a promotion.  I use it once a week.  It makes my skin feel so smooth and pores and imperfections are slowly fading.  I&#x27;ve read the negative comments, and all I can say is, if I miss my weekly &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; and can definitely tell the difference.  I have made this part of my &amp;#34;staying young&amp;#34; regime.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to return this and get my money back.  I tried the facial peel on my face and when I tried to wipe it off, the peel/dead skin (I question the dead skin part) stuck to the fine facial hairs on my face.  It was next to impossible to remove, and looked like I had lint or dead skin all over my cheeks.  Kind of felt a little like tiny balls or rubber cement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware, go with something you can trust.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this  in a Sam&#x27;s store, loved the way it made my skin feel,so clean and soft, so I went online and reordered. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I am a) a total skeptic about bogus marketing and b) an acne sufferer who has spent untold amounts of money trying to deal with my skin. While this stuff does, indeed, create little flakes of itself no matter what you roll it on (much like glue), that is not the whole story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who&#x27;s gone through almost a whole bottle of the stuff, I know the difference between what it looks like on skin that&#x27;s been recently treated with it versus skin that hasn&#x27;t been. For example, when I first used it, the white flakes that came off were insane. The next day, however, I used it again (just to test this exact thing), and the results were much less dramatic. When I use it more often, I get far less stuff coming off my skin. I think it&#x27;s just like a super refined version of rubbing elmer&#x27;s glue on your hand: it picks up anything as it&#x27;s rubbed away. The difference, though, is that it somehow rejuvenates my skin while doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of whether I believed it at first, the results speak for themselves. While it hasn&#x27;t transformed my skin into blemish-free satin, it has dramatically changed the texture of my face and has reduced breakouts significantly. I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansers, toners, scrubs, lotions, and prescription medications in my almost-thirty years, and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased that&#x27;s given me a tangible result. I&#x27;ll be buying it in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(FYI I&#x27;m using it about every three nights, but it&#x27;s winter in Wisconsin and I&#x27;ll probably reduce when it&#x27;s less dry out. If you use it this way, it definitely won&#x27;t last a year.)</li>
            <li> I have been experiencing some issues with my skin getting blotchy and it&#x27;s simply changing due to hormonal imbalances.  I used this product and noticed an improvement within one day.  My skin feels and looks rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;I have my husband use the product also since he gets weather-wear in his face after working outside and his skin is improved in appearance and feel as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product helps to clear and improve the quality of your skin. Not harsh if done the way the directions tell you.</li>
            <li> Really like this product because it really cleans your skin without drying it out. Great for large pores and blackheads.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, anyone who has a acne problem should use this, product, it gets rid of the dead cells that bacteria feed on!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price. I use this product regularly and the results are amazing.  Would definitely continue using it.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  Have been using it for several years now.  Can be used every 2 weeks to peal face.  Removes the top layer, but does not irritate my skin.  Keeps it looking fresh and young.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for years. You rub in circular motions in your skin and the bits and pieces that come off are dead skin! Once you do a once over on your face, your skin looks great.&lt;br /&gt;I do in the evening and put a night cream overnight to nourish it after a peal.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I like the new design for dispensing the product.  I could not get all of the product out with the old design.</li>
            <li> This is the best. I dont know if it really does peel the skin. I know for sure the makeup residue is completely gone. It say not to use under the eyes but I do. Its fine.</li>
            <li> I bought it first in Sams club as a show product, and like it a lot. When I find that amazon also has this product, I order it. It helps cleaning up my dead skin.</li>
            <li> Pump did not work.  Product works ok but you need to use a lot of it before it works good.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this as an impulse purchase at Sam&#x27;s Club, I worried that I had just done a stupid thing. However, I must say that this was the best impulse purchase ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Retin-A, which makes my skin always flaky and in some state of \\&quot;peel\\&quot;. I have tried lots of exfoliators and other scrub products, but this stuff beats them all hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin. I use it way more frequently than recommended, like every couple days, and sometimes daily, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those having a problem with it rolling into balls or clumping or whatever, I suggest that maybe you might be leaving it on too long or something. I put it on a dry, clean face, scrub it around, putting extra on the areas that are the flakiest, then rinse off immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried going without it when my last bottle ran out, but I could definitely tell the difference in my skin. So much softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews, because my face has never looked better since I started using this. My current bottle is getting empty and I&#x27;m freaking out and need to order more. I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it!</li>
            <li> I am excited to find this product so reasonably priced here online.  I was convinced at Sam&#x27;s club like many others on here, but I don&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;duped&amp;#34; at all!  This product does truly remove dead skin cells, leaves skin soft and smoother than any other product, and I now don&#x27;t want to live without it.  I also was skeptical of whether there could truly be that much dead skin coming off, and unlike some of the &amp;#34;haters&amp;#34; on here, I couldn&#x27;t make other surfaces flake and peel like my skin does with it on..... and I can wash my face and scrub it with other cleaners and a wash cloth and then use this on it and skin definitely peels off with this product that regular scrubbing doesn&#x27;t get....... but if you continue to put this on, after a while it doesn&#x27;t flake off any more skin...... my boyfriend uses it on his rough callused hands along with the salt scrub and the results are incredibly soft and smooth skin......I am convinced......  love it!  I also feel like I have less clogged pores and minor acne since using this regularly.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but it is so difficult to get out of the bottle.  Pump doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I love this! I usually try to stay away from anything expensive (my money is not my money, after all; it&#x27;s God&#x27;s), but when my dad offered to buy this for me as an early Christmas gift, I finally relented. This product is a must have for any girl&#x27;s beauty regime! I&#x27;ve always struggled with acne; even ProActive didn&#x27;t work. This, however, has worked wonders! My skin is soft and glowing; I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments in my life! It&#x27;s rather pricey, but I have a feeling that I&#x27;ll be using this for quite some time. I have finally found my skin care soul mate &lt;3</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  This facial peel is super simple to use, gentle on your skin, and leaves your face soft and glowing!</li>
            <li> Wonderful! It is about 3 times the price in store, or anywhere else!</li>
            <li> this is the best product to get rid of dead cells especially for people who has dry flaky skin.without this product my face is a mess.thank god somebody sells something that really works.i tried it all to have dry/flaky face and this is the only thing that helped.thanks avani!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than what they wanted at the store! Love the product!</li>
            <li> Best exfoliator I have ever used.  No pain, no burning, just smooth skin.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> used it before and love the product</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I love the feel of my skin after using it feels like going to the spa.  I used it on my cuticles and the dead skin just flakes off.  I used it on my elbow I have psoriasis and just peels the dead skin for soft skin and then apply moisturizer.  I used it on my heels and the dead skin just flaked off and left skin soft again.</li>
            <li> You will love this item. My skin looks great!</li>
            <li> I bought this item at Sam&#x27;s Club as a package. I didn&#x27;t read the online reviews 1st like I normally do as this was an impulse buy (which is rare for me). I have never had flawless skin, I have a lot of blackheads on my nose, chin and cheek area and nothing has ever worked to get rid of them. I am really glad I bought this product! I used it the night I got home and OMG I had so much dead skin balls all over my face it was terrible. Yes, I know some people say it&#x27;s the product and not skin, however you can tell it was dead skin by the color of the balls (it was similar color to my make up that didn&#x27;t get completely washed off my face). My face felt wonderful after I was done and I could see  a reduction in my pores and blackheads. I did use the moisturizer that came in my package and my skin felt great. After reading the reviews on here about the balls forming no matter what, I decided to try it again the next morning just to see if that was true. It was true, it did form balls, however there were much fewer balls (like an 1/8 of the original amount) and they were not even close to the same color as the 1st time I did it. I could tell however there  was some dead skin in the balls just much less than before. So while I do think the product is made to ball up, you can most definitely tell it&#x27;s not a scam type of product. My skin has never looked or felt better in my life! Even my acne scar is fading. WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought it at Sams as well and went home to use the facial peel.  I kept doing it and than washed it off.  Over and over and over.....now common sense would tell you if that much skin came off than I should have been red or somewhat sore.  Nope nothing at all.  The same amount of skin would come off every time I used it.  Over and over and over again.  I used 1/4th of the bottle at least in one time.  I also got the little balls of rubber cement stuck to the little hairs on the side of my face as well.  I used a pretty heavy cleanser Micro abrasion from Mary Kay and it still did not come off.  I liked the moisturizer however I am returning everything because I do not care to be lied to.  I totally believe that it is NOT dead skin coming off at all.  It is little balls of rubber cement.....My son just laughed at me.  I think I will stick with my Mary Kay.  At least I know they are not selling a fake product</li>
            <li> This is one of the best at home peels ever.  My daughter actually bought one a year ago.  You only need a tiny bit and (I have problem skin!) it literally takes a layer of the dead skin cells off in seconds.  Super quick and easy, painless.  I over time had gotten some problem skin and I use this sparingly.  It hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all.  I love it and it was a great value.  If you don&#x27;t want to waste a ton of time or cash - it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product WITH the Avani Moisturizing Cream as a SET from Sam&#x27;s Club for $40, instead of the individual prices which added to about $42.85.  The catch is that Sam&#x27;s Club only carries the SET occasionally, and that they must be purchased as a SET, so if one runs out, but not the other now they can be purchased separately and with free shipping if the Amazon order is large enough.  The peel works well on the oily corners of the nose or oily T-zone.  It&#x27;s really amazing how it balls-up the dead skin and leaves the skin looking/feeling renewed.  I hardly use any make up, but this is good skin-cleansing stuff, not too harsh.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product!</li>
            <li> WOW! This is an awesome product.  Icould not believe how well it works. I LOVE it! You must buy it.</li>
            <li> I had first encountered this product at Sam&#x27;s this lady was testing and it really does peel the skin away slightly and harmlessly! it really does work and gets rid of fine lines and makes your skin smoother. I love this product! it comes along with the Avani Dead Sea Moisturizing cream as well and it hydrates and those two products together are great. On their actual website is $150 for both and I couldn&#x27;t have found it anywhere cheaper than here!</li>
            <li> Found at Sams Club and loved it so just looked for more on Amazon</li>
            <li> I wanted to believe that this stuff worked.  It did seem to at least clean my skin somewhat.  Then my husband took it and put some on our granite counter-and as he rubbed it the same little clumps formed.  I thought it was cleaning my skin and taking off all the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; stuff, but then when I saw what happened with this peel when used on the counter, I had to wonder-is it the chemicals in it that are meant to form clumps no matter where it is used?  So I tried it on other surfaces as well and sadly the same thing happened.  I am thinking we are being duped into thinking this is awesome stuff but it really is, as my husband who is a chemist said, just a chemical reaction that does very little for your skin.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow, I use this product with the mineral cream at least 3 times week, after a terrible, terrible, year of breaking out . I model part time and I use to have perfect skin, until I hit 20 and everything went down hill, I freaked out and made it 10 times worse with expensive products, peels, costing me crazy amounts of money that I even quit modeling for half a year, and then I bumped into Avani at Sams Club. Super lucky.. ahhhhh!! To the negative review.. Haters gon&#x27; Hate haha, I love love love this line, you can&#x27;t go wrong with something all naturally based. Now they need a make up line lol :)</li>
            <li> Well, like many others I am skeptical if all of those balls on my face are actually dead skin coming off....but it doesn&#x27;t really matter to me.  After I got home with it I tried it on just half my face and I could definitely tell the difference.  The side I used it on was smoother, pores looked smaller, softer.  My skin feels great.  So glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this Skin Renewal Facial Peel really works. I&#x27;ve used it already 4 times. It&#x27;s the same like Oro Gold peel(for which I paid $129 at the mall). It does nothing, it just makes you think it&#x27;s removing dirt and dead cells. I love Papaya-Glycolic Gentle Skin Peel by Earth Science which I bought at Whole Foods. That&#x27;s the facial peel that really works....&lt;br /&gt;I also bought Avani Dead Sea Innovative Firming Eye Serum and Avani Dead Sea Timeless Advanced Micro-capsule Serum. I love them.</li>
            <li> I was left with a face full of beaded gel. I had to wash it off my face when dried because it would not peel.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have read some of the other reviews and was surprised at how many people loved the product.  I am neutral about it; I agree with several of the reviewers who said it is just the product, not the skin, that is balling up.  I see no difference, but maybe it makes my face a little cleaner -- I already wash it carefully anyway.  the lotion is nice though.  I too was conned into buying it in BJs club at a &#x27;fantastic discount&#x27;.  Could have bought it at Amazon at the same &#x27;discount&#x27; or cheaper, and returned it when it failed to live up to its boasts.  There is another product by Philosophy that really does peel the skin and leave it very soft that I by far prefer.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I feel as though it really exfoliates my skin good.  I like how it turns into little hard ball-like substances that really cleanses the pores deep down.  it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth after i use it.  It&#x27;s also very gentle and has no scent, which I love.</li>
            <li> What a scam! As previous posters have pointed out, this starts forming &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; from the moment it touches your face and then leaves an oily residue that also appears to be &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are definitely better options out there. If a product works, there&#x27;s no reason to add ingredients (and who knows what they are) that imitate results.</li>
            <li> Really works , my face looks better and feels clean..........</li>
            <li> I read the reviews regarding this product.  As a former fashion model I was somewhat&lt;br /&gt;Skeptical.  I tried it as I did have dry patches of skin.  Wow it rub right off.  I tried it a second&lt;br /&gt; time and my skin looked great. People have commented on my skin since I have used these products.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Yes, Yes to this and the moisture cream. Love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product...it is a tad expensive but so worth it. Love how you can see it working and the fresh feel to my skin.</li>
            <li> Every women and man should get this and do it once a month to get all the dead skin cells off your face.  It&#x27;s not a pretty site in the sink when your doing it, but your skin feels so good afterwards.</li>
            <li> used the peel for the first time today...my skin has never felt so good..finally a product that really makes a difference</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best products I have used on my face. It eliminates breakouts and leaves me feeling refreshed!</li>
            <li> I first bought this product at Sam&#x27;s and loved it! When I found it here on Amazon for a fraction of the price I was so excited I bought 2 bottles. This is not the same formula I bought at Sam&#x27;s. The Amazon product has a high alcohol content, it is so high you can smell it in the product, It does not work near as well as the original product. I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Found this at sam&#x27;s club at one of those weekend special booths.  Best product to smooth your skin.  Love love love this product</li>
            <li> Having gone to the dead sea where this product was available, the price was a real bargain.  It came in on time and was all that was expected.</li>
            <li> Its a joke, it doesn&#x27;t work at all, I was very disappointed with this product, If I could get my money back I would, but I threw the box and return info out. Save your money and use sugar and lemon you will get better results.</li>
            <li> Dead skin has a way of building up to give a dull look to you skin if you do not exfoliate.  This product is safe yet effective and easy to use at home or in the Beauty Salon or spa. Great Product.</li>
            <li> My wife is extremely satisfied with this product. Delivery is as expected and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I love using this product because you can see results tight away.  The only negative is the pump mechanism.  It leaves quite a bit of product when it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> Really is the safest, easy, cheap price, and u will feel the dead skin fall off in ur sink. Someone got me this from Sams as they were doing a promotion. this stuff is great and the lil small bottle lasted 3 mths and going. Use as often as u want, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rub it into ur face and the dead skin just falls off in balls all over ur sink lol...</li>
            <li> I first purchased this as a promotional item at a Sam&#x27;s Club and paid way too much for it but I liked the product and what it did to my skin so I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon and for less!!  I use it along with the other two products (Refreshing Facial Toner and Timeless Advanced Micro-capsule Serum to protect my skin while I am deployed.</li>
            <li> I bought this anf this is bogus product!!!  I was curious snd rubbed on a cardboardbox, mirror, counter and had same effect.  I know these don&#x27;t have dead skin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A HORRIBLE RIP OFF...BACK TO LANCOME....</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this facial peel.I use it 3 times a week and the results are wonderful.Dead skin just rolls off my face.</li>
            <li> This is one of the strangest products to use. Meaninging you rub it onto clean skin and dead skin rolls off. It&#x27;s pretty gross to see all the gunk roll off as your rubbing it in. But it leaves your face super clean and soft. I like this much better than using grains, seems like a better exfolication.</li>
            <li> I tried this at a friends house and it left my face so smooth I had to get some for myself!  I bought 3 bottles, as I had seen it elsewhere for $90 a bottle!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a reasonable price.  All Avani products have more than met my expectations.  Very happy with and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Save your money! I recently purchased this at a kiosk. Now I exfoliate a lot, use a clarisonic face cleaner, I use products with salicylic acid or hyloronic acid, in addition to regular facials... Deep pore facials and hydro-facials. So I couldn&#x27;t imagine how this product could be removing so much dead skin. So I tried a little experiment. Those of you who already own this product, I encourage you to try this so you&#x27;ll see what I&#x27;m talking about. I put on a pair of rubber gloves, applied the product to the gloves and rubbed my hands together. Sure enough, there was the &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; sloughing off on rubber gloves! So there&#x27;s an ingredient in the product that causes this effect as it dries, what you are seeing is not the dead skin at all.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on other products. This is the best I have tried!  Excellent product and my skin is so soft after using it.</li>
            <li> On 3rd bottle love love and love!</li>
            <li> I got the moisturizer and mud mask too. The products are really great and make my skin feel really great!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a month now and can see a noticeable difference in my complexion.  I was having a lot of trouble with dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> this is easy to use, and is not abrasive at all, leaves a terrific glow to skin and prepares face for any makeup you might want to use. takes so little and lasts a good amount of time. well worth the price. will continue to use</li>
            <li> Love this product but you should only use a little especially on sensitive skin. I have recommended this products to friends and given as gifts.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my beautician and have never had a bad experience with anything she has had me try.  The first time I used the renewal peel - it was great.  I tried it about 10 days later (recommended one time a week).  Some of the peel would not come off of my face.  I had particles stuck to the side of my face and when I tried to remove them, with washing, a wash cloth and even lotion  - the peel would not come off.  I did use it exactly as described.  I actually decided to try it again about 2 weeks later, thinking maybe my face had been wet or some other &#x27;user&#x27; error.  I had the same thing happen again.  I would not recommend this product.  If I had tried it sooner, I would have requested my money back.</li>
            <li> Have used this product before and love it.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased this product elsewhere. I got a much better deal on Amazon. The product works amazingly well. It really sloughs off those dead skin cells, leaving your face looking fresh and radiant. I&#x27;m almost 60, and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> This is really great product. However, it is little expensive but on Amazon it is priced well if you anyone wants to try it.</li>
            <li> This really works on dry skin.I try to use it several times a week on my face then use a good face lotion.</li>
            <li> If you use this and say you didn&#x27;t see or feel any difference....then you need to see a dermatologist.  It is the greatest peel I have ever used, and right now my daughter is using it so I will have to buy more.  I would never run out of this!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Does a great job and very gentle.  I have eczema and this helps keep the flakiness away on my face.  You&#x27;re not supposed to use it around your eyes, but I find no sensitivity issues (I just don&#x27;t leave it on for long).</li>
            <li> I liked this facial peel. Skin is very smooth and not irritated. I definitely will reccomend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Love it. Can&#x27;t say anything bad. I have naturally young-looking skin anyway, and this will help keep it looking that way.</li>
            <li> This product has become a staple in my skin care routine.I read the reviews before I tried it and have to disagree with the nay sayers.When you use this product acording to the directions  you will notice the change in your skin.I use the peel once every two weeks and my skin is remarkable soft and supple and my pores are virtually invisible,my skin is so oily you can fry an egg on it but you would never know it thanks  to this product,it has refined the texture of my skin.I&#x27;m a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> I love how it removes the old skin and allows my face to breath. In the tropics, not all acne medicines sold on television work as our climates are miles apart but this peel definitely helps with my breakouts and allows me to have better and smoother skin.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this from Amazon. It had arrived, was unboxed, and sitting quietly on my counter awaiting use. I knew I should be sqeaky clean before using this on my face as the instructions...which I DID READ...said it worked best on a clean face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All was well until my little black kitty had a tif with the world and became her own version of a whirling dervish and knocked my precious, unused bottle of Facial Peel on the TILE FLOOR whereupon the bottle broke scattering sharp glass in all directions while leaving a residue of Facial Peel on the tile. Well, the tile was not in need of a peel, and the lovely product had sharp shards of glass mixed into it. I decided to just discard the whole mess and went for gloves and dustpan along with short broom. But the product was gooey and required some work with hands, which were yet to put on gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I started to carefully mop the product up with some wipes. Of course, in the process I got the product on my thumb which had dried skin around the nailbed. Poof, off came all the dried skin. At first, I was not certain what was occurring. But soon it registered in my upset brain THAT WHATEVEVER THE PRODUCT TOUCHED...if if was dried skin....it peeled off. The next thing I knew, I was like a small child...trying dips and dabs of product on my toes, my knees, my feet, my face....wherever I could safely put product that had no shards in it. I must have spent two hours....that seemed like 10 minutes because it was SO MUCH FUN to watch THE CHANGE THAT INSTANTLY TOOK PLACE...skin that was dead was gone and nice pink new skin remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I took note of the time, cleaned up the mess and hopped into the shower. Squeaky clean, I emerged and located my SECOND BOTTLE OF Facial Peel. Whence, I used it according to instruction....and...it would appear that A NEW AND YOUNGER VERSION OF MY FACE was smiling back at me. Wow. This had been a disaster with a silver lining...sort of...I did start using my Facial Peel. It is marvelous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it every 5-7 days now for a little more than a month. The changes in my face are incredible. I have exceedingly dry skin because I live in the desert, do not drink enough fluids, or eat the correct foods, or use moisturizers as I should. But, I am now doing better in those areas because of the transformation in my facial skin....not to mention toes and fingers and wherever else I decide to use this! It is awfully expensive to use on elbows and hands, but let me tell you...it works and works immediately. My skin is better everywhere. But mostly, the face is amazing. Literally, it looks like 10 years have been taken off overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommennd, URGE, CHASTIZE, COMMEND, SUGGEST, NAG, BEG, THORIZE, ORGANIZE, LORD OVER YOU, REQEST, BAT YOU OVER THE HEAD, GET ON MY KNEES....whatever it takes to get you to give this product a try if you are have dry skin problems on your face. It is a miracle. I would keep it a secret except that it is already bottled and on the market for you to buy. Please, for goodness sake, do give this Peel a try. It does NOT come off in one peel...which is what I was originally looking for....but that may be because my skin is just too dry...or because that is NOT the point. The idea is too look nicer and get rid of dead facial skin. This will do it. SO PLEASE....well, there I go again. Just give it a try. It rocks!!!!ial Peel.

            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin and this stuff doesn&#x27;t agitate it.</li>
            <li> This bottle of Avani seems to be a different formula from an earlier bottle I purchased.  It takes considerable more product for the facial peel and the pump mechanism does not work.</li>
            <li> I felt like this product was very gimmicky..The &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; was just the product glue-ing up..I put some on a glass plate and used a glove on my hand so there would be no skin contact with the product and it gave the same result as when I use it on my face.  It did make my skin feel softer so I will give it 3 stars, but I see no difference in skin tone/pores/ect</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It doesn&#x27;t work.  I wasted my money and time..............it didn&#x27;t anything on my skin . Buy something else</li>
            <li> The product is awesome it does exactly what i needed it too and it arrived quickly highly recommend the product and the vendor.</li>
            <li> I really love this facial peel.  When using the circular motion with your finger, it really does peel off old layers of dead skin.  Like a review I read when I first ordered, I thought that the product was balling up giving the Impression of dead skin, but when I tested the product with a clean finger (one that the skin peel was used first to clear dead layers) and applied it to a smooth glass surface, it did NOT ball up!  Plus, I sometimes would need to use more product on areas where dead skin was lifted, but not completely removed.</li>
            <li> Using this makes my skin feel clean immediately, old skin clumps up and rolls off! Leaves my skin feeling extra soft and extra clean. Best stuff to get old skin off. I use it once a week, a bit more than recommended, but it&#x27;s so wonderful!</li>
            <li> very difficult to get facial peel out when its half way.  its ok for me</li>
            <li> i tried it on my face and within weeks i was BEGGING all my girlfriends to buy it. this stuff leaves your skin feeling like a baby&#x27;s bottom and i had no idea how much i needed it before i tried it because before this i had always thought i had good clear skin, but this stuff showed me how much even softer it could be! im bad cause i dont use it biweekly as were supposed to...more like once a month or every 3 weeks..BUT ALWAYS BEFORE I&#x27;M ABOUT TO GO ON A DATE...and lets just say, they always call me back ;)</li>
            <li> The product started balling up the minute it hit my face before I had a chance to rub it in, thought it was from the skin on my hands, now I read here about the tiles, the counter, the rubber gloves. Okay, enough already. This broke my skin out almost immediately. I have a broken out chin that looks like zits and rashes all in one. That is from one use. It is going back today.</li>
            <li> I have not used a facial peel before and now I am wandering why because it is great or at least this one is. I use this 2-3 times per week and it leaves my skin incredibly soft and new feeling. I feel like my skin is reversing in age. :-)</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my face feel after I use it.  I have extremely dry skin and it is a great exfoliant.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am so excited that I don&#x27;t have to pay the outrageous prices at the mall anymore for one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> I use my Husbands account so Jennifer McNair loves this product but it requires me to wear gloves when using this product my fingers/finger tips had major peeling going on when I first used it, it doesn&#x27;t help that I have rough hands. But this product does exactly what is says it is a non abrasive peel that helps expose pores for a deeper cleaning for the other products you may use to reduce pore size or clear blemishes. I love it and will continue to use and buy more.</li>
            <li> Not bad. I would try something different</li>
            <li> Where was all that dead skin before?</li>
            <li> Avani is the the best sea skin renewal facial peel. It&#x27;s very gentle taking the dead skin off. You can use it anywhere to get that dead skin off and it makes your skin feel soft after. I would recommend this product. It is awesome.</li>
            <li> Sure it may not be dead skin , but I have cystic acne and that leaves nasty scars I used to product and stopped using my prescription retin a and I love it. My skin does not get red after using it every day like retin a and I dont have breakouts anymore.  I use this and the cream at night and cetaphill in the morning. NO MORE BREAK OUTS AND GETTING RID OF ACNE SCARS. win win in my book</li>
            <li> No matter what beauty products you are currently using you can still fit this one in. You only use it a couple of times a week and it makes your other products go on better and your make-up just looks better.</li>
            <li> I had tried this product at a store demonstration and loved how soft it made my skin feel.  Unfortunately the store only carries it at certain times, so I went to Amazon and found the same product for far less.  The product arrived in a timely manner, the price was right and I still love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I have tried the facial peel, I thought I was imagining the effects of my new glowing skin until I asked my daughters to try it, then I knew 100 per cent that this product is truly amazing their skins glow and my skin has had many compliments, people asking me if I had gone on holiday that I looked so alive and refreshed. I LOVE AVANI, the company is trustworthy and I am now obsessed with their products, thank you avani for my new skin and for your great service. for any woman that reads this i ask you to try this product you wont regret it.</li>
