            <li>It&#x27;s a great color for any skin</li>
            <li>Which is great.</li>
            <li>I am loving it!</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and this color looks great on me as well as on my mom who has a more olive skin tone.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to get a perfect manicure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Gelish brand polishes for over 6 months now and have loved everything I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li>, I think Sensationail is still very worthwhile.</li>
            <li>The surface was still flawless, and every one of my nails had grown to the ends of my fingers for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>Love Sensationail products!  </li>
            <li>This is a nice color</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll get better at it in time, but it looks good</li>
            <li>All Sensationail polishes are very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Once finished, my nails were immediately completely set with a flawless, glossy surface.</li>
            <li>the product went on smooth coverage was good</li>
            <li>and I have had great success with this brand.</li>
            <li>They looked good for special occasions and kept my nails from breaking.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and evenly, and sort of \\&quot;self levels\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love them!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was noticing that my top coat looked opaque after curing it for just the 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>Mostly because my nails are a disaster.</li>
            <li>If your manicures don&#x27;t last but a couple days, you&#x27;ll be blown away by having perfect nails for more than a week or two.</li>
            <li>love Sensationail.</li>
            <li>If your manicures don&#x27;t last but a couple days, you&#x27;ll be blown away by having perfect nails for more than a week or two.</li>
            <li>love Sensationail.</li>
            <li>I have four colors now and absolutely love every one.</li>
            <li>Will try more colors.</li>
            <li>though it gets better with 4 coats.</li>
            <li>but i am so glad i ordered this color</li>
            <li>i will definately be ordering more colors by sensationail</li>
            <li>The formula was not my favorite, though.</li>
            <li>You just need to make sure your cuticles are in top notch condition, away from the polish, and your nails are buffed nice and smooth before you polish.</li>
            <li>It really looks great, just wish it had better coverage.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay on my fingers more than a day.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say, I first noticed the cap wearing off after day 7 or so as well, so still remarkable wear all the way around.</li>
            <li>The polish goes on smoothly and evenly and the shine lasts forever!</li>
            <li>The more you use this product,  the better you get, but it does take time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used another gel polish brand, as well, and I like this brand much better.  </li>
            <li>~ you&#x27;ll be glad you did :)</li>
            <li>Just an OK color.  </li>
            <li>So far it looks good though!</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>Love this polish goes on easy  </li>
            <li>Really, it&#x27;s much easier to schedule time for removal of still great looking polish, than to fit in time for a polish as well.</li>
            <li>I loved the gel so much I re-applied another Sensationail set immediately after filing and prepping.</li>

            <li>It really is true!</li>
            <li>It really is true!</li>
            <li>The application process is beyond easy.</li>
            <li>The application process is beyond easy.</li>
            <li>It arrived very very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a great neutral color, easy to apply, lasts me about 7-10 days which is much better than one day I get from regular polish!</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t like this color at first</li>
            <li>The color is fine.</li>
            <li>Great light-pink polish, goes on solid and not translucent like some light pinks tend to do.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t go on evenly or smoothly like the Gelish brand.</li>
            <li>I bought a cheap LED lamp and a couple bottles of Sensationail gel, just to try it out.</li>
            <li>It does actually work, the polish is great.</li>
            <li>As a precaution, I remove the polish, use cuticle oil and give my nails a breather for a day, before applying another gel manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must read and follow the directions precisely.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a first timer and want to try gel nails at home, I strongly recommend Sensationail!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a first timer and want to try gel nails at home, I strongly recommend Sensationail!</li>
            <li>Before I retired I would not be willing to spend the time it takes, but now that I have more time, I can save the money I used to spend on nail salons.</li>
            <li>I love this color so much!  </li>
            <li>This polish retails for a much higher price than I was able to get it here.</li>
            <li>love the viscosity of the polish (all of them) as it allows me to come very close to the cuticle without getting the product on my skin.</li>
            <li>but I leave them in for the full minute.</li>
            <li>I love the whole Sensationail line.</li>
            <li>The majority of the timesaved during application is lost during the removal process, but when you think of the quality of the nails during wear, time saved not applying top coats every day, and the fast application</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for anyone who wants slightly more than a natural look or anyone who has avoided wearing pink because they thought they were too \\&quot;mature\\&quot; for it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps the main reason I&#x27;m so in love with Sensationail right now, is the quality of my nails after wearing the polish for almost two weeks:</li>
            <li>The application is easy and doesn&#x27;t take much time.</li>
            <li>Very high glossy and smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Two weeks later, all of my nails still looked amazing.</li>
            <li>and I had to apply 3 coats to get a really smooth, even color, which I was surprised by because it&#x27;s a light color.  </li>
            <li>But even the most natural acrylics always looked like acrylics.</li>
            <li>the 2 weeks without touch up may be worth it.</li>
            <li>I also invested in the gel polish removal tool that is well worth the $5.00 I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It peals right off.</li>
            <li>It was the same consistency as nail polish, making it very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>True, removal is not as easy as nail polish, but it&#x27;s nowhere near as much of a hassle as acrylics or ceramics.&lt;br</li>
            <li>True, removal is not as easy as nail polish, but it&#x27;s nowhere near as much of a hassle as acrylics or ceramics.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color was really pretty finished</li>
            <li>Polish will look pretty on me for a day or two.</li>
            <li>SensatioNail is definitely one of my favorite gel polishes.</li>
            <li>thank you so much!</li>
            <li>With proper application, and care, I&#x27;m sure the polish could&#x27;ve lasted a lot longer than 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>time: my first chip happened on day 12 of wear.</li>
            <li>All but one of my nails left the removal process undamaged, and I&#x27;m confident that what I learned from the first removal will prevent any recurrent scrapes in the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the application is super easy and much faster than regular polishes.</li>
            <li>After my very first Sensationail gel manicure, I went about life as normal.</li>
            <li>to me its a bit more dull but if you are more on the subtle side its a great polish.</li>
            <li>I have since changed to Shellac product that does not require primer and much easier to remove, with the same wear and tear - 2 weeks or more.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it stays on for so long and you can go for weeks at a time without worrying about chipping.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is it didn&#x27;t really run or \\&quot;build up\\&quot; while being applied.</li>
            <li>The most important thing in removing the gel polish is to make sure you rough up the entire nail surface with the coarse emery board in the kit.</li>
            <li>and I could still see my tips in certain lights.</li>
            <li>The product is very high quality.</li>
            <li>The product is very high quality.</li>
            <li>so I have to be careful not to go over it too many times.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I ended up trying the product, and it did work very well.  </li>
            <li>this lovely pink polish a try</li>
            <li>But I see others with gorgeous nails, and there are times when I would like my nails to look at least well-groomed, and maybe reach my fingertips.</li>
            <li>i have been searching for a nice soft pink</li>
            <li>, it is very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>I hear the other colors have better coverage.</li>
            <li>I have been using SensatioNail for a few months and am very pleased with the professional- looking results.</li>
            <li>After wiping off the residue, gel has a very strong, stiff,  yet slightly flexible feel, so at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if they were completely set.</li>
            <li>My natural nails were always destroyed by acrylics, so they were \\&quot;special occasion\\&quot; only.</li>
            <li>Additionally, with regular polish, I would have been preserving my polish with a new top coat daily or at least every other day, but with Sensationail I did nothing and had a beautiful gloss on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;ve never really wanted long nails.</li>
            <li>I noticed my two most troublesome nails (that NEVER grow past the quick without breaking) were actually growing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m only on my second application, so keep that in mind, but I did wear the first application out till the first chip and went through the removal process, and have much to say about Sensationail!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other nails still looked fantastic, so I didn&#x27;t bother them.</li>
            <li>The other brand made me appreciate how evenly and smoothly Sensationail went on.</li>
            <li>The results are not only amazing looking, they will last an exceptionally long time if you prep correctly.</li>

            <li>The results are not only amazing looking, they will last an exceptionally long time if you prep correctly.</li>
            <li>A little smaller than I thought it would be, but I love the baby soft pink color :-)</li>
            <li>The first coat goes on completely sheer just to give you an idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, I did my first application the night before I left on vacation... and therefore, after the 45 minutes I allowed myself to do my nails, I immediately had to finish packing.</li>
            <li>To put it in perspective, before this, my regular polish would last a maximum of 3 days before there was significant wear at the tip of my nail which WAS noticeable, that I would feel the need to touch up.</li>
            <li>I bought the full kit at CVS and it came with this Pink Chiffon color.</li>
            <li>The polish does not stay on (properly applied with UV light, base coat, top coat, set in between each coat as instructed with the system) for more than 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>In general the only colors that I&#x27;ve felt really needed more than one coat were usually really dark colors because the Gelish covers so well.  </li>
            <li>All with more or less the same results.</li>
            <li>This is a long review, but if you&#x27;re trying gels for the first time, read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it really did last for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>However, by the time I was out the door and rushing to the airport, my nails were completely FLAWLESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is still sheer enough to see slightly through, but the color is now more opaque.</li>
            <li>i had no previous experience with the brand</li>
            <li>Three coats of Pink Chiffon turned out a lovely shade of milky sheer pink.</li>
            <li>nails really do feel nearly invincible while I&#x27;m wearing Sensationail gel polish, and therefore, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back to regular polish again.</li>
            <li>All in all, if you follow the directions exactly, I find that it takes me about 45 minutes to do the full application of 2 color coats and the base and top coat.</li>
            <li>I use the raspberry wine and espresso bean regularly so I decided to try a new color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only done one manicure so far, and thus far I like this product.</li>
            <li>After setting the first coat, I simply repeated for a second and third coat.</li>
            <li>When I opened the bottle, even though the bottle clearly has a label that said &amp;#34;pink chiffon&amp;#34;, the actual polish inside was a HOT PINK.  </li>
            <li>On top of that I&#x27;m very hard on my nails.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product but wish it had a white color for French manicures.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, with normal polish, my clothes and luggage would have ended up wearing more polish than my nails...</li>
            <li>Thus, not more than 5 minutes after curing my topcoat, my nails got the full assault.</li>
            <li>Just putting one or two coats on gives you sort of a natural manicure look though it makes your tips look sort of dingy if you don&#x27;t have french white tips.</li>
            <li>It may be a little less strong than the gel treatments at the salon</li>
            <li>I was laying it on pretty heavy, too</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick like some other brands</li>
            <li>pink chiffon is a pretty shade of cotton candy pink, however it is extremely sheer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a female, and I can distinguish the difference between a hot pink, and a blush pink.  </li>
            <li>This shade of pink is very natural but there is enough color there for an impact.</li>
            <li>Like I said, there&#x27;s NO mistaking between a blush pink and a hot pink!  </li>

            <li> I loved the gel so much I re-applied another Sensationail set immediately after filing and prepping.</li>

            <li> It really is true!</li>
            <li> It really is true!</li>
            <li> The application process is beyond easy.</li>
            <li> The application process is beyond easy.</li>
            <li> It arrived very very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is a great neutral color, easy to apply, lasts me about 7-10 days which is much better than one day I get from regular polish!</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t like this color at first</li>
            <li> The color is fine.</li>
            <li> Great light-pink polish, goes on solid and not translucent like some light pinks tend to do.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t go on evenly or smoothly like the Gelish brand.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheap LED lamp and a couple bottles of Sensationail gel, just to try it out.</li>
            <li> It does actually work, the polish is great.</li>
            <li> As a precaution, I remove the polish, use cuticle oil and give my nails a breather for a day, before applying another gel manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must read and follow the directions precisely.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a first timer and want to try gel nails at home, I strongly recommend Sensationail!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a first timer and want to try gel nails at home, I strongly recommend Sensationail!</li>
            <li> Before I retired I would not be willing to spend the time it takes, but now that I have more time, I can save the money I used to spend on nail salons.</li>
            <li> I love this color so much!  </li>
            <li> This polish retails for a much higher price than I was able to get it here.</li>
            <li> love the viscosity of the polish (all of them) as it allows me to come very close to the cuticle without getting the product on my skin.</li>
            <li> but I leave them in for the full minute.</li>
            <li> I love the whole Sensationail line.</li>
            <li> The majority of the timesaved during application is lost during the removal process, but when you think of the quality of the nails during wear, time saved not applying top coats every day, and the fast application</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for anyone who wants slightly more than a natural look or anyone who has avoided wearing pink because they thought they were too \\&quot;mature\\&quot; for it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps the main reason I&#x27;m so in love with Sensationail right now, is the quality of my nails after wearing the polish for almost two weeks:</li>
            <li> The application is easy and doesn&#x27;t take much time.</li>
            <li> Very high glossy and smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Two weeks later, all of my nails still looked amazing.</li>
            <li> and I had to apply 3 coats to get a really smooth, even color, which I was surprised by because it&#x27;s a light color.  </li>
            <li> But even the most natural acrylics always looked like acrylics.</li>
            <li> the 2 weeks without touch up may be worth it.</li>
            <li> I also invested in the gel polish removal tool that is well worth the $5.00 I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It peals right off.</li>
            <li> It was the same consistency as nail polish, making it very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> True, removal is not as easy as nail polish, but it&#x27;s nowhere near as much of a hassle as acrylics or ceramics.&lt;br</li>

            <li> The color was really pretty finished</li>
            <li> Polish will look pretty on me for a day or two.</li>
            <li> SensatioNail is definitely one of my favorite gel polishes.</li>
            <li> thank you so much!</li>
            <li> With proper application, and care, I&#x27;m sure the polish could&#x27;ve lasted a lot longer than 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> time: my first chip happened on day 12 of wear.</li>
            <li> All but one of my nails left the removal process undamaged, and I&#x27;m confident that what I learned from the first removal will prevent any recurrent scrapes in the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the application is super easy and much faster than regular polishes.</li>
            <li> After my very first Sensationail gel manicure, I went about life as normal.</li>
            <li> to me its a bit more dull but if you are more on the subtle side its a great polish.</li>
            <li> I have since changed to Shellac product that does not require primer and much easier to remove, with the same wear and tear - 2 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it stays on for so long and you can go for weeks at a time without worrying about chipping.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is it didn&#x27;t really run or \\&quot;build up\\&quot; while being applied.</li>
            <li> The most important thing in removing the gel polish is to make sure you rough up the entire nail surface with the coarse emery board in the kit.</li>
            <li> and I could still see my tips in certain lights.</li>
            <li> The product is very high quality.</li>
            <li> The product is very high quality.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful not to go over it too many times.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I ended up trying the product, and it did work very well.  </li>
            <li> this lovely pink polish a try</li>
            <li> But I see others with gorgeous nails, and there are times when I would like my nails to look at least well-groomed, and maybe reach my fingertips.</li>
            <li> i have been searching for a nice soft pink</li>
            <li> , it is very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> I hear the other colors have better coverage.</li>
            <li> I have been using SensatioNail for a few months and am very pleased with the professional- looking results.</li>
            <li> After wiping off the residue, gel has a very strong, stiff,  yet slightly flexible feel, so at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if they were completely set.</li>
            <li> My natural nails were always destroyed by acrylics, so they were \\&quot;special occasion\\&quot; only.</li>
            <li> Additionally, with regular polish, I would have been preserving my polish with a new top coat daily or at least every other day, but with Sensationail I did nothing and had a beautiful gloss on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;ve never really wanted long nails.</li>
            <li> I noticed my two most troublesome nails (that NEVER grow past the quick without breaking) were actually growing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m only on my second application, so keep that in mind, but I did wear the first application out till the first chip and went through the removal process, and have much to say about Sensationail!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other nails still looked fantastic, so I didn&#x27;t bother them.</li>
            <li> The other brand made me appreciate how evenly and smoothly Sensationail went on.</li>
            <li> The results are not only amazing looking, they will last an exceptionally long time if you prep correctly.</li>

            <li> The results are not only amazing looking, they will last an exceptionally long time if you prep correctly.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I thought it would be, but I love the baby soft pink color :-)</li>
            <li> The first coat goes on completely sheer just to give you an idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, I did my first application the night before I left on vacation... and therefore, after the 45 minutes I allowed myself to do my nails, I immediately had to finish packing.</li>
            <li> To put it in perspective, before this, my regular polish would last a maximum of 3 days before there was significant wear at the tip of my nail which WAS noticeable, that I would feel the need to touch up.</li>
            <li> I bought the full kit at CVS and it came with this Pink Chiffon color.</li>
            <li> The polish does not stay on (properly applied with UV light, base coat, top coat, set in between each coat as instructed with the system) for more than 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> In general the only colors that I&#x27;ve felt really needed more than one coat were usually really dark colors because the Gelish covers so well.  </li>
            <li> All with more or less the same results.</li>
            <li> This is a long review, but if you&#x27;re trying gels for the first time, read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it really did last for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> However, by the time I was out the door and rushing to the airport, my nails were completely FLAWLESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is still sheer enough to see slightly through, but the color is now more opaque.</li>
            <li> i had no previous experience with the brand</li>
            <li> Three coats of Pink Chiffon turned out a lovely shade of milky sheer pink.</li>
            <li> nails really do feel nearly invincible while I&#x27;m wearing Sensationail gel polish, and therefore, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back to regular polish again.</li>
            <li> All in all, if you follow the directions exactly, I find that it takes me about 45 minutes to do the full application of 2 color coats and the base and top coat.</li>
            <li> I use the raspberry wine and espresso bean regularly so I decided to try a new color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only done one manicure so far, and thus far I like this product.</li>
            <li> After setting the first coat, I simply repeated for a second and third coat.</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle, even though the bottle clearly has a label that said &amp;#34;pink chiffon&amp;#34;, the actual polish inside was a HOT PINK.  </li>
            <li> On top of that I&#x27;m very hard on my nails.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product but wish it had a white color for French manicures.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, with normal polish, my clothes and luggage would have ended up wearing more polish than my nails...</li>
            <li> Thus, not more than 5 minutes after curing my topcoat, my nails got the full assault.</li>
            <li> Just putting one or two coats on gives you sort of a natural manicure look though it makes your tips look sort of dingy if you don&#x27;t have french white tips.</li>
            <li> It may be a little less strong than the gel treatments at the salon</li>
            <li> I was laying it on pretty heavy, too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick like some other brands</li>
            <li> pink chiffon is a pretty shade of cotton candy pink, however it is extremely sheer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female, and I can distinguish the difference between a hot pink, and a blush pink.  </li>
            <li> This shade of pink is very natural but there is enough color there for an impact.</li>
            <li> Like I said, there&#x27;s NO mistaking between a blush pink and a hot pink!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale skinned and the color looked pretty on my nails.</li>
            <li> Before trying gels, I would normally wear a few coats of nail polish to protect my fragile nails.</li>
            <li> I recently got into gel nails and don&#x27;t understand what took me so long to get started.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see how long they&#x27;d last.</li>
            <li> They last that long and longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They last that long and longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my nails are STRONGER than they ever have been before, AND for once all my nails are long at the same time!</li>
            <li> Follow up by using flat cotton pads (not cotton balls!)</li>
            <li> I ordered another brand in a similar shade of milky pink sheer.</li>
            <li> I ordered another brand in a similar shade of milky pink sheer.</li>
            <li> I ordered the pink chiffon which should be a soft pastel/blush pink (as shown by the product picture, user picture, AND user reviews).  </li>
            <li> I used the CND shellac base and top coats along with my hot pink SensatioNail.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a big fan of pink</li>
            <li> so I picked up &#x27;pink chiffon&#x27; at my local CVS today</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if it lasts as long as the others I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li> Long baths, keyboards, garden dirt, pottery making, etc., all contribute to my nail issues.</li>
            <li> I had heard accounts of gel nails lasting WEEKS, but I always figured those accounts must be from women who have nannies and maids and gardeners - not real people.</li>
            <li> also have to be careful about the streaking because this color is definitely prone to it...</li>
            <li> third gel manicure I decided to sample other brands of gel.</li>
            <li> third gel manicure I decided to sample other brands of gel.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think you could get away with any less than 3 coats if you&#x27;re using it just for a solid color.</li>
            <li> The colour is slightly thinner than a regular nail polish and with practice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long and tedious process but worth it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like that the bottle is so small, won&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> The color don&#x27;t seem that pink though.</li>
            <li> I carefully cleaned, prepped, and primed my nails.</li>
            <li> I needed 3 coats to get a uniform pink color</li>
            <li> (By the way, the SensatioNail pink Chiffon color does not go on well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a milky, creamy pink with no glimmer or shimmer to it</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re looking for a sparkly pink, this is NOT the color for you.  </li>
            <li> I like the pink</li>
            <li> It comes in a rather small bottle not as much as other brands for the same price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing that other brand now, waiting to see how durable it will be</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing that other brand now, waiting to see how durable it will be</li>
            <li> This brand is a bit thinner that other brands and I like that in that you can control the color better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This did not shrink up on my nail like other brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine enough for a base coat under a glitter coat</li>
            <li> 3 max (if I am very careful).</li>
            <li> it would usually take me to do the same with regular, non-gel polish, and we are talking a serious time-saver application-wise.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a hard finish surface like with acrylics or regular polish.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me (hard on your fragile nails), please try this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me (hard on your fragile nails), please try this product.</li>
            <li> the starter kit recommend that you cure the base and top coats for 30 seconds</li>
            <li> If I put it on too thick it does not last</li>
            <li> (i did not use the base or top coat of this product i used another that i previously purchased)</li>
            <li> It really is a slight sparkle</li>
            <li> My nails are stronger and tend to crack much less often.</li>
            <li> My favorite things about gel is that my nails look and feel completely natural (not rigid, built up, or fake) and they don&#x27;t make that annoying clatter on my keyboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cut into fourths and soaked in acetone and tightly wrapped in aluminum foil.</li>
            <li> but I think it takes a little practice.</li>
            <li> I usually set aside about an hour or two to remove and reapply the polish.</li>
            <li> I have olive skin and pastels/taupes don&#x27;t usually look flattering on me.</li>
            <li> But removing is really difficult, especially if you use the primer (bonding agent) that comes with the starter kit.</li>
            <li> It was just really odd how a completely wrong color got into a pink chiffon bottle.</li>
            <li> Removing can take about an hour (of soaking and scraping), you can reduce removing time by applying primer with a very thin stroke at the tip of the nails only.</li>
            <li> Very pale</li>
            <li> Even a color blind person can tell it&#x27;s completely the wrong color.  </li>
            <li> The cuticle base was starting to show, andI was dying to find out what condition my nails were in underneath the gel.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very weak and thin, and prone to every sort of problem: chips, splits, peels, curls.</li>
            <li> I applied Sensationail Pink Chiffon in one coat, without a base coat.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, they also made an annoying clatter on the keyboard and other surfaces.</li>
            <li> but it seemed very thin</li>

            <li> This is a nice color but it doesn&#x27;t go on evenly or smoothly like the Gelish brand. It&#x27;s fine enough for a base coat under a glitter coat but I don&#x27;t think you could get away with any less than 3 coats if you&#x27;re using it just for a solid color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sensationail products for over two years now and I absolutely love them!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a big fan of pink but I wanted to try it on my nails so I picked up &#x27;pink chiffon&#x27; at my local CVS today and I was NOT disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I love the viscosity of the polish (all of them) as it allows me to come very close to the cuticle without getting the product on my skin. I usually set aside about an hour or two to remove and reapply the polish. It&#x27;s a long and tedious process but worth it every time.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions that come with the starter kit recommend that you cure the base and top coats for 30 seconds but I leave them in for the full minute. I was noticing that my top coat looked opaque after curing it for just the 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;They also suggest you apply two coats of the color gel polish but I&#x27;ve learned to do 3 coats of color for the darker colors and 4 coats for the lighter ones. It seems to last even loger that way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m growing my collection of colors and I would recommend everyone giving this product line a try!</li>
            <li> I recently got into gel nails and don&#x27;t understand what took me so long to get started. I love the fact that it stays on for so long and you can go for weeks at a time without worrying about chipping. The color don&#x27;t seem that pink though. to me its a bit more dull but if you are more on the subtle side its a great polish.</li>
            <li> The color is fine. The polish does not stay on (properly applied with UV light, base coat, top coat, set in between each coat as instructed with the system) for more than 3-4 days. Jamberry is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that lasts longer.</li>
            <li> It comes in a rather small bottle not as much as other brands for the same price. But the color is awesome and just like the photo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gelish brand polishes for over 6 months now and have loved everything I&#x27;ve bought.  In general the only colors that I&#x27;ve felt really needed more than one coat were usually really dark colors because the Gelish covers so well.  That&#x27;s where I think this one was lacking.  The color was really pretty finished but it seemed very thin and I had to apply 3 coats to get a really smooth, even color, which I was surprised by because it&#x27;s a light color.  We&#x27;ll see if it lasts as long as the others I&#x27;ve been using.  I used it with the Gelish foundation and topcoat, so it should be the same as the others I&#x27;ve used.  So far it looks good though!</li>
            <li> Love this polish goes on easy  Does not chip have it on two weeks❤️ It really is a slight sparkle</li>
            <li> This is a long review, but if you&#x27;re trying gels for the first time, read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give gel nails a try, to see what all the fuss was about. I had no expectations at all. Mostly because my nails are a disaster. They&#x27;re very weak and thin, and prone to every sort of problem: chips, splits, peels, curls. On top of that I&#x27;m very hard on my nails. Long baths, keyboards, garden dirt, pottery making, etc., all contribute to my nail issues. I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;ve never really wanted long nails. It doesn&#x27;t suit my lifestyle. But I see others with gorgeous nails, and there are times when I would like my nails to look at least well-groomed, and maybe reach my fingertips. When I worked in an office, I&#x27;d occasionally get acrylic nails. They looked good for special occasions and kept my nails from breaking. But even the most natural acrylics always looked like acrylics. Not to mention, they also made an annoying clatter on the keyboard and other surfaces. My natural nails were always destroyed by acrylics, so they were \\&quot;special occasion\\&quot; only. I know there are those of you out there with nails like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to get to my Sensationail review. No expectations. I bought a cheap LED lamp and a couple bottles of Sensationail gel, just to try it out. I really thought it would be an ordeal to apply, so I set aside a few hours for practice and learning. I carefully cleaned, prepped, and primed my nails. I applied Sensationail Pink Chiffon in one coat, without a base coat. It was the same consistency as nail polish, making it very easy to apply. So far, so good! The first thing I noticed is it didn&#x27;t really run or \\&quot;build up\\&quot; while being applied. You could take your time, as it doesn&#x27;t start to set during application like regular nail polish. It will only set with the lamp. It goes on very smoothly and evenly, and sort of \\&quot;self levels\\&quot;. After setting the first coat, I simply repeated for a second and third coat. Three coats of Pink Chiffon turned out a lovely shade of milky sheer pink. Perfect for a nude look with just a hint of color. Once finished, my nails were immediately completely set with a flawless, glossy surface. I wasn&#x27;t used to the feel of set gel nails. I was expecting a hard finish surface like with acrylics or regular polish. After wiping off the residue, gel has a very strong, stiff,  yet slightly flexible feel, so at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if they were completely set. But after some durability testing, I realized that&#x27;s how they&#x27;re supposed to feel. My favorite things about gel is that my nails look and feel completely natural (not rigid, built up, or fake) and they don&#x27;t make that annoying clatter on my keyboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now, on to durability. Before trying gels, I would normally wear a few coats of nail polish to protect my fragile nails. Polish will look pretty on me for a day or two. 3 max (if I am very careful). I have tried every polish brand under the sun. I&#x27;ve tried pro manicures, treatments, etc. All with more or less the same results. Peeling, wear, yellowing, dulling after a day or two. I had heard accounts of gel nails lasting WEEKS, but I always figured those accounts must be from women who have nannies and maids and gardeners - not real people. After my very first Sensationail gel manicure, I went about life as normal. I kept checking my nails, expecting some sort of wear and tear. A week went by. My nails still looked absolutely perfect. I noticed my two most troublesome nails (that NEVER grow past the quick without breaking) were actually growing! 8 days in, one of my nail caps got a bubble, and I had to remove that gel and re-apply, but I only re-did that one nail. The other nails still looked fantastic, so I didn&#x27;t bother them. I wanted to see how long they&#x27;d last. Two weeks later, all of my nails still looked amazing. The surface was still flawless, and every one of my nails had grown to the ends of my fingers for the first time in years. The cuticle base was starting to show, andI was dying to find out what condition my nails were in underneath the gel. So I removed them. My nails looked great underneath. No peeling or splitting. Not even a hint of yellowing! I loved the gel so much I re-applied another Sensationail set immediately after filing and prepping. Those lasted another two weeks before they began to lift. If you&#x27;re like me (hard on your fragile nails), please try this product. If your manicures don&#x27;t last but a couple days, you&#x27;ll be blown away by having perfect nails for more than a week or two. It really is true! They last that long and longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My third gel manicure I decided to sample other brands of gel. I ordered another brand in a similar shade of milky pink sheer. Immediately, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed as I had been with Sensationail. The other brand made me appreciate how evenly and smoothly Sensationail went on. I&#x27;m wearing that other brand now, waiting to see how durable it will be so I can review that product later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a first timer and want to try gel nails at home, I strongly recommend Sensationail! The application process is beyond easy. The product is very high quality. The results are not only amazing looking, they will last an exceptionally long time if you prep correctly. True, removal is not as easy as nail polish, but it&#x27;s nowhere near as much of a hassle as acrylics or ceramics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Sensationail.

            <li> A little smaller than I thought it would be, but I love the baby soft pink color :-) recommend it</li>
            <li> I love the whole Sensationail line. I have four colors now and absolutely love every one. The application is easy and doesn&#x27;t take much time. The polish lasts for about a week for me because I type a lot at my job. Very high glossy and smooth finish. Will try more colors.</li>
            <li> Great light-pink polish, goes on solid and not translucent like some light pinks tend to do. SensatioNail is definitely one of my favorite gel polishes.</li>
            <li> The color is great and it stays on for two weeks as promised. If I put it on too thick it does not last so I have to be careful not to go over it too many times.</li>
            <li> I have only done one manicure so far, and thus far I like this product. It may be a little less strong than the gel treatments at the salon but I think it takes a little practice. The colour is slightly thinner than a regular nail polish and with practice I think I&#x27;ll get better at it in time, but it looks good and it&#x27;s going to save me a lot in salon visits!</li>
            <li> I am loving it! its an awesome nail gel polish!! beautiful color!! and a wonderful price!! thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I use the raspberry wine and espresso bean regularly so I decided to try a new color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pink chiffon is a pretty shade of cotton candy pink, however it is extremely sheer. I had to put 4 coats on and it is still sheer enough to see slightly through, but the color is now more opaque. Just putting one or two coats on gives you sort of a natural manicure look though it makes your tips look sort of dingy if you don&#x27;t have french white tips. The first coat goes on completely sheer just to give you an idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also have to be careful about the streaking because this color is definitely prone to it...though it gets better with 4 coats. I honestly didn&#x27;t like this color at first but it grew on me. I have olive skin and pastels/taupes don&#x27;t usually look flattering on me. I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments with this color. This shade of pink is very natural but there is enough color there for an impact. It&#x27;s perfect for anyone who wants slightly more than a natural look or anyone who has avoided wearing pink because they thought they were too \\&quot;mature\\&quot; for it.</li>
            <li> The product was sold by Lord N&#x27; Trade.  It arrived very very quickly.  Thumbs up for that.  I ordered the pink chiffon which should be a soft pastel/blush pink (as shown by the product picture, user picture, AND user reviews).  When I opened the bottle, even though the bottle clearly has a label that said &amp;#34;pink chiffon&amp;#34;, the actual polish inside was a HOT PINK.  I&#x27;m a female, and I can distinguish the difference between a hot pink, and a blush pink.  Even a color blind person can tell it&#x27;s completely the wrong color.  That brings me to wonder if the product is a knock-off since it came without any packaging.  I emailed customer service immediately, and they promptly offered a refund but suggesting maybe the picture online is distorting the &amp;#34;shade&amp;#34;.  Like I said, there&#x27;s NO mistaking between a blush pink and a hot pink!  Anyways, I ended up trying the product, and it did work very well.  I used the CND shellac base and top coats along with my hot pink SensatioNail.  I had the polish for about two weeks (enduring moving, and digging in the garden) before I decided to change it.  With proper application, and care, I&#x27;m sure the polish could&#x27;ve lasted a lot longer than 2 weeks.  So overall, everything worked out well.  It was just really odd how a completely wrong color got into a pink chiffon bottle.</li>
            <li> i have been searching for a nice soft pink so i decided to order this color i had no previous experience with the brand but i am so glad i ordered this color it arrived today and i could not wait to use it the product went on smooth coverage was good (i did not use the base or top coat of this product i used another that i previously purchased) i will definately be ordering more colors by sensationail</li>
            <li> I bought the full kit at CVS and it came with this Pink Chiffon color. I&#x27;m very pale skinned and the color looked pretty on my nails. The formula was not my favorite, though. I needed 3 coats to get a uniform pink color and I still could see some streaking. I was laying it on pretty heavy, too and I could still see my tips in certain lights. I hear the other colors have better coverage. I followed the directions exactly and it really did last for 2 weeks. You just need to make sure your cuticles are in top notch condition, away from the polish, and your nails are buffed nice and smooth before you polish. It really looks great, just wish it had better coverage.</li>
            <li> It does actually work, the polish is great. I just don&#x27;t like the removal process but the 2 weeks without touch up may be worth it. ;)</li>
            <li> All Sensationail polishes are very easy to apply. It&#x27;s not thick like some other brands so it&#x27;s easy to get a perfect manicure. Lasts 2 weeks or longer. But removing is really difficult, especially if you use the primer (bonding agent) that comes with the starter kit. Removing can take about an hour (of soaking and scraping), you can reduce removing time by applying primer with a very thin stroke at the tip of the nails only. I have since changed to Shellac product that does not require primer and much easier to remove, with the same wear and tear - 2 weeks or more. If you skip the primer all together, Sensationail will start peeling in 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on my fingers more than a day. I don&#x27;t need nail polish remover. It peals right off.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only on my second application, so keep that in mind, but I did wear the first application out till the first chip and went through the removal process, and have much to say about Sensationail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the application is super easy and much faster than regular polishes. All in all, if you follow the directions exactly, I find that it takes me about 45 minutes to do the full application of 2 color coats and the base and top coat. Compare that to the 2+ HOURS it would usually take me to do the same with regular, non-gel polish, and we are talking a serious time-saver application-wise. If you start to think about nail art, the time saved just gets better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I did my first application the night before I left on vacation... and therefore, after the 45 minutes I allowed myself to do my nails, I immediately had to finish packing. Thus, not more than 5 minutes after curing my topcoat, my nails got the full assault. Needless to say, with normal polish, my clothes and luggage would have ended up wearing more polish than my nails... However, by the time I was out the door and rushing to the airport, my nails were completely FLAWLESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear time: my first chip happened on day 12 of wear. Before this, there was some rubbing off of the \\&quot;cap\\&quot; of my nail, but nothing noticeable unless you looked closely. I&#x27;d say, I first noticed the cap wearing off after day 7 or so as well, so still remarkable wear all the way around. To put it in perspective, before this, my regular polish would last a maximum of 3 days before there was significant wear at the tip of my nail which WAS noticeable, that I would feel the need to touch up. Additionally, with regular polish, I would have been preserving my polish with a new top coat daily or at least every other day, but with Sensationail I did nothing and had a beautiful gloss on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal is a pain... but not a deal-breaker. The majority of the timesaved during application is lost during the removal process, but when you think of the quality of the nails during wear, time saved not applying top coats every day, and the fast application, I think Sensationail is still very worthwhile. Really, it&#x27;s much easier to schedule time for removal of still great looking polish, than to fit in time for a polish as well. All but one of my nails left the removal process undamaged, and I&#x27;m confident that what I learned from the first removal will prevent any recurrent scrapes in the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the main reason I&#x27;m so in love with Sensationail right now, is the quality of my nails after wearing the polish for almost two weeks: my nails are STRONGER than they ever have been before, AND for once all my nails are long at the same time! Since before, with regular polish or none, my nails always would break before they reached my desired length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails really do feel nearly invincible while I&#x27;m wearing Sensationail gel polish, and therefore, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back to regular polish again.</li>
            <li> Love Sensationail products!  This is a great neutral color, easy to apply, lasts me about 7-10 days which is much better than one day I get from regular polish!</li>
            <li> I have been using SensatioNail for a few months and am very pleased with the professional- looking results. The polish goes on smoothly and evenly and the shine lasts forever! My nails are stronger and tend to crack much less often. They are growing and have not been damaged. As a precaution, I remove the polish, use cuticle oil and give my nails a breather for a day, before applying another gel manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must read and follow the directions precisely. The most important thing in removing the gel polish is to make sure you rough up the entire nail surface with the coarse emery board in the kit. It makes all the difference in the world! Follow up by using flat cotton pads (not cotton balls!) cut into fourths and soaked in acetone and tightly wrapped in aluminum foil. Leave on for 15 to 20 minutes. I also invested in the gel polish removal tool that is well worth the $5.00 I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product but wish it had a white color for French manicures. I used another brand of color--Red Carpet LED polish for French manicures, and it worked well with the SensatioNail. (By the way, the SensatioNail pink Chiffon color does not go on well. It&#x27;s streaky.) The more you use this product,  the better you get, but it does take time. Before I retired I would not be willing to spend the time it takes, but now that I have more time, I can save the money I used to spend on nail salons.</li>
            <li> I started doing the gel manicure myself about 8 months ago as I didn&#x27;t want to pay $60 a month for my manicure habit and I used the SensatioNail brand to get me started.  I love this color so much!  It&#x27;s a milky, creamy pink with no glimmer or shimmer to it so if you&#x27;re looking for a sparkly pink, this is NOT the color for you.  I have very fair skin and this color looks great on me as well as on my mom who has a more olive skin tone.  It&#x27;s a great color for any skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used another gel polish brand, as well, and I like this brand much better.  Another reviewer mentioned that 4 coats were needed but I find that 2 coats gives me the coverage I like. This brand is a bit thinner that other brands and I like that in that you can control the color better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this lovely pink polish a try ~ you&#x27;ll be glad you did :)</li>
            <li> This did not shrink up on my nail like other brands. Which is great. I like the pink, it is very soft and pretty. Don&#x27;t like that the bottle is so small, won&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> Great color, one of the best gel brands I have used.</li>
            <li> This polish retails for a much higher price than I was able to get it here. It is the same product as is sold in stores and I have had great success with this brand.</li>
            <li> Just an OK color.  Very pale</li>
