            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>First and foremost, it&#x27;s a great shampoo!</li>
            <li>and I love this product!</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>and I buy the matching conditioner and love it!</li>
            <li>My hair was a medium brown, with warm undertones.</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to use a good conditioner after using the shampoo because it can be a bit drying.</li>
            <li>I really liked the color this gave my hair-</li>
            <li>At the end of the day, I&#x27;m the one that buys it and thinks that it does so use your own judgement.</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>it just smells nice,, i wont buy it again and i am not a blond anymore</li>
            <li>I really liked the color it made my hair.</li>
            <li>Nice Product</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>love love it  ,  its amazing if your really looking for a good lighting shampoo</li>
            <li>/&gt;you wont find any better than this</li>
            <li>At about 3 weeks in, I noticed that I had a lot more breakage than I had ever had before.  </li>
            <li>Works OK as a shampoo.</li>
            <li>I began to feel a tingling, burning sensation on the top of my head...</li>
            <li>It smells like most shampoos and gets the job</li>
            <li>Price was better here</li>
            <li>Love the way this smells and makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I will gladly share.</li>
            <li>I was initially satisfied.</li>
            <li>My hair seemed more frizzy too.</li>
            <li>I bought this because CitreShine is my favorite brand</li>
            <li>This is comparable to the performance and fragrance of my favorite.</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>To be safe I will not use this product more than once a week and will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon.</li>
            <li>so I knew going lighter would damage my hair even more.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is okay.</li>
            <li>I would guess this would be better for oily hair.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It does not have an objectionable smell, and I absolutely love it, so I thought I&#x27;d be okay ordering this item.</li>
            <li>That product works much better than this one in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>be sure to use this with the shampoo</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair light and airy after using!</li>
            <li>Have not notices any more dryness or color fading.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Prior to eliminating this product from my routine, I did not use this product more than once a week.  </li>
            <li>It is shining and more of a strawberry blonde, which works for me as I have a very fair complexion.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many John Frieda hair products and generally I like them because they are great quality and are also affordable.</li>
            <li>Perfect shampoo for any blonde shade, light or darker and even great for color treated blonde hair or highlighted hair!</li>
            <li>Not bad for the money!</li>
            <li>It is easy on your hair and makes it shiny as well as lightens the hair.</li>
            <li>Works fine as a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>There are probably some products that will be more effective if you wish to completely remove all signs of brass caused by lightening rather than coloring over lightened hair.  </li>
            <li>Huge, huge mistake.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years, its my primary shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been alternating my method of washing by co-washing and using sulfate free products.  </li>
            <li>originally I think it made my hair lighter but not anymore.</li>
            <li>My hair was extremely healthy when I first started using Go Blonder.</li>
            <li>However, I will continue to use this product regularly to keep my blonde nice and bright!</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and light when I use it, and the smell is a nice, neutral fragrance.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling stripped, just clean.  </li>
            <li>Between the two, thus far, I have been able to skip TWO root touch-ups!</li>
            <li>Tried this, still using it, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special about it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to change the color, it just makes it very shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>My stylist told me that that was as light as she was going I be able to get my hair without completely frying it.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for any dishwater blonde because it just lifts the color and brightens the different shades we already have in our hair.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair super tangly.</li>
            <li>However, at the time I ordered this product my hair was actually in really great condition considering I was so far from my natural hair color.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Yep - getting bold.</li>
            <li>so your hair is not dull but shiny and beautiful blonde locks!</li>
            <li>Where the other seems to take the lighter strands and make them more sun reactive with that nice multi-lightness-</li>
            <li>(It makes me laugh thinking about it now</li>
            <li>It may not effect others in this way, so it may be worth a try.</li>
            <li>I hoped I would get used to the smell, but have not even been able to try it yet, because my sinuses burn when I get near it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not choosing to recommend this product but every experience is different so choose at your own sake.</li>
            <li>I do not have color treated hair, and I rarely use blow dryers or irons.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been really excited to try it since it&#x27;s peroxide free, unlike many other lightening products.</li>
            <li>All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li>Yay, the hair die only goes so light, so this helps my hair get the rest of the way, I also use it alot on my roots and it helps keep me from having to die it as much :)</li>
            <li>I got very fast results.</li>
            <li>Came very fast.  </li>
            <li>The hair color turned brassy, which gave my now very blonde hair brassy highlights and for some reason the top of my head was just a bunch of brassy.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it like regular shampoo and followed with some more of the purple shampoo.  </li>
            <li>After months of continued use (I purchased my first bottles in October)</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years now, and my hair is still very healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>First a bit about me...</li>
            <li>This shampoo really cleans your hair without leaving it in tangles!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Most will not keep out the yellow - this one does.  </li>
            <li>so it was pretty damaged.</li>
            <li>I intend to return it, but haven&#x27;t been able to handle it enough to even do that.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how to proceed.  </li>
            <li>The top of my head, where I put the most Go Blonde, is not dry and very shinny.  </li>
            <li>However after the second time of using it my hair felt noticably more damaged no matter how much conditioner I added.</li>
            <li>My hair is very healthy and my biggest worry was that this product would destroy it.</li>
            <li>Great smell and gentle, subtle lightening of hair.</li>
            <li>What many manufacturers don&#x27;t realize is that blonde hair -- which is often very light and fine -- cannot tolerate the same chemicals used to give shine to other types of hair.</li>
            <li>I had to get some extra strong conditioner to help it recover.  </li>
            <li>so I certainly don&#x27;t need a shampoo to cause it to fall out as well.  </li>
            <li>I naturally have very light blonde hair, and I want to keep it that way!</li>
            <li>My hair did turn out much lighter.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much change.</li>
            <li>My daughter said she didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in her hair.</li>
            <li>It really brings out the highlights in your hair without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Really lightened my hair well.</li>
            <li>During the summer, I don&#x27;t notice that much of a difference, but do keep using it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>a medium to light shade of blonde.</li>
            <li>I was given a much needed trim and Olaplex treatment which REALLY restored my hair.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really considering just throwing it out and buying the purple toner shampoo.</li>
            <li>This product gave me better results than I expected.</li>
            <li>I went through two bottles of each in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>But, today I got brave (okay desperate) and rubbed it straight into my dry hair, particularly on the top, and left it for about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and was so excited to find it on Amazon, especially with the subscribe and save option!</li>
            <li>First time I used it my hair was soft and silky!</li>
            <li>Hard to be certain, but I think this product is great and really helps to lighten blonde hair.</li>
            <li>(In fact, one tried-and-true treatment is a final rinse of lemon juice, to get hair squeaky clean.)  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my naturally dark blonde/light brown hair within one wash, I think it may have brought out some highlights or made it more of a wheat tone.</li>
            <li>I have now used it five times and it has given me the exact color I was hoping for; a natural sun kissed color.</li>
            <li>It was high-lighted professionally too light and then hair color was added back in to darken it (also at the salon).</li>
            <li>This shampoo seems to produce the kind of brightness blondes are looking for, and I imagine the makers have taken care not to let it be as harsh as the old lemon-juice treatment was.  </li>
            <li>I give this shampoo 2 stars instead of 1 solely because it works as a shampoo and has a decent scent.  </li>
            <li>I let my mousy blonde hair grow naturally until the  light brown was about 10 inches</li>
            <li>My hair grows really quickly so my roots start to show after only about a week after dying.</li>
            <li>and it looks a bit more of a beige color with some white blonde highlights</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that it would work wonderfully for someone with less sensitive skin, but if you have any skin problems it isn&#x27;t worth it :(</li>
            <li>And not to mention how SOFT it is!!</li>
            <li>As far as far as \\&quot;lightening\\&quot; goes, I didn&#x27;t notice very much.  </li>
            <li>I have colored treated hair and this product helps bring out my blonde and helps keep it looking fresh.</li>
            <li>I have naturally darkish blonde hair and this product did not noticeably lighten my hair after going through two full sets (2 bottles of shampoo and two bottles of conditioner).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had strong hair, this happened within a week of using this shampoo and about a month after I had stopped using it my hair finally started growing back.  </li>
            <li>With my light hair after only a short day I get that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look with some shampoos.</li>
            <li>However, I strongly recommend you avoid it at all costs if you are not a natural blonde and have ANY damage to your hair whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo in a local grocery store and used it for the first time this morning.  </li>
            <li>Even after the first time using it my roots seemed &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t stand out as obviously.</li>
            <li>The first time I just shrugged and conditioned with a deep conditioner twice and also used a leave in conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li>Does not damage my hair if consistently conditioned properly after.  </li>
            <li>However, between getting older and getting a real job where I&#x27;m never outdoors, my blonde was turning blah.</li>
            <li>nice plus is that it&#x27;s quite concentrated, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and it also brings out the full spectrum of shades of blonde that are in my otherwise untreated blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;During</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this review now, almost 4 months later because today I threw away my second bottles of shampoo and conditioner while they were partially full.</li>
            <li>so my hair had no real bad reactions to this line of products, would definitely recommend</li>
            <li>Now I have more broken hair than long hair and more brunette hair than blonde hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would strongly recommend using the other product by the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a user of John Frieda products for years, and have been happy with most of their products; however, this product is horrible.  </li>
            <li>While I was going for a light ashy blonde, I ended up with an orangey yellow, even after a second visit.</li>
            <li>I have never gotten results like that with a shampoo before, so I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>it did look brighter and brought out some natural highlights.</li>
            <li>Nothing really worked, I still had yellow streaks in my hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything drastic as far as lightening, just makes your natural highlights pop.</li>
            <li>I am in my 50&#x27;s with (so far) no gray.  </li>
            <li>I do not need to use a conditioner with this either as it leaves my hair soft, silky and manageable.  </li>
            <li>It feels soft and looks shiny after every use.</li>
            <li>It also feels soft and not at all fried.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and shiny and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair drastically changing color.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so some shampoos and soaps irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>No difference in color, reminds me of the old Prell shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve went through many different hair colors the past year</li>
            <li>The first time I used the shampoo as a whole and when I started seeing breakage I began using only a little bit and mixing it with my normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and was pleased with it so now a few years later when I have gone blonde for the summer again</li>
            <li>For me to lose this much hair is not normal, even during a shedding cycle.  </li>
            <li>This product tends to dry the hair out ever so slightly, but that was fine with me because my hair tends to be on the oily side anyway.</li>
            <li>Too bad - it&#x27;s a great idea.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 times so far</li>
            <li>This product helps maintain my natural blonde color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky it only did a little part of my bangs, but had I not caught it</li>
            <li>my naturally medium blonde hair became a pretty dark blonde, almost brown.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really works, I use along with the other items, the Conditioner and the Go Blonder</li>
            <li>When I started using this shampoo, I had naturally dirty blonde hair with bright sun bleached sections framing my face.</li>
            <li>This product did not dry or damage my hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is delicate enough for my gray hair and still leaves it clean and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Lucky for me, I had extremely healthy hair before, so it&#x27;s not too bad, but if your hair is dry to begin with, I would not recommend</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t exactly have the time to go outside everyday</li>
            <li>Sheer blonde doesn&#x27;t bleach, so the color difference isn&#x27;t extreme, but my hair is not nearly as dull.</li>

            <li> I cannot say if this helps someone who already colors or highlights their hair - but for me it&#x27;s a great product and I love it!  </li>
            <li> That said, it is still a good quality shampoo.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get home and wash my hair in good shampoo...</li>
            <li> Just use a good conditioner, I think.</li>
            <li> I think it smells really good too.</li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t good for me.</li>
            <li> Good product and service</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell color lightened any, but I do like the Frieda products and have used them for a good while.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good).</li>
            <li> Good price as well and good find on this product.</li>
            <li> Good to go with no worries.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with this shampoo and have continued to be a happy customer for many years and will continue using it for many more.  </li>
            <li> Plus it smells great too :)</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE JOHN FRIEDA HAIR PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> First and foremost, it&#x27;s a great shampoo!</li>
            <li> and I love this product!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> and I buy the matching conditioner and love it!</li>
            <li> My hair was a medium brown, with warm undertones.</li>
            <li> Also, be sure to use a good conditioner after using the shampoo because it can be a bit drying.</li>
            <li> I really liked the color this gave my hair-</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, I&#x27;m the one that buys it and thinks that it does so use your own judgement.</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> it just smells nice,, i wont buy it again and i am not a blond anymore</li>
            <li> I really liked the color it made my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice Product</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> love love it  ,  its amazing if your really looking for a good lighting shampoo</li>
            <li> /&gt;you wont find any better than this</li>
            <li> At about 3 weeks in, I noticed that I had a lot more breakage than I had ever had before.  </li>
            <li> Works OK as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I began to feel a tingling, burning sensation on the top of my head...</li>
            <li> It smells like most shampoos and gets the job</li>
            <li> Price was better here</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells and makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I will gladly share.</li>
            <li> I was initially satisfied.</li>
            <li> My hair seemed more frizzy too.</li>
            <li> I bought this because CitreShine is my favorite brand</li>
            <li> This is comparable to the performance and fragrance of my favorite.</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> To be safe I will not use this product more than once a week and will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon.</li>
            <li> so I knew going lighter would damage my hair even more.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is okay.</li>
            <li> I would guess this would be better for oily hair.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It does not have an objectionable smell, and I absolutely love it, so I thought I&#x27;d be okay ordering this item.</li>
            <li> That product works much better than this one in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> be sure to use this with the shampoo</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair light and airy after using!</li>
            <li> Have not notices any more dryness or color fading.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior to eliminating this product from my routine, I did not use this product more than once a week.  </li>
            <li> It is shining and more of a strawberry blonde, which works for me as I have a very fair complexion.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many John Frieda hair products and generally I like them because they are great quality and are also affordable.</li>
            <li> Perfect shampoo for any blonde shade, light or darker and even great for color treated blonde hair or highlighted hair!</li>
            <li> Not bad for the money!</li>
            <li> It is easy on your hair and makes it shiny as well as lightens the hair.</li>
            <li> Works fine as a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> There are probably some products that will be more effective if you wish to completely remove all signs of brass caused by lightening rather than coloring over lightened hair.  </li>
            <li> Huge, huge mistake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, its my primary shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been alternating my method of washing by co-washing and using sulfate free products.  </li>
            <li> originally I think it made my hair lighter but not anymore.</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely healthy when I first started using Go Blonder.</li>
            <li> However, I will continue to use this product regularly to keep my blonde nice and bright!</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and light when I use it, and the smell is a nice, neutral fragrance.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling stripped, just clean.  </li>
            <li> Between the two, thus far, I have been able to skip TWO root touch-ups!</li>
            <li> Tried this, still using it, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special about it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to change the color, it just makes it very shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> My stylist told me that that was as light as she was going I be able to get my hair without completely frying it.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for any dishwater blonde because it just lifts the color and brightens the different shades we already have in our hair.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair super tangly.</li>
            <li> However, at the time I ordered this product my hair was actually in really great condition considering I was so far from my natural hair color.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Yep - getting bold.</li>
            <li> so your hair is not dull but shiny and beautiful blonde locks!</li>
            <li> Where the other seems to take the lighter strands and make them more sun reactive with that nice multi-lightness-</li>
            <li> (It makes me laugh thinking about it now</li>
            <li> It may not effect others in this way, so it may be worth a try.</li>
            <li> I hoped I would get used to the smell, but have not even been able to try it yet, because my sinuses burn when I get near it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not choosing to recommend this product but every experience is different so choose at your own sake.</li>
            <li> I do not have color treated hair, and I rarely use blow dryers or irons.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been really excited to try it since it&#x27;s peroxide free, unlike many other lightening products.</li>
            <li> All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li> Yay, the hair die only goes so light, so this helps my hair get the rest of the way, I also use it alot on my roots and it helps keep me from having to die it as much :)</li>
            <li> I got very fast results.</li>
            <li> Came very fast.  </li>
            <li> The hair color turned brassy, which gave my now very blonde hair brassy highlights and for some reason the top of my head was just a bunch of brassy.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it like regular shampoo and followed with some more of the purple shampoo.  </li>
            <li> After months of continued use (I purchased my first bottles in October)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now, and my hair is still very healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> First a bit about me...</li>
            <li> This shampoo really cleans your hair without leaving it in tangles!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Most will not keep out the yellow - this one does.  </li>
            <li> so it was pretty damaged.</li>
            <li> I intend to return it, but haven&#x27;t been able to handle it enough to even do that.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly how to proceed.  </li>
            <li> The top of my head, where I put the most Go Blonde, is not dry and very shinny.  </li>
            <li> However after the second time of using it my hair felt noticably more damaged no matter how much conditioner I added.</li>
            <li> My hair is very healthy and my biggest worry was that this product would destroy it.</li>
            <li> Great smell and gentle, subtle lightening of hair.</li>
            <li> What many manufacturers don&#x27;t realize is that blonde hair -- which is often very light and fine -- cannot tolerate the same chemicals used to give shine to other types of hair.</li>
            <li> I had to get some extra strong conditioner to help it recover.  </li>
            <li> so I certainly don&#x27;t need a shampoo to cause it to fall out as well.  </li>
            <li> I naturally have very light blonde hair, and I want to keep it that way!</li>
            <li> My hair did turn out much lighter.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much change.</li>
            <li> My daughter said she didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in her hair.</li>
            <li> It really brings out the highlights in your hair without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Really lightened my hair well.</li>
            <li> During the summer, I don&#x27;t notice that much of a difference, but do keep using it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> a medium to light shade of blonde.</li>
            <li> I was given a much needed trim and Olaplex treatment which REALLY restored my hair.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really considering just throwing it out and buying the purple toner shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product gave me better results than I expected.</li>
            <li> I went through two bottles of each in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> But, today I got brave (okay desperate) and rubbed it straight into my dry hair, particularly on the top, and left it for about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and was so excited to find it on Amazon, especially with the subscribe and save option!</li>
            <li> First time I used it my hair was soft and silky!</li>
            <li> Hard to be certain, but I think this product is great and really helps to lighten blonde hair.</li>
            <li> (In fact, one tried-and-true treatment is a final rinse of lemon juice, to get hair squeaky clean.)  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my naturally dark blonde/light brown hair within one wash, I think it may have brought out some highlights or made it more of a wheat tone.</li>
            <li> I have now used it five times and it has given me the exact color I was hoping for; a natural sun kissed color.</li>
            <li> It was high-lighted professionally too light and then hair color was added back in to darken it (also at the salon).</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems to produce the kind of brightness blondes are looking for, and I imagine the makers have taken care not to let it be as harsh as the old lemon-juice treatment was.  </li>
            <li> I give this shampoo 2 stars instead of 1 solely because it works as a shampoo and has a decent scent.  </li>
            <li> I let my mousy blonde hair grow naturally until the  light brown was about 10 inches</li>
            <li> My hair grows really quickly so my roots start to show after only about a week after dying.</li>
            <li> and it looks a bit more of a beige color with some white blonde highlights</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that it would work wonderfully for someone with less sensitive skin, but if you have any skin problems it isn&#x27;t worth it :(</li>
            <li> And not to mention how SOFT it is!!</li>
            <li> As far as far as \\&quot;lightening\\&quot; goes, I didn&#x27;t notice very much.  </li>
            <li> I have colored treated hair and this product helps bring out my blonde and helps keep it looking fresh.</li>
            <li> I have naturally darkish blonde hair and this product did not noticeably lighten my hair after going through two full sets (2 bottles of shampoo and two bottles of conditioner).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had strong hair, this happened within a week of using this shampoo and about a month after I had stopped using it my hair finally started growing back.  </li>
            <li> With my light hair after only a short day I get that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look with some shampoos.</li>
            <li> However, I strongly recommend you avoid it at all costs if you are not a natural blonde and have ANY damage to your hair whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo in a local grocery store and used it for the first time this morning.  </li>
            <li> Even after the first time using it my roots seemed &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t stand out as obviously.</li>
            <li> The first time I just shrugged and conditioned with a deep conditioner twice and also used a leave in conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> Does not damage my hair if consistently conditioned properly after.  </li>
            <li> However, between getting older and getting a real job where I&#x27;m never outdoors, my blonde was turning blah.</li>
            <li> nice plus is that it&#x27;s quite concentrated, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and it also brings out the full spectrum of shades of blonde that are in my otherwise untreated blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;During</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review now, almost 4 months later because today I threw away my second bottles of shampoo and conditioner while they were partially full.</li>
            <li> so my hair had no real bad reactions to this line of products, would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Now I have more broken hair than long hair and more brunette hair than blonde hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would strongly recommend using the other product by the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of John Frieda products for years, and have been happy with most of their products; however, this product is horrible.  </li>
            <li> While I was going for a light ashy blonde, I ended up with an orangey yellow, even after a second visit.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten results like that with a shampoo before, so I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> it did look brighter and brought out some natural highlights.</li>
            <li> Nothing really worked, I still had yellow streaks in my hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything drastic as far as lightening, just makes your natural highlights pop.</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s with (so far) no gray.  </li>
            <li> I do not need to use a conditioner with this either as it leaves my hair soft, silky and manageable.  </li>
            <li> It feels soft and looks shiny after every use.</li>
            <li> It also feels soft and not at all fried.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair drastically changing color.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so some shampoos and soaps irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> No difference in color, reminds me of the old Prell shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve went through many different hair colors the past year</li>
            <li> The first time I used the shampoo as a whole and when I started seeing breakage I began using only a little bit and mixing it with my normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and was pleased with it so now a few years later when I have gone blonde for the summer again</li>
            <li> For me to lose this much hair is not normal, even during a shedding cycle.  </li>
            <li> This product tends to dry the hair out ever so slightly, but that was fine with me because my hair tends to be on the oily side anyway.</li>
            <li> Too bad - it&#x27;s a great idea.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 times so far</li>
            <li> This product helps maintain my natural blonde color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky it only did a little part of my bangs, but had I not caught it</li>
            <li> my naturally medium blonde hair became a pretty dark blonde, almost brown.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really works, I use along with the other items, the Conditioner and the Go Blonder</li>
            <li> When I started using this shampoo, I had naturally dirty blonde hair with bright sun bleached sections framing my face.</li>
            <li> This product did not dry or damage my hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is delicate enough for my gray hair and still leaves it clean and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Lucky for me, I had extremely healthy hair before, so it&#x27;s not too bad, but if your hair is dry to begin with, I would not recommend</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t exactly have the time to go outside everyday</li>
            <li> Sheer blonde doesn&#x27;t bleach, so the color difference isn&#x27;t extreme, but my hair is not nearly as dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde but my hair is no stranger to hair dye and other lightening products</li>
            <li> I have been a long time buyer of the John Frieda Sheer Blonde \\&quot;Highlight</li>
            <li> There is less yellow, and my grey is brighter and shinier too.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to be drying my hair somewhat, but I can live with that.  </li>
            <li> the winter my hair tends to get dull, but this product keeps it looking like naturally summer lightened natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it made my hair much blonder.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve tried different shampoos for grey hair, and home remedies.</li>
            <li> I was born with strawberry blonde hair that has over the years lightened in the summer, darkened in the winter - with quite a few different natural streaks of red/blonde.  </li>
            <li> Now with this shampoo I can count on keeping my hair the same color all year long.  </li>
            <li> I am not a natural blonde, I baturally have medium brown hair and I have been dying my hair for over a decade.</li>
            <li> My previously strong hair became very weak, broke and fell out after using this.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel very dry after using it, so I only use it occasionally now.</li>
            <li> I bought both the shampoo and conditioner, and when used together I definitely notice a subtle difference in the color of my hair (especially compared to when I briefly switched back to normal shampoos/conditioners).</li>
            <li> Also - I have noticed it does tend to dry out my hair so a lot of times, so I will use a conditioner - especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> But I definitely noticed it getting dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> But having been a lifelong blonde, I know that blonde hair benefits from shampoo that removes all residue and build-up.</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo, conditioner, and lightening spray every other day for at least two months, hair got very light and blonde (which was what i wanted), and only dried my hair out a little which was easily fixed with a little product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a while and have noticed that with continued use it has kept getting a bit lighter - and keeps the \\&quot;summer\\&quot; sun-kissed streaks all winter long.  </li>
            <li> As long as you do as it says and use it every day you will see the gradual results.</li>
            <li> I have been numerous shades of blonde, brunette, redhead, and even jet black.</li>
            <li> I recently did a blonde balayage to my hair a week and a half ago.</li>
            <li> Naturally my hair is dark blonde with a very small amount of gray, red and lighter blonde highlights.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d spend my money on the Go Blonder shampoo over the regular Sheer Blonde shampoo, because my hair doesn&#x27;t seem noticeably lighter.</li>
            <li> I picked up this shampoo, and finally, the yellow is lightening up a little, I do see a difference.</li>
            <li> product-- A little more expensive than store-</li>
            <li> After the third time (once a week over a three week period) I noticed I had a &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; of small baby like short hairs around my entire hairline!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is somewhat dry, but it has been through a lot.  </li>
            <li> I figured my scalp was dry due to our harsh climate, and my hair was going through a normal shedding cycle, since that happens every few years for a short duration.  </li>
            <li> hair is dark blonde, and after using this product it went lighter.</li>
            <li> While this shampoo does lighten my dark blonde hair somewhat, it also causes it to fall out by the handful!</li>
            <li> It possibly looked a bit less brassy, but I was still hating my hair.</li>
            <li> I had used John Frieda Sheer Blonde Shampoo in the past as a \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; shampoo, so I thought their lightening shampoo might help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the past few months, I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my hair color, even after spending quite a lot of time in the sun.</li>
            <li> I had a &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; of small baby like short hairs around my entire hairline!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times in the last week and a half.</li>
            <li> also makes my hair feel very dry.  </li>
            <li> I read reviews on how it made peoples hair very dry</li>
            <li> I had used other Sheer Blonde products in the past, so I figured I could try this out.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is totally destroyed its so dead and frizzy</li>
            <li> your hair is still feeling dried out after using the shampoo and leaving the conditioner in, maybe try some extra products like a \\&quot;leave-in conditioner\\&quot; that you apply to damp hair.</li>
            <li> I have allergies to anything that smells and this shampoo can be smelled when it is still in a closed package.  </li>
            <li> I have been washing my hair almost everyday and scrubbing it twice with the shampoo then finishing with the blonde conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna need a good deep conditioner now to repair all the damage this terrible product has done to my hair.</li>
            <li> I alternate between the two products, usually two showers with each.  </li>
            <li> I went to the drug store to look for other products and noticed the Go Blonder.  </li>
            <li> I foresee myself cutting all of my hair short in the near future, so all of my hair will have a chance to grow out together.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because of some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today, after thinking about my hair loss timeline, I realized that my problem may have been due to using this product.  </li>
            <li> the other reviews say this shampoo does leave your hair feeling a little too dry after the shampoo is done</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be a little dry now at the ends.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered this product I had an ombre blonde color, with dark dirty blonde near the roots gradually getting lighter with the tips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde and my hair had gotten very dark to the point that it was light-brown/very dirty blonde.</li>
            <li> To at least get value for what I purchased I only use this product on days when I don&#x27;t have to leave my house.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark hair</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely not worth the damage it&#x27;s doing to my hair.</li>
            <li> I went from being a dark brown (about a level 5)</li>
            <li> I am on day 3 of the Go Blonder system and it slowly pulls out the tones from a shampoo while cleansing and neutralizing all at the same time.</li>
            <li> But, as I seat here typing, my hair is noticeably less brassy.  </li>
            <li> At about 10 days into using this shampoo, I noticed a slight lightening of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I decided to stop bleaching my hair after doing so for 30 odd years.</li>
            <li> and he is a natural dirty blonde</li>
            <li> I have dirty blonde hair and believe it has helped bring out natural highlights.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s also half the cost than buying it from a retailer and you get TWO.  </li>
            <li> I intuitively stopped using this product within a month and a half of purchase, and am STILL losing hair by the handful every time I wash it.  </li>
            <li> I do not dye my hair, and my natural color is a dirty blonde and over the years I feel like it has become a little darker than it used to be.</li>
            <li> look like a frizzy mess now and my hair just feels SO damaged.</li>
            <li> look like a frizzy mess now and my hair just feels SO damaged.</li>
            <li> so my hair Is like a dirty blonde mixed with a redish/orange tint.</li>
            <li> I had gotten my hair lightened a few months ago.</li>
            <li> This will make your hair lighter after a few uses.</li>
            <li> For me it really dried my my hair out.  </li>

            <li> I have tons and tons of short wispy hairs around my hairline (including around and behind my ears)</li>
            <li> I put this on some of my hair a few minutes before showering and it makes highlights in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few weeks, along with the matching conditioner, I began noticing my scalp felt itchy</li>
            <li> Nothing dramatic, but I totally noticed it.</li>
            <li> I tried using this shampoo last summer as well, and both times it has caused a dramatic increase in shedding immediately.</li>
            <li> They just weigh blonde hair down and leave it looking sad and wilted.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it made my sensitive skin break out like crazy around the hairline, covered my shoulders and back in itchy bumps, and dried my hair out quite a bit.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is way too heavy and leaves a residue on my scalp which results in flaking -- and, not from dandruff!  </li>
            <li> After using this my hair has been tingling and burning for the past 3 days.</li>
            <li> Not sure it lightens your hair or not,</li>
            <li> It gradually lightens for a sunkissed blonde look instead of a fake look.</li>
            <li> After I had my son last summer, my hormones went a little crazy and</li>
            <li> The reason why I give it only 3 stars is because I can hardly use this stuff since it gives my scalp itchy patches that I&#x27;m afraid could cause my hair to fall out in those regions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a sensitive scalp or any reaction to hair dyes or anything like that, but this stuff made painful sores and welts on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I ignored the negative reviews and decided to take a chance on this product.</li>
            <li> once a week to recondition my scalp as this product has disrupted that delicate balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would give this a negative star rating if I could.  </li>
            <li> I decided it just wasn&#x27;t making the difference that I wanted, so I ended up getting subtle highlights at the salon.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has also dried out quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this shampoo really dried it out and made it frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I never experienced breakage in my hair which I had read was a common problem with this product</li>
            <li> My hair use to be thick, now it is thin and stringy.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how dry and brittle the shampoo made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Not happy, would never recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It made my hair look frizzy and thin.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thin now,</li>
            <li> Not that it was flawed</li>
            <li> I have noticed no difference in my hair and even worse, its melting my hair!</li>
            <li> I use this with the conditioner and it&#x27;s the only product that doesn&#x27;t make my hair horrible...</li>
            <li> So frustrating!</li>
            <li> I knew when I got these products that they had a bleach product and were dangerous.</li>
            <li> Um, no, I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Wondering if some of the people that says this worked are just experiencing a placebo effect :(</li>
            <li> Dries your hair out terribly!  </li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible I used this hoping to lighten my highlights.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> This is the WORST shampoo I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, its my primary shampoo. Once a week use a clarifying shampoo to get rid of the build up this shampoo can creat.</li>
            <li> Yay, the hair die only goes so light, so this helps my hair get the rest of the way, I also use it alot on my roots and it helps keep me from having to die it as much :)</li>
            <li> I had gotten my hair lightened a few months ago. My hair was a medium brown, with warm undertones. While I was going for a light ashy blonde, I ended up with an orangey yellow, even after a second visit. My stylist told me that that was as light as she was going I be able to get my hair without completely frying it. She suggested I try a lightening and/or tone correcting shampoo/conditioner. I bought this, and the John Frieda Colour Renew (shampoo only for both). I alternate between the two products, usually two showers with each.  My hair did turn out much lighter. Unfortunately, it has also dried out quite a bit. Lucky for me, I had extremely healthy hair before, so it&#x27;s not too bad, but if your hair is dry to begin with, I would not recommend this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said above, I purchased the shampoos only. I have a great conditioner that restores a lot of moisture. I continue using that to try to offset the drying effect the shampoo has.</li>
            <li> Naturally my hair is dark blonde with a very small amount of gray, red and lighter blonde highlights. It was high-lighted professionally too light and then hair color was added back in to darken it (also at the salon). The hair color turned brassy, which gave my now very blonde hair brassy highlights and for some reason the top of my head was just a bunch of brassy.  (It makes me laugh thinking about it now but...I just wanted to scream!!!). The salon was out of toner and said it would only damage my hair anyway.  So, I went to another salon.  A stylist there did not think that a toner was going to help, but only damage my hair.  She recommended 10 minutes of purple shampoo and 5 of blue conditioner.  So, I bought these and went home and did as she recommended.  I didn&#x27;t see much change. I went to the drug store to look for other products and noticed the Go Blonder.  The first time I used it like regular shampoo and followed with some more of the purple shampoo.  It possibly looked a bit less brassy, but I was still hating my hair. But, today I got brave (okay desperate) and rubbed it straight into my dry hair, particularly on the top, and left it for about 3 minutes.  I also used the purple shampoo, leaving it only about 1 minute, and deep conditioned for 30 minutes.  But, as I seat here typing, my hair is noticeably less brassy.  It is shining and more of a strawberry blonde, which works for me as I have a very fair complexion.  It is somewhat dry, but it has been through a lot.  The top of my head, where I put the most Go Blonde, is not dry and very shinny.  There are probably some products that will be more effective if you wish to completely remove all signs of brass caused by lightening rather than coloring over lightened hair.  But, since I needed to just lighten up my hair a bit, this worked. Perhaps it was really only removing the color that had been added back in.</li>
            <li> After I had my son last summer, my hormones went a little crazy and my naturally medium blonde hair became a pretty dark blonde, almost brown. I had used John Frieda Sheer Blonde Shampoo in the past as a \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; shampoo, so I thought their lightening shampoo might help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past few months, I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my hair color, even after spending quite a lot of time in the sun. That said, it is still a good quality shampoo. My hair feels soft and light when I use it, and the smell is a nice, neutral fragrance. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d spend my money on the Go Blonder shampoo over the regular Sheer Blonde shampoo, because my hair doesn&#x27;t seem noticeably lighter. Might be time to go to the salon instead.</li>
            <li> All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li> If you color your hair blonde and have the problem of it turning orange, use this shampoo. It definitely works.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really works, I use along with the other items, the Conditioner and the Go Blonder Spray!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dark blonde, and after using this product it went lighter.</li>
            <li> This will make your hair lighter after a few uses. I have never gotten results like that with a shampoo before, so I was pleasantly surprised. However, if your hair is darker than medium blonde, you might end up with a bit of brassiness. Also, be sure to use a good conditioner after using the shampoo because it can be a bit drying.</li>
            <li> I am naturally blonde. However, between getting older and getting a real job where I&#x27;m never outdoors, my blonde was turning blah. I was looking for a way to brighten up without having to bleach. I had used other Sheer Blonde products in the past, so I figured I could try this out. I bought both the shampoo and conditioner, and when used together I definitely notice a subtle difference in the color of my hair (especially compared to when I briefly switched back to normal shampoos/conditioners). Sheer blonde doesn&#x27;t bleach, so the color difference isn&#x27;t extreme, but my hair is not nearly as dull. This product tends to dry the hair out ever so slightly, but that was fine with me because my hair tends to be on the oily side anyway. After months of continued use (I purchased my first bottles in October) I decided it just wasn&#x27;t making the difference that I wanted, so I ended up getting subtle highlights at the salon. However, I will continue to use this product regularly to keep my blonde nice and bright! Plus it smells great too :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the 2 pack is the way to go. It&#x27;s the same price as one bottle is in stores! Great deal.</li>
            <li> I have colored treated hair and this product helps bring out my blonde and helps keep it looking fresh. It has also made my hair noticeably softer</li>
            <li> For me it really dried my my hair out.  I&#x27;m not sure it made my hair much blonder.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE JOHN FRIEDA HAIR PRODUCTS! AMAZING! :D</li>
            <li> love love it  ,  its amazing if your really looking for a good lighting shampoo this is it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you wont find any better than this</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet finished one container of this shampoo, so I don&#x27;t know if it gradually lightens hair or not.  But having been a lifelong blonde, I know that blonde hair benefits from shampoo that removes all residue and build-up. Naturally blonde hair will lose its shine and luster with practically no provocation.  (In fact, one tried-and-true treatment is a final rinse of lemon juice, to get hair squeaky clean.)  This shampoo seems to produce the kind of brightness blondes are looking for, and I imagine the makers have taken care not to let it be as harsh as the old lemon-juice treatment was.  It doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling stripped, just clean.  What many manufacturers don&#x27;t realize is that blonde hair -- which is often very light and fine -- cannot tolerate the same chemicals used to give shine to other types of hair. They just weigh blonde hair down and leave it looking sad and wilted.  This shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to resort to such chemicals to produce shine. It&#x27;s all about lightness and brightness.&lt;br /&gt;Another nice plus is that it&#x27;s quite concentrated, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I give this shampoo 2 stars instead of 1 solely because it works as a shampoo and has a decent scent.  However, if you want blonde hair, don&#x27;t use this shampoo.  When I started using this shampoo, I had naturally dirty blonde hair with bright sun bleached sections framing my face. Yet, I wanted to have lighter hair without dying it. At about 10 days into using this shampoo, I noticed a slight lightening of my hair.  At about 3 weeks in, I noticed that I had a lot more breakage than I had ever had before.  I kept using the shampoo for another couple weeks until I saw that my hair was darker than before I started using the shampoo.  What I realized is that the hair the shampoo turned blonde it subsequently weakened to the point of breaking.  It also weakened and broke my naturally blonde hair. Now I have more broken hair than long hair and more brunette hair than blonde hair. I foresee myself cutting all of my hair short in the near future, so all of my hair will have a chance to grow out together.  It is a shame that such a simple product can cause such damage.</li>
            <li> I decided to stop bleaching my hair after doing so for 30 odd years. I let my mousy blonde hair grow naturally until the  light brown was about 10 inches and then my sister recommended  this product along with the accompanying shampoo and lightening spray. The results speak for themselves</li>
            <li> I really liked the color this gave my hair- it did look brighter and brought out some natural highlights. Unfortunately it made my sensitive skin break out like crazy around the hairline, covered my shoulders and back in itchy bumps, and dried my hair out quite a bit. I&#x27;m sure that it would work wonderfully for someone with less sensitive skin, but if you have any skin problems it isn&#x27;t worth it :(</li>
            <li> Works OK as a shampoo. My daughter said she didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in her hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo in a local grocery store and used it for the first time this morning.  I am at work and about an hour ago I began to feel a tingling, burning sensation on the top of my head...I think it&#x27;s this shampoo.  Can&#x27;t wait to get home and wash my hair in good shampoo...this stuff will be going in the trash today.  I take medicines that contribute to hair loss so I certainly don&#x27;t need a shampoo to cause it to fall out as well.  Not happy, would never recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, but I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair getting any blonder. It makes my hair feel very dry after using it, so I only use it occasionally now. I&#x27;m only using it to get rid of it. It doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does and it dries out my hair, so I won&#x27;t ever buy this line of products again.</li>
            <li> My gray hair picks up a yellow tinge from our well water and copper pipes.  For years I&#x27;ve tried different shampoos for grey hair, and home remedies. Nothing really worked, I still had yellow streaks in my hair.  I picked up this shampoo, and finally, the yellow is lightening up a little, I do see a difference. There is less yellow, and my grey is brighter and shinier too.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to be drying my hair somewhat, but I can live with that.  Just use a good conditioner, I think.</li>
            <li> I naturally have very light blonde hair, and I want to keep it that way! I can definitely see a difference after using this product. My hair just looks brighter. I think it smells really good too. I have been using this product for several years now, and my hair is still very healthy and soft. I will be using this shampoo forever!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! First and foremost, it&#x27;s a great shampoo! With my light hair after only a short day I get that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look with some shampoos. I NEVER get that with this stuff. It smells like most shampoos and gets the job done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of whether it lightens, that&#x27;s debatable. I think that it does, but several people that I have asked says it makes no difference. So the jury is still out. At the end of the day, I&#x27;m the one that buys it and thinks that it does so use your own judgement.</li>
            <li> Works fine as a shampoo.  As far as far as \\&quot;lightening\\&quot; goes, I didn&#x27;t notice very much.  I think my hair seemed a bit shinier and maybe just a touch lighter but I wouldn&#x27;t have noticed a change if I hadn&#x27;t been looking for it.</li>
            <li> Use all the time. Covers mygray</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used John Frieda for years and I love this product! It really brings out the highlights in your hair without drying it out. I was even told by my hair dresser that I should use this even on color treated blonde hair. It takes all the products we put in while styling out so your hair is not dull but shiny and beautiful blonde locks! It doesn&#x27;t do anything drastic as far as lightening, just makes your natural highlights pop. Perfect shampoo for any blonde shade, light or darker and even great for color treated blonde hair or highlighted hair!</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo, the matching conditioner and the spray for years.  It has saved me a fortune in salon trips.  This is perfect for any dishwater blonde because it just lifts the color and brightens the different shades we already have in our hair.  If you are like me, you had hair that almost turned white in the summer as a child, just from playing and swimming in the sun all summer.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  Unfortunately, this shampoo really dried it out and made it frizzy.  I had to get some extra strong conditioner to help it recover.  Too bad - it&#x27;s a great idea.  It just wasn&#x27;t good for me.</li>
            <li> I have used John Frieda Sheer Blonde hairspray and lightening spray treatment for a number of years.  I thought this product would provide the same quality, but that is not the case.  This shampoo is way too heavy and leaves a residue on my scalp which results in flaking -- and, not from dandruff!  To at least get value for what I purchased I only use this product on days when I don&#x27;t have to leave my house.</li>
            <li> Tried this, still using it, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special about it.  It does have a silky feel while washing your hair.</li>
            <li> Great product-- A little more expensive than store- Hair feels like silk after washing</li>
            <li> Really lightened my hair well. I used the shampoo, conditioner, and lightening spray every other day for at least two months, hair got very light and blonde (which was what i wanted), and only dried my hair out a little which was easily fixed with a little product. I&#x27;m a natural blonde but my hair is no stranger to hair dye and other lightening products so my hair had no real bad reactions to this line of products, would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> This is my regular shampoo although I do change periodically and go back to this.  Price was better here so I ordered from here.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for gray hair!  My hair tends to be a little dry now at the ends.  This shampoo is delicate enough for my gray hair and still leaves it clean and manageable.  I no longer need to condition every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells and makes my hair feel.  Have been using it for years.  I get so many compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li> First a bit about me... I cannot say if this helps someone who already colors or highlights their hair - but for me it&#x27;s a great product and I love it!  I am in my 50&#x27;s with (so far) no gray.  I was born with strawberry blonde hair that has over the years lightened in the summer, darkened in the winter - with quite a few different natural streaks of red/blonde.  Now with this shampoo I can count on keeping my hair the same color all year long.  I have been using it for a while and have noticed that with continued use it has kept getting a bit lighter - and keeps the \\&quot;summer\\&quot; sun-kissed streaks all winter long.  During the summer, I don&#x27;t notice that much of a difference, but do keep using it.  Also - I have noticed it does tend to dry out my hair so a lot of times, so I will use a conditioner - especially in the winter.  I am very happy with this shampoo and have continued to be a happy customer for many years and will continue using it for many more.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This shampoo really cleans your hair without leaving it in tangles! It doesn&#x27;t seem to change the color, it just makes it very shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> My favorite product delivered on time!!</li>
            <li> I read these reviews and thought, surely these people complaining of their hair falling out are just wrong.  Um, no, I was wrong! I should have heeded their warning. I have photos. It freaking happened. My hair, which never gets in the drain, or sink, or fills up my hairbrush, began clogging the sink and tub. My son was taking a bath one day and asked, \\&quot;What&#x27;s this mommy?\\&quot; It was a clump of my freaking hair! I&#x27;ve always had strong hair, this happened within a week of using this shampoo and about a month after I had stopped using it my hair finally started growing back.  I have photos to prove this.  I will gladly share. DO NOT USE THIS!</li>
            <li> Dries your hair out terribly!  I&#x27;ve never had a sensitive scalp or any reaction to hair dyes or anything like that, but this stuff made painful sores and welts on my scalp.  And it takes MONTHS to actually lighten your hair.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Drying. No noticable lightening. Made my hair super tangly. Terrible.</li>
            <li> Good product and service</li>
            <li> Did not work for my hair.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. It was exactly what I was expecting. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have tried many John Frieda hair products and generally I like them because they are great quality and are also affordable. I ignored the negative reviews and decided to take a chance on this product. Huge, huge mistake. I am not a natural blonde, I baturally have medium brown hair and I have been dying my hair for over a decade. I have been numerous shades of blonde, brunette, redhead, and even jet black. When I ordered this product I had an ombre blonde color, with dark dirty blonde near the roots gradually getting lighter with the tips a medium to light shade of blonde. My hair has been through the ringer several times because of the chemical processes I have put it through when changing my hair color on a whim. However, at the time I ordered this product my hair was actually in really great condition considering I was so far from my natural hair color. My hair grows really quickly so my roots start to show after only about a week after dying. I chose the ombre color to minimize the roots, but I was hoping using this product would help to &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; in my roots a bit with the rest of my hair so I could wait a while longer before recoloring.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle. I honestly wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;The result:&lt;br /&gt;This product DID help blend in my roots. Even after the first time using it my roots seemed &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t stand out as obviously. However, I strongly recommend you avoid it at all costs if you are not a natural blonde and have ANY damage to your hair whatsoever. I was shocked at how dry and brittle the shampoo made my hair feel. The first time I just shrugged and conditioned with a deep conditioner twice and also used a leave in conditioner afterwards. I was initially satisfied. However after the second time of using it my hair felt noticably more damaged no matter how much conditioner I added. My hair seemed more frizzy too. I used this product a total of three times. After the third time (once a week over a three week period) I noticed I had a &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; of small baby like short hairs around my entire hairline!&lt;br /&gt;Now when I pull my hair into a ponytail or braid I have tons and tons of short wispy hairs around my hairline (including around and behind my ears) that literally broke off.&lt;br /&gt;I look like a frizzy mess now and my hair just feels SO damaged. I have tons of split ends that were NOT there before using this product, even after tons of chemical processes.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. DONT RISK IT!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!oticed I had a &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; of small baby like short hairs around my entire hairline!&lt;br /&gt;Now when I pull my hair into a ponytail or braid I have tons and tons of short wispy hairs around my hairline (including around and behind my ears) that literally broke off.&lt;br /&gt;I look like a frizzy mess now and my hair just feels SO damaged.

            <li> I bought this because CitreShine is my favorite brand but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere and this has some of the same ingredients.  This is comparable to the performance and fragrance of my favorite. I can&#x27;t tell if it does anything to lighten my hair, but since that&#x27;s not the reason I bought it, I don&#x27;t care.  Really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I thought after reading up on this product and the testimonies, that it&#x27;d work for me, but it did not. Not that it was flawed it was simply not for someone with darker hair (as per my sister the stylist).</li>
            <li> Terrible I used this hoping to lighten my highlights. Now my hair is totally destroyed its so dead and frizzy I&#x27;m gonna need a good deep conditioner now to repair all the damage this terrible product has done to my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times in the last week and a half. I have noticed no difference in my hair and even worse, its melting my hair! I&#x27;m lucky it only did a little part of my bangs, but had I not caught it I might have a bald spot along my hair line! Awful. I&#x27;m going to write to the manufacturer because since there is no peroxide in the product this should not happen!!</li>
            <li> This is the WORST shampoo I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;1. My previously strong hair became very weak, broke and fell out after using this. It made my hair look frizzy and thin. I had to use high-end \\&quot;fortifying\\&quot; shampoos to get my hair back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;2. My blonde hair didn&#x27;t get any blonder&lt;br /&gt;3. I don&#x27;t like the smell&lt;br /&gt;Please do not buy this. If you want lighter hair, dye it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Okay so my hair Is like a dirty blonde mixed with a redish/orange tint. And after only two uses of this my hair has already gotten noticeably lighter!!! And not to mention how SOFT it is!! I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair! Like omg fr. I bought the lightening shampoo&amp;conditioner at Meijer for $10 and I suggest you do the same!!! (:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and the conditioner twice. I&#x27;d been really excited to try it since it&#x27;s peroxide free, unlike many other lightening products. I noticed a difference in my naturally dark blonde/light brown hair within one wash, I think it may have brought out some highlights or made it more of a wheat tone. Nothing dramatic, but I totally noticed it. The reason why I give it only 3 stars is because I can hardly use this stuff since it gives my scalp itchy patches that I&#x27;m afraid could cause my hair to fall out in those regions. When I use both the shampoo and conditioner I do a deep condition with a different brand afterwards and that seems to lessen the itchiness. To be safe I will not use this product more than once a week and will not be repurchasing. It may not effect others in this way, so it may be worth a try.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell color lightened any, but I do like the Frieda products and have used them for a good while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde and my hair had gotten very dark to the point that it was light-brown/very dirty blonde. I didn&#x27;t exactly have the time to go outside everyday so I decided to try this stuff out. I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 times so far and I already see a smidge of color change (maybe only a couple shades but I actually notice something so that&#x27;s good). This is a shampoo that you&#x27;re going to need to stick with for a while to see results in the color department.&lt;br /&gt;Like the other reviews say this shampoo does leave your hair feeling a little too dry after the shampoo is done but all I do to correct it is simply leave my conditioner in for an extra 5 minutes to help it absorb some of the extra moisture that was lost. I actually also use the same brand as my conditioner and it&#x27;s been working great so far.&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is still feeling dried out after using the shampoo and leaving the conditioner in, maybe try some extra products like a \\&quot;leave-in conditioner\\&quot; that you apply to damp hair.</li>
            <li> I used this 4x and it did not work for me.  I have ash blonde hair (dyed) and it looks a bit more of a beige color with some white blonde highlights so I used this in hopes it would make my hair a bit lighter but all it did was actually take out the highlights and make my hair overall darker as well as brassy.  also makes my hair feel very dry.  my husband also used this and he is a natural dirty blonde and this did nothing to his hair as well.  Wondering if some of the people that says this worked are just experiencing a placebo effect :(</li>
            <li> Very good product. Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon.</li>
            <li> Have been using this shampoo for about 5 years now.  I have white hair and went through lots of shampoo before finding this one. Most will not keep out the yellow - this one does.  I do not need to use a conditioner with this either as it leaves my hair soft, silky and manageable.  Last shampoo I will ever buy unless its taken off the market.</li>
            <li> I use this with the conditioner and it&#x27;s the only product that doesn&#x27;t make my hair horrible... originally I think it made my hair lighter but not anymore.</li>
            <li> Hard to be certain, but I think this product is great and really helps to lighten blonde hair. I have dirty blonde hair and believe it has helped bring out natural highlights.</li>
            <li> I recently did a blonde balayage to my hair a week and a half ago. I&#x27;ve went through many different hair colors the past year so it was pretty damaged. I have naturally dark hair so I knew going lighter would damage my hair even more. While getting my hair done I was given a much needed trim and Olaplex treatment which REALLY restored my hair. It felt and looked great. I decided to get this shampoo rather than the purple shampoo because I wanted to gradually get lighter, while avoiding any brassiness. Only after three uses my hair has gotten so frizzy and is obviously breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it did lighten my hair and lighten the highlights in my hair. But I definitely noticed it getting dry and frizzy. The halo around my hairline is breaking. I&#x27;m embarrassed by the amount of whispy 2-inch pieces of hair all around my head! The first time I used the shampoo as a whole and when I started seeing breakage I began using only a little bit and mixing it with my normal shampoo. There&#x27;s still results of getting lighter but it&#x27;s definitely not worth the damage it&#x27;s doing to my hair. At this point I&#x27;m just using it because I paid almost 9 dollars for it but I&#x27;m really considering just throwing it out and buying the purple toner shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am on day 3 of the Go Blonder system and it slowly pulls out the tones from a shampoo while cleansing and neutralizing all at the same time.</li>
            <li> After using this my hair has been tingling and burning for the past 3 days. Everywhere I get the sensation theres scabs and bald spots. Use at your own risk!</li>
            <li> Great deal! I love the shampoo and conditioner. I have well water and this shampoo keeps me blonde instead of mousy brown.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is okay. Not sure it lightens your hair or not, but it dries my hair out. I would guess this would be better for oily hair.</li>
            <li> This product gave me better results than I expected. I was skeptical at first because of some of the reviews. I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about when they say it doesn&#x27;t work or that it ruined their hair. I do not dye my hair, and my natural color is a dirty blonde and over the years I feel like it has become a little darker than it used to be. My hair is very healthy and my biggest worry was that this product would destroy it. This product did not dry or damage my hair. It feels soft and looks shiny after every use. I noticed a difference in the color of my hair after using it twice with the matching conditioner. I have now used it five times and it has given me the exact color I was hoping for; a natural sun kissed color. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months now and my hair is noticeably, but not dramatically lighter.  I&#x27;m happy with that.  It also feels soft and not at all fried.</li>
            <li> I have naturally darkish blonde hair and this product did not noticeably lighten my hair after going through two full sets (2 bottles of shampoo and two bottles of conditioner). I will not buy it again because it didn&#x27;t actually enhance my color to any shade lighter like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and was so excited to find it on Amazon, especially with the subscribe and save option! This product helps maintain my natural blonde color and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> While this shampoo does lighten my dark blonde hair somewhat, it also causes it to fall out by the handful! Even after several washes with a different shampoo, I am still losing 50+ strands of hair with each wash. Who cares if it lightens my hair? I would not have anything left to lighten if I continued to use this shampoo. I tried using this shampoo last summer as well, and both times it has caused a dramatic increase in shedding immediately. I will not be trying it a third time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update ~ Over 3 months later, and my hair is still falling out with each shampoo and even when I run my hands through my hair. So frustrating!</li>
            <li> As long as you do as it says and use it every day you will see the gradual results. Its definitely helping to keep my roots in check. &#x3D;) I Use this with the \\&quot;matching\\&quot; conditioner for best results. Then I follow-up with John Frieda (Yes, I try to stay with the same Brands) Sheer Blonde Controlled Lightening Spray. Between the two, thus far, I have been able to skip TWO root touch-ups!</li>
            <li> Nice. I put this on some of my hair a few minutes before showering and it makes highlights in my hair.</li>
            <li> Great smell and gentle, subtle lightening of hair. Leaves my hair soft and shiny and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair drastically changing color.</li>
            <li> Didnt do anything to my blond hair it just smells nice,, i wont buy it again and i am not a blond anymore</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so some shampoos and soaps irritate my skin. This shampoo does not... and it also brings out the full spectrum of shades of blonde that are in my otherwise untreated blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;During the winter my hair tends to get dull, but this product keeps it looking like naturally summer lightened natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li> After reading some of these reviews I was nervous to try the product. I have used it a few times and yes it makes my hair a bit drier. However it has peroxide so that wasn&#x27;t a surprise to me. I do like the smell and it does lather up well. I use conditioner and leave in conditioner by John Frieda. Anytime you put any product in your hair to lighten it, it can damage your hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this and it is working well. It is easy on your hair and makes it shiny as well as lightens the hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even be in the same room with this shampoo or handle it.  I have allergies to anything that smells and this shampoo can be smelled when it is still in a closed package.  I hoped I would get used to the smell, but have not even been able to try it yet, because my sinuses burn when I get near it.  I intend to return it, but haven&#x27;t been able to handle it enough to even do that.  I don&#x27;t know exactly how to proceed.  I bought another John Frieda  product.  It does not have an objectionable smell, and I absolutely love it, so I thought I&#x27;d be okay ordering this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and was pleased with it so now a few years later when I have gone blonde for the summer again and I&#x27;d like to maintain the brightness I bought this. I read reviews on how it made peoples hair very dry and I was weary to order even though I&#x27;ve used it before. First time I used it my hair was soft and silky! And it smells like the salons shampoo! I also use the matching conditioner and even after 2 washes I can tell it has started to lighten a lot!</li>
            <li> No difference in color, reminds me of the old Prell shampoo. It dries my blond hair out and the conditioner is like water</li>
            <li> I ordered the shampoo, conditioner, and spray back in January of this year. I began using them all as soon as they came. I got very fast results. Once I ran out of the spray, I just continued to use the shampoo and conditioner by themselves. I went through two bottles of each in a reasonable amount of time. I really liked the color it made my hair. I&#x27;m writing this review now, almost 4 months later because today I threw away my second bottles of shampoo and conditioner while they were partially full. I knew when I got these products that they had a bleach product and were dangerous. I threw away the shampoo and conditioner because of the way my hands burned and blistered every time I used the product. I never experienced breakage in my hair which I had read was a common problem with this product but it was the condition that it put my skin in that made me decide to throw it out and to give it a 3-star rating. I&#x27;m not choosing to recommend this product but every experience is different so choose at your own sake.</li>
            <li> I had dyed my hair hoping to lighten it when that didn&#x27;t work I bought this along with the conditioner thinking maybe it would help... It didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;d don&#x27;t know what this is supposed to lighten but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time buyer of the John Frieda Sheer Blonde \\&quot;Highlight Activating\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner... That product works much better than this one in my opinion.  This product has zero effect on my hair.  Where the other seems to take the lighter strands and make them more sun reactive with that nice multi-lightness-shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend using the other product by the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> everything was satisfactory for both the k-cups &amp; the shampoo.</li>
            <li> be sure to use this with the shampoo</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo all the time and I buy the matching conditioner and love it! I works just how I would want it to! It gradually lightens for a sunkissed blonde look instead of a fake look. I like the smell and it makes my hair light and airy after using! Very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> this is my brand of choice,  Have blonde hair that gets colored and highlights in every 4 weeks.  This does what it says brightens cleans well takes out any brazenness.  I also use this brand conditioner.  Have not notices any more dryness or color fading.  Nice Product I also use the mousse.  Shipped quick and well packaged.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels great after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been to the hairdresser for coloring in 2 years!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great! I went from being a dark brown (about a level 5) back to a blonde at the salon (about a 7). She bleached my hair then colored it. It was still a bit orangy so she told me to use the blonde shampoo. I have been washing my hair almost everyday and scrubbing it twice with the shampoo then finishing with the blonde conditioner as well. There it a noticible lighter difference in the shade of my hair. And it&#x27;s also half the cost than buying it from a retailer and you get TWO.  Not bad for the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of John Frieda products for years, and have been happy with most of their products; however, this product is horrible.  I purchased this product back in August from a local store.  I do not have color treated hair, and I rarely use blow dryers or irons.  My hair was extremely healthy when I first started using Go Blonder. After using this product for a few weeks, along with the matching conditioner, I began noticing my scalp felt itchy and I was losing hair.  It did not cross my mind that this product could be the problem, since I&#x27;ve used John Frieda for years without any issues.  I figured my scalp was dry due to our harsh climate, and my hair was going through a normal shedding cycle, since that happens every few years for a short duration.  This time however, the hair loss did not stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to eliminating this product from my routine, I did not use this product more than once a week.  Knowing anything that lightens has the potential of being damaging, I alternated between this product, and others I had in order to avoid over doing it.  As the hair loss continued, I began to panic. I intuitively stopped using this product within a month and a half of purchase, and am STILL losing hair by the handful every time I wash it.  For me to lose this much hair is not normal, even during a shedding cycle.  My hair use to be thick, now it is thin and stringy. I cringe every time I need to take a shower out of fear that I will once again pick up another handful of my once beautiful hair to throw in the trash.  My hair is so thin now, even my husband who massages my head on occasion has noticed that my hair is extremely thin and has expressed his concern for me since he knows how important a woman&#x27;s hair is to her. I have breakage throughout my scalp, especially the crown, that is about 1-2 inches in length, and the itchy scalp is still an issue.  I&#x27;ve done everything I can to stop the hair loss, to no avail.  I&#x27;ve been alternating my method of washing by co-washing and using sulfate free products.  I&#x27;m also deep conditioning my scalp with castor oil once a week to recondition my scalp as this product has disrupted that delicate balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, after thinking about my hair loss timeline, I realized that my problem may have been due to using this product.  I did a search to see if I could find anyone else who has had this experience. I&#x27;ve seen multiple comments regarding this product and the spray product where others are having the same results.  Bottom line...IF YOU VALUE YOUR HAIR, DON&#x27;T RISK IT.  I have about 1/3 of the hair I had four months ago, and am still losing it, even though I stopped using these products over a month ago.  I would give this a negative star rating if I could.  Hopefully, my opinion will keep another woman from this horrible experience.</li>
            <li> the wife loves this product and uses it all the time. Good price as well and good find on this product.</li>
            <li> Good to go with no worries.  Does not damage my hair if consistently conditioned properly after.  Came very fast.  Blinked and it was here.  Superb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using another of John Frieda&#x27;s shampoos in the Sheer Blonde formula. This time I&#x27;m going wit the Go Blonder. Yep - getting bold.</li>
