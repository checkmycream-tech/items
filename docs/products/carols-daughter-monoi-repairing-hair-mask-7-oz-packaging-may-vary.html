            <li>I tried this over and over, gave it to friends, no one saw any positive difference but a great smell.</li>
            <li>But I think I like this even better than the matching shampoo and conditioner.  </li>

            <li>Best deep conditioner on the market!!!!</li>

            <li>Just apply, wait, rinse, and enjoy!</li>

            <li>If your reading reviews and wondering whether or not you should give it a shot, go for it:)</li>
            <li>I love carol&#x27;s daughter monio repairing hair mask.</li>
            <li>love it  ....</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic too!</li>
            <li>In my hair arsenal for sure.</li>
            <li>Probably not for everyone, but I sure love this product.</li>
            <li>It really does what it claims it will do and smells great -</li>
            <li>And it makes my hair a lot softer and it straightens better after using it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair so soft and shiny and smells gorgeous!</li>
            <li>/&gt;i will say though, that that the cost is rather high, but otherwise -- great product.</li>
            <li>luckily my mom bought it for me and let me tell YOU, this product is like magic!</li>
            <li>LOVE the smell of this hair mask and LOVE that it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love CD&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner, but can&#x27;t say that this mask does anything special for my hair.</li>
            <li>It sure did make my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>I continue to use the conditioner because it smells great and leaves my washed hair feeling soft</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s true!  </li>
            <li>This makes my hair easily detangle, smells like gardenia flowers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an easy to use system.</li>
            <li>thing to note: this has a strong scent.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy, easily damaged caucasian hair that is coloured every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a couple of inches below my shoulders so now products that are easy to comb out are important.  </li>
            <li>If my fine hair had a snag or tangle, forget it - a chunk of like 20 strands would come out.</li>
            <li>I have fine, highlighted hair and it keeps the highlights</li>
            <li>I have fine colored hair shoulder length, wavy/slightly curly.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s on the fine side.</li>
            <li>it really helps my hair to grow and become healthy!</li>
            <li>This conditioner no only smells nice, but I&#x27;m actually able to get a comb/brush through it!</li>
            <li>I had little breakage which is GREAT for me...and NO KNOTS!!</li>
            <li>after ONE use, my hair was softer, it straightened better, i saw less breakage and it smells good !</li>
            <li>since i discovered this product over two years ago, I havent stopped using it and my hair has changed a lot for the better, this hydrates the hair in an amazing way, it leaves it shinny, soft, removes the frizziness, helps with split ends</li>
            <li>I have seen fantastic results from using this hair mask.</li>
            <li>As a result the ends of my hair are silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product to try over holidays and on the whole was satisfied with the product&#x27;s smell and texture which makes it ideal for detangling hair and as a deep conditioner after shampooing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a light floral and almost nutty scent that lasts</li>
            <li>I use the entire system of products and my hair is in great condition.</li>
            <li>Use this product last night after washing with my Wen shampoo as a DC treatment; my hair was silky smooth -- I don&#x27;t think I have ever experienced my hair being so soft and it smells good too.  </li>
            <li>In humid weather I have even left some of the product in my hair, because it also works great as a leave-in.</li>
            <li>The Monoi hair care system by Carol&#x27;s daughter is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>(As a bonus, I find that just having this on my hands to smooth it on my hair, makes my hands noticeably softer!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it once to twice a month for a deep conditioner and am always happy.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth the money if you want healthy hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but it&#x27;s strong.  </li>
            <li>Overall, amazing product!</li>
            <li>It lasts me months, and is so worth the price!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li>this product has made a significant difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love, this is by far my favorite hair mask.</li>
            <li>I heard a lot about this product and many of them were positive.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and it makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I am a mixed chick, and this product worked good for my hair</li>
            <li>The price is better &amp; the shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>I use it at least once each month, and find its moisturizing and conditioning properties to be absolutely wonderful!  </li>
            <li>so I used it again and kept it on much longer and used much more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not cool.</li>
            <li>AND MY HAIR HAS A TREMENDOUS TRANSFORMATION IN</li>
            <li>Have seen tremendous results in just one month of use,</li>
            <li>I use it along with other monoi products, it has been very effective in stopping breaking and shedding, and helping with my hair growth.</li>
            <li>and I am enjoying my new growth</li>
            <li>The Monoi Hair Mask is hands down the best conditioner I have ever used on my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I will continue using it and recommend it to anyone who wants to have soft, manageable, strong and healthy feeling hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this at sephora a year ago when I absolutely killed my hair and this stuff was great.</li>
            <li>Amazing conditioning and deep conditioning power!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of these ingredients in different hair preparations, so it&#x27;s nice to see them all here</li>
            <li>The deep conditioning process does not need heat for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>I love the fact it&#x27;s all natural too</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s completely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the cost put you of, the benefit to your hair is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>....I have fallen in love with my natural hair again.  </li>
            <li>time I open the container, I am greeted by the most lovely, white floral scent (which I love).</li>
            <li>My hair is generally healthy but naturally wavy.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it is pricey, but I think worth it.</li>
            <li>My hair is a bed of well defined, super soft curls that can be easily combed out or finger combed.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner really did DRAMATICALLY reduce breakage, as evidenced by  significantly fewer strands in my bath/shower water.</li>
            <li>I use this once or twice a month or right before getting a protective style.</li>
            <li>After the second use my hair was very strong, I like it</li>
            <li>and I am happy to say that while my hair is growing out past my shoulders</li>
            <li>This product not only smells great but actually does what it says.  </li>
            <li>The price from this seller was reasonable and the shipment arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>and this is my favorite deep conditioner ever!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the thick texture, and fantastic conditioning results I received as well.  </li>
            <li>This works great for my thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty sure this works well for everyone, as the two of us have completely different hair types</li>
            <li>I instantly fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Some were saying I will be able to see instant result.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I am using this product</li>
            <li>at the price point that this sells for, I will most definitely repurchase this when I run out.</li>
            <li>Hair is much stronger!</li>
            <li>The only perk really was that it made my hair smell AWESOME, even after shampooing a few days after using it.</li>
            <li>I get about 6-8 applications per jar; that said I apply the product very liberally, so others may be able to get a few more applications out of it than I do.</li>
            <li>I was pretty scared my hair would snap from braiding or combing.  </li>
            <li>As such, it was easy to apply and distribute throughout my hair and my hair soaked it right</li>
            <li>This mask smells amazing, the effect on the hair is nice; and last you for at least 5 applications.</li>
            <li>I love this and plan to buy it for as long as they make the product.</li>
            <li>There is no instruction on the product i.e. how long to leave it on your hair before you wash it out and how many times a week you should use it.</li>
            <li>The smell so lovely and it lingers so long.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s unusual for a hair product, so just be prepared for it.  </li>
            <li>Caucasian female with thin hair and this makes it much stronger and smells awesome.....</li>
            <li>With thinning hair it really helps stop breakage</li>
            <li>I found after using the product I had to layer on multiple layers of conditioner to get the silky smooth look and feel I wanted.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL</li>
            <li>Very upset.</li>
            <li>I will not use as much because I forgot how much this stuff costs</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and my hair seems to be much healthier and very shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve needed this my whole life.</li>
            <li>This product made me change my whole opinion about the state my hair was in.  </li>
            <li>This mask worked very well on my perm relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>Out of everything she gave me, this was my absolute favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not falling out as much.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really care for this product much.  </li>
            <li>but I have 4A/4B hair that does not like too much product</li>
            <li>My hair is far more coarse than my daughters</li>
            <li>I tried it and my hair was even more dry than before!!</li>
            <li>I have used quite a few products and am still trying to find the right one that I can really say that I love and will stick with for my type hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t normally review products, but felt compelled to write one as soon as I jumped out of the shower!</li>
            <li>I love the way this smells and makes my hair pretty soft considering it&#x27;s highlighted and extremely damaged.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super soft, not dry and very shiny!</li>
            <li>Nothing works quite as good as this, not even other more expensive hair mask, and the only thing that makes my hair as smooth as the Monoi Mask is an oil treatment - which I have to leave on for hours and is heaps messier!</li>
            <li>Very good product for weak and fragile hair.</li>
            <li>I just recently got my hair done and the ends were dry and my hair wasn&#x27;t as nice as before.</li>
            <li>Completely wilds out after the beach, hot weather, or a night out.</li>
            <li>My hair is stronger so there is less breakage, and therefore more opportunity for it to grow.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure if you would have different results when using the entire the product line for the Monoi</li>
            <li>This was a decent hair mask.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair mask.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It hydrates very well and leaves hair soft and silky</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it time to time so far and nothing really changes and no difference.</li>
            <li>the is the real deal as far as hair products go</li>
            <li>I just put it on in the shower, throw on a shower cap, shave my legs and do my normal washing then take off the shower cap and rinse.</li>
            <li>I have very thin, long, easily-greasy hair and this conditioner is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Deep conditioner I use, feel the difference right away.</li>
            <li>Following chemo, my kinky hair came back baby fine.  </li>
            <li>My hair is normally quite dry due to color treatment and daily shampooing and all of the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi products have been good for it.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product for natural, Afro-textured hair.  </li>
            <li>It may be a little on the strong side (especially for men), but if you like white floral scents, you will probably really enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>I had better results with regular redken extreme.</li>
            <li>My hair is damaged due to prolonged use of blow drying and color treatment , but this product is keeping it from breaking off completely, I use this fantastic product once a week and use the manoi conditioner in between.  </li>
            <li>The first time I put it on my hair after shampooing my hair instantly felt softer and silkier, and it was a cinch to comb through.</li>
            <li>and I do not have nearly as many split ends as I usually do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually one to spend a lot of money on hair care products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s literally like magic, but I&#x27;m kindof lazy and don&#x27;t use it as often as I should.</li>
            <li>I get my hair wet and put about 1/8 cup on my head and sit out in the sun for at least 3 hours, then I wash it out and my hair has this great feel and shine, soft and manageable, I do it about every 3 or 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have fine long blonde hair and I color or do the roots about every 3 mos.</li>
            <li>I did not find that this mask garnered any extra special results over using the regular conditioner though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>So pleased, unfortunately, I wish it lasted long, but that won&#x27;t prevent me from buying it again. :)</li>
            <li>I was just about to do a major hair cut because the ends of my hair looked super dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To use this, I use two fingers to scoop out a little bit, rub that into the palms of my hands, and then smooth it over my head as I work it in to my hair.</li>
            <li>My curls are defined, soft, and last until I am ready to wash them again.  </li>
            <li>(For the record, I have color-treated, waist-length, Caucasian-textured hair that tends to form natural waves.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m avoiding getting too frequent hair cuts.  </li>
            <li>It makes my natural hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey (and the reason why I sometimes buy cheaper &amp;#34;equivalents&amp;#34; instead), but I have frequently come back after realizing that it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to detangle my hair after I use this product, especially after using it 2-3 times.</li>
            <li>Following it up with the Tahitian Oil is really just seals the deal.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural and my textures are 4a/4b.</li>
            <li>My overall hair texture has improved but I am using the whole Monoi system, (shampoo, conditioner and conditioning spray)</li>
            <li>This makes my hair silky soft</li>
            <li>The scent  is luxurious, the conditioner melts in your hair and leaves it feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>Hair breakage has almost been completely eliminated.</li>
            <li>or so), and then rinse it out really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, wavy hair, and this hair mask leaves my hair soft, tangle free</li>
            <li>Soft.</li>
            <li>I applied this to my hair and it was so manageable and soft and the fragrance lingered for days.  </li>
            <li>It always leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>In addition, it keeps my hair a bit soft and curly.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li>I am continuing to use this product if only to make the up front financial investment ($26) worth it.</li>
            <li>It could be used by those with normal to dry hair whether itnbe straight wavy color treated etc.</li>
            <li>It let my hair super dry and coarse.</li>
            <li>, i use it every week no less than once a week</li>
            <li>I got 2 perms back to back because the stylist messed up the first time.</li>
            <li>I really love the Monoi Shampoo and Conditioner; for one thing my hair breaks far less with this duo than with any other products I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>This hair mas also helps calm frizz down.  </li>
            <li>, really helps to tame my usual frizz/flyaways, and makes my hair smell amazing for the entire day.</li>
            <li>My hair has been dry and damaged since then, but this conditioner really helped.</li>
            <li>(A little went a long way for me, I was able to stretch out 2oz over that entire time) along with Josie Maran Argan Oil</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s hard to have naturally curly hair that is moisturized, healthy and shiny and this product goes a long way in helping make that happen.</li>
            <li>I recently cut my long dried out hair up to my shoulders in an attempt to prevent damage and grow out healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>I recommend leaving it on for at least 15m under light heat.</li>
            <li>I guess I expected too much.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference adding this as a final step made!  </li>
            <li>I only use this once or twice a month and the breakage from my hair has almost completely stopped.</li>
            <li>If I am getting my hair professionally done, I take Monoi to the salon with me to use for my deep conditioning treatment.  </li>
            <li>Natural kinky hair, instantly smooths and strengthens.</li>
            <li>absolutely less shedding the first time it was used on the clients hair.</li>
            <li>and I love putting little bit in my hair everyday after I get out of the shower like a leave in conditioner versus a mask.</li>
            <li>A little bit pricey for a mask but worth paying extra dollars for a product that works.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m doing my hair at home, I simply finger comb my hair (which, thanks to Monoi only takes a couple of minutes), apply a generous amount of SheaMoisture Curl &amp; Define Milk and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li>Used it the same day it came and 3 days later, my hair is still sooooo manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>it is not dry</li>
            <li>The results on dry hair is silky and not heavy.</li>

            <li> I tried this over and over, gave it to friends, no one saw any positive difference but a great smell.</li>

            <li> In this review I want to make sure</li>

            <li> I love carol&#x27;s daughter monio repairing hair mask.</li>
            <li> love it  ....</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic too!</li>
            <li> In my hair arsenal for sure.</li>
            <li> Probably not for everyone, but I sure love this product.</li>
            <li> It really does what it claims it will do and smells great -</li>
            <li> And it makes my hair a lot softer and it straightens better after using it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair so soft and shiny and smells gorgeous!</li>
            <li> /&gt;i will say though, that that the cost is rather high, but otherwise -- great product.</li>
            <li> luckily my mom bought it for me and let me tell YOU, this product is like magic!</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell of this hair mask and LOVE that it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love CD&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner, but can&#x27;t say that this mask does anything special for my hair.</li>
            <li> It sure did make my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> I continue to use the conditioner because it smells great and leaves my washed hair feeling soft</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s true!  </li>
            <li> This makes my hair easily detangle, smells like gardenia flowers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an easy to use system.</li>
            <li> thing to note: this has a strong scent.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy, easily damaged caucasian hair that is coloured every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a couple of inches below my shoulders so now products that are easy to comb out are important.  </li>
            <li> If my fine hair had a snag or tangle, forget it - a chunk of like 20 strands would come out.</li>
            <li> I have fine, highlighted hair and it keeps the highlights</li>
            <li> I have fine colored hair shoulder length, wavy/slightly curly.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s on the fine side.</li>
            <li> it really helps my hair to grow and become healthy!</li>
            <li> This conditioner no only smells nice, but I&#x27;m actually able to get a comb/brush through it!</li>
            <li> I had little breakage which is GREAT for me...and NO KNOTS!!</li>
            <li> after ONE use, my hair was softer, it straightened better, i saw less breakage and it smells good !</li>
            <li> since i discovered this product over two years ago, I havent stopped using it and my hair has changed a lot for the better, this hydrates the hair in an amazing way, it leaves it shinny, soft, removes the frizziness, helps with split ends</li>
            <li> I have seen fantastic results from using this hair mask.</li>
            <li> As a result the ends of my hair are silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to try over holidays and on the whole was satisfied with the product&#x27;s smell and texture which makes it ideal for detangling hair and as a deep conditioner after shampooing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a light floral and almost nutty scent that lasts</li>
            <li> I use the entire system of products and my hair is in great condition.</li>
            <li> Use this product last night after washing with my Wen shampoo as a DC treatment; my hair was silky smooth -- I don&#x27;t think I have ever experienced my hair being so soft and it smells good too.  </li>
            <li> In humid weather I have even left some of the product in my hair, because it also works great as a leave-in.</li>
            <li> The Monoi hair care system by Carol&#x27;s daughter is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> (As a bonus, I find that just having this on my hands to smooth it on my hair, makes my hands noticeably softer!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it once to twice a month for a deep conditioner and am always happy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s well worth the money if you want healthy hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but it&#x27;s strong.  </li>
            <li> Overall, amazing product!</li>
            <li> It lasts me months, and is so worth the price!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li> this product has made a significant difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love, this is by far my favorite hair mask.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot about this product and many of them were positive.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and it makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I am a mixed chick, and this product worked good for my hair</li>
            <li> The price is better &amp; the shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> I use it at least once each month, and find its moisturizing and conditioning properties to be absolutely wonderful!  </li>
            <li> so I used it again and kept it on much longer and used much more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not cool.</li>
            <li> AND MY HAIR HAS A TREMENDOUS TRANSFORMATION IN</li>
            <li> Have seen tremendous results in just one month of use,</li>
            <li> I use it along with other monoi products, it has been very effective in stopping breaking and shedding, and helping with my hair growth.</li>
            <li> and I am enjoying my new growth</li>
            <li> The Monoi Hair Mask is hands down the best conditioner I have ever used on my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using it and recommend it to anyone who wants to have soft, manageable, strong and healthy feeling hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this at sephora a year ago when I absolutely killed my hair and this stuff was great.</li>
            <li> Amazing conditioning and deep conditioning power!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of these ingredients in different hair preparations, so it&#x27;s nice to see them all here</li>
            <li> The deep conditioning process does not need heat for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> I love the fact it&#x27;s all natural too</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s completely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the cost put you of, the benefit to your hair is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> ....I have fallen in love with my natural hair again.  </li>
            <li> time I open the container, I am greeted by the most lovely, white floral scent (which I love).</li>
            <li> My hair is generally healthy but naturally wavy.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it is pricey, but I think worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair is a bed of well defined, super soft curls that can be easily combed out or finger combed.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner really did DRAMATICALLY reduce breakage, as evidenced by  significantly fewer strands in my bath/shower water.</li>
            <li> I use this once or twice a month or right before getting a protective style.</li>
            <li> After the second use my hair was very strong, I like it</li>
            <li> and I am happy to say that while my hair is growing out past my shoulders</li>
            <li> This product not only smells great but actually does what it says.  </li>
            <li> The price from this seller was reasonable and the shipment arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> and this is my favorite deep conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the thick texture, and fantastic conditioning results I received as well.  </li>
            <li> This works great for my thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty sure this works well for everyone, as the two of us have completely different hair types</li>
            <li> I instantly fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Some were saying I will be able to see instant result.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using this product</li>
            <li> at the price point that this sells for, I will most definitely repurchase this when I run out.</li>
            <li> Hair is much stronger!</li>
            <li> The only perk really was that it made my hair smell AWESOME, even after shampooing a few days after using it.</li>
            <li> I get about 6-8 applications per jar; that said I apply the product very liberally, so others may be able to get a few more applications out of it than I do.</li>
            <li> I was pretty scared my hair would snap from braiding or combing.  </li>
            <li> As such, it was easy to apply and distribute throughout my hair and my hair soaked it right</li>
            <li> This mask smells amazing, the effect on the hair is nice; and last you for at least 5 applications.</li>
            <li> I love this and plan to buy it for as long as they make the product.</li>
            <li> There is no instruction on the product i.e. how long to leave it on your hair before you wash it out and how many times a week you should use it.</li>
            <li> The smell so lovely and it lingers so long.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s unusual for a hair product, so just be prepared for it.  </li>
            <li> Caucasian female with thin hair and this makes it much stronger and smells awesome.....</li>
            <li> With thinning hair it really helps stop breakage</li>
            <li> I found after using the product I had to layer on multiple layers of conditioner to get the silky smooth look and feel I wanted.</li>
            <li> VERY WELL</li>
            <li> Very upset.</li>
            <li> I will not use as much because I forgot how much this stuff costs</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and my hair seems to be much healthier and very shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve needed this my whole life.</li>
            <li> This product made me change my whole opinion about the state my hair was in.  </li>
            <li> This mask worked very well on my perm relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> Out of everything she gave me, this was my absolute favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not falling out as much.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for this product much.  </li>
            <li> but I have 4A/4B hair that does not like too much product</li>
            <li> My hair is far more coarse than my daughters</li>
            <li> I tried it and my hair was even more dry than before!!</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few products and am still trying to find the right one that I can really say that I love and will stick with for my type hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t normally review products, but felt compelled to write one as soon as I jumped out of the shower!</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells and makes my hair pretty soft considering it&#x27;s highlighted and extremely damaged.  </li>
            <li> My hair is super soft, not dry and very shiny!</li>
            <li> Nothing works quite as good as this, not even other more expensive hair mask, and the only thing that makes my hair as smooth as the Monoi Mask is an oil treatment - which I have to leave on for hours and is heaps messier!</li>
            <li> Very good product for weak and fragile hair.</li>
            <li> I just recently got my hair done and the ends were dry and my hair wasn&#x27;t as nice as before.</li>
            <li> Completely wilds out after the beach, hot weather, or a night out.</li>
            <li> My hair is stronger so there is less breakage, and therefore more opportunity for it to grow.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure if you would have different results when using the entire the product line for the Monoi</li>
            <li> This was a decent hair mask.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair mask.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It hydrates very well and leaves hair soft and silky</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it time to time so far and nothing really changes and no difference.</li>
            <li> the is the real deal as far as hair products go</li>
            <li> I just put it on in the shower, throw on a shower cap, shave my legs and do my normal washing then take off the shower cap and rinse.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, long, easily-greasy hair and this conditioner is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Deep conditioner I use, feel the difference right away.</li>
            <li> Following chemo, my kinky hair came back baby fine.  </li>
            <li> My hair is normally quite dry due to color treatment and daily shampooing and all of the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi products have been good for it.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product for natural, Afro-textured hair.  </li>
            <li> It may be a little on the strong side (especially for men), but if you like white floral scents, you will probably really enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> I had better results with regular redken extreme.</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged due to prolonged use of blow drying and color treatment , but this product is keeping it from breaking off completely, I use this fantastic product once a week and use the manoi conditioner in between.  </li>
            <li> The first time I put it on my hair after shampooing my hair instantly felt softer and silkier, and it was a cinch to comb through.</li>
            <li> and I do not have nearly as many split ends as I usually do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually one to spend a lot of money on hair care products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally like magic, but I&#x27;m kindof lazy and don&#x27;t use it as often as I should.</li>
            <li> I get my hair wet and put about 1/8 cup on my head and sit out in the sun for at least 3 hours, then I wash it out and my hair has this great feel and shine, soft and manageable, I do it about every 3 or 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have fine long blonde hair and I color or do the roots about every 3 mos.</li>
            <li> I did not find that this mask garnered any extra special results over using the regular conditioner though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> So pleased, unfortunately, I wish it lasted long, but that won&#x27;t prevent me from buying it again. :)</li>
            <li> I was just about to do a major hair cut because the ends of my hair looked super dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To use this, I use two fingers to scoop out a little bit, rub that into the palms of my hands, and then smooth it over my head as I work it in to my hair.</li>
            <li> My curls are defined, soft, and last until I am ready to wash them again.  </li>
            <li> (For the record, I have color-treated, waist-length, Caucasian-textured hair that tends to form natural waves.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m avoiding getting too frequent hair cuts.  </li>
            <li> It makes my natural hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey (and the reason why I sometimes buy cheaper &amp;#34;equivalents&amp;#34; instead), but I have frequently come back after realizing that it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to detangle my hair after I use this product, especially after using it 2-3 times.</li>
            <li> Following it up with the Tahitian Oil is really just seals the deal.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and my textures are 4a/4b.</li>
            <li> My overall hair texture has improved but I am using the whole Monoi system, (shampoo, conditioner and conditioning spray)</li>
            <li> This makes my hair silky soft</li>
            <li> The scent  is luxurious, the conditioner melts in your hair and leaves it feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> Hair breakage has almost been completely eliminated.</li>
            <li> or so), and then rinse it out really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, wavy hair, and this hair mask leaves my hair soft, tangle free</li>
            <li> Soft.</li>
            <li> I applied this to my hair and it was so manageable and soft and the fragrance lingered for days.  </li>
            <li> It always leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> In addition, it keeps my hair a bit soft and curly.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li> I am continuing to use this product if only to make the up front financial investment ($26) worth it.</li>
            <li> It could be used by those with normal to dry hair whether itnbe straight wavy color treated etc.</li>
            <li> It let my hair super dry and coarse.</li>
            <li> , i use it every week no less than once a week</li>
            <li> I got 2 perms back to back because the stylist messed up the first time.</li>
            <li> I really love the Monoi Shampoo and Conditioner; for one thing my hair breaks far less with this duo than with any other products I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This hair mas also helps calm frizz down.  </li>
            <li> , really helps to tame my usual frizz/flyaways, and makes my hair smell amazing for the entire day.</li>
            <li> My hair has been dry and damaged since then, but this conditioner really helped.</li>
            <li> (A little went a long way for me, I was able to stretch out 2oz over that entire time) along with Josie Maran Argan Oil</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s hard to have naturally curly hair that is moisturized, healthy and shiny and this product goes a long way in helping make that happen.</li>
            <li> I recently cut my long dried out hair up to my shoulders in an attempt to prevent damage and grow out healthy hair.  </li>
            <li> I recommend leaving it on for at least 15m under light heat.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected too much.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference adding this as a final step made!  </li>
            <li> I only use this once or twice a month and the breakage from my hair has almost completely stopped.</li>
            <li> If I am getting my hair professionally done, I take Monoi to the salon with me to use for my deep conditioning treatment.  </li>
            <li> Natural kinky hair, instantly smooths and strengthens.</li>
            <li> absolutely less shedding the first time it was used on the clients hair.</li>
            <li> and I love putting little bit in my hair everyday after I get out of the shower like a leave in conditioner versus a mask.</li>
            <li> A little bit pricey for a mask but worth paying extra dollars for a product that works.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m doing my hair at home, I simply finger comb my hair (which, thanks to Monoi only takes a couple of minutes), apply a generous amount of SheaMoisture Curl &amp; Define Milk and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> Used it the same day it came and 3 days later, my hair is still sooooo manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> it is not dry</li>
            <li> The results on dry hair is silky and not heavy.</li>
            <li> I was having a huge slow down in growth, as well, I was shedding big time.</li>
            <li> OK, I might have done it wrong, when I put a gob or two or three in my dry hair, put on a couple shower caps, and went to bed....</li>
            <li> Smells really good...but not sure of</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron on my hair almost every day.</li>
            <li> (so I applied it to dry hair, wrapped my hair up under a processing cap, and just let it do its work for a half hour before shampooing as normal).  </li>
            <li> My hair is mid-back, and I now get regular complements on it, and I am not a spring chicken any more,  (54).</li>
            <li> list!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am African-American with tightly curled, un-permed (natural) hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strange, because you don&#x27;t feel residue when you touch your hair.  </li>
            <li> After I washed it out my hair was so soft even when I blow dried it.</li>
            <li> this product is keeping the hair on my head growing long.....</li>
            <li> I saw this in my shower and had forgotten about it since I only used to do the monoi shampoo and conditioner (due to time constraints) and thought that combination was just \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Since then I my hair has been ultimately dry &amp; brittle.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with curly or dry hair.</li>
            <li> If your hair is curly and is both with dry and greasy then this is for you.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the only benefit I&#x27;ve seen from it so far, and have used it at least three times (once a week) since receiving it.</li>
            <li> I have fine oily hair and am unable to put conditioner all over my head due to it looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African-American woman with thick, natural 4b hair that hits around mid-back length when it is flat ironed.  </li>
            <li> you cannot loose.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;ll probably have to break down and buy a full-size version.seen a lot of these ingredients in different hair preparations, so</li>
            <li> My hair is 3b-c curly, I am Caucasian with a small amount of African heritage, so my hair is dry, frizzy/curly and fragile.  </li>
            <li> My hair was really dry and damaged due to the high heat and hard water.</li>
            <li> Dry!</li>
            <li> being said, I speak from the perspective of someone who used a Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awampuhi Shampoo typically before using this deep conditioning mask.</li>
            <li> Someone had made a comment stating this product didn&#x27;t have instructions; I thought I&#x27;d let people know instructions ARE present on the product yet hidden like that of a medicine bottle, requiring you to peel the label on the container.</li>
            <li> I use a tiny bit as a leave-in, and my hair breakage seems less.  </li>
            <li> The product is a little on the expensive at $32 when purchased in store, but I do know if you but it in stores or from the Ulta website you get a free Monoi shampoo and conditioner with the mask.</li>
            <li> The jar is small for $20, but it last long.  </li>
            <li> I am a 23 year old Caucasian woman with thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I usually come back to this product when my hair becomes severely dry and unmanageable and after</li>
            <li> Brings the dry, brittle and dull hair back to life.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, supertight, dry African hair that can&#x27;t be managed without being relaxed.</li>
            <li> While the price point is steep, it is in line with other high-end products.</li>
            <li> I will say I did notice a small decline in hair breakage/shedding the next time I detangled/washed my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser told me that i should use the monoi repairing collection because she saw what it did for one of her other clients.</li>
            <li> It is not the case with other products like deva curl.</li>
            <li> I started highlighting my hair this year and found that after awhile, my hair felt a little dry.</li>
            <li> The product is like any other you will probably get for half the price.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair slick and squeeky and is hard to wash out to get a natural hair feel again.  </li>
            <li> i have very coarse and thick her.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;ll probably have to break down and buy a full-size version.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and is not oily.</li>
            <li> well conditioned but doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I mention that I&#x27;ve had limited exposure to Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair products in the past</li>
            <li> The biggest issue for me is that after using this product, while it gave me a slight shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I discovered it from my mother in law who uses it, and she is black with straightened/permed hair</li>
            <li> I colored my hair about a month in half ago.  </li>
            <li> I notice less shedding of my hair.  </li>
            <li> The label says that you have 96% less breakage after one use</li>
            <li> and I have noticed I&#x27;m losing less hair when I wash it.  </li>
            <li> My split ends after using twice are less split.</li>
            <li> And because Monoi conditions so well, I experience significantly less hair breakage during the comb out process.  </li>
            <li> Typically, once my hair grows past shoulder length the ends start to become very dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> Previously, after washing my hair, my hair would curl and tangle so tightly that it would take hours to comb.</li>
            <li> A must use if you have hair like mine - thick, long, curly, and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Once my hair was dry it was crispy and hard.</li>
            <li> Of course, my hair is neither dry, dull, or damaged--so I&#x27;m betting that would be the ticket for seeing some improvement.</li>
            <li> but I feel maybe this one is decreasing the breakage a little.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to be using this as a mask at least once a week!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick though so only need a little for everyday use</li>
            <li> Hardly any hair breakage on my wide tooth&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;This does contain silicones (quite a few of them).  </li>
            <li> My dried out colored hair, WOKE UP.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold on the shampoo and conditioner, but I&#x27;ll leave this product behind for next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Hispanic and have thick, medium-length dark hair.</li>
            <li> I would also recommend using it less than once a month as while it does pack a keratin-punch for hair, you wouldn&#x27;t want to use it to often and get a hard straw like feel.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 12 weeks</li>
            <li> I usually use drug-store shampoos, and conditioners; however, I have been using the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, usually once or twice a week, for three months</li>
            <li> no more breakage....</li>
            <li> I have used Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi repairing hair mask in the past.</li>

            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it everyday because it was too heavy for my thin hair</li>
            <li> For those who said their hair was hard; this product has protein which hardens the hair as it dries.</li>

            <li> This is expensive  -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive - and I believe for a product that HARMS, not helps hair.</li>

            <li> As always you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> Too expensive to see no difference..</li>
            <li> I know people think this line of products is way to expensive</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it, however it smells awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Instead of a hair mask, I used this as a deep conditioner (so I applied it to dry hair, wrapped my hair up under a processing cap, and just let it do its work for a half hour before shampooing as normal).  As such, it was easy to apply and distribute throughout my hair and my hair soaked it right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This definitely improved the condition of my hair.  My hair is normally quite dry due to color treatment and daily shampooing and all of the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi products have been good for it.  But I think I like this even better than the matching shampoo and conditioner.  It controls frizz and improved the smoothness/texture of my hair.  (For the record, I have color-treated, waist-length, Caucasian-textured hair that tends to form natural waves.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note: this has a strong scent.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but it&#x27;s strong.  And it stays with you, even after shampooing.  That&#x27;s unusual for a hair product, so just be prepared for it.  It&#x27;s strange, because you don&#x27;t feel residue when you touch your hair.  But *something* is causing your hair to smell like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients since I didn&#x27;t see them on the product page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Glycerin, Cetyl Esters, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Coconut Oil, Gardenia Tahitensis Flower Extract, Cyclopentasiloxane, Isohexadecane, Shea Butter, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Oil, Phyllostachis Bambusoides Juice, Hydrolyzed Hibiscus Esculentus Extract, Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccaride, Sunflower Seed Extrac, Panthenol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, Octyldodecanol, Ceteareth-20, Quarternium-91, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does contain silicones (quite a few of them).  Silicones actually help my hair a lot, so I don&#x27;t avoid them, but I know some people care so I figured I would mention it.  I&#x27;ve seen a lot of these ingredients in different hair preparations, so it&#x27;s nice to see them all here (for example, there&#x27;s a hair oil with hibiscus in it, coconut oil for hair treatment is well established, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with how this helped my hair.  I&#x27;ve worked my way through both of my deluxe sample containers and now I&#x27;ll probably have to break down and buy a full-size version.seen a lot of these ingredients in different hair preparations, so it&#x27;s nice to see them all here (for example, there&#x27;s a hair oil with hibiscus in it, coconut oil for hair treatment is well established, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with how this helped my hair.

            <li> This repairing mask has done wonders for my hair.  I know swear by it and use religiously once a week.  Since I&#x27;ve been using it, I only have to trim my hair every once in a while.  I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out so I&#x27;m avoiding getting too frequent hair cuts.  I also highlight my hair and straighten it about 3 times a week.  Before I used this, I&#x27;d get split ends and frizziness. This hair mas also helps calm frizz down.  I highly recommend this hair mask.</li>
            <li> Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask is wonderful.  It makes my natural hair soft and silky.  My hair is starting to grow.  It is repairing my damaged hair.  I love it.</li>
            <li> One of the best Hair Masks I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It is a bit pricey (and the reason why I sometimes buy cheaper &amp;#34;equivalents&amp;#34; instead), but I have frequently come back after realizing that it&#x27;s worth the extra money. It makes my hair feel healthier. I have course, thick, curly hair. This makes my hair shinier, healthier. It brings life to my hair and not only reduces breakage but helps with split ends that I do have. It is so much easier to detangle my hair after I use this product, especially after using it 2-3 times. I usually come back to this product when my hair becomes severely dry and unmanageable and after only 2-3 uses my hair is back to looking healthier.</li>
            <li> Really helps my hair ends not split, smells great.</li>
            <li> Great product, amazing results</li>
            <li> Great product... I am a mixed chick, and this product worked good for my hair</li>
            <li> Caucasian female with thin hair and this makes it much stronger and smells awesome.....Love this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this product. They stopped selling it at sephora so I bought on here!! It&#x27;s definitely the same product and I love putting little bit in my hair everyday after I get out of the shower like a leave in conditioner versus a mask. It does wonders for my bleached blond hair!!! It&#x27;s very thick though so only need a little for everyday use</li>
            <li> If you have breakage, dryness, or damage, this product is all you need! I&#x27;m a product junkie and this is my favorite deep conditioner ever! The smell is divine and I was deeply impressed that the claim of about 90% breakage ceasing within the 1st usage, was true. While the price point is steep, it is in line with other high-end products. Following it up with the Tahitian Oil is really just seals the deal.</li>
            <li> The product is like any other you will probably get for half the price. Doesn&#x27;t do wonders just basic stuff.</li>
            <li> I have curly African American 3C hair that is prone to breakage, tangling, brittleness and snapping. This makes my hair easily detangle, smells like gardenia flowers. It is a tan color with a creamy, buttery texture. It doesn&#x27;t exactly make hair shine, but is great for a leave in conditioner and makes hair even curlier. I liked the price for the amount that you get of 7oz. It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and is not oily. This is perfect for any ethnic hair type or wavy/curly hair for non-ethnic hair. When I put it on my hair I instantly noticed the difference. I love this and plan to buy it for as long as they make the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Use it with the conditioner and shampoo... If you have color treated hair its real good!  I&#x27;m using this mask before shampoo every two weeks, and my hair looks great!</li>
            <li> I love love love the Carol&#x27;s Daughter products! I was happy to see them available on Amazon so I don&#x27;t have to drive the 30 min to an Ulta. The price is better &amp; the shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> not working for my damaged hair... no use paying 32 $ at ulta... intense boost system works great instead. pls ask ulta</li>
            <li> I gotta say this is a good conditioner and smells good. You always have to switch it up but I feel maybe this one is decreasing the breakage a little. I have terrible hair and its a bit better lately  this is lovely and luxurious anyways</li>
            <li> Best deep conditioner on the market!!!!</li>
            <li> I have seen fantastic results from using this hair mask. I use it at least once each month, and find its moisturizing and conditioning properties to be absolutely wonderful!  I will continue using it and recommend it to anyone who wants to have soft, manageable, strong and healthy feeling hair.</li>
            <li> I only used this once. There is no instruction on the product i.e. how long to leave it on your hair before you wash it out and how many times a week you should use it. I kept it on for about 10 minutes. It sure did make my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> This mask is not only for ethnic hair types. It could be used by those with normal to dry hair whether itnbe straight wavy color treated etc. It has a pleasant smell which some may not appreciate. It hydrates very well and leaves hair soft and silky</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and it makes your hair so soft. I&#x27;m in love, this is by far my favorite hair mask.</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair have been bleached probably 10 times in the last year and I use this mask every time I wash my hair.  As a result the ends of my hair are silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I purchase this every three months, this is my favorite hair mask.  With thinning hair it really helps stop breakage and I am enjoying my new growth</li>
            <li> I had just taken out a sew-in that had been in my hair for 5 months. My hair is natural and my textures are 4a/4b. My kinky curlies were in bad shape. This repairing mask was AMAZING. My hair is so soft and manageable! I had little breakage which is GREAT for me...and NO KNOTS!! For those who said their hair was hard; this product has protein which hardens the hair as it dries. The deep conditioning process does not need heat for it to be effective. Just apply, wait, rinse, and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to try over holidays and on the whole was satisfied with the product&#x27;s smell and texture which makes it ideal for detangling hair and as a deep conditioner after shampooing. In this review I want to make sure I mention that I&#x27;ve had limited exposure to Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair products in the past so I wasn&#x27;t sure if you would have different results when using the entire the product line for the Monoi products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I speak from the perspective of someone who used a Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awampuhi Shampoo typically before using this deep conditioning mask. I cannot stress how amazing this product smells. It&#x27;s like a light floral and almost nutty scent that lasts hours after you&#x27;ve used it (I got many compliments from friends). The biggest issue for me is that after using this product, while it gave me a slight shine to my hair. It let my hair super dry and coarse. This may be a hair type problem I have curly type 4a hair. I found after using the product I had to layer on multiple layers of conditioner to get the silky smooth look and feel I wanted. I am continuing to use this product if only to make the up front financial investment ($26) worth it. I would advise against purchasing this item independently of the product line that may make a difference in how your hair responds to this hair mask. I would also recommend using it less than once a month as while it does pack a keratin-punch for hair, you wouldn&#x27;t want to use it to often and get a hard straw like feel. I will say I did notice a small decline in hair breakage/shedding the next time I detangled/washed my hair.</li>
            <li> I really love the Monoi Shampoo and Conditioner; for one thing my hair breaks far less with this duo than with any other products I&#x27;ve ever tried. I did not find that this mask garnered any extra special results over using the regular conditioner though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely stick with Carol&#x27;s Daughter/Monoi but just not the mask.</li>
            <li> This is the most expensive hair product that I have ever purchased.  But the wonderful smell seduced me!  I am very pleased with the thick texture, and fantastic conditioning results I received as well.  My hair is 3b-c curly, I am Caucasian with a small amount of African heritage, so my hair is dry, frizzy/curly and fragile.  This conditioner really did DRAMATICALLY reduce breakage, as evidenced by  significantly fewer strands in my bath/shower water. My hair is mid-back, and I now get regular complements on it, and I am not a spring chicken any more,  (54).</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells and makes my hair pretty soft considering it&#x27;s highlighted and extremely damaged.  I love the fact it&#x27;s all natural too</li>
            <li> I have thick relaxed hair.  It&#x27;s a couple of inches below my shoulders so now products that are easy to comb out are important.  I bought the shampoo which is ok but the mask left my hair sticky. I used 2 detanglers and still it took me 30 minutes to comb it out. The Sally&#x27;s hair one product combs out in 2 minutes with no hair lost. I&#x27;ll be returning the monoi mask.</li>
            <li> I have thick, supertight, dry African hair that can&#x27;t be managed without being relaxed. I deep conditioned with carol&#x27;s daughter monoi repairing mask for 30 minutes under a heating cap. Once my hair was dry it was crispy and hard. I didn&#x27;t do my hair any justice, nor did it add any shine. sigh, the search continues. Im going to try phyto products next.</li>
            <li> OMG...great for curly girls!  I had a problem with combing my hair, I couldn&#x27;t get a comb through it!!! With this product, I am able to get a comb through my hair with no problems!  I&#x27;m so very pleased with this product. I use this along with Wen conditioning wash.  So pleased, unfortunately, I wish it lasted long, but that won&#x27;t prevent me from buying it again. :)</li>
            <li> This works great for my thick and curly hair. It tames my locks and smooths them out.  My overall hair texture has improved but I am using the whole Monoi system, (shampoo, conditioner and conditioning spray)</li>
            <li> It is the best conditioner ever! I have fine oily hair and am unable to put conditioner all over my head due to it looking greasy. This conditioner no only smells nice, but I&#x27;m actually able to get a comb/brush through it!</li>
            <li> Good mask, helps when need a conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> Great hair treatment! Can notice a difference with every application. I haven&#x27;t found anything else that works quite like it. It lasts me months, and is so worth the price!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so and smells great. I love it and will buy it again</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT SMELLS VERY GOOD AND IT ALSO WORKS VERY WELL AND MY HAIR HAS A TREMENDOUS TRANSFORMATION IN IT&#x27;S MANAGEABILITY.</li>
            <li> I bought this at sephora a year ago when I absolutely killed my hair and this stuff was great. I just recently started highlighting my hair again and we know what damage that can do to our hair. I ordered it this time on amazon and I still love this stuff. I just recently got my hair done and the ends were dry and my hair wasn&#x27;t as nice as before. I put this in for a couple hours even though it says only a couple minutes. After I washed it out my hair was so soft even when I blow dried it. Definitely going to be using this as a mask at least once a week!</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing Mask highly enough. I switched from Wen to Carol&#x27;s Daughter, and it has made all of the difference. I use the Monoi shampoo and conditioner along with the split end repair and the oil. After trying a sampling of the Monoi products, I bought most of the others in this line. My hair is shiny and split ends are indeed repaired. I love the smell, which lasts three days before  I shampoo again. Try it!</li>
            <li> one of the best hair mask ever. work for Caucasian thick hair too</li>
            <li> This was a decent hair mask. It did make my hair softer. But I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the price. I&#x27;d rather by the Wen Shampoo instead.</li>
            <li> I am blown away by the reviews. I tried it and my hair was even more dry than before!! But I was so convinced I was using it wrong or something so I used it again and kept it on much longer and used much more. Same results. Dry! My hair was so frizzy. I had better results with regular redken extreme. Very upset. And for $30...outrageous :-(</li>
            <li> I use the entire system of products and my hair is in great condition. I have fine long blonde hair and I color or do the roots about every 3 mos. I was having a huge slow down in growth, as well, I was shedding big time. If my fine hair had a snag or tangle, forget it - a chunk of like 20 strands would come out. Haven&#x27;t seen that since using monoi! Also, there is literally no hair on my comb after using now. I have been using this for 4 months. It&#x27;s an easy to use system. Also, I discovered it from my mother in law who uses it, and she is black with straightened/permed hair so I&#x27;m pretty sure this works well for everyone, as the two of us have completely different hair types but we both love the CD Monoi products!</li>
            <li> I love it the smell is amazing and gives a lot of shine and bounce to your hair , very good for mistreated color treated hair</li>
            <li> since i discovered this product over two years ago, I havent stopped using it and my hair has changed a lot for the better, this hydrates the hair in an amazing way, it leaves it shinny, soft, removes the frizziness, helps with split ends, i use it every week no less than once a week</li>
            <li> Best conditionner i have used thus far. Great moisture repair and great smell! I instantly fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.  I colored my hair about a month in half ago.  Since then I my hair has been ultimately dry &amp; brittle.  Tried several deep conditioners &amp;/or masks.  This is the one!!! As I applied I saw a difference. I went under dryer for approximately 20 mins. As I styled my hair I notice less shedding of my hair.  The day after I still saw moisture in my hair.  This is definitely will be added to my hair regimen AND to my top 5 hair products!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner</li>
            <li> Always does what it says.  It claims to reduces breakage and it does.  This conditioner never disappoints.  The shampoo is great also.</li>
            <li> Use this product last night after washing with my Wen shampoo as a DC treatment; my hair was silky smooth -- I don&#x27;t think I have ever experienced my hair being so soft and it smells good too.  I used quite a bit so next time I will not use as much because I forgot how much this stuff costs (I purchased this a year ago -- #productjunkie)  - yikes!  This is expensive  - no wonder its woks!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used on my hair. The label says that you have 96% less breakage after one use and it&#x27;s true!  I have fine, highlighted hair and it keeps the highlights well conditioned but doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I have also purchased the monoi shampoo and love it as well.  This is the only conditioner I will use.  I highly recommend it for anyone!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair silky soft and I just love the smell. I leave it in for 15 minutes in the bath and the scent and softness lasts for days.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair slick and squeeky and is hard to wash out to get a natural hair feel again.  I WISH I HAD MY MONEY BACK!!  It&#x27;s expensive - and I believe for a product that HARMS, not helps hair.</li>
            <li> Rreally love the way monoi makes my hair manageable and the way it smells. My hair dresser remarked on how good my hair smelled and it was day after I had used this product. My hair is damaged due to prolonged use of blow drying and color treatment , but this product is keeping it from breaking off completely, I use this fantastic product once a week and use the manoi conditioner in between.  I&#x27;d give it a five for doing everything it was advertised to do.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. I use it along with other monoi products, it has been very effective in stopping breaking and shedding, and helping with my hair growth.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift when I was deployed to Afghanistan. My hair was really dry and damaged due to the high heat and hard water. This was GREAT. I couldn&#x27;t use it everyday because it was too heavy for my thin hair but once a week worked perfectly. Smells amazing too.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and as described. Very happy with the service; I would recommend it to all my friends. This mask smells amazing, the effect on the hair is nice; and last you for at least 5 applications. However i m still experiencing some breakage. Will keep using it and see.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy, easily damaged caucasian hair that is coloured every 3 weeks. This product is a game changer! The first time I put it on my hair after shampooing my hair instantly felt softer and silkier, and it was a cinch to comb through. I use as a rinse-out conditioner in the shower, and to deep condition my hair I sleep in it and rinse it out in the morning. In humid weather I have even left some of the product in my hair, because it also works great as a leave-in. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love Love love this product! An absolutely great hair mask with a divine scent!</li>
            <li> I am multi-racial  and have curly hair and I use this mask twice a week and every time after I do I get compliments on my hair. I think it&#x27;s hard to have naturally curly hair that is moisturized, healthy and shiny and this product goes a long way in helping make that happen. It&#x27;s really simple to make a part of your regular routine too. I just put it on in the shower, throw on a shower cap, shave my legs and do my normal washing then take off the shower cap and rinse. You don&#x27;t have to sit under a dryer for an hour for this product to do it&#x27;s magic. It also smells great. I would recommend this to anyone with curly or dry hair. Also it&#x27;s completely worth the money. Even with twice a week use and shoulder length hair I buy it about every two to three months.</li>
            <li> The Monoi hair care system by Carol&#x27;s daughter is fantastic.  You literally see the difference after one use.  Don&#x27;t let the cost put you of, the benefit to your hair is well worth it.  I say this as someone who has bought shampoos and conditioners in all price ranges, without the promised results until Monoi.</li>
            <li> As always you can&#x27;t go wrong with this. This provides moisture,strength and repair yo your tresses. No matter what hair texture you have, fine,straight,wavy,kinky or textured hair.... you will love this. The smell so lovely and it lingers so long.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. The results on dry hair is silky and not heavy. The smell is terrific!</li>
            <li> I guess I expected too much. I heard a lot about this product and many of them were positive. Some were saying I will be able to see instant result. But I didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve been using it time to time so far and nothing really changes and no difference. Too expensive to see no difference..</li>
            <li> Amazing conditioning and deep conditioning power! Brings the dry, brittle and dull hair back to life.  This is a must try for all hair types!</li>
            <li> It gets rid of ALL my split ends! AMAZING-- all it takes is to apply for thirty minutes and then wash out.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the carold daughter hair mask..it smells wonderful and leaves my hair very silky. thank you</li>
            <li> Like this product a lot.  I have fine colored hair shoulder length, wavy/slightly curly.  BUY THIS ON AMAZON!  What a great price, 18.00!  I paid 32.00 at Ulta....amazon isn&#x27;t always the least expensive, but in this case, the savings compared to Ulta is obscene.  I&#x27;ll never buy there again before comparing to Amazon.</li>
            <li> love love love this.  Leaves my hair beautiful.. I can&#x27;t be without..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m caucasian with hair that&#x27;s on the fine side. I started highlighting my hair this year and found that after awhile, my hair felt a little dry. I started using this mask once/week and my hair seems to be much healthier and very shiny. LOVE the smell of this hair mask and LOVE that it&#x27;s easy to use. You put it on after washing and leave it in for 5-7 minutes, then rinse thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I tried this over and over, gave it to friends, no one saw any positive difference but a great smell. It kind of makes the hair clump together as one piece. Not recommended at all.</li>
            <li> Changes my hair. I&#x27;ve needed this my whole life. It&#x27;s dessert for the shower.</li>
            <li> The scent  is luxurious, the conditioner melts in your hair and leaves it feeling so soft. I would reccomend this product over and over.</li>
            <li> I was just about to do a major hair cut because the ends of my hair looked super dry.  I saw this in my shower and had forgotten about it since I only used to do the monoi shampoo and conditioner (due to time constraints) and thought that combination was just \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.  Wow, what a difference adding this as a final step made!  I used this hair mask 3 days ago and I honestly don&#x27;t think I need to cut off my hair now, maybe I can get just a trim.  This product made me change my whole opinion about the state my hair was in.  My hair is super soft, not dry and very shiny!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using this product and I have noticed I&#x27;m losing less hair when I wash it.  It also gives my hair shine in addition to strength.</li>
            <li> This does wonders. If your hair is curly and is both with dry and greasy then this is for you. Gives your hair the shine and softness it needs. I recommend leaving it on for at least 15m under light heat.</li>
            <li> your hair will feel so refresh i have been using this product for over 4 years now.</li>
            <li> This mask worked very well on my perm relaxed hair. Hardly any hair breakage on my wide tooth&lt;br /&gt;comb. Will be buying this product again. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> ....I have fallen in love with my natural hair again.  This item is on my \\&quot;must have\\&quot; list!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am African-American with tightly curled, un-permed (natural) hair.  Previously, after washing my hair, my hair would curl and tangle so tightly that it would take hours to comb. And, hair breakage was horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a game changer.  It detangled my hair while making it manageable and silky...and what a delightful smell. Hair breakage has almost been completely eliminated.</li>
            <li> I received a 2oz bottle of this from my MIL when she was clearing out a lot of hair and beauty products she hadn&#x27;t had a chance to use yet.  Out of everything she gave me, this was my absolute favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have my thick hair highlighted and trimmed once every 6-8 weeks.  Typically, once my hair grows past shoulder length the ends start to become very dry and brittle.  I recently cut my long dried out hair up to my shoulders in an attempt to prevent damage and grow out healthy hair.  I have been using this product for the past 12 weeks (A little went a long way for me, I was able to stretch out 2oz over that entire time) along with Josie Maran Argan Oil and I am happy to say that while my hair is growing out past my shoulders it is not dry and I do not have nearly as many split ends as I usually do.  This stuff also smells AMAZING. I recommend it and I intend to buy more of this stuff for myself!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair so soft and shiny and smells gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Smell&#x27;s wonderful!  My hair is thick and tends to be frizzy.  This product is a key part of my routine to keep my hair under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually one to spend a lot of money on hair care products. I usually use drug-store shampoos, and conditioners; however, I have been using the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, usually once or twice a week, for three months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each time I open the container, I am greeted by the most lovely, white floral scent (which I love). It may be a little on the strong side (especially for men), but if you like white floral scents, you will probably really enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this, I use two fingers to scoop out a little bit, rub that into the palms of my hands, and then smooth it over my head as I work it in to my hair. I leave it in my hair while I finish my shower routine (probably 5 mins. or so), and then rinse it out really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, wavy hair, and this hair mask leaves my hair soft, tangle free, really helps to tame my usual frizz/flyaways, and makes my hair smell amazing for the entire day. (As a bonus, I find that just having this on my hands to smooth it on my hair, makes my hands noticeably softer!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even at the price point that this sells for, I will most definitely repurchase this when I run out.</li>
            <li> OK, I might have done it wrong, when I put a gob or two or three in my dry hair, put on a couple shower caps, and went to bed....I didn&#x27;t know what to expect....OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG, this stuff is so GREAT....My dried out colored hair, WOKE UP.....I even had alot of shine....LOVE LOVE this stuff :))</li>
            <li> I use this once a month as a deep conditioner and my hair is doing quite well!  Hair is much stronger!</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughters hair as well as mine. My hair is far more coarse than my daughters (she&#x27;s mixed African and white), but this product repairs both of our hair. I use it once to twice a month for a deep conditioner and am always happy. It has saved my ends and hers as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will say though, that that the cost is rather high, but otherwise -- great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.I love the way my hair feels and looks. say good bye to ponytails and let it flow freely. great doing business with you.</li>
            <li> This mask lives up to its potential. absolutely less shedding the first time it was used on the clients hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great and seems to work well on my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser told me that i should use the monoi repairing collection because she saw what it did for one of her other clients. i was very skeptical ( as i am about everything) especially when i saw the price!!!  luckily my mom bought it for me and let me tell YOU, this product is like magic! i have very coarse and thick her. i mean like comb breaking thick hair, and ive been transitiong for about 4 months now so it breaks off alot. after ONE use, my hair was softer, it straightened better, i saw less breakage and it smells good ! you cannot loose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and I can&#x27;t honestly say that I&#x27;ve seen good results.  I purchase the entire Monoi line and I still experience breakage.  I continue to use the conditioner because it smells great and leaves my washed hair feeling soft but it hasn&#x27;t stopped the breakage as promised.</li>
            <li> Smells really good...but not sure of it does what it promises to I&#x27;ll keep using it and see where it goes</li>
            <li> I dont know yet just how effective this product is but I like how it makes yr hair feel. Soft. I do know that you must use the shampoo with it to expect results. I do love the smell and feel of both combined.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t normally review products, but felt compelled to write one as soon as I jumped out of the shower! This product is amazing! If your reading reviews and wondering whether or not you should give it a shot, go for it:) The product is a little on the expensive at $32 when purchased in store, but I do know if you but it in stores or from the Ulta website you get a free Monoi shampoo and conditioner with the mask. All the products in this line work perfectly together so I would recommend purchasing it from an Ulta retailer. I&#x27;m Hispanic and have thick, medium-length dark hair. About a year ago I had a traumatic experience with a bad dye job and this product brought my hair back to life! Also, helps restore moisture if you use heat styling tools often. Must have, must keep :) Try it out!</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes my hair shiny and feel stronger. A little bit pricey for a mask but worth paying extra dollars for a product that works.</li>
            <li> I know people think this line of products is way to expensive but it&#x27;s well worth the money if you want healthy hair. I only use this once or twice a month and the breakage from my hair has almost completely stopped. I also use the regular monoi conditioner regularly along with the deep conditioner</li>
            <li> It smells GREAT! that&#x27;s the only benefit I&#x27;ve seen from it so far, and have used it at least three times (once a week) since receiving it. Will continue to use to see a difference in my hair. One thing I didn&#x27;t like about it, is that THERE ARE NO DIRECTIONS ON HOW TO USE IT on the jar.</li>
            <li> This product not only smells great but actually does what it says.  My hair is stronger so there is less breakage, and therefore more opportunity for it to grow.</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner for my curly, Hispanic hair.  It detangles my hair in seconds, so it doesn&#x27;t get damage.  The jar is small for $20, but it last long.  I have been using this product for about 6 months.  It is gentle on the hair.  I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair, but then again it isn&#x27;t damaged, I just wanted to try a deep-conditioner. The only perk really was that it made my hair smell AWESOME, even after shampooing a few days after using it. My boyfriend loved the smell too, if that adds anything.</li>
            <li> Unable to use item due to it being damaged</li>
            <li> I love, love, love CD&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner, but can&#x27;t say that this mask does anything special for my hair. Of course, my hair is neither dry, dull, or damaged--so I&#x27;m betting that would be the ticket for seeing some improvement. I&#x27;m sold on the shampoo and conditioner, but I&#x27;ll leave this product behind for next time.</li>
            <li> Use this product over and over again the results are great. I use several product in the line and I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is so amazing.  The smell is awesome.  I applied this to my hair and it was so manageable and soft and the fragrance lingered for days.  This is a keeper.  Would defiantly repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, long, easily-greasy hair and this conditioner is one of the best I&#x27;ve used. Someone had made a comment stating this product didn&#x27;t have instructions; I thought I&#x27;d let people know instructions ARE present on the product yet hidden like that of a medicine bottle, requiring you to peel the label on the container. You simply apply the conditioner to your hair after using shampoo, let it sit in your hair for 5 minutes, then rinse out. Letting the conditioner sit in your hair is CRITICAL in getting the maximum results this conditioner intended. Overall, amazing product!</li>
            <li> Fast and great product! I love carol&#x27;s daughter monio repairing hair mask. it really helps my hair to grow and become healthy!</li>
            <li> this product is keeping the hair on my head growing long.....love it  ....no more breakage....no tangles.....the is the real deal as far as hair products go</li>
            <li> This product really works.  My split ends after using twice are less split. My hair is softer and shines.  I use Monoi Repairing Hair Mask once a week.  I leave it on for 7-10 minutes and immediately I saw results.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not falling out as much. I love this hair mask, it&#x27;s great! I wish I could put this on auto-subscription.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It always leaves my hair soft and silky. It smells fantastic too! I would get it again!</li>
            <li> My hair is generally healthy but naturally wavy. I got 2 perms back to back because the stylist messed up the first time. My hair has been dry and damaged since then, but this conditioner really helped. It&#x27;s literally like magic, but I&#x27;m kindof lazy and don&#x27;t use it as often as I should.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for this product much.  I have used quite a few products and am still trying to find the right one that I can really say that I love and will stick with for my type hair.</li>
            <li> After the second use my hair was very strong, I like it and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it, however it smells awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African-American woman with thick, natural 4b hair that hits around mid-back length when it is flat ironed.  The Monoi Hair Mask is hands down the best conditioner I have ever used on my natural hair.  After I wash my hair with As I Am Coconut Cowash I apply Monoi and leave it on for about 5 minutes and rinse out.  My hair is a bed of well defined, super soft curls that can be easily combed out or finger combed.  If I&#x27;m doing my hair at home, I simply finger comb my hair (which, thanks to Monoi only takes a couple of minutes), apply a generous amount of SheaMoisture Curl &amp; Define Milk and let it air dry.  My curls are defined, soft, and last until I am ready to wash them again.  If I am getting my hair professionally done, I take Monoi to the salon with me to use for my deep conditioning treatment.  My stylist loves it.  And because Monoi conditions so well, I experience significantly less hair breakage during the comb out process.  Carol&#x27;s Daughter products are either a hit or severe miss for me, but the Monoi Hair Mask is definitely a hit.  I HIGHLY recommend this product for natural, Afro-textured hair.  The downside is the price.  For the price I think customers should be granted a bigger jar.  I get about 6-8 applications per jar; that said I apply the product very liberally, so others may be able to get a few more applications out of it than I do.</li>
            <li> I ordered this &amp;#34;Repairing Hair Mask&amp;#34; from Carol&#x27;s Daughter... but instead they sent me the Anti breakage spray... I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;Not cool.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it is pricey, but I think worth it. In my hair arsenal for sure. Following chemo, my kinky hair came back baby fine.  I was pretty scared my hair would snap from braiding or combing.  I use a tiny bit as a leave-in, and my hair breakage seems less.  In addition, it keeps my hair a bit soft and curly. Probably not for everyone, but I sure love this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product .Love it! Recommend it for all hair types. Have seen tremendous results in just one month of use,</li>
            <li> One of the best beauty products that I have ever purchased.  Way cheaper on Amazon than the big retailer.  It really does what it claims it will do and smells great - now that&#x27;s refreshing!</li>
            <li> I now know what the fuss is about.  This strengthens your hair and gives it shine. I still need a leave in conditioner to moisturize my hair after using this conditioner. It is not the case with other products like deva curl. This is not an issue but I have 4A/4B hair that does not like too much product so I sometimes skip leave ins. However, I give this 5 stars for its hair strengthening , shine and scent powers. I use this once or twice a month or right before getting a protective style. Very good product for weak and fragile hair.</li>
            <li> I am a 23 year old Caucasian woman with thick, wavy hair. I use a flat iron on my hair almost every day. This product makes my hair smell wonderful! And it makes my hair a lot softer and it straightens better after using it. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner. On,y. Deep conditioner I use, feel the difference right away. Natural kinky hair, instantly smooths and strengthens.</li>
            <li> I have used Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi repairing hair mask in the past. this product has made a significant difference in my hair.  Breakage has virtually stopped. The price from this seller was reasonable and the shipment arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I can vouch this product actually works to make hair feel and look healthier a smoother after one use&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> Got it for my ex, she loves it</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. Great conditioner. Makes hair soft and managable. Nice slip.</li>
            <li> Treats my wife&#x27;s hair like nothing else</li>
            <li> 3rd time re-ordering. A must use if you have hair like mine - thick, long, curly, and frizzy. Completely wilds out after the beach, hot weather, or a night out. Nothing works quite as good as this, not even other more expensive hair mask, and the only thing that makes my hair as smooth as the Monoi Mask is an oil treatment - which I have to leave on for hours and is heaps messier! I take about 2-3 months to use a jar, but that&#x27;s because I use it so often.</li>
            <li> Used it the same day it came and 3 days later, my hair is still sooooo manageable and soft. Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> I get my hair wet and put about 1/8 cup on my head and sit out in the sun for at least 3 hours, then I wash it out and my hair has this great feel and shine, soft and manageable, I do it about every 3 or 4 weeks.</li>
