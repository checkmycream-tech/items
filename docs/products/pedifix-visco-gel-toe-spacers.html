            <li>need to be more stable</li>
            <li>Excellent Product  Easy to order  Clear and precise order and pay system</li>
            <li>This is a great product, very comfortable and soft between the toes.</li>
            <li>I look at a large amount of places where I could buy my product and decided on this particular one for the presentation and atractive packing, plus the price was excellent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight, comfortable.</li>
            <li>spread works well, after a while they get discolored, and don&#x27;t know how to clean them!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and stays in place.</li>
            <li>I can easily wear it in my shoe.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am warning more open shoes so the need for them isn&#x27;t as great.</li>
            <li>the product does what its supposed to though you should know that they come off easily while sleeping when you move your feet around in bed.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>I wear one night and day and it is comfortable even when wearing shoes.</li>
            <li>I wished they shipped more economically to Australia.</li>
            <li>Not as comfortable as foam spacers.</li>
            <li>Using these every day between great toe and 2nd toe for bunion relief.</li>
            <li>COMFORTABLE TO WEAR.</li>
            <li>By using it along with a size wider/longer for my shoe, I stay pain free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, It&#x27;s soft, when placed in between toes is not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a better solution chatting with an avid biker.  </li>
            <li>The visco gel spacer, size small, is perfect for women with toe issues.  </li>
            <li>They fit quite well, but I like the large size better.</li>
            <li>But, it is good to wear in shoes throughout the day because the bigger bunion contraptions don&#x27;t fit into any shoes.</li>
            <li>very high (mind you, very pretty &amp; sexy, lol) heels all the time when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>They stay in place and do a good job of counteracting the tendency of my bunion (big toe) to go off exploring the rest of my foot.  </li>
            <li>good will need to buy some and dispose these that last about a month</li>
            <li>They straighten my toe, while giving mild protection from bunion.</li>
            <li>I have the beginnings of a bunion on one foot and this product helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>It feels comfortable and is very flexible.  </li>
            <li>Works better than anything else I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Very very happy with them -- it won&#x27;t correct the problem, but I believe it keeps my toes from getting worse.  </li>
            <li>It was a fun idea</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work too well; need to get a different kind.</li>
            <li>This product helps me more than most other products.</li>
            <li>Despite a successful back surgery my hallux valgus problems continued to grow (The surgery was, of course, primarily to fix my back not the foot).</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t as good as other bunion contraptions.</li>
            <li>and the spacer fits right in,</li>
            <li>I got a problem with my right foot.</li>
            <li>You can wear socks and shoes with it, soon you forget about wearing them right away.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>This one is narrower and longer than I would like, so when I wear it, it sits higher than my toes.</li>
            <li>The toes spacer material is soft, colorless and comfortable to wear through the day and night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product really eliminated my bunion pain!  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised and what we wanted.</li>
            <li>I ordered the medium first.</li>
            <li>PEDIFIX is now my first stop whenever I need anything like this.</li>
            <li>But if I&#x27;m just sitting at home then I will use the better bigger contraption, not these.</li>
            <li>They are soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that I keep losing them and need to buy more or our Yorkie steals them from my foot when the shoe is off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are 2 very small and soft silicone gels, very easy to clean, simply clean with water and mild soap.</li>
            <li>These toe spacers are great for winter time especially when everything we were is closed toes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also better for my foot in the long run.</li>
            <li>They work well and help me feel more comfortable with my bunion, since it pushes my big toe into the next toe.  </li>
            <li>My puppy loves them too, which I&#x27;m not sure is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>They are not a \\&quot;cure all\\&quot;, but they certainly help.</li>
            <li>and I called the manufacturer&#x27;s toll-free number on the package to ask about size Large.  </li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>I order and re-order these, as they work very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Its comfortable enough to not even know you have it on.</li>
            <li>This one has really done the trick.</li>
            <li>Its comfortable enough to wear while working out.  </li>
            <li>If you need to have them forwarded use &amp;#34;shipito&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;They are quite reasonable.</li>
            <li>I tried to use leukotape in order to keep my toe from moving in, but it was a (very) temporary fix.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful for those with a hammer toe.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll help correct the alignment or not, but my feet feel so much happier.</li>
            <li>so when the pain returns I am ready.</li>
            <li>This type of spacer worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li>If your toes are very close together</li>
            <li>HELPS KEEP TOE IN STRAIGHT..</li>
            <li>These spacers really helped my bunion and foot neuroma.</li>
            <li>Works to cushion tired feet ok but will slip Ok value for the money if you have an issue with pain</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to - can&#x27;t ask for more or less.  </li>
            <li>But she also was able to give me two nearby local retailers who definitely stock the product -- in size Large!  </li>
            <li>They are very soft, and fit under my socks usually without becoming dislodged.</li>
            <li>The separators help push my big toe back just enough to be more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I wear them on both feet even though I only have a bunion on my right foot and it helps with the pain from standing 40 hours a week at my job (for both feet!)</li>
            <li>The shoe store near my house sells these for a higher price plus tax.</li>
            <li>I have no ill effect from using it as frequently as I do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Simply slipping this toe spacer in on a regular day is a quick and effective way to keep my bunion pain under control as well as actually help correct my toe&#x27;s position.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lasted me about six months before noticing the material breaking down and becoming really flimsy....</li>
            <li>also suggest Visco to use a more durable gel material to prevent breakage after a few months.  </li>
            <li>Went right in the trash, didn&#x27;t even bother to mail it back.</li>
            <li>These little toe spacers really are super comfortable and keep my toes from rubbing together - I wear them to work out, do long walks -- I would even wear them to bed if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that I might lose them in my sheets during the night.  </li>
            <li>They stay in place, and are so comfortable that I&#x27;m not aware I&#x27;m wearing them.</li>
            <li>The other 9 were backordered and arrived a couple of weeks later, which was fine, as I had the first pair.  </li>
            <li>They might work for a VERY mild bunion if you only need a very minor correction.</li>
            <li>They are also VERY soft and don&#x27;t really keep your big toe separate, so I still felt pain in my feet while working out, whereas normally I wouldn&#x27;t when I wear toe spacers.</li>
            <li>Which is fine, because months is a very long time for a toe separator to last.    </li>
            <li>They can fit in the shoe without taking up space or without feeling to tight in the shoe.  </li>
            <li>Further, where are its size Large on Amazon?</li>
            <li>Finally I had so much pain</li>
            <li>So, the spacers worked very well for me, but as with all orthopedic devices it may be different from person to person.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft and squishy, which I was not expecting, and I don&#x27;t even notice that they&#x27;re there anymore.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft, I forget I&#x27;m even wearing them.</li>
            <li>I had recently been having a lot of pain in my big toe, right at the joint.  </li>
            <li>They are very soft and flexible, so I barely know they are there.</li>
            <li>The person who answered at PEDIFIX knew their product line extremely well and told me that the Large size of this product probably would not be large enough for me.  </li>
            <li>I imagine they may break down over time from constant use but so worth it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These little stuff really do their job, I am so much happier now.</li>
            <li>My bunion really pushes my big and second toes to the side.  </li>
            <li>It feels thicker than the first one, so I guess over a few months they sort of pack in and become a little less effective and need replaced.</li>
            <li>These did not help my condition at all because they are so soft that they didn&#x27;t reposition my big toe at all.  </li>
            <li>As always the shipment arrived promptly and the product Gel was soft enough but I needed another answer to my problem!</li>
            <li>I was hoping to see a thicker ones because of my serious bunions, I would glad to see different sizes for various conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping that it would help keep my big toe aligned and push away from 2nd toe, but when I walk, it&#x27;s too soft  and squished that it&#x27;s almost as if nothing is there.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so thin that it doesn&#x27;t actually \\&quot;separate\\&quot; or feel anything better.</li>
            <li>A pleasure when I am wearing my closed shoe high heels.</li>
            <li>Depending on amount of usage, these wear down quite fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for several months but its SO SOFT that it doesn&#x27;t actually separate the big toe and 2nd toe.</li>
            <li>These little silicon gel toe separators work very well.  </li>
            <li>I have another pair of toe spacers that I&#x27;ve been using almost daily for over 5 years, and they are still as good as they were when I bought them, too bad</li>

            <li> good will need to buy some and dispose these that last about a month</li>
            <li> They straighten my toe, while giving mild protection from bunion.</li>
            <li> I have the beginnings of a bunion on one foot and this product helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> It feels comfortable and is very flexible.  </li>
            <li> Works better than anything else I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Very very happy with them -- it won&#x27;t correct the problem, but I believe it keeps my toes from getting worse.  </li>
            <li> It was a fun idea</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work too well; need to get a different kind.</li>
            <li> This product helps me more than most other products.</li>
            <li> Despite a successful back surgery my hallux valgus problems continued to grow (The surgery was, of course, primarily to fix my back not the foot).</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as good as other bunion contraptions.</li>
            <li> and the spacer fits right in,</li>
            <li> I got a problem with my right foot.</li>
            <li> You can wear socks and shoes with it, soon you forget about wearing them right away.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This one is narrower and longer than I would like, so when I wear it, it sits higher than my toes.</li>
            <li> The toes spacer material is soft, colorless and comfortable to wear through the day and night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product really eliminated my bunion pain!  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised and what we wanted.</li>
            <li> I ordered the medium first.</li>
            <li> PEDIFIX is now my first stop whenever I need anything like this.</li>
            <li> But if I&#x27;m just sitting at home then I will use the better bigger contraption, not these.</li>
            <li> They are soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that I keep losing them and need to buy more or our Yorkie steals them from my foot when the shoe is off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are 2 very small and soft silicone gels, very easy to clean, simply clean with water and mild soap.</li>
            <li> These toe spacers are great for winter time especially when everything we were is closed toes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also better for my foot in the long run.</li>
            <li> They work well and help me feel more comfortable with my bunion, since it pushes my big toe into the next toe.  </li>
            <li> My puppy loves them too, which I&#x27;m not sure is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> They are not a \\&quot;cure all\\&quot;, but they certainly help.</li>
            <li> and I called the manufacturer&#x27;s toll-free number on the package to ask about size Large.  </li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> I order and re-order these, as they work very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Its comfortable enough to not even know you have it on.</li>
            <li> This one has really done the trick.</li>
            <li> Its comfortable enough to wear while working out.  </li>
            <li> If you need to have them forwarded use &amp;#34;shipito&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;They are quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> I tried to use leukotape in order to keep my toe from moving in, but it was a (very) temporary fix.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful for those with a hammer toe.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll help correct the alignment or not, but my feet feel so much happier.</li>
            <li> so when the pain returns I am ready.</li>
            <li> This type of spacer worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li> If your toes are very close together</li>
            <li> HELPS KEEP TOE IN STRAIGHT..</li>
            <li> These spacers really helped my bunion and foot neuroma.</li>
            <li> Works to cushion tired feet ok but will slip Ok value for the money if you have an issue with pain</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to - can&#x27;t ask for more or less.  </li>
            <li> But she also was able to give me two nearby local retailers who definitely stock the product -- in size Large!  </li>
            <li> They are very soft, and fit under my socks usually without becoming dislodged.</li>
            <li> The separators help push my big toe back just enough to be more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I wear them on both feet even though I only have a bunion on my right foot and it helps with the pain from standing 40 hours a week at my job (for both feet!)</li>
            <li> The shoe store near my house sells these for a higher price plus tax.</li>
            <li> I have no ill effect from using it as frequently as I do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Simply slipping this toe spacer in on a regular day is a quick and effective way to keep my bunion pain under control as well as actually help correct my toe&#x27;s position.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted me about six months before noticing the material breaking down and becoming really flimsy....</li>
            <li> also suggest Visco to use a more durable gel material to prevent breakage after a few months.  </li>
            <li> Went right in the trash, didn&#x27;t even bother to mail it back.</li>
            <li> These little toe spacers really are super comfortable and keep my toes from rubbing together - I wear them to work out, do long walks -- I would even wear them to bed if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that I might lose them in my sheets during the night.  </li>
            <li> They stay in place, and are so comfortable that I&#x27;m not aware I&#x27;m wearing them.</li>
            <li> The other 9 were backordered and arrived a couple of weeks later, which was fine, as I had the first pair.  </li>
            <li> They might work for a VERY mild bunion if you only need a very minor correction.</li>
            <li> They are also VERY soft and don&#x27;t really keep your big toe separate, so I still felt pain in my feet while working out, whereas normally I wouldn&#x27;t when I wear toe spacers.</li>
            <li> Which is fine, because months is a very long time for a toe separator to last.    </li>
            <li> They can fit in the shoe without taking up space or without feeling to tight in the shoe.  </li>
            <li> Further, where are its size Large on Amazon?</li>
            <li> Finally I had so much pain</li>
            <li> So, the spacers worked very well for me, but as with all orthopedic devices it may be different from person to person.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft and squishy, which I was not expecting, and I don&#x27;t even notice that they&#x27;re there anymore.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft, I forget I&#x27;m even wearing them.</li>
            <li> I had recently been having a lot of pain in my big toe, right at the joint.  </li>
            <li> They are very soft and flexible, so I barely know they are there.</li>
            <li> The person who answered at PEDIFIX knew their product line extremely well and told me that the Large size of this product probably would not be large enough for me.  </li>
            <li> I imagine they may break down over time from constant use but so worth it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These little stuff really do their job, I am so much happier now.</li>
            <li> My bunion really pushes my big and second toes to the side.  </li>
            <li> It feels thicker than the first one, so I guess over a few months they sort of pack in and become a little less effective and need replaced.</li>
            <li> These did not help my condition at all because they are so soft that they didn&#x27;t reposition my big toe at all.  </li>
            <li> As always the shipment arrived promptly and the product Gel was soft enough but I needed another answer to my problem!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to see a thicker ones because of my serious bunions, I would glad to see different sizes for various conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping that it would help keep my big toe aligned and push away from 2nd toe, but when I walk, it&#x27;s too soft  and squished that it&#x27;s almost as if nothing is there.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so thin that it doesn&#x27;t actually \\&quot;separate\\&quot; or feel anything better.</li>
            <li> A pleasure when I am wearing my closed shoe high heels.</li>
            <li> Depending on amount of usage, these wear down quite fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for several months but its SO SOFT that it doesn&#x27;t actually separate the big toe and 2nd toe.</li>
            <li> These little silicon gel toe separators work very well.  </li>
            <li> I have another pair of toe spacers that I&#x27;ve been using almost daily for over 5 years, and they are still as good as they were when I bought them, too bad</li>
            <li> My foot doctor explained that it is not practical to correct my bunion by surgery, because my feet are so flat and it would take several operations.</li>
            <li> I found them to be very narrow but unusually tall compared to the ones I&#x27;ve found at my local RiteAid.  </li>
            <li> My feet are normal to narrow size.</li>
            <li> Since you get two spacers,  I suggest that you alternate using a different one every other night.</li>
            <li> Others that I have purchased in the past were too large and I felt like I had jammed something in my foot.</li>
            <li> I started to look for something that I can wear all day long</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product like this one for so long.</li>
            <li> I like it because it does separate my big toe from the other toe yet as soon as its removed for a long period of time</li>
            <li> Its washable and reusable for a very long time.</li>
            <li> wash it each evening and let it dry overnight.</li>
            <li> I wear size 12 shoes and there is a very large gap naturally between the base of my big toe and my second toe.  </li>
            <li> I have a broken big toe that cannot be fixed and</li>
            <li> This morning, I couldn&#x27;t find it and used the other one instead.</li>
            <li> They are small enough to not cause discomfort.</li>
            <li> The toes glide against it each other rather than rub, and I don&#x27;t have any blisters.  </li>
            <li> Ether way, when I have used them I am still not sure they are actually helping.</li>
            <li> At a reunion with the surgeon that had made the back surgey I complained about my foot.</li>
            <li> If I walk for a long time I develop a blister between my small toe and its neighbor.  </li>
            <li> It needs to be thicker and less squishy.</li>
            <li> Some shoes, they make them a little tight.</li>
            <li> I wear these everyday now and my feet hurt dramatically less.</li>
            <li> They do get smushed a little after a while, so I replace them every 3 months.</li>
            <li> Wake up in the morning with little or no pain.&lt;br /&gt;Robin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say how wide you need a space between toes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also losing it&#x27;s shape after a few wears, getting squashed into an even narrower shape and remaining that way after wear.</li>
            <li> I had ordered 10 packs and one arrived in a few days.  </li>
            <li> I wear it everyday, at night and even out and about.</li>
            <li> Too mushy, waste of money.</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t start to hurt until a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I have a corn that would give me pain everyday.</li>
            <li> They were not comfortable in my shoes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a runner, and flat footed, so I have a problem with my bunion getting worse with each step.   </li>
            <li> Since then I put them on everyday and at night I don&#x27;t feel the usual pain that have been troubling me for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went to an orthopedic doctor who told me that \\&quot;You have to get used to it, it will continue to get worse throughout your life\\&quot;, and then to a physiotherapist that said he could cure me if I was prepared to spend lots of money on a long treatment.</li>
            <li> I have a bunion on my left foot that is quite painful; orthotics have caused plantar fasciitis and I tried these gel separators as a last resort.  </li>
            <li> No more foot cramps</li>
            <li> He told me that maybe I could try the small toe spacers they sell in the pharmacies.</li>
            <li> When I do long hikes or runs, I tape my foot up to provide support, but I&#x27;d become a crazy person if I had to tape my foot every day just to walk around.</li>
            <li> They work, but they&#x27;re very thick and don&#x27;t help you gradually add width, causing a change in my gait pattern.</li>
            <li> Too soon to notice a difference, but i can see where they may help make my bunions not get any worse.</li>
            <li> My toes don&#x27;t feel cramped or smushed, and my feet aren&#x27;t sore or tired at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I use it maintain space for a broken toe that healed poorly ....</li>
            <li> One day my bunions really troubled me</li>
            <li> but the size was wrong.</li>
            <li> I have worn them before but lost my one pair -- was desperate to find them elsewhere, as drug stores tend to not stock these.  </li>
            <li> Really disappointed in packaging.</li>
            <li> and they are very painful after hours of walking or standing.</li>

            <li> Ineffective for my bunions!</li>
            <li> I really like these. They straighten my toe, while giving mild protection from bunion. Some shoes, they make them a little tight. But I&#x27;ll wear around house. Too soon to notice a difference, but i can see where they may help make my bunions not get any worse. Comfortable to wear. They don&#x27;t slip. They stay in place. You may need added bunion pad, but I like the seperator part of it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this before. Now I ordered for my friends.</li>
            <li> I got one of these from the foot doctor, but lost it.  Saw this one line and it works as well.  It&#x27;s good if you have a bunion and \\&quot;kissing toes\\&quot;, as the doctor called it.</li>
            <li> My foot doctor explained that it is not practical to correct my bunion by surgery, because my feet are so flat and it would take several operations. He recommended these spacers to take the pressure off the 2nd toe. They work excellently. I wear one night and day and it is comfortable even when wearing shoes.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have purchased this sooner! I have the beginnings of a bunion on one foot and this product helps tremendously. Easy to use and stays in place. No more foot cramps and now I have &amp;#34;happy feet&amp;#34;. I imagine they may break down over time from constant use but so worth it! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and Seller. A+++++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a runner, and flat footed, so I have a problem with my bunion getting worse with each step.   These spacers are great to prevent pain. I never run without them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading great reviews. I&#x27;ve been using the product for several months but its SO SOFT that it doesn&#x27;t actually separate the big toe and 2nd toe. I was hoping that it would help keep my big toe aligned and push away from 2nd toe, but when I walk, it&#x27;s too soft  and squished that it&#x27;s almost as if nothing is there. I have a tiny bit of space between my big toe/2nd toe and the spacer fits right in, but it&#x27;s so thin that it doesn&#x27;t actually \\&quot;separate\\&quot; or feel anything better. My feet are normal to narrow size. I tried placing it &#x27;higher\\&quot; towards the top of the toes, but its still not as effective as I hoped and falls. It needs to be thicker and less squishy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace a gel toe separator I had before and lost, but can&#x27;t seem to find the same one. This one is narrower and longer than I would like, so when I wear it, it sits higher than my toes. It&#x27;s also losing it&#x27;s shape after a few wears, getting squashed into an even narrower shape and remaining that way after wear. I need something durable that I can run in and this isn&#x27;t going to do it for me</li>
            <li> I order and re-order these, as they work very well.  I had ordered 10 packs and one arrived in a few days.  The other 9 were backordered and arrived a couple of weeks later, which was fine, as I had the first pair.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have bunions on both feet and they are very painful after hours of walking or standing. The pain would occur even if I sit all day, it&#x27;s just not as pain as I walk/stand. I started to look for something that I can wear all day long and I found this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though they are small, you can feel it in between the toes, so I never wear it it after first use. One day my bunions really troubled me so I put them on in my socks.. after a couple hours, I didn&#x27;t feel the pain anymore! Since then I put them on everyday and at night I don&#x27;t feel the usual pain that have been troubling me for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are 2 very small and soft silicone gels, very easy to clean, simply clean with water and mild soap. I was hoping to see a thicker ones because of my serious bunions, I would glad to see different sizes for various conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These little stuff really do their job, I am so much happier now.</li>
            <li> My bunion really pushes my big and second toes to the side.  These did not help my condition at all because they are so soft that they didn&#x27;t reposition my big toe at all.  They might work for a VERY mild bunion if you only need a very minor correction.</li>
            <li> The toes spacer material is soft, colorless and comfortable to wear through the day and night.&lt;br /&gt;It takes pressure effectively from the bunion and ball bones in every step!  I suggest a product rename to Bunion Support, instead of Toe Spacer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also suggest Visco to use a more durable gel material to prevent breakage after a few months.  Further, where are its size Large on Amazon?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know these came in different sizes until I bought this one. They are perfect. Others that I have purchased in the past were too large and I felt like I had jammed something in my foot. Just perfect!</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday, at night and even out and about. Its comfortable enough to not even know you have it on. I like it because it does separate my big toe from the other toe yet as soon as its removed for a long period of time it will gradually begin to go back in that direction.</li>
            <li> Too mushy, waste of money. Nothing works for bunions but surgery. Went right in the trash, didn&#x27;t even bother to mail it back.</li>
            <li> These gel spacers are very nice.  They are effective and gentle, and help to reposition my great toe.  I have a bunion on my left foot that is quite painful; orthotics have caused plantar fasciitis and I tried these gel separators as a last resort.  I love them.  They are not a \\&quot;cure all\\&quot;, but they certainly help.</li>
            <li> I had bunion surgery years ago, and while it was successful, a tendon tightened up and I needed to wear a toe separator to get it loosened back up. This one has really done the trick. I&#x27;ve worn one of the pair (you get two, since most people will need them for both feet) for months, with great results. This morning, I couldn&#x27;t find it and used the other one instead. It feels thicker than the first one, so I guess over a few months they sort of pack in and become a little less effective and need replaced. Which is fine, because months is a very long time for a toe separator to last.    It works great and is a great value, and this shipper was fast and packed it well.</li>
            <li> My ladies said they had never seen anything like this product east of the border to the known universe.</li>
            <li> I received this product within a week. It&#x27;s very light weight, comfortable. I can easily wear it in my shoe.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I received only 1, the order should have had two in the package.</li>
            <li> I look at a large amount of places where I could buy my product and decided on this particular one for the presentation and atractive packing, plus the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> During a problem with sciatic nerve pain I got a problem with my right foot. It evolved into hallux valgus on my big toe. Despite a successful back surgery my hallux valgus problems continued to grow (The surgery was, of course, primarily to fix my back not the foot). Finally I had so much pain it was difficult to walk, and I had to give up some of my favorite shoes. I went to an orthopedic doctor who told me that \\&quot;You have to get used to it, it will continue to get worse throughout your life\\&quot;, and then to a physiotherapist that said he could cure me if I was prepared to spend lots of money on a long treatment. At a reunion with the surgeon that had made the back surgey I complained about my foot. He told me that maybe I could try the small toe spacers they sell in the pharmacies. I have now used a toe spacer every day for about two months and I´d say that 80% of my hallux valgus problems have disappeared. I have still problems with some shoes, but I do not have any pains. So, the spacers worked very well for me, but as with all orthopedic devices it may be different from person to person.</li>
            <li> I have always had bunions but they didn&#x27;t start to hurt until a few years ago. I wear these between my big toe and 2nd toe every time I leave the house. They are great and my feet almost never hurt. They do get smushed a little after a while, so I replace them every 3 months. I would recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a solution to bunions but a Great alternative for temporary relief. When used while wearing flats, it helped quite a bit. It is also discreet enough it will not show while wearing flats. Again, wearing better shoes with more room and support is preferred. But when you&#x27;re going out and plan to walk quite a bit, this was a great alternative and temp relief. Depending on amount of usage, these wear down quite fast. I&#x27;d only wear these when bunion is inflamed, so it&#x27;s not quite that often. It&#x27;s lasted me about six months before noticing the material breaking down and becoming really flimsy.... no longer offering the support is once had.</li>
            <li> This product really eliminated my bunion pain!  Its comfortable enough to wear while working out.  This is an awesome product that really works to relieve pain and align your toes.</li>
            <li> Of all of the products I&#x27;ve purchased to help correct my beginning of a bunion, this is the best. It is simple, doesn&#x27;t cause any discomfort and encourages my big toe to straighten out a bit, the way it should be. When I do long hikes or runs, I tape my foot up to provide support, but I&#x27;d become a crazy person if I had to tape my foot every day just to walk around. Simply slipping this toe spacer in on a regular day is a quick and effective way to keep my bunion pain under control as well as actually help correct my toe&#x27;s position.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say how wide you need a space between toes.  I have a broken big toe that cannot be fixed and it feels better when I use the spacer.  It&#x27;s also better for my foot in the long run.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable. I&#x27;m wearing one between my big toe and the next toe. I used to put cotton between those toes, but the cotton doesn&#x27;t stay in place. These are rubber. They stay in place, and are so comfortable that I&#x27;m not aware I&#x27;m wearing them. They keep their shape after washing. The shoe store near my house sells these for a higher price plus tax.</li>
            <li> I use these toe spacers to separate pinky toe from ring toe and big toe from pointer toe.  I do need to cut the height of the spacers.  These are the only product i have found (and i have tried everything out there) that actually stays in place and relieves pressure and pain.</li>
            <li> What a piece of junk these toe spacers are. I wore them once (!!!) for a workout, and after just one time they got deformed. They are also VERY soft and don&#x27;t really keep your big toe separate, so I still felt pain in my feet while working out, whereas normally I wouldn&#x27;t when I wear toe spacers. I have another pair of toe spacers that I&#x27;ve been using almost daily for over 5 years, and they are still as good as they were when I bought them, too bad I forgot what brand they are.</li>
            <li> As described and arrived on time.  Look forward to buying again in the future.</li>
            <li> These little silicon gel toe separators work very well.  They stay in place and do a good job of counteracting the tendency of my bunion (big toe) to go off exploring the rest of my foot.  Works better than anything else I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, It&#x27;s soft, when placed in between toes is not uncomfortable. I recommend this product to my clients that have  problem with bunions or hammer toes.</li>
            <li> A pleasure when I am wearing my closed shoe high heels. Instant relief. Saved the night at a wedding I attended. Not for me but for the bride.</li>
            <li> I have had several sets of toe spacers from several different companies. These are my favorites. They are very soft and flexible, so I barely know they are there. My toes don&#x27;t feel cramped or smushed, and my feet aren&#x27;t sore or tired at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Again, a good product and will buy again.  I ruined my feet wearing very high (mind you, very pretty &amp; sexy, lol) heels all the time when I was younger.  I now rely on all sorts of foot support products for any &amp;#34;extended use&amp;#34; of feet.  This product helps me more than most other products.</li>
            <li> These are very good quality. I wished they shipped more economically to Australia. If you need to have them forwarded use &amp;#34;shipito&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;They are quite reasonable. They definitely help my toe problem</li>
            <li> Works to cushion tired feet ok but will slip Ok value for the money if you have an issue with pain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for years. I just purchased replacements for two of them since the originals were looking  a bit ragged and several years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After placing it between the big toe and the index toe, it may take a few minutes to get used to the toe spacer, but it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash it each evening and let it dry overnight. Since you get two spacers,  I suggest that you alternate using a different one every other night.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to - can&#x27;t ask for more or less.  It feels comfortable and is very flexible.  My puppy loves them too, which I&#x27;m not sure is a good thing.  But if this is what you&#x27;re looking for, don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised and what we wanted. This item is just as pictured. Most useful product that arrived promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> I had recently been having a lot of pain in my big toe, right at the joint.  I tried to use leukotape in order to keep my toe from moving in, but it was a (very) temporary fix.  This product actually helps, and I don&#x27;t even realize I&#x27;m wearing it - whereas the tape would roll and pinch my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Not as comfortable as foam spacers. sticks to skin.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for those with a hammer toe.</li>
            <li> I wear these everyday now and my feet hurt dramatically less. They&#x27;re so soft and squishy, which I was not expecting, and I don&#x27;t even notice that they&#x27;re there anymore. I wear them on both feet even though I only have a bunion on my right foot and it helps with the pain from standing 40 hours a week at my job (for both feet!) I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll help correct the alignment or not, but my feet feel so much happier.</li>
            <li> These were a bit thicker than I had thought, however they work nicely.  I keep them covered with powder and they work great when I hike.</li>
            <li> These do an exceptional job separating my toes and easing the pain. They&#x27;re so soft, I forget I&#x27;m even wearing them. I wear a size 10 shoe. I ordered the medium first. They fit quite well, but I like the large size better.</li>
            <li> Using these every day between great toe and 2nd toe for bunion relief. It has helped with positioning the toes and has reduced bunion pain and deformity. Praying it will prevent surgery in the future. I am able to wear more shoes without pain now than I could before using these spacers.</li>
            <li> These spacers are very comfortable and help eleviate foot soreness.  I do not use them day at this point but have them close so when the pain returns I am ready.</li>
            <li> They work well and help me feel more comfortable with my bunion, since it pushes my big toe into the next toe.  The separators help push my big toe back just enough to be more comfortable.</li>
            <li> This product may be inexpensive, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  The gel spacers do not stay put inside your shoe.  May work if you&#x27;re using them to paint your toenails but that&#x27;s about all it&#x27;s good for.</li>
            <li> This type of spacer worked very well for me.  They are very soft, and fit under my socks usually without becoming dislodged. They are small enough to not cause discomfort.</li>
            <li> Works marvelously to relieve my toe pain and enable me to enjoy walking again.  Will be purchasing again!  Great value.</li>
            <li> I feel better when I put them in my toe. I have bunions that hurts. You can wear socks and shoes with it, soon you forget about wearing them right away.</li>
            <li> I use the toe spacers every night for relief. Wake up in the morning with little or no pain.&lt;br /&gt;Robin I</li>
            <li> I use these for after my bunion surgery, to help keep my toes spread works well, after a while they get discolored, and don&#x27;t know how to clean them!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product like this one for so long. I have crooked toes and all my problems are gone with this product. I am able to walk without pain again with it. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I have been diagnosed with &amp;#34;crossover toes&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m doing my best to keep my toes healthy and uncrossed!  These little toe spacers really are super comfortable and keep my toes from rubbing together - I wear them to work out, do long walks -- I would even wear them to bed if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that I might lose them in my sheets during the night.  I have worn them before but lost my one pair -- was desperate to find them elsewhere, as drug stores tend to not stock these.  Very very happy with them -- it won&#x27;t correct the problem, but I believe it keeps my toes from getting worse.  I love them!</li>
            <li> If your toes are very close together and you prefer ultrasoft spacers, these may work for you.  I found them to be very narrow but unusually tall compared to the ones I&#x27;ve found at my local RiteAid.  I wear size 12 shoes and there is a very large gap naturally between the base of my big toe and my second toe.  I noticed that these were size Medium and I called the manufacturer&#x27;s toll-free number on the package to ask about size Large.  The person who answered at PEDIFIX knew their product line extremely well and told me that the Large size of this product probably would not be large enough for me.  She directed me to a larger and firmer (flesh-colored) toe spacer called a \\&quot;Bunion Reliever\\&quot; which Amazon has in three sizes.  But she also was able to give me two nearby local retailers who definitely stock the product -- in size Large!  How often can a company do THAT!  Excellent!  PEDIFIX is now my first stop whenever I need anything like this.</li>
            <li> They work, but they&#x27;re very thick and don&#x27;t help you gradually add width, causing a change in my gait pattern. It was a fun idea but the size was wrong.</li>
            <li> Now I can walk pain free! I wear them every day. I have a corn that would give me pain everyday. I stand all day and these gel spacers took away the pain and I can do my work and dance like Fred Astaire.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product  Easy to order  Clear and precise order and pay system</li>
            <li> Good product for anybody.</li>
            <li> These toe spacers are great for winter time especially when everything we were is closed toes. The spacers actually help relief the pressure point which is usually the bunion on your feet and instead help straighten your toes in order to create a bigger surface area onto which your shoes touch your feet thus distributing the pressure all along your foot instead on the first point of contact, your bunion. Its washable and reusable for a very long time.</li>
            <li> If I walk for a long time I develop a blister between my small toe and its neighbor.  I tried these toe separators to prevent the blister but they did not work for me. I have given myself a chance to get used to them and suffered with them for 2 weeks wearing them every day.  They slipped out from between my toes.  They were not comfortable in my shoes. I felt them all the time.  And they irritated the skin between the toes while they were in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a better solution chatting with an avid biker.  He uses BodyGlide to prevent saddle sores, I decided to try BodyGlide between my toes and it totally solved my problem. I use BodyGlide [[ASIN:B000WDSL24 Bodyglide Anti-chafe Balm]] between my toes every day.  The toes glide against it each other rather than rub, and I don&#x27;t have any blisters.  I have no ill effect from using it as frequently as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> HELPS KEEP TOE IN STRAIGHT.. COMFORTABLE TO WEAR. CAN BE WASHED. WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.NOT TO PRICEY.DON&#x27;T RUB SKIN. LIKE OTHERS</li>
            <li> As always the shipment arrived promptly and the product Gel was soft enough but I needed another answer to my problem!</li>
            <li> I have a neuroma at my second toe, and was advised that the toe spacer would help in taking the pressure from a bunion from pressing on the nerve with the gel toe spacer (as used by ballerinas).  It has helped me.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as good as other bunion contraptions. I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; any changes in the formation of my bunions. But, it is good to wear in shoes throughout the day because the bigger bunion contraptions don&#x27;t fit into any shoes. So, it is great for that. I can see it does prevent my toes from squishing together inside my shoes quite well. But if I&#x27;m just sitting at home then I will use the better bigger contraption, not these.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work too well; need to get a different kind.</li>
            <li> good will need to buy some and dispose these that last about a month</li>
            <li> Really disappointed in packaging. Not as advertised so spacers are already squished. Won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, very comfortable and soft between the toes. These spacers really helped my bunion and foot neuroma. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Part of it may be that I keep forgetting to use them, or maybe it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s the spring now and I am warning more open shoes so the need for them isn&#x27;t as great. Ether way, when I have used them I am still not sure they are actually helping. Sometimes they make the shoes feel tighter than they were, but I am us anything is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> The visco gel spacer, size small, is perfect for women with toe issues.  I use it maintain space for a broken toe that healed poorly ....does the trick and fits inside my shoes.  Great product.</li>
            <li> For those with foot problems such as toes that turn crooked and for people with bunions to keep the next toe from compensating these spacers do help.  They can fit in the shoe without taking up space or without feeling to tight in the shoe.  They are soft and comfortable. The only problem I have is that I keep losing them and need to buy more or our Yorkie steals them from my foot when the shoe is off.</li>
            <li> These work for me...  I walk a lot (Fitbit).</li>
            <li> the product does what its supposed to though you should know that they come off easily while sleeping when you move your feet around in bed.  I wear a pair of socks which keeps the product in place!  Keeps your toes aligned which is what was needed.</li>
            <li> My toe spacers are great.  I have only recently needed a product like this...I am glad to know about these, and will order more.  By using it along with a size wider/longer for my shoe, I stay pain free.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay put&#x27; lost them within a very short time, in my shoes and in my socks. need to be more stable</li>
