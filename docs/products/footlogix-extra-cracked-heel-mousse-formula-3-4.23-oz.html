            <li>Best product I have found after trying dozens.</li>
            <li>This is the best creme I have found for my cracked heels.</li>

            <li>and I still love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome and works great if used at least once a day.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I was able to purchase on line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>make sure to wash our hands after applying.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Amazon is always my first choice when the doctor recommends something,price was quite good as well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Non-greasy and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Great for dry feet, toes and heels.</li>
            <li>nothing special will continue to use it</li>
            <li>I have been using it daily as maintenance and it has helped a good bit.</li>
            <li>I have purchased other footlogic products and they were great ...</li>
            <li>I have used many many products in an attempt to soften foot calluses and moisturize at the same</li>
            <li>but the foam doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb that quickly.</li>
            <li>Clears up my cracked feet quickly.  </li>
            <li>This foam is the secret to beautiful feet!  </li>
            <li>Worth the price for something that really does work!</li>
            <li>This skin mousse keeps it hydrated and and is very gentle.</li>
            <li>I first discovered this at my nail salon-recommend it</li>
            <li>Make it part of your routine and your heels should be smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The directions say use twice daily, but I have found once in the morning when pulling my socks on works just fine.</li>
            <li>They are not perfect, but they sure are a whole lot better!</li>
            <li>I really thought this would work but</li>
            <li>Fantastic product - the only thing that has ever worked!</li>
            <li>Works well and is fast to use.  </li>
            <li>The price was much cheaper</li>
            <li>My heels were so cracked, it hurt to walk, Footlogix healed them fast and now I use it all sandal season.</li>
            <li>I have severely dry heels and have tried many lotions, ointments and other treatments - this is the one thing that has shown significant results.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and dry finish and leaves feet feeling silky like.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;than where I normally would buy it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, and you can almost feel it starting to work right away.  </li>
            <li>I love these products as I have purchased them in the past for myself.</li>
            <li>it really does work if you use it daily after a shower.</li>
            <li>Once you have used it a few times, you will find that twice a week is more than enough to keep your skin moist.  </li>
            <li>When you don&#x27;t use it, your heels go right back to being gross.</li>
            <li>This cracked heel formula by Footlogix really made a difference in the appearance of my cracked dry heels in quite a short amount of time!</li>
            <li>It is very to use and does dry almost immediately which is a big plus.</li>
            <li>The stuff is weird--like shaving cream only not wet or oily.  </li>
            <li>Especially in the summer when I walk around with sandals or bare feet.</li>
            <li>These efforts would barely hold back the heel cracks, but would not stop them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Especially if you wear sandals or go around the house bare footed.</li>
            <li>I get very deep wide cracks in my heels from walking barefoot on the beach and concrete.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap, but each can lasts a long time and believe me, it is well worth the investment.</li>

            <li> My Mom has sensitive skin due to debriding of the skin on her foot (ulcer) and a tie amputation.  </li>
            <li> Being 49 years old and having &amp;#34;cow hooves&amp;#34; is no fun.  </li>
            <li> Eventually the cracks go away, and as long as we keep using it twice a day, the cracks don&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> I actually haven&#x27;t used it in a couple days and my heels are STILL not cracked and dry</li>
            <li> can also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts a very,very long time.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If I lost my home and my job and had to sleep under a bridge to keep dry, I would still collect pocket change until I could afford a can of this foam.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry feet</li>
            <li> I have only had it a few weeks</li>
            <li> the rough skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> I have use this product in both a professional and personal setting and I can tell you without fail if you follow the instructions, you will see results.</li>
            <li> faithfully you will definitely find an improvement in those hard to treat calluses.  </li>
            <li> I had cracked heels from wearing flipflops all the time and this product healed my feet with just a few applications.  </li>
            <li> It suggest using an amount the size of a walnut, I would suggest a small walnut.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say than that.  </li>
            <li> received wrong product,unable to sent back</li>
            <li> not sure how this cracked heel formula works, but we rub a small amount on twice a day and it seems to dissolve the thick skin around the cracks.</li>
            <li> At least my feet wouldn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My foot calluses will be so thick that a podiatrist has to shave them to get hem under control.  </li>
            <li> No more cracked heels or skin!  </li>
            <li> cracked heals are getting worse as I am using it..</li>
            <li> I have used virtually every product on the market;even used to use petroleum jelly and thick socks to combat the harsh Midwestern winters. :(</li>
            <li> Small price for avoiding those painful and irritating heel cracks.</li>
            <li> The painful cuts are healed in two days.</li>
            <li> I went from painful cracked heels to non cracked in no time at all.</li>
            <li> very disappointed that this product....does not work ..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Helpful.  I need to remember to apply it twice a day.</li>
            <li> very disappointed that this product....does not work ..I have purchased other footlogic products and they were great ...I really thought this would work but cracked heals are getting worse as I am using it..</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before from Amazon.  I have very dry feet and nothing helped until I purchased this product.  Non-greasy and fragrance free.</li>
            <li> great non-greasy product, scent free and it works</li>
            <li> I have used many many products in an attempt to soften foot calluses and moisturize at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;It comes out of the can like shaving cream. Only a small amount is needed. It does not leave an oily sticky residue like many moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;If you use this product faithfully you will definitely find an improvement in those hard to treat calluses.  And your feet will be moisturized at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;The can also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this in a spa by the technician doing my pedicure.  Once you have used it a few times, you will find that twice a week is more than enough to keep your skin moist.  Does not leave a slipperiness like lotion.  Best product I have found after trying dozens.</li>
            <li> I have use this product in both a professional and personal setting and I can tell you without fail if you follow the instructions, you will see results.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product - the only thing that has ever worked!</li>
            <li> The absolute best heel repair I have ever used! Worth the price for something that really does work!</li>
            <li> Use the product about once a week.  Easy to use and is not greasy.  Works well and is fast to use.  Good service from company.</li>
            <li> love it,should of set it up on auto so i would get it every 60 days..</li>
            <li> Works great. Would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> This is the best creme I have found for my cracked heels. I get very deep wide cracks in my heels from walking barefoot on the beach and concrete. I apply foot creme, but it doesn&#x27;t do the trick this product does. It is so great that when I ran out, I immediately did an internet search to find the mousse because in my experience this is the BEST for quickly sealing the splits. The painful cuts are healed in two days.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a MIRACLE! The only thing I&#x27;ve ever used that actually WORKS to heal cracked heels.</li>
            <li> If I lost my home and my job and had to sleep under a bridge to keep dry, I would still collect pocket change until I could afford a can of this foam.  At least my feet wouldn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of creams, lotions, etc etc for cracked heels, and nothing works like this stuff.  It&#x27;s not cheap, but each can lasts a long time and believe me, it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this at my nail salon-recommend it HIGHLY.Most food creams moisturize your feet-this goes to work to heal AND moisturize. Make sure to use 2× a day for maximum effect.I have used virtually every product on the market;even used to use petroleum jelly and thick socks to combat the harsh Midwestern winters. :( This is,quite frankly,the very best product out there to keep your feet soft and smooth.Lasts a very,very long time.</li>
            <li> This foam is the secret to beautiful feet!  No more cracked heels or skin!  Cannot recommend this highly enough!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. Make it part of your routine and your heels should be smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Dr recommended did the trick non greasy and very effective now I continue to use for prevention I will buy again love it</li>
            <li> This cracked heel formula by Footlogix really made a difference in the appearance of my cracked dry heels in quite a short amount of time! They are not perfect, but they sure are a whole lot better!</li>
            <li> I have severely dry heels and have tried many lotions, ointments and other treatments - this is the one thing that has shown significant results.  I have only had it a few weeks so I don&#x27;t know if I will need to use to every day forever, but I don&#x27;t think I will care - it&#x27;s that good.  I actually haven&#x27;t used it in a couple days and my heels are STILL not cracked and dry like they were before.  Just an amazing product, I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> InSpa started offering a heel service with their pedicures for an added $10.  This is what they used.  I figured I&#x27;d take the $10 and just buy the stuff.  I agree with the reviews--you have to use it religiously for it to work well.  However, the best benefit is that you can use this and then walk around.  The stuff is weird--like shaving cream only not wet or oily.  You kind of rub it in, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything, so your foot isn&#x27;t greasy either.  Definitely helps with the cracking.</li>
            <li> If you use this on your heels three or four times a week for a couple of weeks, it will make an enormous difference in the feel and appearance of your feet.  It&#x27;s an essential before summer hits, or before a trip to any tropical location.</li>
            <li> I had cracked heels from wearing flipflops all the time and this product healed my feet with just a few applications.  Very easy to apply....not greasy.</li>
            <li> I was told about this product by a manicurist over a year ago and I still love this stuff. it really does work if you use it daily after a shower.</li>
            <li> Works well on feet with corns,blisters etc. Even helps the bunions. Amazon is always my first choice when the doctor recommends something,price was quite good as well.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and works great if used at least once a day.  When you don&#x27;t use it, your heels go right back to being gross.</li>
            <li> This worked for me. You should know that this is a foam. It suggest using an amount the size of a walnut, I would suggest a small walnut. It worked immediately to take the sting out of my cracked heel. I have been using it daily as maintenance and it has helped a good bit. It is very to use and does dry almost immediately which is a big plus. I have had no problem with any residue showing up on any of my designer shoes.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was amazed when I found the price of Footlogix on Amazon.  The price was much cheaper&lt;br /&gt;than where I normally would buy it.  It arrived within 3 days.  Amazing!  I will order it again when&lt;br /&gt;I run out.</li>
            <li> My husband is a diabetic.This product works excellent on cracks.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a podiatrist.  This is my second order of this product, and I could not be happier.  I no longer have to &amp;#34;sandpaper&amp;#34; the rough skin on my feet.  I just apply a golfball size amount on each foot every night and massage in well.  Totally non-sticky.</li>
            <li> Being 49 years old and having &amp;#34;cow hooves&amp;#34; is no fun.  My foot calluses will be so thick that a podiatrist has to shave them to get hem under control.  &amp;#34;This product has been my salvation!  A great pedicure and then using a foot file and this stuff every day make sit so I can wear sandals without shame.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it religiously twice a day so I can&#x27;t say whether it works or not but the foam doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb that quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I am so glad I was able to purchase on line.</li>
            <li> Great delivery! Great price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay nothing special will continue to use it</li>
            <li> This is the BEST!  Clears up my cracked feet quickly.  A must have for me in the winter.</li>
            <li> I love these products as I have purchased them in the past for myself. But this purchase&lt;br /&gt;of the Foot Logix Extra Cracked Heel Formula Mousse 3+ (4.23 oz)&lt;br /&gt;and the Footlogix Foot Care Mousse #3 Cracked Heel Formula 4.2 oz  was&lt;br /&gt;for a friend to try who has problems with her feet because she has diabetes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunely I was sent two of the the Footlogix Foot Care Mousse #3 Cracked Heel&lt;br /&gt;Formula 4.2 oz so she didn&#x27;t get to try the extra cracked heel formula.</li>
            <li> I have rated this product before. I went from painful cracked heels to non cracked in no time at all. Especially in the summer when I walk around with sandals or bare feet. The directions say use twice daily, but I have found once in the morning when pulling my socks on works just fine.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this product for about 1 year. Prior to this, we used several types of scrapers, buffers, scrubs, and razors etc. These efforts would barely hold back the heel cracks, but would not stop them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how this cracked heel formula works, but we rub a small amount on twice a day and it seems to dissolve the thick skin around the cracks. Eventually the cracks go away, and as long as we keep using it twice a day, the cracks don&#x27;t come back. We use it all year long.&lt;br /&gt;We make sure to wash our hands after applying.&lt;br /&gt;One of these cans lasts about 3 months with both of us using it twice a day. It goes a long way. Small price for avoiding those painful and irritating heel cracks. Especially if you wear sandals or go around the house bare footed.</li>
            <li> My Mom has sensitive skin due to debriding of the skin on her foot (ulcer) and a tie amputation.  This skin mousse keeps it hydrated and and is very gentle.</li>
            <li> Great for dry feet, toes and heels. Smooth and dry finish and leaves feet feeling silky like.</li>
            <li> My podiatrist sold me this product after foot surgery years ago. I continue to use Footlogix, as I find it to be an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Best product I have used!</li>
            <li> It works!  Not much more to say than that.  It&#x27;s not greasy, and you can almost feel it starting to work right away.  Very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> My brother-in-law introduced me to this product. My heels were so cracked, it hurt to walk, Footlogix healed them fast and now I use it all sandal season.</li>
            <li> received wrong product,unable to sent back</li>
