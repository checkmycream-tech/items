    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This color is beautiful!!  </li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>It is best applied over moisturized lips because its literally like coloring your lips with a kids marker it has NO moisture to it so apply to moist lips with a bit of chapstick, then put gloss over it if you want.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!  </li>
            <li>It was great</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>also the way it looks once its applied isn&#x27;t very nice</li>
            <li>I was able to get three uses out of it at best.</li>
            <li>Loved the smooch proof</li>
            <li>Love Love Love!!!</li>
            <li>This is really nice.</li>
            <li>What product I did get there was a nice color.</li>
            <li>Nice color though.</li>
            <li>Great product I love the stains for they do not rub off as easily and do not stain teeth .Let</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant on purchasing this color because I am very fair</li>
            <li>This is perfect for when I&#x27;m just going to the gym, shopping and anytime I am not trying to look made up but just look alive.  </li>
            <li>I wanted this to do a natural look and its perfect for that.</li>
            <li>so you have to apply a balm or lip conditioner, plumper, or even chapstick over the top for moisture protection.  </li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I discovered Lipstain by accident, but love it now, and when my friends see me whip it out and put it on, they ask all about it.</li>
            <li>It does not have anything on it that would pump more product onto the tip of the pen, and shaking the pen doesn&#x27;t make more product come out.</li>
            <li>So if you purchase this just be warned that you might love it</li>
            <li>However, I just ordered2 more</li>
            <li>and my husband likes it when I use it because when I kiss him he doesn&#x27;t get it on his lips. : )</li>
            <li>: I love wearing this under lipstick.</li>
            <li>LOVE the color.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day and I LOVE this color.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even show up on my lips at all even after I cut the tip of the marker to get more out of of it.</li>
            <li>The color is lovely</li>
            <li>The color is cute.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>But yeah I love it :)</li>
            <li>This product gave my lips a nice rich berry color</li>
            <li>Easy to apply but very light</li>
            <li>The berry long time is the perfect color for me.  </li>
            <li>This gave my lips a nice, deep berry color that was attractive, but the formula is a bit drying.  </li>
            <li>Good producer, fast shipping, works well for my needs.</li>
            <li>Color wore off very easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice berry natural color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t look nice and it dries up fast!</li>
            <li>It gives my lips a much more smooth and rich appearance.</li>
            <li>What is great about lip stains, the color looks different based on skin tone.</li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned about the intensity of the color (I have fairly light skin)</li>
            <li>So when I saw this item available for purchase from Amazon, in a color I&#x27;d like to try, I went for it.  </li>
            <li>Ok so I have pretty light skin</li>
            <li>Lip Stain might be my new favorite thing and this one looks and feels fabulous!</li>
            <li>and it does dry the lips, but the color is really great.</li>
            <li>a natural look that looks like I just have a nice color to my lips</li>
            <li>I have no idea where they got the idea that it&#x27;s going to stay on for 16hours, but I think I got about 3, which is not bad for me.</li>
            <li>, that is what I love the most and also its lasting!</li>
            <li>so dont expect a lipstick bold look.</li>
            <li>This one is OKAY when it comes to lasting but could be better.</li>
            <li>I liked the photos I found of it on people&#x27;s lips enough to try it out anyways.</li>
            <li>but it might not be worth the price when i dries out one week</li>
            <li>The only thing that I liked about this was the color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok so I read tons of reviews that said it would dry out very quickly etc.</li>
            <li>I will purchase a new one because I love the color so much</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if they even still make it,but it was the only warm color that would have looked good on me.</li>
            <li>it is very much like a marker running out of ink.  </li>
            <li>Does not last more than an hour or so.</li>
            <li>I never got this and when I tried to report it I ended up getting a replacement sent with a note that I&#x27;m supposed to return the first one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably going to get charged for two when I never got the first one.</li>
            <li>The felt tip already on first use isn&#x27;t very damp</li>
            <li>I was looking more for a classic red, and this is a bit darker than I was expecting, but it does say &amp;#34;berry&amp;#34; which I guess is supposed to translate as purple-red.</li>
            <li>With this method, my mouth still has a nice tint even as the lipstick or gloss wear down.</li>
            <li>and my lips are pretty much tan without much color.</li>
            <li>The only thing I like is that the felt tip makes it easy to put on.</li>
            <li>No regrets I got it in about a week after purchase and trust me, totally worth your money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dry and the lip stain doesn&#x27;t flow out evenly or easily.  </li>
            <li>intensity of the lip stain add a little and its super light.</li>
            <li>I think it looks better on someone with tan or a bit darker skin, because it&#x27;s a dark color.</li>
            <li>Kind of a pain to apply, the felt tip is very thin and doesn&#x27;t spread or smear, it&#x27;s just like drawing with a fine tip felt pen.</li>
            <li>I have several colors of this stain; this particular \\&quot;berry\\&quot; is a very deep red-purple which might be too intense for those who are not accustomed to wearing strong lipstick shades.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would have more of a red tint instead of pink, but it definitely is more on the pink side.</li>
            <li>So, good product in itself, lasts a long time on your lips and isn&#x27;t heavy or waxy or greasy - but don&#x27;t buy it at Amazon!</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t look natural.  </li>
            <li>Keeps lipstick from running into old age lines around lips</li>
            <li>If the color had lasted, I might have tried to use this in conjunction with a transparent lip balm, but I was really surprised to find that the color had dissipated within 30 minutes - and that was without eating or drinking</li>
            <li>but I discovered that I can modify how heavily it goes on by using a light swipe followed by pressing my lips together, or get a darker color with layered applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an unusual product in the sense that the way it is distributed is like a felt tip pen, only you have to hold it upright</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will report back in a few weeks about how many uses i got out of it.</li>
            <li>as dry as the long lasting lip colors but not as lovely either, zero shine, best as a base for gloss.</li>
            <li>is my second purchase, the first lasted about 6 months of regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t come off too easily, and even after it came off, it still left a little color.</li>
            <li>and i worry that like other reviews it will dry out easily.</li>
            <li>I use this lip stain in the same way, coloring my lips completely, then appliance a top layer of  gloss or regular lipstick after the stain has dried.</li>
            <li>Bought two, thought the first one was defective and opened the second one (different color) and had the same experience.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t stand the look of your bare  lips, this type of stain is part of a solution to keeping your mouth in color all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took a few applications to get a sufficient color, but still well worth it for all day color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can apply this anytime, even when I first wake up in the  morning, to give my pale lips a natural but enhanced color.  </li>
            <li>so the liquid stays available to the tip more fully; if the tip starts to dry out then it is very difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>I have bought this exact product locally, in Target, for about the same price, but their color selection is usually limited or sold out.  </li>
            <li>I like how pointed the tip is compared to other lip stains I&#x27;ve purchased - it makes it easier to outline your lips which is really how I use the stain.</li>
            <li>And since I live in an area that has extremely dry air</li>
            <li>I ordered a red and will be looking for a more a subtle pink for a day to day natural look.</li>
            <li>It is true that the delivery system sucks.</li>

            <li> It is true that the delivery system sucks.</li>
            <li> Loved the product but only lasted about 2 weeks:(</li>
            <li> suggested by makeup artists, in the past I have used a lip pencil to completely fill in lip color prior to applying my lipstick.</li>
            <li> and I have managed to stretch this out for quite a long time doing this.</li>
            <li> a long while thing.</li>
            <li> Makes my lips a bit dry but totally fixed by a little chap.</li>
            <li> Have used other lip stains and this one last the longest and is not blotty.</li>
            <li> I agree the tip does seem dry</li>
            <li> It was so dry I had to funnel in alcohol to use it.</li>
            <li> practices for application is to completely dry lips.  </li>
            <li> and it does dry out your lips.</li>
            <li> and i know they are dry, though i wanted it to put under lip gloss</li>
            <li> Markers are so DRY they do not place any color on your lips.  </li>
            <li> Arrived almost totally dry.  </li>
            <li> it dry then cover with gloss</li>
            <li> Overall, a little dry and colors</li>
            <li> It was not really a lip stain</li>
            <li> not very deep.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> Cause it&#x27;s somewhat dry after you put it on, and voila!!</li>
            <li> It simply does not stay on longer than a few minutes, even considering I&#x27;ve chosen a dark color.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll probably try some of the other colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly too light, and I have to reapply a few times to keep it on all day, but I also lick my lips like mad so that could be part of</li>
            <li> and I thought this color would be too dark.</li>
            <li> i got this about two weeks ago and not only is the color not nice</li>

            <li> You do have to hold it upside down to get the color out</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love Love Love!!! This color is beautiful!!  No regrets I got it in about a week after purchase and trust me, totally worth your money! I put on a little gloss over it Cause it&#x27;s somewhat dry after you put it on, and voila!! Perfect! Like Like Like!!👌👌👌👍👍👍❤❤❤❤❤</li>
            <li> Loved the smooch proof</li>
            <li> It was not really a lip stain</li>
            <li> I hope they don&#x27;t stop making this.  The berry long time is the perfect color for me.  I can apply this anytime, even when I first wake up in the  morning, to give my pale lips a natural but enhanced color.  Remember, this is just a stain so you have to apply a balm or lip conditioner, plumper, or even chapstick over the top for moisture protection.  If I am going all out on the makeup in the evening I just put gloss or lipstick over it.  The beauty of it is that when my lipstick/gloss wears off I still have some color on my lips from the lip stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a natural look that looks like I just have a nice color to my lips I just apply a colorless lip plumper or balm over it throughout the day and it doesn&#x27;t smear like lipstick and gloss and I don&#x27;t need a mirror to apply a balm.  This is perfect for when I&#x27;m just going to the gym, shopping and anytime I am not trying to look made up but just look alive.  Some manufacturers are making a stain/balm/gloss all-in-one but for me, they smear badly and they don&#x27;t look natural.  The NYC lip stain literally stains my lips so it is staying put wherever I put it.  I agree the tip does seem dry but I store the tube upside down and, with the cap on, I tap it a bit against my hand to make the stain saturate the tip of the brush before applying and I have managed to stretch this out for quite a long time doing this.</li>
            <li> Makes my lips a bit dry but totally fixed by a little chap. I love intensity of the lip stain add a little and its super light. Add a lot and its darker. Came ahead of time.</li>
            <li> Color wore off very easily and quickly. Not recommended</li>
            <li> I discovered Lipstain by accident, but love it now, and when my friends see me whip it out and put it on, they ask all about it. Nothing to melt, that is what I love the most and also its lasting!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come off too easily, and even after it came off, it still left a little color. I was looking more for a classic red, and this is a bit darker than I was expecting, but it does say &amp;#34;berry&amp;#34; which I guess is supposed to translate as purple-red.</li>
            <li> Ok so I read tons of reviews that said it would dry out very quickly etc. I liked the photos I found of it on people&#x27;s lips enough to try it out anyways. Ok so I have pretty light skin and my lips are pretty much tan without much color. I wanted this to do a natural look and its perfect for that. It is best applied over moisturized lips because its literally like coloring your lips with a kids marker it has NO moisture to it so apply to moist lips with a bit of chapstick, then put gloss over it if you want. Easy to apply but very light so dont expect a lipstick bold look. This is a very nice berry natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing..... It is true that the delivery system sucks. The felt tip already on first use isn&#x27;t very damp and i worry that like other reviews it will dry out easily. It does not have anything on it that would pump more product onto the tip of the pen, and shaking the pen doesn&#x27;t make more product come out. So if you purchase this just be warned that you might love it but it might not be worth the price when i dries out one week in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will report back in a few weeks about how many uses i got out of it.</li>
            <li> Keeps lipstick from running into old age lines around lips However, I just ordered2 more and they were dried up. I think this product was discontinued a while ago and now stock isld.</li>
            <li> This gave my lips a nice, deep berry color that was attractive, but the formula is a bit drying.  And since I live in an area that has extremely dry air that unmercifully chaps lips, it wasn&#x27;t something that I could continue using.  I like moist lips.  If the color had lasted, I might have tried to use this in conjunction with a transparent lip balm, but I was really surprised to find that the color had dissipated within 30 minutes - and that was without eating or drinking anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for me, this was a failed experiment.  So disappointing, because I had always heard that lip stains are the solution to temporary lip color.  Back to the drawing board for me.</li>
            <li> does not stay on as I wish it did. The only thing that I liked about this was the color.&lt;br /&gt;everything else was a disappointment</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant on purchasing this color because I am very fair and I thought this color would be too dark. I was so wrong. What is great about lip stains, the color looks different based on skin tone. This product gave my lips a nice rich berry color and my husband likes it when I use it because when I kiss him he doesn&#x27;t get it on his lips. : )</li>
            <li> I am so unsatisfied with this product. i got this about two weeks ago and not only is the color not nice when applied to the lips it also stopped working because the marker dried up. this is a bad quality lip stain DO NOT BUY THIS!! it doesn&#x27;t look nice and it dries up fast! also the way it looks once its applied isn&#x27;t very nice it looks ugly. and then once you apply it you cant even take it off. i hope this review helped all of you!!</li>
            <li> Loved the product but only lasted about 2 weeks:(</li>
            <li> I am allergic to almost everything, but this lip stain doesn&#x27;t bug me at all. It&#x27;s slightly too light, and I have to reapply a few times to keep it on all day, but I also lick my lips like mad so that could be part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I&#x27;m going for a darker colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I love wearing this under lipstick. It gives my lips a much more smooth and rich appearance. Three-layered, with gloss, or four-layered, with chapstick, looks just out of this world- like my lips are made of candy. I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup though, so it&#x27;s a once in a long while thing.</li>
            <li> Lip Stain might be my new favorite thing and this one looks and feels fabulous!</li>
            <li> It was so dry I had to funnel in alcohol to use it.</li>
            <li> The lip stain is essentially a permanent marker for your lips!  No funny taste, no rubbing off.  I was a bit concerned about the intensity of the color (I have fairly light skin) but I discovered that I can modify how heavily it goes on by using a light swipe followed by pressing my lips together, or get a darker color with layered applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best practices for application is to completely dry lips.  Any existing gloss or even saliva, and the stain won&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second purchase, the first lasted about 6 months of regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it runs low it is very much like a marker running out of ink.  It took a few applications to get a sufficient color, but still well worth it for all day color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would wait a few minutes and apply gloss just as I&#x27;m heading out the door - otherwise the stain can lift.  Also if i chew my lips the color does come off quicker.</li>
            <li> LOVE the color. However, it is hard to get it out and it does dry out your lips.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Looks like my lips are naturally red!</li>
            <li> Horrible, I hate the felt tip point I don&#x27;t think it had anything in it it didn&#x27;t even shade my lips darker and it is a waste of money. I like lip stains and i know they are dry, though i wanted it to put under lip gloss but this product did nothing</li>
            <li> Wears off within less than an hour</li>
            <li> As a bright-lipstick addict, I am frustrated by having to check and reapply my color throughout the day. I have tried every \\&quot;long-wearing\\&quot; lipstick on the market, and none are truly indelible. If you can&#x27;t stand the look of your bare  lips, this type of stain is part of a solution to keeping your mouth in color all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As suggested by makeup artists, in the past I have used a lip pencil to completely fill in lip color prior to applying my lipstick. I use this lip stain in the same way, coloring my lips completely, then appliance a top layer of  gloss or regular lipstick after the stain has dried. With this method, my mouth still has a nice tint even as the lipstick or gloss wear down. I also do use this stain by itself around the house when I just need some lip color but not a fully made-up mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that this stain can be somewhat drying when worn alone. Also, I keep it stored in an cap-down position so the liquid stays available to the tip more fully; if the tip starts to dry out then it is very difficult to apply. I have several colors of this stain; this particular \\&quot;berry\\&quot; is a very deep red-purple which might be too intense for those who are not accustomed to wearing strong lipstick shades.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely disappointing product. I should have read the reviews before I purchased. Markers are so DRY they do not place any color on your lips.  Bought two, thought the first one was defective and opened the second one (different color) and had the same experience. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these. Absolutely awful product.</li>
            <li> gud price, gud quality</li>
            <li> This is really nice. It stays on all day and I LOVE this color.</li>
            <li> I had this in the color orange which they don&#x27;t show on here so I&#x27;m not sure if they even still make it,but it was the only warm color that would have looked good on me.It didn&#x27;t even show up on my lips at all even after I cut the tip of the marker to get more out of of it. So I had to throw it away!</li>
            <li> I like how pointed the tip is compared to other lip stains I&#x27;ve purchased - it makes it easier to outline your lips which is really how I use the stain. I like to use the stain as a lip liner because it will last all day. This one is OKAY when it comes to lasting but could be better. For the price though I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Good producer, fast shipping, works well for my needs.</li>
            <li> It was great but it was dried out when it arrived. What product I did get there was a nice color. But it took forever to build up pigmentation because it was dried out. I will purchase a new one because I love the color so much</li>
            <li> Does not last more than an hour or so.</li>
            <li> This is terrible lipstain.  It simply does not stay on longer than a few minutes, even considering I&#x27;ve chosen a dark color.  The only thing I like is that the felt tip makes it easy to put on.</li>
            <li> I never got this and when I tried to report it I ended up getting a replacement sent with a note that I&#x27;m supposed to return the first one.  The one I NEVER got.  Ugh...I have looked and looked for a phone number to contact someone but can&#x27;t find a number or an email address.  The only email is one that you can&#x27;t reply to.  I&#x27;m probably going to get charged for two when I never got the first one.</li>
            <li> I have bought this exact product locally, in Target, for about the same price, but their color selection is usually limited or sold out.  So when I saw this item available for purchase from Amazon, in a color I&#x27;d like to try, I went for it.  Unfortunately, the tube I got must have been lying around a long time, or something.  It&#x27;s dry and the lip stain doesn&#x27;t flow out evenly or easily.  The ones I bought locally didn&#x27;t have that issue for me.  So, good product in itself, lasts a long time on your lips and isn&#x27;t heavy or waxy or greasy - but don&#x27;t buy it at Amazon!</li>
            <li> You do have to hold it upside down to get the color out and it does dry the lips, but the color is really great.</li>
            <li> Arrived almost totally dry.  I was able to get three uses out of it at best.</li>
            <li> It is like watercolor and although it does seem to be smooch proof, it stings a bit. The color is lovely</li>
            <li> Goes on unevenly. Dries lips a lot. The color is cute. Does not combine well with chapstick or any gloss or lipstick. But it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I think it looks better on someone with tan or a bit darker skin, because it&#x27;s a dark color. But yeah I love it :)</li>
            <li> Great product I love the stains for they do not rub off as easily and do not stain teeth .Let it dry then cover with gloss</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would have more of a red tint instead of pink, but it definitely is more on the pink side. I have no idea where they got the idea that it&#x27;s going to stay on for 16hours, but I think I got about 3, which is not bad for me. I&#x27;ll probably try some of the other colors.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it does not stick on at all or soak in! Might as well use a sharpie, it would work just as well!</li>
            <li> Have used other lip stains and this one last the longest and is not blotty. Expect to use a gloss over it if you want a shiny look at this one is matte. I ordered a red and will be looking for a more a subtle pink for a day to day natural look. The application makes it through cocktails without the tell -tale glass residue.</li>
            <li> Stain comes out of the holder which makes using it rather difficult. It pulls out when pulling the cap off. Nice color though.</li>
            <li> Kind of a pain to apply, the felt tip is very thin and doesn&#x27;t spread or smear, it&#x27;s just like drawing with a fine tip felt pen. If your in a hurry, forget it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the 16 hour wear? Not even close. maybe an hour or two unless you don&#x27;t move your lips.Overall, a little dry and colors not very deep.&lt;br /&gt;Not as dry as the long lasting lip colors but not as lovely either, zero shine, best as a base for gloss.</li>
            <li> This is an unusual product in the sense that the way it is distributed is like a felt tip pen, only you have to hold it upright so it doesn&#x27;t apply as evenly as I would like it to</li>
