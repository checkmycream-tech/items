            <li>PURCHASED FOR MY GREAT AUNT.  </li>
            <li>So glad to finally be able to get this again!!!!!</li>
            <li>have tried many things and this has done the best.</li>
            <li>Good Stuff, works much better than anything else I have tried and best part is that it don&#x27;t make me gag.</li>
            <li>but I really enjoy the powder best.  </li>
            <li>Have been shopping around for a good replacement since they discontinued Rigident.  </li>
            <li>Good thing I was alone.  </li>
            <li>It works just as good as rigident at just a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have zinc in it which is supposed to be the good quality.  </li>
            <li>THAT 8 HOURS GOOD LUCK</li>
            <li>The best denture adhesive available.</li>
            <li>Life is good.</li>
            <li>This is the best ( &amp;, only), thing that works for me -BEST</li>
            <li>VERY PLEASED WITH PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>Happy to be able to order on line.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to purchase this item again!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This is great stuff as it takes just a breath to hold denture secure even when eating nuts!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have it available to prevent sore gums.</li>
            <li>Getting dentures to stay fixed in mouth is not the greatest fun I have, but this is the best product I&#x27;ve found for the job.</li>
            <li>I picked this product because the one I truely liked has gone off market.  </li>
            <li>Both were effective, but I didn&#x27;t like the oozing, so I tried this powder.</li>
            <li>Super Poligrip powder works great for me...</li>
            <li>Always happy to use Super Poli Grip.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to be able to plan where more is needed to help keep these babies in place.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t have the dentures permanently relined until three months pass to make sure I&#x27;m completely healed (I have a wonderful dentist who has told me that living with dentures is a process that one learns over time and has been patiently working with me).</li>
            <li>not as good as super Wernets, but it is ok.  </li>
            <li>And if more people would try it, it would make the \\&quot;other\\&quot; adhesive obsolete.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this item, wish I could still find it in stores.</li>
            <li>I have used just about every product on the market and have found that the PoliGrip Powder is the best at holding my dentures for an entire day!</li>
            <li>He says that the poligrip cream is better than this, he prefer the quality and the adhhesive of the cream.</li>
            <li>That makes it more desirable to me.</li>
            <li>I like this denture powder because it holds better than the fixodent creams.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended to him by the doctor who made his dentures, and he&#x27;s been well satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>Love their service.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Just to take a minute to say that I love being able to deal through Amazon and Online Pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Dentures stay in place easier, better and longer</li>
            <li>I was so glad I am still able to buy it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Better hold on huppers than lowers.</li>
            <li>Ordered the Poli-grip at a great price, easy transaction, fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Was waiting until it was available and glad to be able to purchase in quantity.  </li>
            <li>The best I have found for me is Secure Denture Bonding Cream for both upper and lower dentures.</li>
            <li>I was concerned about the reviews stating that one could not find this powder easily in the drug stores, so I bought a package of six bottles.</li>
            <li>I use it on my bottom dentures and with eating and drinking it stays strong.</li>
            <li>this powder works just fine for me...</li>
            <li>This is a more than adequate substitute.</li>
            <li>A great product, I can only find it at CVS Drugs and its not close to us.</li>
            <li>Both are easy to apply and clean.</li>
            <li>Holds dentures securely all day.</li>
            <li>After reading many positive reviews, I bought this PoliGrip Super Adhesive Powder, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>but anything to get excited about.</li>
            <li>Works great on my bottom partial denture.  </li>
            <li>Full 5 star rating for this seller.</li>
            <li>Super Wernets tooth powde&amp;#34;r before they went out of business.</li>
            <li>Got for my husband, it arrived quickly, was packaged well</li>
            <li>I have experimented with Fixodent cream, and Super Poligrip cream.</li>
            <li>beautiful new teeth are gonna be left in the burger</li>
            <li>Easy to use - I put the powder down &amp; add a few drops of warm water, layer some more powder, add some more warm water.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied, will do it again the next time I need this product.</li>
            <li>I am a new denture wearer and was looking for a product that would work better than the &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li>Always the best &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; powder, however I purchased this under duress as it was over priced due to an FDA recall because of Zinc used in product and a large lawsuit againat the producer due to some kind of &amp;#34;so called&amp;#34; reaction by one user.</li>
            <li>Better adhesion and less goopy than the gel, makes it more comfortable.</li>
            <li>The holding power of these is very lacking when compared to the original.</li>
            <li>I have &amp;#34;immediate&amp;#34; dentures right now</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and is much easier to clean off your dentures at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I found this product very much to my liking because it keeps my dentures in place and they don&#x27;t move around.</li>
            <li>my dentures are not ill fittings</li>
            <li>Funny thing about it</li>
            <li>but I was glad no one walked it when I was playing with white powder!</li>
            <li>There is a brush for removing it, but he&#x27;s pretty set in his ways and won&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>that I need to keep eating healthy and go back to my trusty cream...</li>
            <li>thanks for having it!  </li>
            <li>Hallelujah!, my favorite is back!</li>
            <li>so we can learn to live together!!</li>
            <li>SOO MUCH CHEAPER TO BUY THIS WAY THAN THE STORES!&lt;br /&gt;AND</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to struggle as much to remove the goop from your mouth and gums.  </li>
            <li>Nothing much  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>EXCEPT THANKS</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Your really taking advantage of the fact</li>
            <li>PoliGrip - don&#x27;t really like paying $500.00 for 6 of these when they normally go for around $28.00 for 6.</li>
            <li>but at the same time when you finally break that seal, it takes most of the goop with it</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m healing, I needed the dentures to hold steady so I could learn to eat with them.</li>
            <li>For the lowers, it&#x27;s only good as long as I don&#x27;t eat or drink anything, and even then only for about 4 - 5 hours.  </li>
            <li>The temporaries have become quite loose, but this product has held my dentures securely in place all day.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommended the powder it works so well.</li>
            <li>Kind of like \\&quot;the other white Meat\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I went to the restroom to add a little more powder.  </li>
            <li>There has been many other brands tried, and this is the only one that works consistently.  </li>
            <li>and I was so surprised!!</li>
            <li>It could have been the price that i normally pay for it .</li>
            <li>This seller was cerianly proferteering by the price charged by adding an upcharge of $20 over the normal price.</li>
            <li>so this gives me a little more of a secure fit for eating ribs and steaks and corn on the cob... not for real loose dentures but good for that extra hold you may need for those pork chops and fried chicken...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new lower denture wearer.</li>
            <li>But the powder has worked far better than another other product on the upper.</li>
            <li>It is easier to use, less goopy, cleans-up easier, and just as secure.</li>
            <li>I saved the powder for last because I was positive it wouldn&#x27;t work - nothing else had.</li>
            <li>It does take a few minutes for it to set after putting the dentures in, maybe 10-15 minutes, but he eats pretty much anything he wants with them.  </li>
            <li>No messy salve.  </li>
            <li>He keeps some at work in case his teeth loosen; reapplication is much easier after a simple rinse.</li>
            <li>and the shipping was fast got it a day earlier...</li>
            <li>Far easier to remove this adhesive at night before bed than the tube form.</li>
            <li>Poligrip powder is a no mess, no stress denture adhesive.  </li>
            <li>Works okay on my upper denture, but I usually have to redo it about 3:00 in the afternoon.  </li>
            <li>Last time I paid $25.00 for one that normally costs $4.65.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, easy to remove and not as sloppy feeling as the product I had been using previously.  </li>
            <li>and I have no other choice.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH EASIER DON&#x27;T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LOOSE TEETH</li>
            <li>, I was at WalMart last night and felt the top denture was a little loose.  </li>
            <li>My situation is very different from others whereas I am still in a soft liner after 5 months.  </li>
            <li>I have poor fitting dentures, yet this powder holds them in place for up to eight hours.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but this brand (Poli Grip) of powder works for me very well compared to the other brands of powdered denture adhesives.</li>
            <li>I find it is much easier to use it when I use a spray bottle to wet the powder with a bit of water before inserting the dentures especially the lower.</li>

            <li> Always the best &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; powder, however I purchased this under duress as it was over priced due to an FDA recall because of Zinc used in product and a large lawsuit againat the producer due to some kind of &amp;#34;so called&amp;#34; reaction by one user.</li>
            <li> Better adhesion and less goopy than the gel, makes it more comfortable.</li>
            <li> The holding power of these is very lacking when compared to the original.</li>
            <li> I have &amp;#34;immediate&amp;#34; dentures right now</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and is much easier to clean off your dentures at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I found this product very much to my liking because it keeps my dentures in place and they don&#x27;t move around.</li>
            <li> my dentures are not ill fittings</li>
            <li> Funny thing about it</li>
            <li> but I was glad no one walked it when I was playing with white powder!</li>
            <li> There is a brush for removing it, but he&#x27;s pretty set in his ways and won&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> that I need to keep eating healthy and go back to my trusty cream...</li>
            <li> thanks for having it!  </li>
            <li> Hallelujah!, my favorite is back!</li>
            <li> so we can learn to live together!!</li>
            <li> SOO MUCH CHEAPER TO BUY THIS WAY THAN THE STORES!&lt;br /&gt;AND</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to struggle as much to remove the goop from your mouth and gums.  </li>
            <li> Nothing much  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> EXCEPT THANKS</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Your really taking advantage of the fact</li>
            <li> PoliGrip - don&#x27;t really like paying $500.00 for 6 of these when they normally go for around $28.00 for 6.</li>
            <li> but at the same time when you finally break that seal, it takes most of the goop with it</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m healing, I needed the dentures to hold steady so I could learn to eat with them.</li>
            <li> For the lowers, it&#x27;s only good as long as I don&#x27;t eat or drink anything, and even then only for about 4 - 5 hours.  </li>
            <li> The temporaries have become quite loose, but this product has held my dentures securely in place all day.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommended the powder it works so well.</li>
            <li> Kind of like \\&quot;the other white Meat\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I went to the restroom to add a little more powder.  </li>
            <li> There has been many other brands tried, and this is the only one that works consistently.  </li>
            <li> and I was so surprised!!</li>
            <li> It could have been the price that i normally pay for it .</li>
            <li> This seller was cerianly proferteering by the price charged by adding an upcharge of $20 over the normal price.</li>
            <li> so this gives me a little more of a secure fit for eating ribs and steaks and corn on the cob... not for real loose dentures but good for that extra hold you may need for those pork chops and fried chicken...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new lower denture wearer.</li>
            <li> But the powder has worked far better than another other product on the upper.</li>
            <li> It is easier to use, less goopy, cleans-up easier, and just as secure.</li>
            <li> I saved the powder for last because I was positive it wouldn&#x27;t work - nothing else had.</li>
            <li> It does take a few minutes for it to set after putting the dentures in, maybe 10-15 minutes, but he eats pretty much anything he wants with them.  </li>
            <li> No messy salve.  </li>
            <li> He keeps some at work in case his teeth loosen; reapplication is much easier after a simple rinse.</li>
            <li> and the shipping was fast got it a day earlier...</li>
            <li> Far easier to remove this adhesive at night before bed than the tube form.</li>
            <li> Poligrip powder is a no mess, no stress denture adhesive.  </li>
            <li> Works okay on my upper denture, but I usually have to redo it about 3:00 in the afternoon.  </li>
            <li> Last time I paid $25.00 for one that normally costs $4.65.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, easy to remove and not as sloppy feeling as the product I had been using previously.  </li>
            <li> and I have no other choice.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH EASIER DON&#x27;T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LOOSE TEETH</li>
            <li> , I was at WalMart last night and felt the top denture was a little loose.  </li>
            <li> My situation is very different from others whereas I am still in a soft liner after 5 months.  </li>
            <li> I have poor fitting dentures, yet this powder holds them in place for up to eight hours.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this brand (Poli Grip) of powder works for me very well compared to the other brands of powdered denture adhesives.</li>
            <li> I find it is much easier to use it when I use a spray bottle to wet the powder with a bit of water before inserting the dentures especially the lower.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the powder; tasteless and fairly easy to remove when needed.</li>
            <li> Amazon was selling single bottles for as much as $75 just a few months ago.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s got a rock-solid hold on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is dead simple to apply - if you have ever baked a cake, you know the process of coating the pan with flour - same concept.</li>
            <li> I am a very recent denture wearer, so my experience with adhesives is limited.</li>
            <li> This product does a very good job as an&lt;br /&gt;adhesive and does not have the horrible taste some denture dhesives have.  </li>
            <li> The holding power holds all day long.</li>
            <li> It is too bad that more drugstores do not carry it.  </li>
            <li> Once the powder is sprinkled on your dentures, just wet your mouth and your dentures will stay in place all day.   </li>
            <li> Unlike the other types of pink adhesives that come in a tube, this has absolutely NO TASTE to it.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be the only thing that holds my dentures down firmly</li>
            <li> Zinc content is  lower than other products.  </li>
            <li> PoliGrip Powder beats all the other denture adhesives hands down .</li>
            <li> Holds my dentures all day even when eating Italian Buns which are notably hard to bite into and chew.  </li>
            <li> I sprinkle a little on my wet dentures, give them a little squirt of water from a spray bottle, and stick them in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have a little pill bottle that goes on my keychain just in case.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t messy and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The drawback to it is that it takes a few minutes to set as opposed to the goopy stuff.  </li>
            <li> It does prevent dentures that are a bit loose from irritating my gums.  </li>
            <li> It has been difficult, at times, to find this product on local grocery/drugstore shelves.</li>
            <li> Today I decided to try this powder instead of the usual cream.</li>
            <li> The dentures are seated firmly and not &#x27;rocketing&#x27; around my mouth - I even chewed a cracker today!!</li>
            <li> Price $149.99 &amp; FREE Shipping is a sick, sick joke.</li>
            <li> Zinc is not good I have read.  </li>
            <li> The dentures can be a bit tough to get out</li>
            <li> but when it&#x27;s time to remove it can be difficult and leaves behind a sticky residue on my gums.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s in scarce supply at the moment</li>
            <li> I was afraid I would have to use inferior product henceforth, but</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> The powder doesnt have a bad taste nor does it ooze onto my tongue.   </li>
            <li> and they make others sick.</li>
            <li> and i hate that stuff you squeeze in the tube</li>
            <li> It works and is not gooey or nasty sticky when you have to remove dentures at night.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s disgusting at how some people try and rip others off when a product is removed from the market.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m paying outrageous prices for a bottle of two.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried several different types (paste etc) but I really enjoy the powder best.  It works and is not gooey or nasty sticky when you have to remove dentures at night.  I highly recommend the powder; tasteless and fairly easy to remove when needed.</li>
            <li> Used to use &amp;#34;Super Wernets&amp;#34; til they stopped making it a couple of years ago.  This is a more than adequate substitute.</li>
            <li> Poligrip powder is a no mess, no stress denture adhesive.  No messy salve.  Just sprinkle and go.  The big problem is that you cannot find this product everywhere...thus I ordered it online.  It is too bad that more drugstores do not carry it.  And if more people would try it, it would make the \\&quot;other\\&quot; adhesive obsolete.  Kind of like \\&quot;the other white Meat\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love this product. It isn&#x27;t messy and lasts all day. It doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> The powder comes off the dentures and my gums much easier than the messy cream adhesives. I find it is much easier to use it when I use a spray bottle to wet the powder with a bit of water before inserting the dentures especially the lower.</li>
            <li> A great product, I can only find it at CVS Drugs and its not close to us. I found it  at Amazon and a bit cheaper too.</li>
            <li> Ordered the Poli-grip at a great price, easy transaction, fast shipment. Full 5 star rating for this seller. Very satisfied, will do it again the next time I need this product.</li>
            <li> Was very happy with this adhesive.  Have been shopping around for a good replacement since they discontinued Rigident.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> SOO MUCH CHEAPER TO BUY THIS WAY THAN THE STORES!&lt;br /&gt;AND SO MUCH EASIER DON&#x27;T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LOOSE TEETH</li>
            <li> Thank you for having this item...</li>
            <li> I love this item, wish I could still find it in stores. So happy with it that I am giving one to a friend for Christmas.</li>
            <li> It has been difficult, at times, to find this product on local grocery/drugstore shelves. The perfect solution? Go to Amazon. This is the best for its purpose I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This is the best ( &amp;, only), thing that works for me -BEST hold, LONGEST lasting, &amp; NO oOozy-goop!</li>
            <li> VERY PLEASED WITH PRODUCT.  GOOD PRICE!</li>
            <li> About 8 months ago, I bought this for my husband &amp; now he is sold on it. It is easier to use, less goopy, cleans-up easier, and just as secure. He keeps some at work in case his teeth loosen; reapplication is much easier after a simple rinse. At home too, sink drain does not get as clogged from all the removed adhesive.</li>
            <li> PoliGrip adhesive powder is the best product I&#x27;ve used.  Unlike the other types of pink adhesives that come in a tube, this has absolutely NO TASTE to it.  It lasts all day and is much easier to clean off your dentures at the end of the day.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used just about every product on the market and have found that the PoliGrip Powder is the best at holding my dentures for an entire day! It can&#x27;t always be found in stores so I turned to Amazon and got within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Super Poligrip powder works great for me...it has no zinc in the formula and will hold my denture in place all day...I recommend this product...</li>
            <li> Always happy to use Super Poli Grip.  Was waiting until it was available and glad to be able to purchase in quantity.  Will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> So glad to finally be able to get this again!!!!!</li>
            <li> not as good as super Wernets, but it is ok.  it serves the purpose and I have no other choice.</li>
            <li> He says that the poligrip cream is better than this, he prefer the quality and the adhhesive of the cream.</li>
            <li> Please see my review for the Fixiadent powder.  Same results according to my source.  Both are easy to apply and clean.</li>
            <li> Zinc content is  lower than other products.  That makes it more desirable to me.</li>
            <li> No complaints. Excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> i have dentures and i hate that stuff you squeeze in the tube it makes me gag... this powder works just fine for me... my dentures are not ill fittings so this gives me a little more of a secure fit for eating ribs and steaks and corn on the cob... not for real loose dentures but good for that extra hold you may need for those pork chops and fried chicken... i like it and i don&#x27;t gag... and the shipping was fast got it a day earlier...</li>
            <li> Looks like I bought just in time - the price doubled the next day; I was going to add another case!</li>
            <li> It is the best product that I have found since the product Ridgident has gone off the market.</li>
            <li> I like this denture powder because it holds better than the fixodent creams.  The powder doesnt have a bad taste nor does it ooze onto my tongue.   Once the powder is sprinkled on your dentures, just wet your mouth and your dentures will stay in place all day.   I would recommend Poligrip denture powder to everyone.</li>
            <li> My situation is very different from others whereas I am still in a soft liner after 5 months.  But the powder has worked far better than another other product on the upper.</li>
            <li> I love it.  The drawback to it is that it takes a few minutes to set as opposed to the goopy stuff.  I have &amp;#34;immediate&amp;#34; dentures right now and it&#x27;s nice to be able to plan where more is needed to help keep these babies in place.  I reccomenned that you give it a try.  I&#x27;ve shared with others and they are as impressed as I am!  The dentures can be a bit tough to get out but at the same time when you finally break that seal, it takes most of the goop with it so you don&#x27;t have to struggle as much to remove the goop from your mouth and gums.  BIG advantage to this!  I have a little pill bottle that goes on my keychain just in case.  Funny thing about it, I was at WalMart last night and felt the top denture was a little loose.  I went to the restroom to add a little more powder.  Good thing I was alone.  I didn&#x27;t care who saw the dentues (like I&#x27;ll ever see them again?) but I was glad no one walked it when I was playing with white powder!</li>
            <li> Can no longer purchase this product in our local stores.  It is the only fixodent that works for my father.  Happy to be able to order on line.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this denture adhesive for several years now.  It was recommended to him by the doctor who made his dentures, and he&#x27;s been well satisfied with it.  He has never had any problem with his dentures turning lose.  It does take a few minutes for it to set after putting the dentures in, maybe 10-15 minutes, but he eats pretty much anything he wants with them.  The only thing he doesn&#x27;t like is the residue in his mouth after he takes them out, but I would imagine that comes along with all denture adhesives.  There is a brush for removing it, but he&#x27;s pretty set in his ways and won&#x27;t use it.  That&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;ve downgraded it to 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> It works just as good as rigident at just a fraction of the cost. I will be sure to purchase this item again!</li>
            <li> Great product recommended by my dentist.  I couldn&#x27;t hold my dentures in without it. I sprinkle a little on my wet dentures, give them a little squirt of water from a spray bottle, and stick them in my mouth.  I have never had them loosen before the days end.  One bottle of it last about a month if used correctly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my spouse.  He says it&#x27;s the best dental adhesive and believe me he&#x27;s tried them all.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s disgusting at how some people try and rip others off when a product is removed from the market. People like that are nothing but  greedy and they make others sick.I hope they get stuck with all that they have.</li>
            <li> I used to use the &amp;#34;real Super Wernets tooth powde&amp;#34;r before they went out of business. Reviews of this product claims it to be the same. The holding power of these is very lacking when compared to the original.</li>
            <li> Price $149.99 &amp; FREE Shipping is a sick, sick joke. An obvious attack on old people who cannot be expected to pay this price in order to eat.</li>
            <li> This appears to be the best product on the market for keeping your choppers in place.  There has been many other brands tried, and this is the only one that works consistently.  We purchased the 6 pack, and through Amazon got the best pricing and delivery.  Five stars for Amazon also...</li>
            <li> i HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND HOPE THAT THEY WILL PUT IT BACK ON The  MARKET.i didn&#x27;t likehaving to pay the price that i did in order to get some. It could have been the price that i normally pay for it . I  don&#x27;t know what the problem is that they took it off the market but hope they can fix it</li>
            <li> This is great stuff as it takes just a breath to hold denture secure even when eating nuts!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many things and this has done the best.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff, works much better than anything else I have tried and best part is that it don&#x27;t make me gag.</li>
            <li> Holds my dentures all day even when eating Italian Buns which are notably hard to bite into and chew.  Would never get anything else and it doesn&#x27;t have zinc in it which is supposed to be the good quality.  Zinc is not good I have read.  I purchased six packs of this through Amazon which is my online go to.  Love their service.</li>
            <li> THE GLUE DOESN&#x27;T HOLD ALL DAY YOU WILL NEED TO TAKE SOME WITH YOU IF YOU PLANS ON BEING OUT LONGER THAT 8 HOURS GOOD LUCK</li>
            <li> Easy to use - I put the powder down &amp; add a few drops of warm water, layer some more powder, add some more warm water.  Perfect and sometimes lasts for two days!  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> PoliGrip Powder beats all the other denture adhesives hands down . The holding power holds all day long. There is no oozing. I use it on my bottom dentures and with eating and drinking it stays strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best in our opinion. Nothing much  you can  say about  it.  It&#x27;s  necessity at our house but anything to get excited about.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Works very well.</li>
            <li> Got for my husband, it arrived quickly, was packaged well and the product is as described. Hopefully my husband uses it</li>
            <li> This is waayyyy better than any &#x27;paste&#x27; on the market and not gooey!!!  I bought it in bulk!  :)  I even carry one in my purse....</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. You can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore. It&#x27;s the only denture adhesive I can use.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for a grandparent.</li>
            <li> I picked this product because the one I truely liked has gone off market.  This product does a very good job as an&lt;br /&gt;adhesive and does not have the horrible taste some denture dhesives have.  Yes I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Always the best &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; powder, however I purchased this under duress as it was over priced due to an FDA recall because of Zinc used in product and a large lawsuit againat the producer due to some kind of &amp;#34;so called&amp;#34; reaction by one user. This seller was cerianly proferteering by the price charged by adding an upcharge of $20 over the normal price.</li>
            <li> I have poor fitting dentures, yet this powder holds them in place for up to eight hours. Unfortunately it&#x27;s in scarce supply at the moment and I&#x27;m paying outrageous prices for a bottle of two.</li>
            <li> Today I decided to try this powder instead of the usual cream. Followed the instructions to the letter.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of hrs. later decided to break the promise I made myself to eat healthier, and after more&lt;br /&gt;than a year bought the Mcdonalds double cheezburger and fries. After the second bite wnen I realized&lt;br /&gt;my beautiful new teeth are gonna be left in the burger the moment I take that bite, I decided it was a&lt;br /&gt;sign that I need to keep eating healthy and go back to my trusty cream...</li>
            <li> Just to take a minute to say that I love being able to deal through Amazon and Online Pharmacy. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works okay on my upper denture, but I usually have to redo it about 3:00 in the afternoon.  Not always convenient.  For the lowers, it&#x27;s only good as long as I don&#x27;t eat or drink anything, and even then only for about 4 - 5 hours.  The best I have found for me is Secure Denture Bonding Cream for both upper and lower dentures.</li>
            <li> I found this product very much to my liking because it keeps my dentures in place and they don&#x27;t move around. I have tried the cream and it doesn&#x27;t work well at all. I highly recommended the powder it works so well. I haven&#x27;t found anything about the product I don&#x27;t like.I haven&#x27;t used this product before until I ordered it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Holds the denture but when it&#x27;s time to remove it can be difficult and leaves behind a sticky residue on my gums.  It does prevent dentures that are a bit loose from irritating my gums.  I&#x27;m happy to have it available to prevent sore gums.</li>
            <li> Getting dentures to stay fixed in mouth is not the greatest fun I have, but this is the best product I&#x27;ve found for the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the holding power of the adhesive powder . Works great on my bottom partial denture.  Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use Poli Grip Powder daily (bummer). I don&#x27;t know why, but this brand (Poli Grip) of powder works for me very well compared to the other brands of powdered denture adhesives.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my step-father he won&#x27;t use anything else once he started using this.  i don&#x27;t know where he found it, because i have called all over the place looking for it and can&#x27;t find it. thanks for having it!  he says that everyone should try it, it is the greatest product for dentures and he wishes he had found it years ago!</li>
            <li> Bert I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am a very recent denture wearer, so my experience with adhesives is limited. I have experimented with Fixodent cream, and Super Poligrip cream. Both were effective, but I didn&#x27;t like the oozing, so I tried this powder. So far, it&#x27;s got a rock-solid hold on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is dead simple to apply - if you have ever baked a cake, you know the process of coating the pan with flour - same concept.</li>
            <li> An excellent and needed product...I am amazed at the increase in price, however...I have yet to understand it...</li>
            <li> Better adhesion and less goopy than the gel, makes it more comfortable. Dentures stay in place easier, better and longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new lower denture wearer. Can&#x27;t have the dentures permanently relined until three months pass to make sure I&#x27;m completely healed (I have a wonderful dentist who has told me that living with dentures is a process that one learns over time and has been patiently working with me). The unlined dentures were flying all over my mouth and I couldn&#x27;t learn to chew and eat. Now that I&#x27;m healing, I needed the dentures to hold steady so I could learn to eat with them. I tried pastes, the thermal plastic, everything! I saved the powder for last because I was positive it wouldn&#x27;t work - nothing else had. Well, I used the powder and I was so surprised!! The dentures are seated firmly and not &#x27;rocketing&#x27; around my mouth - I even chewed a cracker today!! I was concerned about the reviews stating that one could not find this powder easily in the drug stores, so I bought a package of six bottles. I love this stuff! It seems to be the only thing that holds my dentures down firmly so we can learn to live together!!</li>
            <li> PURCHASED FOR MY GREAT AUNT.  NO COMMENT FROM HER, EXCEPT THANKS</li>
            <li> Works the best of all.</li>
            <li> Item shipped and arrived as described. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time.  It is the best I do not have to re apply or carry it with me. I was so glad I am still able to buy it from Amazon.  Thanks</li>
            <li> The best denture adhesive available. This product has been off the market for a while- Amazon was selling single bottles for as much as $75 just a few months ago. I was afraid I would have to use inferior product henceforth, but Hallelujah!, my favorite is back! Life is good.</li>
            <li> Far easier to remove this adhesive at night before bed than the tube form. Holds dentures securely all day. Better hold on huppers than lowers.</li>
            <li> I am a new denture wearer and was looking for a product that would work better than the &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; products.  After reading many positive reviews, I bought this PoliGrip Super Adhesive Powder, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It is easy to apply, easy to remove and not as sloppy feeling as the product I had been using previously.  I am currently wearing a temporary upper and lower denture, but will soon be transitioning to a permanent set.  The temporaries have become quite loose, but this product has held my dentures securely in place all day.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> PoliGrip - don&#x27;t really like paying $500.00 for 6 of these when they normally go for around $28.00 for 6. Last time I paid $25.00 for one that normally costs $4.65.  Your really taking advantage of the fact the there are production problems at GlaxoSmithKline!!!</li>
