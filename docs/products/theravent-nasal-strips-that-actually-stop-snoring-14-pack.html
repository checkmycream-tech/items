            <li>Great ,product,service and price !</li>
            <li>Snoring GREATLY reduced!  </li>
            <li>Great news!  </li>
            <li>Theravent is the best!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li>&quot; is maybe the best way to put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; is maybe the best way to put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
            <li>I woke up to a very happy wife.  </li>
            <li>this is a great solution for noisy sleepers.</li>
            <li>Lol.. what a joke...</li>
            <li>These vents work great for my son.</li>
            <li>It had greatly reduced the snoring until then, but also greatly reduced the breathing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great concept, but it&#x27;s incomplete.</li>
            <li>Still happy with it.</li>
            <li>Happy wife happy life.  </li>
            <li>The pap is excellent and I feel so much better.</li>
            <li>I promise it will get better is probably the best way to sum up this product.</li>
            <li>and sometimes you don&#x27;t get a good adhesion.</li>
            <li>The one piece design is not as good as having 2 separate pieces, one for each nostril.  </li>
            <li>But customer service was good.</li>
            <li>guess I&#x27;ll keep researching but for now this seems to be a good interim</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been good for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a good nights sleep</li>
            <li>The idea is good, but the execution is poor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad we were able to find a solution that makes us both happy!</li>
            <li>Day 3 was magic!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not preventing the snoring, it kind of changes it.  </li>
            <li>You have to make sure you get a good seal all the way around your nostrils.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice alternative, but i just didn&#x27;t have any luck with it.</li>
            <li>I guess looking at what was our main concern they work flawless.</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of options to help with my snoring and this has been the best so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every kind of so called solution, and I wasn&#x27;t able to find anything that worked.</li>
            <li>concept makes sense, which is why I tried it, but the intake needs to be improved, and exhaling might be more effective with a mouthpiece (or something)</li>
            <li>concept makes sense, which is why I tried it, but the intake needs to be improved, and exhaling might be more effective with a mouthpiece (or something)</li>
            <li>The warm water lets it slip off easily.</li>
            <li>, she is...), but she claims that I&#x27;m breathing a lot better, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like many products would like you to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I tried so many snoring items until this one put an end to searching for anymore.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I feel like it could have been helpful, but there has to be some better glue or a better design.</li>
            <li>It helps him sleep better at night</li>
            <li>and he feels more rested.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there is anything better than this product.</li>
            <li>Just make sure the product is put on as describe and you should have no worries.</li>
            <li>whatever you want to call it, kept me awake most of the night if I didn&#x27;t take something to help me.  </li>
            <li>The cost of the product is negligible and cheaper than my medication was, and I&#x27;m sure this is way better for me.  </li>
            <li>My husband says that he is able to sleep now and we both get rest.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even tell I am wearing any more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wake myself up gasping for breath any more and my wife tells me I don&#x27;t even snore (</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worth every penny and probably more.</li>
            <li>But then it goes ways, mostly for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Last night, the seal was nearly perfect and almost no air was able to escape during exhale.  </li>
            <li>This does NOT explain the difficulty inhaling I described however, because as soon as I pull the Theravent off, I&#x27;m able to breathe much more</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second problem may affect some more than others.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t doubt some experiences may be better than mine, but reader beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will adjust this review, and the stars, if things</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;ve felt better</li>
            <li>I just purchased the MAX version today to see if it works better</li>
            <li>but hey, another health benefit - more water consumption?</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase them because I do have a much better night&#x27;s sleep while wearing them.  </li>
            <li>All in all this has been a fantastic purchase!</li>
            <li>and I was able to fall asleep all night.</li>
            <li>My supplier ran out of Provent and it was going to be a month or so before they had more</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m impressed, and definitely recommend trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Ordering again.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I will keep using them until they are gone and see if it gets better.</li>
            <li>i have tried this after using the Pro-vent snore therapy, and that worked much better for me.  </li>
            <li>These &amp;#34;micro valves&amp;#34; can also vibrate like a reed in a woodwind instrument when you inhale, creating some interesting whistles and squeaks.  </li>
            <li>; first, if you have a mustache, good luck.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t end my snoring altogether, but it does make it significantly quieter (read that as &amp;#34;bearable&amp;#34; for my wife), and I am sleeping better for sure.  </li>
            <li>Theravent does create a good seal around the nostrils, but makes so much noise</li>
            <li>They were easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to realize I just need to follow the directions and breathe easy through my mouth until I fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>Strong smell.</li>
            <li>100%but helps for sure, makes u look funny, and takes time to get used to but is worth to try for sure!</li>
            <li>and I can sleep soundly.</li>
            <li>He sleeps sound too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I really do question some of these 5-star reviews as sounding kind of phony.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I really do question some of these 5-star reviews as sounding kind of phony.</li>
            <li>Men with mustaches may have additional difficulty getting this product to fit or seal correctly.</li>
            <li>Depending on how it&#x27;s positioned through the night, when you exhale through it you can get a wooshing sound, weazing, or whistling sound.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>seems to be the way to her rich</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does seem to reduce snoring significantly, and this is verified by an overnight recording I make using an iPhone app for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does seem to reduce snoring significantly, and this is verified by an overnight recording I make using an iPhone app for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>I was getting excited until I read the box</li>
            <li>bottom line is that these things do work, and they have made a significant difference in how both of us sleep at night.  </li>
            <li>I purchased Theravent after a recent fit of research looking for a solution to my apnea, which was becoming a greater and greater</li>
            <li>I tried theravent because it said it was simple and it was more effective than the nasal strips, which didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and is a lot cheaper and more comfortable to wear than Provent.</li>
            <li>it is a very good alternative to travelling with your cpap machine, but i wouldn&#x27;t want to use it everyday</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products to help alleviate snoring and am ready to give up.</li>
            <li>will give it a full two weeks</li>
            <li>To be fair, if you don&#x27;t tear it off in the middle of the night, I can understand how this would work</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yesterday I was about to say that I&#x27;d finally had a good night.  </li>
            <li>and then it got a lil&#x27; better with not snoring as much.</li>
            <li>Went through three of these things (at a dollar a piece) trying to get a seal to form, and the adhesive just wasn&#x27;t strong enough to be effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use and not uncomfortable to wear but just did not work.</li>
            <li>Finding the right option for your own unique issue can be challenging, but Theravent is definitely that right option, for me.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>and I quickly put on the device.</li>
            <li>Theravent has helped me tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Provent is still better for sleep apnea of course, but with Theravent my 02 levels stay up in a decent range and I can sleep thru the night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a severe obstructed sleep apnea patient of many years who is intolerant of the high pressures of my CPAP.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Having read the directions and learned how to properly fit the theravent I tried my first strip.  </li>
            <li>Thank you, Theravent, for giving me the ability to sleep peacefully once again!</li>
            <li>intake side requires too much effort to inhale comfortably.  </li>
            <li>intake side requires too much effort to inhale comfortably.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well and is fairly comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>But worth trying if you can afford them.</li>
            <li>It seems after reading the reviews that some people have had success with these</li>
            <li>so maybe it&#x27;s worth trying to see if they work for you.</li>
            <li>I have used sleeping medication of nearly all forms for a decade or more.  </li>
            <li>but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>The trick is to make sure it completely seals around your nose.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for a full week, and she has stopped wearing the ear plugs for the first time in years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found success putting it on right before bed and then forcing myself to daydream until I fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it has helped the  sound going from a Loud Bear growing to a more like soft weaseling sound, the noise is still there but is not as loud nor as strong as before, so over all I keep using this product for now.&lt;br /&gt;Edwin.</li>
            <li>I have tried the Breathe Right strips and they do not work for me.  </li>
            <li>Tried theravent and the first night I received it, it was golden.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much anything will work for somebody, and lucky them.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much anything will work for somebody, and lucky them.  </li>
            <li>and she was overjoyed to share with me the very real reduction in my snoring.  </li>
            <li>He said they tickled the first couple of nights</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I only bought the trial pack.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And I&#x27;m definitely getting more used to wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Theravent stopped my snoring the first night.  </li>
            <li>When you put on the device and cover your nostrils you become aware of your breathing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Absolutely worked for me!  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well for nose snorers.</li>
            <li>Felt like it provided it an overall better nights sleep.</li>
            <li>My recordings still show it is working, mostly, and I don&#x27;t feel the need to pull it off in the middle of the night</li>
            <li>The night before last, there was more air leaking out during an exhale.  </li>
            <li>So here&#x27;s the latest (earlier review below).  </li>
            <li>Difficult to find perfect placement on nostrils.</li>
            <li>I have sent back many of these products, and some didn&#x27;t even bother, always feeling ripped off.</li>
            <li>okay if u can get it to seal properly.</li>
            <li>I was able to get it to work properly about one out of five times.</li>
            <li>I may come back and give an update if my snoring gets better as time passes with this product.</li>
            <li>Makes funny sounds.  </li>
            <li>I have been pretty amazed at how well it works for an over the counter product, I half-expected this thing to be a snake oil product but seems like a solid fabrication (not flimsy like a nasal strip), and pretty easy to place on your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You need a good seal at with your upper lip, and you may not get it with facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, my husband has been much less grumpy in the mornings without me keeping him up all night!</li>
            <li>We have enjoyed quiet and comfortable nights sleep for several months</li>
            <li>She explained that she was able to fall right back asleep after returning to bed with out having to fight against loud snoring.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of amazing, actually, but it really does work, at least for me.  </li>
            <li>First, there was no way to fit this to my nose with a tight fit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 2 months, and  my partner is finally able to get a decent nights sleep for the first time in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I think I must be being &amp;#34;trained&amp;#34; to breathe a certain way.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like it or it doesn&#x27;t work, you will be doing somebody a huge solid if you pass your unused product on to them.  </li>
            <li>It really works .</li>
            <li>I read all the instructions and they are very helpful to get started.</li>
            <li>Try before Provent, but don&#x27;t expect much help.</li>
            <li>I really wish I can invent stuff to sell that dont work....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like wearing it all that much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s an unusual sensation, but I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a week</li>
            <li>And the sensation is a bit unusual - you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, and your nasal cavities &amp;#34;pressurize a bit&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this product because it really works as it says.</li>
            <li>Still evaluating how much it stops snoring.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely works and virtually stops snoring.  </li>
            <li>For me....not so much.</li>
            <li>I really had nothing to lose except my snoring.  </li>
            <li>This does not affect the inhale much, or at all, but may ease the exhale somewhat, if not as much as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>I had a comfortable and reasonably quiet night.  </li>
            <li>very noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it works for all those reviewers on Amazon who aren&#x27;t actually fakes (and I suspect more than a few).  </li>
            <li>I really, really want these things to work, which is why I continue to put up with the discomfort hoping I will eventually</li>
            <li>I really, really want these things to work, which is why I continue to put up with the discomfort hoping I will eventually</li>
            <li>I really want to try this product</li>
            <li>(really hope it does, it&#x27;s embarrassing to snore so much as a woman!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course, this is really my problem</li>
            <li>It took me a night or so to get used to the feeling of the Theravent on my nose, but it really isn&#x27;t very noticeable once I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.</li>
            <li>Item works wonders when I go to sleep thanks for your prompt service</li>
            <li>you snore you have probably already spent a fair amount of money trying various things to stop.  </li>
            <li>It is not uncomfortable for the most part, the adhesive is a little itchy but not bad, however, I find myself tearing it off in the middle of the night... defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>Once I laid down to go to sleep and dozed off there was the instant bliss of silence for my wife and a good night&#x27;s sleep for both of us.  </li>
            <li>But, to be honest, my husband&#x27;s severe OSA was never going to be fixed by anything less than a CPAP.</li>
            <li>Even after using theravant just for a couple nights, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge differences in not only how rested I feel, but my wife too, who is often the first one to wake up to the sound of our daughter crying.</li>
            <li>There is no money back guarantee to back up all the confident claims the manufacturer makes, so I guess that says a lot.</li>
            <li>Seemed like a great concept but unfortunately they did absolutely nothing to help my snoring.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently 38 weeks pregnant, and while my snoring has gotten worse throughout this pregnancy, I wanted to give my husband some reprieve and a good night&#x27;s sleep before the baby gets here.</li>
            <li>It is meant to be a one-way air vent, and should allow air to pass through your nostrils normally as you inhale, and then it closes off during exhale, forcing air to leave through your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m parched come morning and easy down two glasses of water...</li>
            <li>My husband has snored very loudly for 36 years.</li>
            <li>By the time the outgoing breath has passed through and around the Theravent, I&#x27;m pretty short of oxygen, and I will sometimes gasp to inhale, as if I had been under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>of the complication in my case could be perennial allergies, although they are mild, my breathing can often be partially constricted.</li>
            <li>Only keeps positive pressure on the nasal cavity during exhale.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Snoring was not as loud.</li>
            <li>My quality of sleep is somewhere closer to normal now and my energy level, not to mention general motivation, has picked up dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>The app I use shows a graph, a static/choppy line to indicate noise, and a straight line to indicate quiet.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for any solutions to help my loud snoring - out of desperation</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous products for snoring and this one seems to really work..</li>
            <li>I have a beard and must shave the area directly beneath my nose.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing on the open market that has &amp;#34;kinda worked.&amp;#34;  I think it&#x27;s worth it for you to try, you may like it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products claiming to stop or decrease snoring, and all they are is taking advantage of a real problem, with false claims to offer a solution to  people&#x27;s relationships.</li>
            <li>and then I still struggle with applying them correctly, but that&#x27;s easy enough to correct and they tolerate repositioning pretty well, but you&#x27;ll probably waste one or two the first few nights.  </li>
            <li>They are not super comfortable, and I often wake up and take mine off in the middle of the night, but they can be a vacation saver when traveling and sharing a room with others.  </li>
            <li>Uncomfortable, doesn&#x27;t seal well enough to know how effective it really is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that my snoring is just due to the pregnancy weight gain and it&#x27;ll lessen on its own within the next few months.</li>
            <li>She had been up several times in the night to help feed our new baby</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not like I have to make a major investment here</li>
            <li>Note that I am a major league snorer.  </li>
            <li>My partner hasn&#x27;t had a decent nights sleep for a long time.  </li>
            <li>After a week of trying to acclimate to them, these remained uncomfortable and disruptive to my sleep - so much so that more than once, I unconsciously tore them off in the middle of the night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expected no results but theravent really works.  </li>
            <li>With a deviated septum I struggle to breathe through my nose anyway, so apparently these were not the thing for me.</li>
            <li>The first few nights were tough, however my wife tells me the snoring is much better.</li>
            <li>Then along came theravent which in my mind was at least something unique enough to give a try.  </li>
            <li>But I bought it here and directly; when buying it directly you have to be very careful to not accidentally sign up for the subscriptions service.</li>
            <li>Like many of the reviewers here, I&#x27;ve burned through quite a few options (some pretty silly, in hindsight) in my attempts to combat snoring.</li>
            <li>I also use the Pure Sleep mouthpiece, and am probably going to try sleeping without it for a few nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Snoring GREATLY reduced!  </li>
            <li> Great news!  </li>
            <li> Theravent is the best!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> &quot; is maybe the best way to put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; is maybe the best way to put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
            <li> I woke up to a very happy wife.  </li>
            <li> this is a great solution for noisy sleepers.</li>
            <li> Lol.. what a joke...</li>
            <li> These vents work great for my son.</li>
            <li> It had greatly reduced the snoring until then, but also greatly reduced the breathing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great concept, but it&#x27;s incomplete.</li>
            <li> Still happy with it.</li>
            <li> Happy wife happy life.  </li>
            <li> The pap is excellent and I feel so much better.</li>
            <li> I promise it will get better is probably the best way to sum up this product.</li>
            <li> and sometimes you don&#x27;t get a good adhesion.</li>
            <li> The one piece design is not as good as having 2 separate pieces, one for each nostril.  </li>
            <li> But customer service was good.</li>
            <li> guess I&#x27;ll keep researching but for now this seems to be a good interim</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been good for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a good nights sleep</li>
            <li> The idea is good, but the execution is poor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad we were able to find a solution that makes us both happy!</li>
            <li> Day 3 was magic!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not preventing the snoring, it kind of changes it.  </li>
            <li> You have to make sure you get a good seal all the way around your nostrils.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice alternative, but i just didn&#x27;t have any luck with it.</li>
            <li> I guess looking at what was our main concern they work flawless.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of options to help with my snoring and this has been the best so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every kind of so called solution, and I wasn&#x27;t able to find anything that worked.</li>
            <li> concept makes sense, which is why I tried it, but the intake needs to be improved, and exhaling might be more effective with a mouthpiece (or something)</li>

            <li> The warm water lets it slip off easily.</li>
            <li> , she is...), but she claims that I&#x27;m breathing a lot better, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like many products would like you to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I tried so many snoring items until this one put an end to searching for anymore.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I feel like it could have been helpful, but there has to be some better glue or a better design.</li>
            <li> It helps him sleep better at night</li>
            <li> and he feels more rested.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there is anything better than this product.</li>
            <li> Just make sure the product is put on as describe and you should have no worries.</li>
            <li> whatever you want to call it, kept me awake most of the night if I didn&#x27;t take something to help me.  </li>
            <li> The cost of the product is negligible and cheaper than my medication was, and I&#x27;m sure this is way better for me.  </li>
            <li> My husband says that he is able to sleep now and we both get rest.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even tell I am wearing any more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wake myself up gasping for breath any more and my wife tells me I don&#x27;t even snore (</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth every penny and probably more.</li>
            <li> But then it goes ways, mostly for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last night, the seal was nearly perfect and almost no air was able to escape during exhale.  </li>
            <li> This does NOT explain the difficulty inhaling I described however, because as soon as I pull the Theravent off, I&#x27;m able to breathe much more</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second problem may affect some more than others.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t doubt some experiences may be better than mine, but reader beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will adjust this review, and the stars, if things</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;ve felt better</li>
            <li> I just purchased the MAX version today to see if it works better</li>
            <li> but hey, another health benefit - more water consumption?</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase them because I do have a much better night&#x27;s sleep while wearing them.  </li>
            <li> All in all this has been a fantastic purchase!</li>
            <li> and I was able to fall asleep all night.</li>
            <li> My supplier ran out of Provent and it was going to be a month or so before they had more</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed, and definitely recommend trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Ordering again.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I will keep using them until they are gone and see if it gets better.</li>
            <li> i have tried this after using the Pro-vent snore therapy, and that worked much better for me.  </li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;micro valves&amp;#34; can also vibrate like a reed in a woodwind instrument when you inhale, creating some interesting whistles and squeaks.  </li>
            <li> ; first, if you have a mustache, good luck.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t end my snoring altogether, but it does make it significantly quieter (read that as &amp;#34;bearable&amp;#34; for my wife), and I am sleeping better for sure.  </li>
            <li> Theravent does create a good seal around the nostrils, but makes so much noise</li>
            <li> They were easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to realize I just need to follow the directions and breathe easy through my mouth until I fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Strong smell.</li>
            <li> 100%but helps for sure, makes u look funny, and takes time to get used to but is worth to try for sure!</li>
            <li> and I can sleep soundly.</li>
            <li> He sleeps sound too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I really do question some of these 5-star reviews as sounding kind of phony.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I really do question some of these 5-star reviews as sounding kind of phony.</li>
            <li> Men with mustaches may have additional difficulty getting this product to fit or seal correctly.</li>
            <li> Depending on how it&#x27;s positioned through the night, when you exhale through it you can get a wooshing sound, weazing, or whistling sound.  </li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> seems to be the way to her rich</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does seem to reduce snoring significantly, and this is verified by an overnight recording I make using an iPhone app for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does seem to reduce snoring significantly, and this is verified by an overnight recording I make using an iPhone app for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> I was getting excited until I read the box</li>
            <li> bottom line is that these things do work, and they have made a significant difference in how both of us sleep at night.  </li>
            <li> I purchased Theravent after a recent fit of research looking for a solution to my apnea, which was becoming a greater and greater</li>
            <li> I tried theravent because it said it was simple and it was more effective than the nasal strips, which didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and is a lot cheaper and more comfortable to wear than Provent.</li>
            <li> it is a very good alternative to travelling with your cpap machine, but i wouldn&#x27;t want to use it everyday</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products to help alleviate snoring and am ready to give up.</li>
            <li> will give it a full two weeks</li>
            <li> To be fair, if you don&#x27;t tear it off in the middle of the night, I can understand how this would work</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yesterday I was about to say that I&#x27;d finally had a good night.  </li>
            <li> and then it got a lil&#x27; better with not snoring as much.</li>
            <li> Went through three of these things (at a dollar a piece) trying to get a seal to form, and the adhesive just wasn&#x27;t strong enough to be effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use and not uncomfortable to wear but just did not work.</li>
            <li> Finding the right option for your own unique issue can be challenging, but Theravent is definitely that right option, for me.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> and I quickly put on the device.</li>
            <li> Theravent has helped me tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Provent is still better for sleep apnea of course, but with Theravent my 02 levels stay up in a decent range and I can sleep thru the night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a severe obstructed sleep apnea patient of many years who is intolerant of the high pressures of my CPAP.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having read the directions and learned how to properly fit the theravent I tried my first strip.  </li>
            <li> Thank you, Theravent, for giving me the ability to sleep peacefully once again!</li>
            <li> intake side requires too much effort to inhale comfortably.  </li>
            <li> intake side requires too much effort to inhale comfortably.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well and is fairly comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li> But worth trying if you can afford them.</li>
            <li> It seems after reading the reviews that some people have had success with these</li>
            <li> so maybe it&#x27;s worth trying to see if they work for you.</li>
            <li> I have used sleeping medication of nearly all forms for a decade or more.  </li>
            <li> but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> The trick is to make sure it completely seals around your nose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a full week, and she has stopped wearing the ear plugs for the first time in years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found success putting it on right before bed and then forcing myself to daydream until I fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it has helped the  sound going from a Loud Bear growing to a more like soft weaseling sound, the noise is still there but is not as loud nor as strong as before, so over all I keep using this product for now.&lt;br /&gt;Edwin.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Breathe Right strips and they do not work for me.  </li>
            <li> Tried theravent and the first night I received it, it was golden.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much anything will work for somebody, and lucky them.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much anything will work for somebody, and lucky them.  </li>
            <li> and she was overjoyed to share with me the very real reduction in my snoring.  </li>
            <li> He said they tickled the first couple of nights</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I only bought the trial pack.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And I&#x27;m definitely getting more used to wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Theravent stopped my snoring the first night.  </li>
            <li> When you put on the device and cover your nostrils you become aware of your breathing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Absolutely worked for me!  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well for nose snorers.</li>
            <li> Felt like it provided it an overall better nights sleep.</li>
            <li> My recordings still show it is working, mostly, and I don&#x27;t feel the need to pull it off in the middle of the night</li>
            <li> The night before last, there was more air leaking out during an exhale.  </li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the latest (earlier review below).  </li>
            <li> Difficult to find perfect placement on nostrils.</li>
            <li> I have sent back many of these products, and some didn&#x27;t even bother, always feeling ripped off.</li>
            <li> okay if u can get it to seal properly.</li>
            <li> I was able to get it to work properly about one out of five times.</li>
            <li> I may come back and give an update if my snoring gets better as time passes with this product.</li>
            <li> Makes funny sounds.  </li>
            <li> I have been pretty amazed at how well it works for an over the counter product, I half-expected this thing to be a snake oil product but seems like a solid fabrication (not flimsy like a nasal strip), and pretty easy to place on your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You need a good seal at with your upper lip, and you may not get it with facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, my husband has been much less grumpy in the mornings without me keeping him up all night!</li>
            <li> We have enjoyed quiet and comfortable nights sleep for several months</li>
            <li> She explained that she was able to fall right back asleep after returning to bed with out having to fight against loud snoring.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of amazing, actually, but it really does work, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> First, there was no way to fit this to my nose with a tight fit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 2 months, and  my partner is finally able to get a decent nights sleep for the first time in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I think I must be being &amp;#34;trained&amp;#34; to breathe a certain way.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like it or it doesn&#x27;t work, you will be doing somebody a huge solid if you pass your unused product on to them.  </li>
            <li> It really works .</li>
            <li> I read all the instructions and they are very helpful to get started.</li>
            <li> Try before Provent, but don&#x27;t expect much help.</li>
            <li> I really wish I can invent stuff to sell that dont work....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like wearing it all that much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s an unusual sensation, but I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a week</li>
            <li> And the sensation is a bit unusual - you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, and your nasal cavities &amp;#34;pressurize a bit&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product because it really works as it says.</li>
            <li> Still evaluating how much it stops snoring.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> It absolutely works and virtually stops snoring.  </li>
            <li> For me....not so much.</li>
            <li> I really had nothing to lose except my snoring.  </li>
            <li> This does not affect the inhale much, or at all, but may ease the exhale somewhat, if not as much as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> I had a comfortable and reasonably quiet night.  </li>
            <li> very noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it works for all those reviewers on Amazon who aren&#x27;t actually fakes (and I suspect more than a few).  </li>
            <li> I really, really want these things to work, which is why I continue to put up with the discomfort hoping I will eventually</li>
            <li> I really, really want these things to work, which is why I continue to put up with the discomfort hoping I will eventually</li>
            <li> I really want to try this product</li>
            <li> (really hope it does, it&#x27;s embarrassing to snore so much as a woman!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course, this is really my problem</li>
            <li> It took me a night or so to get used to the feeling of the Theravent on my nose, but it really isn&#x27;t very noticeable once I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> Item works wonders when I go to sleep thanks for your prompt service</li>
            <li> you snore you have probably already spent a fair amount of money trying various things to stop.  </li>
            <li> It is not uncomfortable for the most part, the adhesive is a little itchy but not bad, however, I find myself tearing it off in the middle of the night... defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> Once I laid down to go to sleep and dozed off there was the instant bliss of silence for my wife and a good night&#x27;s sleep for both of us.  </li>
            <li> But, to be honest, my husband&#x27;s severe OSA was never going to be fixed by anything less than a CPAP.</li>
            <li> Even after using theravant just for a couple nights, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge differences in not only how rested I feel, but my wife too, who is often the first one to wake up to the sound of our daughter crying.</li>
            <li> There is no money back guarantee to back up all the confident claims the manufacturer makes, so I guess that says a lot.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a great concept but unfortunately they did absolutely nothing to help my snoring.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently 38 weeks pregnant, and while my snoring has gotten worse throughout this pregnancy, I wanted to give my husband some reprieve and a good night&#x27;s sleep before the baby gets here.</li>
            <li> It is meant to be a one-way air vent, and should allow air to pass through your nostrils normally as you inhale, and then it closes off during exhale, forcing air to leave through your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m parched come morning and easy down two glasses of water...</li>
            <li> My husband has snored very loudly for 36 years.</li>
            <li> By the time the outgoing breath has passed through and around the Theravent, I&#x27;m pretty short of oxygen, and I will sometimes gasp to inhale, as if I had been under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the apnea reference, I do not have apnea, according to the last sleep test I did, but I have awoken a number of times with this device aware that I had \\&quot;forgotten to inhale,\\</li>

            <li> He tried it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> of the complication in my case could be perennial allergies, although they are mild, my breathing can often be partially constricted.</li>
            <li> Only keeps positive pressure on the nasal cavity during exhale.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Snoring was not as loud.</li>
            <li> My quality of sleep is somewhere closer to normal now and my energy level, not to mention general motivation, has picked up dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> then a pack of 30 directly from Theravent, and I&#x27;m about to join their recurring ordering system.  </li>
            <li> I found it on my elbow the next morning although it felt very sticky.  </li>
            <li> The app I use shows a graph, a static/choppy line to indicate noise, and a straight line to indicate quiet.  </li>
            <li> Not for me, so far.  </li>
            <li> Not for me, so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for any solutions to help my loud snoring - out of desperation</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products for snoring and this one seems to really work..</li>
            <li> I have a beard and must shave the area directly beneath my nose.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing on the open market that has &amp;#34;kinda worked.&amp;#34;  I think it&#x27;s worth it for you to try, you may like it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products claiming to stop or decrease snoring, and all they are is taking advantage of a real problem, with false claims to offer a solution to  people&#x27;s relationships.</li>
            <li> and then I still struggle with applying them correctly, but that&#x27;s easy enough to correct and they tolerate repositioning pretty well, but you&#x27;ll probably waste one or two the first few nights.  </li>
            <li> They are not super comfortable, and I often wake up and take mine off in the middle of the night, but they can be a vacation saver when traveling and sharing a room with others.  </li>
            <li> Uncomfortable, doesn&#x27;t seal well enough to know how effective it really is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that my snoring is just due to the pregnancy weight gain and it&#x27;ll lessen on its own within the next few months.</li>
            <li> She had been up several times in the night to help feed our new baby</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not like I have to make a major investment here</li>
            <li> Note that I am a major league snorer.  </li>
            <li> My partner hasn&#x27;t had a decent nights sleep for a long time.  </li>
            <li> After a week of trying to acclimate to them, these remained uncomfortable and disruptive to my sleep - so much so that more than once, I unconsciously tore them off in the middle of the night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected no results but theravent really works.  </li>
            <li> With a deviated septum I struggle to breathe through my nose anyway, so apparently these were not the thing for me.</li>
            <li> The first few nights were tough, however my wife tells me the snoring is much better.</li>
            <li> Then along came theravent which in my mind was at least something unique enough to give a try.  </li>
            <li> But I bought it here and directly; when buying it directly you have to be very careful to not accidentally sign up for the subscriptions service.</li>
            <li> Like many of the reviewers here, I&#x27;ve burned through quite a few options (some pretty silly, in hindsight) in my attempts to combat snoring.</li>
            <li> I also use the Pure Sleep mouthpiece, and am probably going to try sleeping without it for a few nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vents create a negative pressure which you feel working right away.  </li>
            <li> It has helped to minimize the noise with snoring, I have tried other products but by far this is the one to help to minimize the noise, my wife has been monitoring all the different products that I have tried and by her &amp;#34;testament&amp;#34; she tells me that it does not stop the snoring</li>
            <li> I was anxious to send this because it really helped our relationship, and I knew it could help others.</li>
            <li> This is one in a long line of various snoring remedies that haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> It is one in a long list of possible solutions that are not probable solutions to snoring.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Drawback #2: You will definitely wake up with a dry throat and mouth.</li>
            <li> I googled and found a remedy that others had used, of cutting more holes in them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite loud actually, and though I sleep through it as usual, the recorder app on my phone tells the story.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s roughly the same design as provent</li>
            <li> The strips felt weird at first (as anything over your nose probably would), but after a few days I was pretty used to them.</li>
            <li> Depending on how you get them applied, there can be some slight noise generated by the valves on inhale and by the exhale port on exhale, but it&#x27;s only a minor annoyance while trying to fall asleep</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are periods during the night when the snoring is as if nothing had changed, loud and repetitive, sometimes for 30-40 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to wash face before applying or they come loose during the night.</li>
            <li> and he actually removed it the first 2 nights because it was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> He actually doesn&#x27;t snore AT ALL when he wears it but it would be pretty expensive to use 365 days.</li>
            <li> Third, it does take some getting used to as the &amp;#34;micro valve&amp;#34; technology is just a small flap of cellophane that moves inward when you breathe in through your nose to allow air in, and that moves back against the mesh part of the device when you exhale, preventing air from escaping through your nose.  </li>
            <li> so you can only breathe in through your nose a little and not breathe out of your nose at all.</li>
            <li> I can see the little microvalves moving as I breathe, but they don&#x27;t allow enough air in as I inhale.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who&#x27;s snoring seemed to be getting harder and harder to sleep through when he found this product.</li>
            <li> As I inhale through my nose, my mouth is normally closed.  </li>
            <li> As I inhale through my nose, my mouth is normally closed.  </li>
            <li> No more waking myself up apparently from my snoring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still not ready to order the bulk pack, but I&#x27;m going for 30 days this time and will continue to try</li>
            <li> He said the strips felt weird at first, but after a few nights he was totally used to them.</li>
            <li> Because of said beard, it&#x27;s very difficult to apply it in the right spot where I can get enough pressure to stop snoring.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> other nights</li>
            <li> No more kicks from the wife in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t pulled off, the line shows quiet for periods of hours, interrupted by one or very few snoring episodes.  </li>
            <li> But no matter how well it is applied, I can slowly exhale in a labored way, just enough to keep my mouth closed and fool my unconscious self into believing I&#x27;m breathing.  </li>
            <li> I found them to be irritating on my nose, hard to put in the right place.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money, product did not work and kept coming loose.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, I was really hoping they would help.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not effective and inferior to another commercial product they sell.  </li>
            <li> For my husband, it&#x27;s like they turn the volume down - a bit.  </li>
            <li> The down side to that is that it is Rx</li>
            <li> Being a bit apprehensive due to some of the reviews I read and not liking anything that confines or restricts, I was blown away by how little it bothered me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Theravent takes a few nights to get used to, but it definitely works (for me at least).  </li>
            <li> that keeps the lips slightly apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that keeps the lips slightly apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel better-rested, and she&#x27;s less cranky - the definition of a win-win.</li>
            <li> Using Theravent takes a little getting used to both in the application and the use.</li>
            <li> The Theravent may reduce my snoring, sometimes a lot, sometimes a little, but it does NOT \\&quot;stop\\&quot; snoring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And that vibration can tickle your nose like a feather because that little piece of cellophane is sort of sucked into your nostril opening while vibrating.</li>
            <li> Tough to apply properly.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Must have a few nights to adapt.  </li>
            <li> Dead people don&#x27;t snore.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I tried it unsuccessfully for a few nights.</li>
            <li> Also, it is too expensive for seniors on a fixed income.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work, is a waste of money</li>
            <li> It feels really weird, but I woke up early that morning and took it off</li>
            <li> One thing I think has helped has been to poke a few holes in the nasal vent with the un-bent end of a paper clip.  </li>
            <li> The effort to force the air out between closed lips is unnatural to say the least, and adds to breathing difficulty.&lt;br</li>

            <li> The effort to force the air out between closed lips is unnatural to say the least, and adds to breathing difficulty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not comfortable at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;Drawback #1: I&#x27;ve been told the snoring is gone but is now replaced with loudly heavy breathing through my nose/</li>
            <li> The instructions do say that if you sometimes have trouble breathing this product probably won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy sleeper, and it&#x27;s a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> The initial period necessary to adjust to sleeping with Theravent (3 nights for me) was slightly annoying, and I&#x27;m still considering minor adjustments with the Lite and Max offerings.</li>
            <li> These work pretty well, depending on how badly you snore to start with.  </li>
            <li> First 2 nights were bad</li>
            <li> than I have in over a year, which I&#x27;m pretty shocked to admit.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this helped.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> Might help a bit, not sure</li>
            <li> so it was difficult not to rub it off, maybe back sleepers can handle it.</li>
            <li> I finally took it off at 3:45am because I thought it was suffocating me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure</li>
            <li> but I find myself pulling them off in the middle of the night because breathing is just too difficult.  </li>
            <li> but I find myself pulling them off in the middle of the night because breathing is just too difficult.  </li>
            <li> It reduces the snoring; however, the product forced me to breathe through my mouth as a result my throat was always dried at night.</li>
            <li> My wife and I just had a baby in the past month and while she&#x27;s still sleeping in our room it&#x27;s been difficult because I snore loudly enough to wake the baby, never mind my wife.</li>
            <li> No more sore throat in the morning.</li>
            <li> Ok.. I have tried this product for the past 4 nights.</li>
            <li> Awakening in a fog with some, still tired after using others, and fearing the mask, I sought out other alternatives.  </li>
            <li> Not a very good product.  </li>
            <li> Works, but it is hard to get it to seal with a mustache.</li>
            <li> Hard to position</li>
            <li> I had to result to cutting a larger hole to breathe out.</li>
            <li> At least I</li>
            <li> Read but do not be affected by negative reviews, you have to try it yourself.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned that might have a negative effect</li>
            <li> In reality, my often mouth stays open as I inhale, as it would if I had a cold.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure about the snoring , but I do know my cat sleeps on the bed with me again now!.</li>
            <li> They would be very expensive for daily use ($1/day).</li>
            <li> But, I found it very difficult to get it to seal properly.</li>
            <li> The first time I put this on, I hated it.</li>
            <li> Less annoying than other OTC &amp;#34;Breathrite&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable and hard to breathe.</li>
            <li> or it would make his snoring worse than it already was.</li>
            <li> Worthless piece of tape with hole in middle.</li>
            <li> This product does not work it is a poor substitute for provent</li>
            <li> damning, according to my girlfriend, these caused my snoring to become worse, since I was struggling to breathe.</li>
            <li> yep hate it, only tried one, felt suffucated</li>
            <li> Then it does not seem uncomfortable in the least.</li>
            <li> My snoring has gotten so much worse</li>
            <li> I would rate them  &amp;#34;5 Stars&amp;#34; except for an irritating vibration issue that I explain below.  </li>
            <li> However, the item is difficult to sleep with.</li>
            <li> Difficult to get used to</li>
            <li> I think i understand the theory, but this device is ridiculously uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> but I felt like I was suffocating.  </li>
            <li> Not at all uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s difficult to breathe through your nose with these.  </li>
            <li> But then last night was miserable.</li>
            <li> (What&#x27;s wrong with that picture?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Difficult to exhale.</li>
            <li> He was worried it would be uncomfortable (bc the strips go over your nostrils.)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, didn&#x27;t prevent my snoring.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t uncomfortable, and they were &amp;#34;sealed correctly&amp;#34;, but they did nothing for my snoring.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s weird...</li>
            <li> it feels like you&#x27;re suffocating if you breathe through your nose while you&#x27;re awake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I can see that it may work for some people but even if it does it is way to  expensive to use.  </li>
            <li> but he says they are too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Very poor design, uncomfortable to wear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once on, inhalation is difficult and exhalation is nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> I tried the product for a couple of months since I was desperate for a solution to my snoring.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s impossible to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> My husband is about the loudest snorer ever and after popping one of these bad boys on him, I sometimes don&#x27;t even know he&#x27;s in the bed.</li>
            <li> Bad news is that I just about suffocated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was shocked at the report.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how you can get used to something that is trying to suffocate you.</li>
            <li> Does not work as advertise, does not stop snore nor even reduce.</li>
            <li> My husband has snored very loudly for 36 years. It has kept me awake every night to the point of ear plugs. The ear plugs make my ears sore, so I decided to try these. He said they tickled the first couple of nights but then he got used to them and they are wonderful!!!!!!!! I don&#x27;t have to wear ear plugs anymore and I can sleep soundly. He sleeps sound too. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I did not like it when my boyfriend would wear these. It would scare me because it was almost like he would stop breatheing when he had them on or it would make his snoring worse than it already was.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!  You cannot get any air.  What a waste of money.  Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> So Theravents actually did work, but not for my snoring? My wife said that I no longer stop breathing in the middle of the night. But I continue to have moderate snoring. I guess looking at what was our main concern they work flawless. One night I did not wear one and my wife said multiple times I would stop breathing. I realize this product says it&#x27;s not for sleep Apnea but it&#x27;s roughly the same design as provent which is a prescription sleep apnea device. So considering theravent keeps me breathing continually all night 5 plus stars.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly. However, the item is difficult to sleep with. I tried it for a week, and I always felt like I was choking. I had to result to cutting a larger hole to breathe out. Not for me.</li>
            <li> it is a very good alternative to travelling with your cpap machine, but i wouldn&#x27;t want to use it everyday</li>
            <li> Works, but it is hard to get it to seal with a mustache.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last night and am not sure if I will continue to try the product or not. I have tried so many products to help alleviate snoring and am ready to give up.</li>
            <li> Save your $$. Returning mine. Worthless piece of tape with hole in middle.</li>
            <li> Definitely reduced snoring. I have a mustache and sometimes you don&#x27;t get a good adhesion.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this helped. Snoring was not as loud. Must have a few nights to adapt.  I think it&#x27;s dependent on individual.  I passed not for me.</li>
            <li> this is a great solution for noisy sleepers. It really works .</li>
            <li> Did not work at all.  Very disappointing Can&#x27;t recommend this product.  Next step will be getting the prescription Provent/SR.</li>
            <li> Difficult to get used to</li>
            <li> I tried theravent because it said it was simple and it was more effective than the nasal strips, which didn&#x27;t work for me.  I read all the instructions and they are very helpful to get started. The first few nights were tough, however my wife tells me the snoring is much better.</li>
            <li> This product does not work it is a poor substitute for provent which actually works</li>
            <li> Despite all it&#x27;s claims, this product did not stop me snoring at all. My husband said I snored differently but no less.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and not uncomfortable to wear but just did not work. There is no money back guarantee to back up all the confident claims the manufacturer makes, so I guess that says a lot. I&#x27;m glad I only bought the trial pack.</li>
            <li> Less annoying than other OTC &amp;#34;Breathrite&amp;#34; products. Try before Provent, but don&#x27;t expect much help.</li>
            <li> First, there was no way to fit this to my nose with a tight fit.  So I only wore the product for 1 hour.  The next day I had a rash around my nose, which persisted for 3 days.  They claim their product has no latex, so I assume that issue was because of the adhesive they used.</li>
            <li> Lol.. what a joke...besides the feeling of gasping for air...I still got kicked out of bed....I really wish I can invent stuff to sell that dont work....seems to be the way to her rich..reminds me of snake oil.</li>
            <li> I think i understand the theory, but this device is ridiculously uncomfortable.  Felt like i was sufficating before i got out of the bathroom.  If i want to force myself to mouthbreath, there are probably cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t breathe while using this. I guess it works by forcing you to die. Dead people don&#x27;t snore. Do not buy this crap!</li>
            <li> Five stars, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s the thing - I don&#x27;t really like wearing it all that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an unusual sensation, but I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a week and here&#x27;s the thing: it works.  It&#x27;s kind of amazing, actually, but it really does work, at least for me.  My wife has never minded my snoring (an angel, she is...), but she claims that I&#x27;m breathing a lot better, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m definitely getting more used to wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yeah, you look like a pig when you wear one.  And the sensation is a bit unusual - you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, and your nasal cavities &amp;#34;pressurize a bit&amp;#34; when you breathe out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you breathe.  At least I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you snore you have probably already spent a fair amount of money trying various things to stop.  Try this.  If you&#x27;re like me, this is the last product you&#x27;ll use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Theravent stopped my snoring the first night.  When you put on the device and cover your nostrils you become aware of your breathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned this to my wife and she prompted me to breathe through my mouth while I am awake.  Once I laid down to go to sleep and dozed off there was the instant bliss of silence for my wife and a good night&#x27;s sleep for both of us.  We have enjoyed quiet and comfortable nights sleep for several months together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is different from all the gimmicks and gadgets out there.  I learned that Theravent is adapted from a prescription version of this product.  As I understand, it works by building up pressure in the back of your throat to keep the wind pipe open where snoring actually happens.  Learning about Theravent and using it, I discovered that snoring does not happen in the nose. Like many products would like you to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to put on and remove. One tip for removing the device in the morning, take it off in the shower. The warm water lets it slip off easily.</li>
            <li> OMG! Just got this and put it on at night and my snoring problem has a solution. I tried so many snoring items until this one put an end to searching for anymore. I will continue to buy this product because it really works as it says.</li>
            <li> Been using these strips for a while. Only thing to take care of my nose snoring. Husband was relieved I finally found something that works! I&#x27;ve Ttied everything on the market but this is the ONLY thing that works for me. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  They were easy to use but I felt like I was suffocating.  I had to keep my mouth open while the strip was on which deafeats the purpose of the strip.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work. What more can I say?</li>
            <li> Hard to position, didn&#x27;t stay on, didn&#x27;t work.  But, to be honest, my husband&#x27;s severe OSA was never going to be fixed by anything less than a CPAP.</li>
            <li> Could not get this to seal to my nose. Went through three of these things (at a dollar a piece) trying to get a seal to form, and the adhesive just wasn&#x27;t strong enough to be effective. I feel like it could have been helpful, but there has to be some better glue or a better design.</li>
            <li> This is one in a long line of various snoring remedies that haven&#x27;t worked. My partner snores like an ox, despite every effort for a non-surgical remedy. I have come to the conclusion that a non-surgical solution does not exist.</li>
            <li> I tried it unsuccessfully for a few nights. I guess its the cpap or nothing if I want my boyfriend to get any sleep.</li>
            <li> Great ,product,service and price !</li>
            <li> Absolutely worked for me!  Snoring GREATLY reduced!  Try these!</li>
            <li> I have severe sleep apnea and this products works quite well.</li>
            <li> I can sleep next to my boyfriend without wanting to smother him with my pillow! While his snoring problem isn&#x27;t severe, it&#x27;s enough to keep me awake at night. Thank you, Theravent, for giving me the ability to sleep peacefully once again! He said the strips felt weird at first, but after a few nights he was totally used to them. I&#x27;m so glad we were able to find a solution that makes us both happy!</li>
            <li> I tried the five dollar trial and then found out I have severe apnea requiring a CPAP. The pap is excellent and I feel so much better. But the Theravent people have an automated phone that calls you four times a day telling you to contact customer service. I contacted them twice and twice they said the calls would stop. They haven&#x27;t. It is harassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August, 2014 Update:  Great news!  I lost eight pounds and I no longer snore or need a CPAP machine. Wahooooo!!!! Losing weight is no picnic though.</li>
            <li> It has helped to minimize the noise with snoring, I have tried other products but by far this is the one to help to minimize the noise, my wife has been monitoring all the different products that I have tried and by her &amp;#34;testament&amp;#34; she tells me that it does not stop the snoring but it has helped the  sound going from a Loud Bear growing to a more like soft weaseling sound, the noise is still there but is not as loud nor as strong as before, so over all I keep using this product for now.&lt;br /&gt;Edwin.</li>
            <li> It muffled snoring.  But I bought it here and directly; when buying it directly you have to be very careful to not accidentally sign up for the subscriptions service. No emails they sent indicated I had signed up for the subscription program, just &amp;#34;If you signed up for the subscription program&amp;#34; language. The phone rep says there is a &amp;#34;pop up&amp;#34; that informs you, but canceled my subscription and gave me an RMA for the unwanted packages.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. I use each patch twice. Seems to work as described. Still evaluating how much it stops snoring.</li>
            <li> So, like all my reviews, I will update as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 4th night using it. It is not uncomfortable for the most part, the adhesive is a little itchy but not bad, however, I find myself tearing it off in the middle of the night... defeats the purpose. Its possible I&#x27;m still getting used the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give it a full two weeks, hopefully I stop ripping it off in the middle. Until then, 2 starts. To be fair, if you don&#x27;t tear it off in the middle of the night, I can understand how this would work and I can defiantly see that it could work...updates soon.</li>
            <li> These do seem to work but the design needs improvement.  The one piece design is not as good as having 2 separate pieces, one for each nostril.  Also, it is too expensive for seniors on a fixed income.  Will have to find another solution.  But worth trying if you can afford them.</li>
            <li> Ny hubby only used once. Not sure.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> After a week of trying to acclimate to them, these remained uncomfortable and disruptive to my sleep - so much so that more than once, I unconsciously tore them off in the middle of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More damning, according to my girlfriend, these caused my snoring to become worse, since I was struggling to breathe.</li>
            <li> The product feels uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t treat snoring, rather it makes it more obvious to breathe from your mouth.</li>
            <li> These vents work great for my son. It helps him sleep better at night and he feels more rested. It helped with his snoring.</li>
            <li> You have to learn to breath through your mouth with these.  I&#x27;ve tried several times but just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money, product did not work and kept coming loose.</li>
            <li> Theravent is the best!  It absolutely works and virtually stops snoring.  The adjustment period is short and not a big deal.  Not at all uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It definitely works, not 100%but helps for sure, makes u look funny, and takes time to get used to but is worth to try for sure!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for nose snorers. My hubby is also a mouth snorer so it doesn&#x27;t help with that, but it does eliminate one source.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there is anything better than this product. It provides hours and hours of restful sleep and it can even save marriages. My husband is about the loudest snorer ever and after popping one of these bad boys on him, I sometimes don&#x27;t even know he&#x27;s in the bed. It&#x27;s a miracle. I&#x27;ve told all my family and friends about it. Just make sure the product is put on as describe and you should have no worries. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work, is a waste of money</li>
            <li> Might as well tape our nose shut.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a great concept but unfortunately they did absolutely nothing to help my snoring. Instructions were followed explicitly but to no avail.  It seems after reading the reviews that some people have had success with these so maybe it&#x27;s worth trying to see if they work for you. For me....not so much.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t breath with it on.  I can&#x27;t use them</li>
            <li> yep hate it, only tried one, felt suffucated</li>
            <li> Helped to stop the snoring but sometimes falls off in the night.  Felt like it provided it an overall better nights sleep.</li>
            <li> I have used sleeping medication of nearly all forms for a decade or more.  My snoring/apnea/whatever you want to call it, kept me awake most of the night if I didn&#x27;t take something to help me.  Awakening in a fog with some, still tired after using others, and fearing the mask, I sought out other alternatives.  Tried theravent and the first night I received it, it was golden.  Being a bit apprehensive due to some of the reviews I read and not liking anything that confines or restricts, I was blown away by how little it bothered me.  Get it and try it.  YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE!  I have not taken one thing to help me sleep since I bought this product, and oddly enough, if I forget it one night here and there I still sleep. I think I must be being &amp;#34;trained&amp;#34; to breathe a certain way.  The cost of the product is negligible and cheaper than my medication was, and I&#x27;m sure this is way better for me.  I awaken rested, no bags under my eyes (like there were with medication), and my wife has recommended this to everybody in her office.  Read but do not be affected by negative reviews, you have to try it yourself.  If you don&#x27;t like it or it doesn&#x27;t work, you will be doing somebody a huge solid if you pass your unused product on to them.  Get it done.</li>
            <li> I promise it will get better is probably the best way to sum up this product. I got this for my husband who&#x27;s snoring seemed to be getting harder and harder to sleep through when he found this product. Using Theravent takes a little getting used to both in the application and the use. It took him a while to feel as though he had it on correctly and he actually removed it the first 2 nights because it was uncomfortable. Day 3 was magic! He slept through the night with it on and I slept through the night! He actually doesn&#x27;t snore AT ALL when he wears it but it would be pretty expensive to use 365 days.</li>
            <li> It takes a couple times to get used to Theravent but well worth it.  I wait till just before I fall asleep to put it on. Then it does not seem uncomfortable in the least. iIf I fall asleep without  it, my wife simple lets me know and I quickly put on the device. Everyone is happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks Theravent!&lt;br /&gt;Marty c</li>
            <li> The product works well and has helped a lot. My husband says that he is able to sleep now and we both get rest. I can&#x27;t even tell I am wearing any more.</li>
            <li> Might help a bit, not sure</li>
            <li> These actually work.. It feels really weird, but I woke up early that morning and took it off and my friend woke me back up and made me put it back on.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t help at all. Did nothing to stop the snoring.</li>
            <li> While Theravent isn&#x27;t sold as a sleep apnea device, it uses the same method of remedy for snoring as its sister product, Provent does for sleep apnea (which requires a Rx), although via a different design.  I&#x27;m a severe obstructed sleep apnea patient of many years who is intolerant of the high pressures of my CPAP.  I purchased Theravent after a recent fit of research looking for a solution to my apnea, which was becoming a greater and greater issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theravent takes a few nights to get used to, but it definitely works (for me at least).  I don&#x27;t wake myself up gasping for breath any more and my wife tells me I don&#x27;t even snore (which is what Theravent is marketed to treat)!  My quality of sleep is somewhere closer to normal now and my energy level, not to mention general motivation, has picked up dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a pack of 14 from Amazon and then a pack of 30 directly from Theravent, and I&#x27;m about to join their recurring ordering system.  Now and then I still struggle with applying them correctly, but that&#x27;s easy enough to correct and they tolerate repositioning pretty well, but you&#x27;ll probably waste one or two the first few nights.  Depending on how you get them applied, there can be some slight noise generated by the valves on inhale and by the exhale port on exhale, but it&#x27;s only a minor annoyance while trying to fall asleep and it beats the noise created by your snoring (or gasping, as the case may be).  Follow Theravent&#x27;s instructions and you&#x27;ll be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny and probably more.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of options to help with my snoring and this has been the best so far. I could never get used to wearing a mouthpiece. The strips felt weird at first (as anything over your nose probably would), but after a few days I was pretty used to them. Most importantly, my husband has been much less grumpy in the mornings without me keeping him up all night!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for these.  I found them to be irritating on my nose, hard to put in the right place.</li>
            <li> It worked  but can&#x27;t breath well thought</li>
            <li> Maybe the concept works with the prescription but it&#x27;s difficult to breathe through your nose with these.  I found it on my elbow the next morning although it felt very sticky.  I don&#x27;t sleep on my back so it was difficult not to rub it off, maybe back sleepers can handle it.</li>
            <li> Strong smell. I don&#x27;t know how they can release such product when it is supposed to be taped to your nose.</li>
            <li> Once on, inhalation is difficult and exhalation is nearly impossible. I would rather snore than have to wear this. I am going to request a refund.</li>
            <li> My snoring has gotten so much worse that I decided I had to do something about it.  I&#x27;ve tried every kind of so called solution, and I wasn&#x27;t able to find anything that worked. My partner hasn&#x27;t had a decent nights sleep for a long time.  I found Theravent while searching on the web, and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I really had nothing to lose except my snoring.  Theravent has helped me tremendously.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 2 months, and  my partner is finally able to get a decent nights sleep for the first time in a long time.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> 4/1/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trial continues.  One thing I think has helped has been to poke a few holes in the nasal vent with the un-bent end of a paper clip.  (In the pursuit of science, I&#x27;ve also tried scissor tips and even a golf tee - unused, but the paper clip is easiest work with.  This does not affect the inhale much, or at all, but may ease the exhale somewhat, if not as much as I&#x27;d like.  My recordings still show it is working, mostly, and I don&#x27;t feel the need to pull it off in the middle of the night just to breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are periods during the night when the snoring is as if nothing had changed, loud and repetitive, sometimes for 30-40 minutes.  The difference is that it doesn&#x27;t continue, as it did before, sporadically through the night. The app I use shows a graph, a static/choppy line to indicate noise, and a straight line to indicate quiet.  Since the Theravent, when it&#x27;s working and I haven&#x27;t pulled off, the line shows quiet for periods of hours, interrupted by one or very few snoring episodes.  Again, the snoring doesn&#x27;t seem any milder or quieter when it happens.  But then it goes ways, mostly for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/19/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I was about to say that I&#x27;d finally had a good night.  Slept like a baby.  But then last night was miserable. I finally took it off at 3:45am because I thought it was suffocating me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what was the difference?  Not sure but I think it has to do with air leakage.  Some is necessary.  The night before last, there was more air leaking out during an exhale.  I was concerned that might have a negative effect but it didn&#x27;t, and I had a comfortable and reasonably quiet night.  Last night, the seal was nearly perfect and almost no air was able to escape during exhale.  I had two wake-up-gasping experience - the second time was enough and I pulled the damn thing off.  It had greatly reduced the snoring until then, but also greatly reduced the breathing.  (What&#x27;s wrong with that picture?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to see a range of resistance on the one-way air vents.  Some nights they almost seem not there, other nights they \\&quot;drag\\&quot; very noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/7/14  So here&#x27;s the latest (earlier review below).  The Theravent may reduce my snoring, sometimes a lot, sometimes a little, but it does NOT \\&quot;stop\\&quot; snoring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it&#x27;s not preventing the snoring, it kind of changes it.  By forcing me to exhale through my mouth, it seems to irritate my throat by drying it out.  Why?  As I understand the theory, my mouth should open and close as I inhale and exhale.  In reality, my often mouth stays open as I inhale, as it would if I had a cold.  I tend to snore eventually when that happens.  It&#x27;s quite loud actually, and though I sleep through it as usual, the recorder app on my phone tells the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of the complication in my case could be perennial allergies, although they are mild, my breathing can often be partially constricted. This does NOT explain the difficulty inhaling I described however, because as soon as I pull the Theravent off, I&#x27;m able to breathe much more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another part of the problem - and I think this adds to the asphyxiation feeling - is that despite the one-way resistance to exhaling, I can still exhale through my nose with the Theravent on.  Yes, it is worn properly.  My face is washed, and I make the \\&quot;shaving face\\&quot; to stretch my lip and nose area before applying it per TV&#x27;s advice.  But no matter how well it is applied, I can slowly exhale in a labored way, just enough to keep my mouth closed and fool my unconscious self into believing I&#x27;m breathing.  By the time the outgoing breath has passed through and around the Theravent, I&#x27;m pretty short of oxygen, and I will sometimes gasp to inhale, as if I had been under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great concept, but it&#x27;s incomplete. I&#x27;m glad it works for all those reviewers on Amazon who aren&#x27;t actually fakes (and I suspect more than a few).  Pretty much anything will work for somebody, and lucky them.  Not for me, so far.  I really, really want these things to work, which is why I continue to put up with the discomfort hoping I will eventually \\&quot;learn\\&quot; how to breathe with them as I sleep. Disappointed so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not yet giving up on these things but I find myself pulling them off in the middle of the night because breathing is just too difficult.  The adjustment is not going well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to reduce snoring significantly, and this is verified by an overnight recording I make using an iPhone app for that purpose.  But...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First problem is the design.  It is meant to be a one-way air vent, and should allow air to pass through your nostrils normally as you inhale, and then it closes off during exhale, forcing air to leave through your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The intake side requires too much effort to inhale comfortably.  Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination but inhaling seems to become more difficult as the night goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second problem may affect some more than others.  As I inhale through my nose, my mouth is normally closed.  The effort to force the air out between closed lips is unnatural to say the least, and adds to breathing difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept makes sense, which is why I tried it, but the intake needs to be improved, and exhaling might be more effective with a mouthpiece (or something) that keeps the lips slightly apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the apnea reference, I do not have apnea, according to the last sleep test I did, but I have awoken a number of times with this device aware that I had \\&quot;forgotten to inhale,\\&quot; is maybe the best way to put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I really do question some of these 5-star reviews as sounding kind of phony. I don&#x27;t doubt some experiences may be better than mine, but reader beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will adjust this review, and the stars, if things improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--an a few).  Pretty much anything will work for somebody, and lucky them.  Not for me, so far.  I really, really want these things to work, which is why I continue to put up with the discomfort hoping I will eventually \\&quot;learn\\&quot; how to breathe with them as I sleep.

            <li> I really want to try this product but I am a mouth breather at night. Will this hinder its effect at all?</li>
            <li> These work pretty well, depending on how badly you snore to start with.  For me - they stop my snoring.  For my husband, it&#x27;s like they turn the volume down - a bit.  They are not super comfortable, and I often wake up and take mine off in the middle of the night, but they can be a vacation saver when traveling and sharing a room with others.  You have to make sure you get a good seal all the way around your nostrils.  They would be very expensive for daily use ($1/day).</li>
            <li> Before being diagnosed with sleep apnea, I bought these to quiet my snoring. While my wife said they did work, I felt like I couldn&#x27;t breathe.  Rightfully so, these have a one way flapper so you can only breathe in through your nose a little and not breathe out of your nose at all. I would recommend saving your money for the doctors visit.</li>
            <li> Adhesive did not work well, strips came off during the night. After repeated attempts this was totally a flop.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable at all</li>
            <li> Product was unsuccessful in reducing my snoring even after several days of use. Men with mustaches may have additional difficulty getting this product to fit or seal correctly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for any solutions to help my loud snoring - out of desperation I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try. (I&#x27;m tried nasal strips, spray, etc.) I have been pretty amazed at how well it works for an over the counter product, I half-expected this thing to be a snake oil product but seems like a solid fabrication (not flimsy like a nasal strip), and pretty easy to place on your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on night #4 and I&#x27;ve felt better than I have in over a year, which I&#x27;m pretty shocked to admit. It does take some relaxation techniques to adjust to the nasal strip and the suffocation feeling others reference - I&#x27;ve never had a CPAP machine but my assumption is it&#x27;s got to be a similar feeling? I&#x27;ve found success putting it on right before bed and then forcing myself to daydream until I fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawback #1: I&#x27;ve been told the snoring is gone but is now replaced with loudly heavy breathing through my nose/the theravent - and that they could hear the vents &amp;#34;rattling&amp;#34;. I just purchased the MAX version today to see if it works better (really hope it does, it&#x27;s embarrassing to snore so much as a woman!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawback #2: You will definitely wake up with a dry throat and mouth. I&#x27;m parched come morning and easy down two glasses of water... but hey, another health benefit - more water consumption?</li>
            <li> As described, however when I wear gives me a headache and I feel like I&#x27;m going to suffocate so I can&#x27;t use. I googled and found a remedy that others had used, of cutting more holes in them but that didn&#x27;t work either. Sorry to say, I was really hoping they would help.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me--snoring did not go away.  It turns out I have sleep apnea.  But customer service was good.</li>
            <li> HATE THESE!  I CANT BREATH WITH THESE ON</li>
            <li> I tried the product for a couple of months since I was desperate for a solution to my snoring.  It reduces the snoring; however, the product forced me to breathe through my mouth as a result my throat was always dried at night. I gave up on the product after three months.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all for me. Difficult to exhale. Difficult to find perfect placement on nostrils.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my husband who has always had a terrible snoring problem. Of course, this is really my problem bc it keeps me up all night. He tried it for the first time last night. He was worried it would be uncomfortable (bc the strips go over your nostrils.) However, once he fell asleep there was no problem! He did not snore at all. I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
            <li> This product works very well and is fairly comfortable to wear.  The trick is to make sure it completely seals around your nose.  I have tried the Breathe Right strips and they do not work for me.  The only drawback to this product is the cost, especially if you use them every night.  I will continue to purchase them because I do have a much better night&#x27;s sleep while wearing them.  My husband does too!</li>
            <li> It took me a night or so to get used to the feeling of the Theravent on my nose, but it really isn&#x27;t very noticeable once I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. My wife and I just had a baby in the past month and while she&#x27;s still sleeping in our room it&#x27;s been difficult because I snore loudly enough to wake the baby, never mind my wife. Even after using theravant just for a couple nights, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge differences in not only how rested I feel, but my wife too, who is often the first one to wake up to the sound of our daughter crying. All in all this has been a fantastic purchase!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, didn&#x27;t prevent my snoring.  I think my snoring originates from my jaw relaxing and allowing my tongue to fall towards the back of my throat.</li>
            <li> Saved my marriage. Wife snores. We&#x27;ve tried everything including surgery and sleep therapy. These things work, and work well. Just remember to wash face before applying or they come loose during the night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently 38 weeks pregnant, and while my snoring has gotten worse throughout this pregnancy, I wanted to give my husband some reprieve and a good night&#x27;s sleep before the baby gets here. This product didn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;ve tried it 3 nights in a row and he says every morning that I might as well not have been wearing them. They aren&#x27;t uncomfortable, and they were &amp;#34;sealed correctly&amp;#34;, but they did nothing for my snoring. I&#x27;m hoping that my snoring is just due to the pregnancy weight gain and it&#x27;ll lessen on its own within the next few months. Super disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Nothing like Provent and bunches while I&#x27;m sleeping. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> This system actually works. I have tried many products claiming to stop or decrease snoring, and all they are is taking advantage of a real problem, with false claims to offer a solution to  people&#x27;s relationships. I have sent back many of these products, and some didn&#x27;t even bother, always feeling ripped off. I was anxious to send this because it really helped our relationship, and I knew it could help others.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable and hard to breathe.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> The product seemed to work okay if u can get it to seal properly. But, I found it very difficult to get it to seal properly. Directions did not help. I was able to get it to work properly about one out of five times. I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Only keeps positive pressure on the nasal cavity during exhale.  This is only 1/2 of a snoring problem.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products for snoring and this one seems to really work..so far so good.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my snoring</li>
            <li> Item works wonders when I go to sleep thanks for your prompt service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to find something that would work in place of a sleep apnea mask. The first time I put this on, I hated it. I tried it the second night and I was able to fall asleep all night. I was getting excited until I read the box and it said this is not a treatment for sleep apnea. Now I don&#x27;t know if this is the company just trying to avoid the hassle of FDA medical device compliance, or what. You can&#x27;t get a doctor to recommend anything but the gold standard because they are always worried about covering their as&amp;.I guess I&#x27;ll keep researching but for now this seems to be a good interim step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, if you have facial hair, this will not work. Had to shave to goatee.</li>
            <li> I have sleep apnea and had been using Provent (made by the same company) My supplier ran out of Provent and it was going to be a month or so before they had more so I tried the Theravent. It works very well and is a lot cheaper and more comfortable to wear than Provent. Provent is still better for sleep apnea of course, but with Theravent my 02 levels stay up in a decent range and I can sleep thru the night. I am not sure about the snoring , but I do know my cat sleeps on the bed with me again now!. I am going to recommend it to my mother who snores like a freight train.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward... it&#x27;s weird... it feels like you&#x27;re suffocating if you breathe through your nose while you&#x27;re awake. It took me a while to realize I just need to follow the directions and breathe easy through my mouth until I fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At that point... I wake up several hours later feeling like it&#x27;s been 5 minutes since I dozed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t slept like this in ages. It&#x27;s been good for me. No more sore throat in the morning. No more kicks from the wife in the middle of the night. No more waking myself up apparently from my snoring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still not ready to order the bulk pack, but I&#x27;m going for 30 days this time and will continue to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed, and definitely recommend trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Ordering again. Still happy with it. Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for my snoring boyfriend, oh boy it definitely works.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately did nothing for me. I suspect the reason being that I am a mouth breather when I sleep. I don&#x27;t breath through my nose at all. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Having tried several solutions for snoring including different mouth pieces and breath-right strips, sprays pillows, sleeping positions etc., I gave up on ever solving my snoring problem.  Then along came theravent which in my mind was at least something unique enough to give a try.  I thought heck even if it doesn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s not like I have to make a major investment here so let&#x27;s give it one last try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having read the directions and learned how to properly fit the theravent I tried my first strip.  I noticed immediately that the technology was giving me a different breathing experience.  The vents create a negative pressure which you feel working right away.  It took a moment to get used to but once I slipped into sleep I didn&#x27;t have any recollection that I was using a snore therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a good nights sleep I woke up to a very happy wife.  She had been up several times in the night to help feed our new baby and she was overjoyed to share with me the very real reduction in my snoring.  She explained that she was able to fall right back asleep after returning to bed with out having to fight against loud snoring.  I was no longer gasping for air in the middle of the night and was sleeping like I never snored before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked at the report.  I expected no results but theravent really works.  Happy wife happy life.  I will be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> Ok.. I have tried this product for the past 4 nights. The product doesn&#x27;t work for me. Now, I can&#x27;t give the product a low number since it works on some people. It may not work for me but will for others. We are all different... I bought the one with 14 applications just so I could try it. I will keep using them until they are gone and see if it gets better. First 2 nights were bad and then it got a lil&#x27; better with not snoring as much. I may come back and give an update if my snoring gets better as time passes with this product.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work...sent it back</li>
            <li> Tried it for 5 nights each night I ripped it off halfway through the night without knowing it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t breathe. I had to take it off. I haven&#x27;t tried it again yet. I think I might have a physical problem like a deviated septum or something. I will have to get it checked out at the doctor. The instructions do say that if you sometimes have trouble breathing this product probably won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> Not a very good product.  They did not stick to my skin, however I could not get them not to stick to my mustache. I shaved off my mustache, and cleaned my skin with alchohol, and finally got them to stick. Bad news is that I just about suffocated. I do not reccomend.</li>
            <li> Like many of the reviewers here, I&#x27;ve burned through quite a few options (some pretty silly, in hindsight) in my attempts to combat snoring. Finding the right option for your own unique issue can be challenging, but Theravent is definitely that right option, for me. The initial period necessary to adjust to sleeping with Theravent (3 nights for me) was slightly annoying, and I&#x27;m still considering minor adjustments with the Lite and Max offerings. But once I adjusted, the problem disappeared. Or so my girlfriend tells me. I feel better-rested, and she&#x27;s less cranky - the definition of a win-win.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work for me.  i have tried this after using the Pro-vent snore therapy, and that worked much better for me.  The down side to that is that it is Rx and you cant just buy it.  plus it is extremely more expensive.  This is a nice alternative, but i just didn&#x27;t have any luck with it.</li>
            <li> I could not breathe at all with these strips on. Perhaps it&#x27;s the shape of my nose, but in spite of carefully following the instructions and readjusting several times I had the same results. With a deviated septum I struggle to breathe through my nose anyway, so apparently these were not the thing for me.</li>
            <li> Not working for me.  I can see the little microvalves moving as I breathe, but they don&#x27;t allow enough air in as I inhale.  As a result, the sides of my nose collapse, the mucous membranes stick together, and voila, might as well have duct tape over my nose.</li>
            <li> Theravent does create a good seal around the nostrils, but makes so much noise it&#x27;s impossible to fall asleep. Sounded like Darth Vader with a whistle stuck in his grill.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well don&#x27;t waste your money ...</li>
            <li> Bottom line up front:  THESE WORK!!  I would rate them  &amp;#34;5 Stars&amp;#34; except for an irritating vibration issue that I explain below.  Note that I am a major league snorer.  My wife has worn earplugs at night to allow her to sleep for several years, and even that hasn&#x27;t always worked.  I&#x27;ve been using these for a full week, and she has stopped wearing the ear plugs for the first time in years.  It doesn&#x27;t end my snoring altogether, but it does make it significantly quieter (read that as &amp;#34;bearable&amp;#34; for my wife), and I am sleeping better for sure.  I also use the Pure Sleep mouthpiece, and am probably going to try sleeping without it for a few nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several caveats; first, if you have a mustache, good luck.  You need a good seal at with your upper lip, and you may not get it with facial hair.  Second, use rubbing alcohol to cleanse the area around your nose to ensure that this thing will stay stuck in place throughout the night.  Third, it does take some getting used to as the &amp;#34;micro valve&amp;#34; technology is just a small flap of cellophane that moves inward when you breathe in through your nose to allow air in, and that moves back against the mesh part of the device when you exhale, preventing air from escaping through your nose.  These &amp;#34;micro valves&amp;#34; can also vibrate like a reed in a woodwind instrument when you inhale, creating some interesting whistles and squeaks.  And that vibration can tickle your nose like a feather because that little piece of cellophane is sort of sucked into your nostril opening while vibrating. Last night the tickling woke me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But bottom line is that these things do work, and they have made a significant difference in how both of us sleep at night.  I just purchased my next 30-day supply.</li>
            <li> My wife tells me I&#x27;ve figured out how to snore through it.  The idea is good, but the execution is poor.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  1.Kinda works (I&#x27;ve tried all strengths and went with regular).  Sometime I snore, sometimes I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  1.  Uncomfortable.  I have a beard and must shave the area directly beneath my nose.  When I put it on, it feels like it stabs my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;  2.  Tough to apply properly.  Because of said beard, it&#x27;s very difficult to apply it in the right spot where I can get enough pressure to stop snoring.&lt;br /&gt;  3.  Makes funny sounds.  Depending on how it&#x27;s positioned through the night, when you exhale through it you can get a wooshing sound, weazing, or whistling sound.  Sometimes those sounds are load enough to wake you up.  I&#x27;m a heavy sleeper, and it&#x27;s a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why the 3 stars and not the 2.  It&#x27;s the only thing on the open market that has &amp;#34;kinda worked.&amp;#34;  I think it&#x27;s worth it for you to try, you may like it.</li>
            <li> My Woman Says I Still Snore</li>
            <li> Very poor design, uncomfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;this product not not come close to its claims,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it again nor would I recommend it anyone, C/S recommended that I buy another size to try, and toss the 11 that did not get used.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable, doesn&#x27;t seal well enough to know how effective it really is. I can see that it may work for some people but even if it does it is way to  expensive to use.  $15 for 14 days means it cost $15 for every two weeks. So $15 * 26 &#x3D; $390 a year plus tax for a basically a bandaid with a hole in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I will get a sleep study....</li>
            <li> bought these for my husband. They do work but he says they are too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Not effective and inferior to another commercial product they sell.  It is one in a long list of possible solutions that are not probable solutions to snoring.</li>
    </ol>
