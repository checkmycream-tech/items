            <li>I guess I am going to stick to shaving with a razor which seems to work best.</li>
            <li>Best electric razor I have ever used.</li>

            <li>This shaver works GREAT!</li>
            <li>The ones that worked the best, of course, were the disposable razors but the use of these leads to in-grown hairs and causes severe itchy re-growth.  </li>

            <li>It also does a great job of underarms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>An optional \\&quot;extension cord\\&quot; for those situations would be a great benefit (ATTN:</li>

            <li>We are both happy.</li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It is great....</li>
            <li>A great purchase, great price.</li>
            <li>I was happy with it until the battery weakened.</li>
            <li>It gives a great, close shave.</li>
            <li>She also experienced some hair pulling when using it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>offered to return it, but she felt it was still great for legs.  </li>
            <li>The shaver does work great day-to-day for grooming.</li>
            <li>lol, like I did.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Great results.</li>
            <li>The swivel head seems like a great idea</li>
            <li>Figured it would be a great time saver.</li>
            <li>I hope this is an exception to an otherwise great product.</li>
            <li>The bikini attachment is great also.  </li>
            <li>the attachment is great.</li>
            <li>it works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor.</li>
            <li>This product is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>But if you keep it well cleaned, the trimmer edge works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great shaver for the money</li>
            <li>The Panasonic shaver worked great.</li>
            <li>This does a great job for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>It arrived ahead of schedule and my wife says it does a great job shaving her legs and underarms.</li>
            <li>Great for underarms legs and grooming</li>
            <li>The trimmer attachment is great as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: As others have mentioned, this shaver misses tons of hairs.</li>
            <li>Sellers part was great.</li>
            <li>Keep it charged when not using it so haven&#x27;t experienced performance issues.</li>
            <li>and it still works great.</li>
            <li>Battery life is great.</li>
            <li>It is great because you can do it in any room of the house or camping etc.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with this item.&lt;br</li>
            <li>as great on the legs though.</li>
            <li>durable and works great.  </li>
            <li>My customer is happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT WORKS GREAT...</li>

            <li>This is a great razor for women.  </li>
            <li>This is a great purchase.</li>
            <li>This one is great because it pivots which makes shaving easier.</li>
            <li>When these work, they are great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>It provides me with the closest shave I&#x27;ve experienced.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any nicks or cuts  in the years I have used this shaver.</li>
            <li>in all, this is a great wet/dry shaver for the price and</li>
            <li>Does a great job.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Like the swivel head - does a great job around the knees.</li>
            <li>The bikini trimmer is great.</li>
            <li>I was happy with it.</li>
            <li>The shave isnt as great as i would like it to be.</li>
            <li>Works great on under arms.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the purchase however, because it trims what it needs to trim so that I can wear a swimsuit without...</li>
            <li>The bikini attachment is great too -</li>
            <li>Have used this item for years and still works great.</li>
            <li>It works great on her legs too.  </li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t as great as the shaver i was using.  </li>
            <li>Its great in or out of the shower/bath.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re crunched for time.  </li>
            <li>This is a great shaver for the bikini area.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>

            <li>A great alternative to a razor.</li>
            <li>I can tell you it is really great</li>
            <li>I have an electric shaver, but it isn&#x27;t great at all.</li>
            <li>and this is great for that &amp;#34;next day stubble&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Works great, no problems with it.</li>
            <li>bought it for my wife and she wasn&#x27;t happy with the performance of the product.</li>
            <li>A quality product, at a great price - Amazon once again beat the competition on value.</li>
            <li>it works great but not for pubic hair like underarms and bikini lines.</li>
            <li>but she wasn&#x27;t happy with the shave-</li>

            <li>and it shaves very nice.</li>
            <li>Very nice razor, I bought it for the wife.</li>
            <li>so thought this razor would be very handy.  </li>
            <li>The flexibility of the head is very nice and the handle feels ergonomically designed.  </li>
            <li>This shaver works very nicely.  </li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Very nice quality.</li>
            <li>two pivoting heads are very nice for those bumps and folds all bodies have.</li>
            <li>it works amazing!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing shaver, ladies!</li>
            <li>Durable and amazing. 5 stars!</li>
            <li>The price was amazing too!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been amazing ever since... who would have known!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most impressed with,</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pull hairs, great power, good charge, and</li>
            <li>In use, shaves off the hair perfectly, without the hassle of razor burn :)</li>
            <li>Outstanding quality - awesome price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works great!!</li>
            <li>The shaver is nice!</li>
            <li>Now, my razor is always in its own slot when I need it!</li>
            <li>Good electric shaver, great features.</li>
            <li>But before it died, I loved using it in the shower, worked great everywhere.</li>
            <li>I tried this one after reading many reviews and agree it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>Great product and good delivery time</li>
            <li>I love this razor- the pivoting head is perfect for legs.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST one I could find after reviewing many electric shavers.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how effective it is!</li>
            <li>My daughter enjoyed this purchase and said it was the best razor that she ever had.  </li>
            <li>it is very handy and keeps a good charge.</li>
            <li>My wife says it&#x27;s very easy to use and does a very good job.</li>
            <li>This was a good purchase for the price it has worked</li>
            <li>When deciding to purchase an electric razor, you have to remember that you will get a good shave</li>
            <li>For the price this is a good razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>I wanted an electric razor even though I realized the results would not be as good as with a razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the one I used to have that died after 10 years or so.</li>
            <li>(All Good equipment with batteries tells you to do that.)</li>
            <li>It has the \\&quot;GOOD HOUSEKEEPING\\&quot; seal of approval on it.</li>
            <li>(But then if it were, I doubt it would be as good of a product.)</li>
            <li>I have own Panasonic shavers before and it is great to have as a backup</li>
            <li>and we both thought it was good.</li>
            <li>It looks like it would do a good job, but it does not do a good job.  </li>
            <li>I picked this one cause of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Good choice all around.</li>
            <li>Shaver works as good as I expect for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>close shave, keeps a good charge.</li>
            <li>Panasonic fit my needs perfectly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be making the mistake of buying this shaver again, no matter HOW good it was in the beginning.</li>
            <li>This one had good reviews on Consumer Reports, so I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as good as the Remington it replaced.</li>
            <li>it would not be fair of me to comment either way.  </li>
            <li>it would not be fair of me to comment either way.  </li>
            <li>battery life is good.  </li>
            <li>it is almost as good as a  blade, but is easier to use.</li>
            <li>had never tried electric shaving, but this Panasonic shaver is inexpensive and has some good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>but does a good job</li>
            <li>I LOVED THE WAY</li>
            <li>There were a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li>This electric razor is good, not great.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>I had been looking everywhere for a good women&#x27;s electric razor and couldn&#x27;t find anything.  </li>
            <li>I went on a hunt for a good razor, hoping that I could find one that would give me a close</li>
            <li>You would assume that the pivoting head on this razor would be a GOOD thing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ladies, if you are looking for a good, close shave out of an electric razor, don&#x27;t buy this one...get the cheaper one without the pivoting head.  </li>
            <li>Is it wonderful for a girl just getting comfortable with shaving and does it do an acceptable job of it?</li>
            <li>The razor did do a good job for her when it was working though.</li>
            <li>and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>It works great and the razor itself is nice too.  </li>
            <li>When I broke the foil on my Remington (which I LOVED)</li>
            <li>I loved my Remington</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good in a pinch...</li>
            <li>As a shaver, I suppose this is as good as you can get with an electric.  </li>
            <li>and it feels good in my hand.</li>
            <li>To use on the legs its good, but again to get around the knees</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cut me which was good</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>&gt; the good part</li>
            <li>battery still holds a good</li>
            <li>like using the Bikini trimmer, she lets me do that - works good...</li>
            <li>does not do me much good but using it in the shower is beneficial.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>not as good as the one I had before.  </li>
            <li>Fair price if it was really good.</li>
            <li>Keeps a good charge and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>Best comfortable razor.</li>
            <li>This is a good razor</li>
            <li>I am the husband and used a mans electric Braun Series 3 340 and have it for years and it cuts close and the ladies shaver I purchased it because it had good ratings.</li>
            <li>Still looking for a good electric razor, would not recommend  this one at all.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d believe the good reviews but that was a mistake.</li>
            <li>She tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>I had a Remington wet/dry trimmer that I loved, until it stopped working out of nowhere.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve gotten one good shave out of this thing.</li>
            <li>It works but not as good as you would expect it to</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>It was just as good as using a disposable razor and did not cause any itchy re-growth.  </li>
            <li>it does a really good job.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>They loved it &amp; plan to purchase one as well.</li>
            <li>This razor does not do a good job at all.</li>
            <li>I loved this shaver until it died 6 months after I bought it.</li>
            <li>The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a good charge either.</li>
            <li>so if you are looking for a good shaver this would be it.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly good for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>Bought this because the reviews stated it was a good shaver.  </li>
            <li>anyway, its good.</li>
            <li>With that being said, I still get a fairly close shave.  </li>
            <li>This one works well and is a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>dose a good job for the price.</li>
            <li>Was packaged good when shipped.</li>
            <li>Good for those of us</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to keep going over and over your leg to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t women get a razor that shaves as good as a man?</li>
            <li>If you can get it for under $25 you&#x27;re getting a good deal</li>
            <li>good buy</li>
            <li>I had a Panasonic electric razor and loved it.</li>
            <li>I have had this shaver for a year and the battery is longer keeping a good charge.</li>
            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>Of course it&#x27;s not as good as a blade shaver</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still really good.</li>
            <li>It holds a good charge and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Almost as good as the husbands shaver.  </li>
            <li>Must be good, I gave it as a Christmas gift and it has been used with no complaints.  </li>
            <li>It was nice to hear her happy about a gift that I bought her.</li>
            <li>This shaver is as good as any disposable/venus type razors out there.</li>
            <li>This is a good shaver to just have.  </li>
            <li>The flip up side burn trimmer is a good feature for my husband.</li>
            <li>I have really loved this razor.</li>
            <li>Maybe you just need to have finer hair for it to be of good use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No where close to being a good shaver.</li>
            <li>I am olive complected and have fairly course hair</li>
            <li>At times it feels like it is not doing a good job although it does shave well.  </li>
            <li>Worked well for two years then fell apart despite good care.</li>
            <li>It takes a lot of patience to get a good close shave.</li>
            <li>The battery life seems good.</li>
            <li>The handy recharging device that plugs into the outlet is great.</li>
            <li>I have fair hair and fair skin.</li>
            <li>Swivel head seems like a good feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the price was good .</li>
            <li>my girlfriend loved it..</li>
            <li>The trimmer doesn&#x27;t do a good job at all.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as advertised.</li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>For trimming and leaving hair it is good.  </li>
            <li>Every woman needs a reliable good shaver and this one fits the bill.</li>
            <li>Does a good job.  </li>
            <li>surprisingly nice close smooth shave!!!</li>
            <li>Shaver is awesome; well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is wet/dry and each method performs beautifully.</li>
            <li>She is very pleased with this product and she would recommend it to any one in need of a good shaving device.</li>
            <li>Perfect for when I need a quick shave.</li>
            <li>The shaver arrived quickly and works perfectly just like its predecessor.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair on my legs and it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.</li>
            <li>The best part though and what I am really (really!!)</li>
            <li>IT CHARGE&#x27;S QUICKLY AND SEEMS TO HOLD CHARGE FOR NEEDED LENGTH OF TIME FOR USING IT!!!  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but was happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>My wife is very satisfied with the preformance</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>All in all, very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>After going through a great panasonic electric razor, I thought this was going to be a sure bet.</li>

            <li>I was nervous about buying this as some of the reviews weren&#x27;t great, but I love it.</li>
            <li>The pivoting head feature is a great idea, as it makes shaving much more forgivable and seems to reduce irritation.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet, but it&#x27;s great to be able to rinse it under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, no irritation!  </li>
            <li>I have dropped it soooo many times and it turns on an works great.</li>

            <li>Decided to try was very pleased</li>
            <li>She had never used a electric shaver before an is very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I find it works best dry, and it doesn&#x27;t give you the perfect up close shave.</li>
            <li>The price was right, and the razor works wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice razor and I love that it is flexible.</li>
            <li>My razor came when promised, it charged quickly, and does a really nice job!!</li>

            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>The trimmer part I love!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more convenient!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on legs and bikini area for about two months and am very pleased and quite impressed with the close shave - never expected the great results I get.  </li>
            <li>It works well which is more than I can say for the one I replaced!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I just wish she would use it more often!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>So I thought if i bought this, it wouldn&#x27;t shave off that top layer!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the bikini feature!  </li>
            <li>I decided to get it based on the reviews - I sure wish I hadn&#x27;t now!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this shaver!  </li>
            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>and it just doesn&#x27;t get any better for an electric shaver than a Norelco!</li>
            <li>, was I glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love this shaver!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>

            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be mored pleased!  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t shave often but compared to what I was going through with my allergy, this is WAY better!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>then use the shaver just to be safe!</li>
            <li>first, I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>I love using it!  </li>
            <li>I love my shaver!</li>
            <li>I love this electric shaver!  </li>

            <li>Glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
            <li>ES2216PC is not just for the ladies any more!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this shaver!  </li>
            <li>Now I love it!</li>
            <li>and this one does 10x better job than the one I had before!  </li>
            <li>These things should give you more than a year!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>this was an impluse purchase, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>so I decided to go with this Panasonic and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this shaver!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will still love it a year from now!  </li>
            <li>Ideally, the reason I purchased this is that the cost of blades for Venus and Gilette shavers has skyrocketed, and even shopping at Costco anymore has become super pricey for replacement blades.</li>
            <li>Although we did not need the item and returned, the service was great and we were refunded for the product very quickly.</li>
            <li>It gives a close shave, easy to handle, and great in the shower.</li>
            <li>great razor easy to use and reliable</li>
            <li>It is great for underarms, it seems to move around curves easily.  </li>
            <li>panasonic is a great tread mark... was arrive very quickly...</li>
            <li>As a positive this razor had an excellent battery life.</li>
            <li>Very nice product easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>Leaves legs feeling smooth and works great under arms too.  </li>
            <li>Amazing, is the word I would use to describe this razor.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I use it on the bikini and underarm area with amazing results.  </li>
            <li>But Amazon is amazing,</li>
            <li>The shaver is great and I feel free of the dread of shaving my legs.</li>
            <li>It is amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice I can use it in the shower without a problem.</li>
            <li>I got a nice close shave...</li>
            <li>I have a nice close shave when finished without all the nicks.</li>
            <li>Panasonic must have own people writing them....</li>
            <li>I honestly thought I&#x27;d use it a couple of times and never touch it again...</li>
            <li>And honestly, even at the &#x27;1&#x27; setting, since it still has the mesh cover on, it didn&#x27;t cut anything.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s nice to not need to sit beside an electrical outlet to use it.</li>
            <li>Story:&lt;br /&gt;I came from a remington WDF3500 razor and I liked it</li>
            <li>No razor burn, no irritated skin, and best of all a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Based on the many great reviews of the Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver with Bikini Attachment, I decided to purchase this shaver and boy am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>glad i read all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>But then I used it in the shower and that was really nice.  </li>
            <li>cannot speak to the longevity yet, but the blades do a nice job</li>
            <li>It keeps it out of the way, but still handy.  </li>
            <li>in all works nice, the battery seem to work for 45 min at one go.</li>
            <li>Even thought this product got so many good reviews...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a spectacular job on my pits.  </li>
            <li>I also liked the fact that I could shave my legs before I got into the shower, which saves water.</li>
            <li>it gives me the absolute best shave!!!!&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>good for the price made of mostly plastic</li>
            <li>as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I hope one day, the industry can make women shaver comparable to men&#x27;s shaver that has nice dual blades for shaving close and is made of good quality (many of those for men in the market)</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice looking wet-dry shaver.</li>
            <li>Received in a reasonable time and in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>Pop-up trimmer comes in handy somewhat for already \\&quot;trimmed\\&quot; areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>what kind of products I use to shave with.</li>
            <li>Nice charger also...does not take up room like others.</li>
            <li>but she liked the way it shaved her legs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked about it:  </li>
            <li>It is a nice razor, and I like the fact that it is a wet/dry electric razor.</li>
            <li>It is handy it does give a nice shave.</li>
            <li>Performs nicely, even in &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; areas.</li>
            <li>I ordered this shaver based on the excellent reviews, and to switch from a Remington that didn&#x27;t shave very closely.</li>
            <li>But I have really liked this razor for what it is.</li>
            <li>Performs nicely for my wife.  </li>
            <li>I like a nice close shave and figured I&#x27;d have to give that up by switching to an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I like the closeness of the shave without getting to close, They are convenient to use and handy as well.</li>
            <li>However, my sister tried it on her legs, and she liked it a lot</li>
            <li>The bikini trimmer is not all that effective</li>
            <li>Durable, effective: would buy again.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a closer shave to be honest..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s wet/dry</li>
            <li>Nice close shave and no irritation.  </li>
            <li>The charger is kind of a pain.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a cord</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t any kind of indicator that shows battery</li>
            <li>have used it under my arms and it gives a nice close shave there too.</li>
            <li>did not shave as close as I would have liked</li>
            <li>When her birthday arrived this year, I bought her a Panasonic Shaver of her own.  </li>
            <li>Works Great, nice attachment and leaves skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>I liked the pivoting head as you shaved.  </li>
            <li>Nice shaver.</li>
            <li>I really liked this shaver until the battery stopped holding a charge after about 11 weeks.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery time is good, charging time OK</li>
            <li>but it would be nice to have some lights to indicated level of charge</li>
            <li>I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Nice product made for ladies.  </li>
            <li>gives a nicely close shave and the bikini attachment</li>
            <li>is nice for trimming as needed.</li>
            <li>Being charitable, if you shave every day, maybe this would work.  </li>
            <li>It was nice to have it up and out of the way for charging in the outlet that I did plug it into, though.</li>
            <li>I really liked it.</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of EZ-bake oven..  </li>
            <li>Handy and waterproof.</li>
            <li>She really liked it, our daughter &amp;#34;borrowed it&amp;#34; and loves it too.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to buy a nice razor for myself.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest...</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and razor works great!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s handy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x60;s nice to use in the winter months, when one might let herself &#x27;go&#x27; between shavings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x60;s nice to touch up when one does not feel like taking the time in shower to shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gives a nice shave&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>The somewhat flexible head is a nice feature for going over knees and toes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not as close as I&#x27;d have liked, even from an electric razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was durable, and worked well in water, I liked how it charged with no wires, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Nice modifications for feminine body.</li>
            <li>There are not that many good electric razors out there for women</li>
            <li>It gives a nice close shave, as close as you can get without a razor.</li>
            <li>great product  great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular, just an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>that I ever liked this one.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull the skin and gave me a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>and she says it does a nice job.</li>
            <li>The amount of energy I&#x27;ve saved (water energy from not having to be in the shower, and my own energy by not having to lather up).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price, fast shipping, quality product!!!</li>
            <li>The original idea to purchase came as one of my granddaughters was turning 12 and had expressed great interest in shaving her legs.</li>
            <li>but it was decent at best.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this shaver and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great for helping her have a safe, easy way to shave.</li>
            <li>Although this is not a replacement for shaving altogether for me, it works great in the shower as an in-between shaves, don&#x27;t need to be 100% silky smooth, just don&#x27;t want ppl to be able to see hair, kind of shave.</li>
            <li>This works great, its true it doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor, but it does a pretty good job!</li>
            <li>trimmer &amp; attachment works great, when wet is best.</li>
            <li>That said, I think this product is great for quick and convenient shaves out of the shower.</li>
            <li>This is a great item to quickly take care of bikini areas or legs before heading to the beach.  </li>
            <li>Good Product., easy to use, convenient in size.  </li>
            <li>What a great thing for in between and quick shaves.</li>
            <li>my sister really loved using it ,easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Good to have, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great for quick leg shaving</li>
            <li>great for quick fixes/shaves.</li>
            <li>This works great for quick shaves.</li>
            <li>I have had my fair share of electric razors and this one is definitely one of the best!  </li>
            <li>It does a good job, but doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to use</li>
            <li>sit is a very strong &#x27;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning is very easy as the heads pop on and off.</li>
            <li>Very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>If I were able to do a back-flip from excitement, I surely would!</li>
            <li>BUT FOR MY MONEY ITS ABOUT THE SECOND BEST THING TO A FULL WAX!!!</li>
            <li>It does not do as good a job as a razor but works just fine.</li>
            <li>Great shaver....very nice design and very gentle to use...</li>
            <li>This is worth the money and a great purchase.  </li>
            <li>As far as electronic razors go, this is the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>A close smooth shave, looked like a good wax</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with the replacement as there is no doubt that it delivers a closer shave than its predecessor did.</li>
            <li>I have owned two of these and this one is by far the best one yet.</li>
            <li>Would have liked it better if it had a stand to put it on when recharging instead of sticking it on an outlet.  </li>
            <li>But this one is by FAR the Best Shaver I&#x27;ve owned!!</li>
            <li>She is quite pleased and plans on getting our daughters their own.</li>
            <li>This one is getting closer, but I&#x27;ll bet if I bought a nice men&#x27;s shaver that it would work better than any ladies shaver on the market.</li>
            <li>This is the best electric razor that I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>And it does work on your face, but honestly, my husbands 3 headed electric razor works better for my face and does not irritate me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had electric shavers before, but this is by far the BEST</li>
            <li>It is by far the best electric razor I have owned.  </li>
            <li>I had been using an old mens Braun shaver with a cord so this seemed wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best one I have used.  </li>
            <li>By far the BEST razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I initially liked it better than I do now.</li>
            <li>She is very pleased and so am I because We found the \\&quot;Best of the Best\\&quot;, finally.</li>
            <li>My wife is very happy with this shaver, because it&#x27;s easily cleaned and it works really well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and keeps you well groomed!</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>easy to handle and clean---arthritic hands are a bear!  </li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve used an elec razor, and it&#x27;s very easy &amp; does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great little machine at a great price!</li>
            <li>But overall, I find the Panasonic shaver does a very good job providing a fairly close shave.  </li>
            <li>Great product, after using other electric shavers this one is the best.close shaves and no nicks or pulling would recommend this to eveyone with sensitive skin!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Works great, great quality and the batteries last forever.  </li>
            <li>The unit itself is attractive, and I liked it over all, it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I like it alot more than my old one.&lt;br /&gt;Just perfect! !!!!</li>
            <li>My first razor worked great for about 2 months and then stopped holding a charge.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with how comfortable the shave is from this razor.</li>
            <li>This is a great improvement over my first razor.</li>
            <li>This is the first Panasonic electric shaver I have ever owned; and, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>So, this is my first electric razor, really happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty happy with this item.</li>
            <li>and at first I was really happy with it.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge great and is quick and easy to recharge.  </li>
            <li>And if there are any fine hairs, just forget it!</li>
            <li>Legs and underarms are very smooth after using the product.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li>but over all it makes my legs look very smooth.  </li>
            <li>It also makes them very smooth.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>a cancer surviver it is very important I don&#x27;t get cut</li>
            <li>The results are very smooth (even with thicker hair)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave legs very smooth</li>
            <li>My wife says she loves how the shaver moves over her legs, very comfortable... loves it.</li>
            <li>I also liked that it easily attached to the cordless, plug-in</li>
            <li>the hand nicely and easy to carry when going away.</li>
            <li>Good for a quick leg touch up on the go but</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a super smooth close shave, go with a manual razor, otherwise this is great on the go.</li>
            <li>Amazon price was excellent and I appreciated the super saver</li>
            <li>It cleans easily and has a pop up blade for armpits, which is the most effective tool I have used ever for that area.  </li>
            <li>As a woman of a certain age, this is great to buzz around my face once or twice a week between facials.  </li>
            <li>but it sure is nice for a quick cleanup!</li>
            <li>It is so quick and easy to use!!</li>
            <li>Does not shave any more</li>
            <li>Love the compact way it recharges, no cord.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have mostly used this on trips.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Product is ok.</li>
            <li>who cares about shaving :)</li>
            <li>, it gives good shaves, and it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Love the bikini attachment too.</li>
            <li>I purchased this in the hope that it would be better and easier than a razor, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>I got this more as a trimmer than a razor.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>I have had others that gave a closer shave but paid much more.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten so many nicks.</li>
            <li>I feel I got a better shave on legs/</li>
            <li>may you ladies enjoy like I am!</li>
            <li>WHOO-WHO! :-)</li>
            <li>Much better than any electric razor</li>
            <li>Versus using a razor, I think this shaver gives better results.  </li>
            <li>The charger sits nicely on the counter with the extension cord I bought for it, but even if I did not have the cord, the unit snaps securely in the charger and dose not fall out unless you were to knock it onto something.</li>
            <li>: I was able to purchase an extended warranty for two years for an additional nine dollars.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>As someone else has pointed out the plastic tabs that holds the blades are raised up more than the blades are.  </li>
            <li>Her long-time favorite electric shaver, a version of the Norelco LadyShave, has been discontinued and hers is no longer holding a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t any better.  </li>
            <li>but i love using this for those days when i just don&#x27;t feel like shaving.</li>
            <li>so I guess it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so good, easy to clean and</li>
            <li>I love these shavers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think anyone can ask for more.</li>
            <li>Quite pleased with it for the price.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver -</li>
            <li>WE BOTH LOVE THEM.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SHAVER...</li>
            <li>It does not produce a baby-smooth finish, but like many people have said you&#x27;ll get a result which is like about 12-24 hours after a razor shave.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sooooo much better.</li>
            <li>Since the idea of giving her a razor with actual blades was inconceivable, this razor was considered one of the best out there.  </li>
            <li>her favorite razor ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but instead of running a cord to the razor, the razor snaps in to the top of the plug itself.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok when you don&#x27;t have a lot of time.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I went over the hair, I still had stubble.</li>
            <li>I had better luck when i tried it in the shower with shaving cream, but it was still just so-</li>
            <li>It is better than the Clio, but still bulkier than a disposable blade razor, and not as close.  </li>
            <li>even that they have maintained the quality but not being able to get my hands on one</li>
            <li>It is better than the Clio, but still bulkier than a disposable blade razor, and not as close.  </li>
            <li>even that they have maintained the quality but not being able to get my hands on one</li>
            <li>got a closer and better shaver with my boyfriends</li>
            <li>Love the pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li>i am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love this shaver.</li>
            <li>I have never been a big fan of electric shavers for women, but the Panasonic ES2216PC is probably one of the best I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li>I am in love, Love, LOVE with this Panasonic women&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li>but I noticed that my hair growth is more faster</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>Love it, bought it for my daughter for x-mas</li>
            <li>thought about going with a men&#x27;s razor - it seems like there ought to be something snazzy you get for 10x the price (literally, many men&#x27;s razors do cost 10x what this one costs).  </li>
            <li>Given that women shave more of their bodies than men it surprises me that there aren&#x27;t better shaving options for women.  </li>
            <li>Great item, you will get a very close shave every time.  </li>
            <li>Neither way seems to work better.</li>
            <li>but I was really satisfied with the results of this</li>
            <li>in fact the lighter the touch, the better.  </li>
            <li>It works okay</li>
            <li>It is an okay product.  </li>
            <li>I especially liked how quiet it was.</li>
            <li>It shaves even better in the shower with a shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Remington is much better in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>And it took too many passes.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did.  </li>
            <li>That gives you a nice smooth movement with the shaver for the varied terrain of your valley.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am okay with this shaver, but it could be better.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off paying more and getting a men&#x27;s Panasonic razor instead.</li>
            <li>I wanted to switch to an electric razor to save time (and also because it is supposed to be better for ingrown hairs).</li>
            <li>In either case simply touching the metal contacts allowed the razor head, which was still attached and in my hand to run.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I had been looking at many stores for this item but none of them carry it anymore.</li>
            <li>but at this price I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>razor works much better on the leg area.</li>
            <li>product feels like it was made much more for the bikini area.</li>
            <li>I did, however, like the shaver, so I decided to give this model one more chance.</li>
            <li>a thousand times better than the philips , braun  and the remingtons Ive tried all of them</li>
            <li>My manual dissposables are better than this over priced shaver.</li>
            <li>I saw it and thought she would just love having a &amp;#34;Pretty Shaver&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It is okay for the price.</li>
            <li>I imagine with some time, I could get better at shaving</li>
            <li>can tell you, though, that now that I have used this shaver, I will use a shaver forever more.</li>
            <li>It does an okay job.</li>
            <li>I love having the freedom of using it wet/dry to shave.</li>
            <li>i think razor is easier than this.search more for better product.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and comfy without razor bumps!</li>
            <li>My scissors does a better job</li>
            <li>a not-so-close shave was okay.</li>
            <li>I spend MORE TIME going over one spot</li>
            <li>Wasting more time.</li>
            <li>Resorted to waxing and I am way happier now :)</li>
            <li>(knowing I have no allergic reaction), I find myself more often than not using this electric razor.</li>
            <li>Yes it costs more</li>
            <li>or so you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>You have great legs and people really notice them and then as you sip your coffee you notice some stray hairs or stubble.</li>
            <li>It takes her more time to do her legs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I probably have coarser hair on my legs than most ladies, and this shaver did not cut it at all.  </li>
            <li>love the charging station</li>
            <li>Even if this shaver does not stand the test of time, I am already a convert and will research a more premium model.</li>
            <li>(while I do love the revamped design and the stylish mauve charging dock).</li>
            <li>However, that is just the blades getting deeper and grabbing more of the hairs, and I would never trade that up.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why I have been using those cheap disposable razors all these years!  </li>
            <li>This item worked ok as a razor for my legs (even though it wasn&#x27;t a close shave), but the bikini attachment is a joke.  </li>
            <li>This is great.my wife is enjoying the fact that she dosent  get cut</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleased with my purchase of the Panasonic ES2216PC Electric Razor.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor...</li>
            <li>I love this charger.</li>
            <li>okay for the time it worked,</li>
            <li>You can probably do better.</li>
            <li>but it did a better job than this one.  </li>
            <li>(I had just switched from an epilator so anything felt better)  </li>
            <li>(Even then, I still have more &amp;#34;prickles&amp;#34; than I can stand)</li>
            <li>I like the charger stand (it plugs into an outlet and the razor stands on top).</li>
            <li>My mother used to have an electric razor from 20 years ago that worked better...</li>
            <li>After reading many glowing reviews, I was satisfied with going ahead to make the purchase.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it works as well as the rest.</li>
            <li>I have used several electric razors over the years and this one is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Sherry:)</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Seems that it is also better made than the Norelco.</li>
            <li>I have to go over my legs many times.</li>
            <li>this one is a good powerful product and I&#x27;m really satisfied with my purchase .</li>
            <li>Also, great because it&#x27;s so fast for shaving if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li>OK, I dont know anything about the batteries of this item...</li>
            <li>therefore her life just got waaayyy better.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>and I am able to shave my legs with a razor every week if I want.</li>
            <li>*most* of the stubble.</li>
            <li>I say most because it never provided a close shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver several months ago, and it was the very best electronic shaver I have ever had</li>
            <li>bought this because she would get rashes from using a regular shaver, this has been the best thing for her</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to save time, water, and to get a better shave.</li>
            <li>If you had a Venus or Gillette in your hand, you atleast had better control.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m particularly pleased with being able to use it in or out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>Shaved using it and shaving cream and was really pleased at how closely it shaved.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver I am on blood thinner</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out why it does this.</li>
            <li>Skip this and just by a better men&#x27;s electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Love the shave and comfort of this razor.  </li>
            <li>It broke into many pieces and the blades all came apart and the plastic snapped.</li>
            <li>Beaver never so smooth!  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li>It also does a better job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor isn&#x27;t magic.</li>
            <li>I love the pivoting head part esp for going over the knees and underarms.</li>
            <li>Does ok on underarms but</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this shaver and look forward to using it over and over again.  </li>
            <li>I was able to shave 3 times on one charge.  </li>
            <li>im glad i invested in it.</li>
            <li>and I have been very happy with it and plan to take it overseas with me later this year.</li>
            <li>but this one is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Purchase this one which is better quality at a lower price.</li>
            <li>Now they both use it and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I hope you would look for a better shaver given the price of this one.</li>
            <li>Love this shaver.</li>
            <li>Just glad I decided to take a chance on this one.</li>
            <li>okay&#x27;</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this model 3 times (it seems to last 2-3 years before it no longer holds a charge) and have always been very happy with the quality of shave it delivers.  </li>
            <li>It seems to shave OK</li>
            <li>To be on the safe side I always charge it for 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you register with Panasonic so the warranty will be valid.</li>
            <li>Love this shaver.</li>
            <li>Works better than anticipated.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Glad I took a chance with it.</li>
            <li>Works ok</li>
            <li>It did an ok job while it lasted,(4 MONTHS).</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t look much better in the end.</li>
            <li>Corded items like this always work better than cordless, but I couldn&#x27;t even find a corded razor so had to go with this one.</li>
            <li>Great to use...doesn&#x27;t get a really close shave</li>
            <li>This makes it much more packable.</li>
            <li>I am pleased and recommend this product for price and performance</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and now I use it more than she does.</li>
            <li>One of the reviews mentioned getting scratched from the plastic casing around the top of the razor.  </li>
            <li>love the wet/dry function.  </li>
            <li>The shaver head is much more mobile than I had imagined</li>
            <li>I purchased it without realizing it was panasonic &amp; its an ok shaver.</li>
            <li>I love the attached bikini trimmer, too.</li>
            <li>but I have always had nice smooth skin after an electric shave.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s used to using a disposable razor which I&#x27;m sure would cut closer.  </li>
            <li>However once I used it found that it pulls the hair, it does not cut them and it irritates my skin more then a razor, I had used a Remington shaver for years but it was time to replace</li>
            <li>I was 100% satisfied with the Wet/Dry Shaver.</li>
            <li>I love this razor for my underarms.</li>
            <li>I also have an Emjoy epilator - which I LOVE, but I wanted something I could take with me on camping trips.</li>
            <li>I started growing chin hairs in my 40s, &amp; after years of plucking every day, more &amp; more each year, a girlfriend told me about the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Epilator &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it for 2010.</li>
            <li>Love the pivoting head.  </li>
            <li>I love mixing water with my shaving gel.</li>
            <li>Love the way it make my skin feel</li>
            <li>Was given as a gift to my grand daughter - she loves it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to charge it in months.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery; Not as happy as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>It is better than the Remington and annie</li>
            <li>Also love the bikini attachment-</li>
            <li>I bought one for myself and two more for gifts.</li>
            <li>Much better than the disposable razors.</li>
            <li>I must say I am extremely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer also seems to miss many hairs (and also snags) when I&#x27;m doing my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my wife, at her request, and she reports that it more than meets her expectations, and she has no complaints about the product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It is just OK.  </li>
            <li>Best spent money on an amazing ladies shaver.  </li>
            <li>I figured it still worked OK</li>
            <li>love this razor.  </li>
            <li>razor itself is ok for what I used it for--touching up when not wanting to use a razor.  </li>
            <li>Also, I love the space saving charger stand.</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor for my lovely wife.</li>
            <li>She loves it just as much as I love the no stubble on her legs.</li>
            <li>Im glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li>Much better than my Remington</li>
            <li>Love the shaver.  </li>
            <li>i love it..</li>
            <li>On top of all that, I also found it was more work/took more time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several lady&#x27;s electric razors but this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>If there is a better one out there I haven&#x27;t found it.</li>
            <li>So I figured that is okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not for this for sure.</li>
            <li>But I would give 4 stars because the shaver is ok.</li>
            <li>Although this doesn&#x27;t give me a closer shave than a manual razor, I love the fact that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>so I figured being able to trim my legs would be better.</li>
            <li>I was sure to read the reviews before purchasing this shaver, and all reviews were in-line with what I was hoping for out of a shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You do end up needing to shave more because the electric razors always leave a teeny-tiny amount of &amp;#34;peach fuzz,&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s what prevents the ingrown</li>
            <li>a doubt my all time favorite electric razor.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;has made a  good razor and it was worth</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the transaction.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t give to be able to use a blade razor.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a better electric razor out there for women, I have not found it.  </li>
            <li>OK, so I have to go over some spots twice to get all of the hair...</li>
            <li>My legs still felt scratchy after many passes of the shaver.</li>
            <li>my wife love this.thanks</li>
            <li>Everything was absolutely perfect for several months!</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This razor does get all the hair(s) and does a nice close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not terribly bothered.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d be better off buying a mans beard and moustache trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better shavers from Remmington.</li>
            <li>so I really thought this one would be great.</li>
            <li>I love that I can just pop it onto the charger in the wall.</li>
            <li>What more can you want from an electric shaver?</li>
            <li>I had much better luck with my husbands Norelco 3 head shaver.  </li>
            <li>However, this is not a problem for me as I would rather shave more often than deal with irritated skin.</li>
            <li>My last Panasonic shaver lasted more than 20 years and was awesome.</li>
            <li>This one is ok.</li>
            <li>and it is WAY BETTER.</li>
            <li>I love this razor and wish I had purchased it years ago.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the charging directions and do not leave it charging while not in use or it will ruin the battery.</li>
            <li>Love using it in shower and bath.</li>
            <li>I really really love this shaver.</li>
            <li>The blade came off on one side and it could no longer be used safely.  </li>
            <li>I just kept using it hoping that it would work better, but it never did.  </li>
            <li>If you have a Remington and are looking for a better replacement</li>
            <li>Keeps a charge for more than two uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had one just like this for years but didnt have the swivel top.  </li>
            <li>It works ok, but,</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I want,  but it&#x27;s better than all the razor blade cuts.  </li>
            <li>the shave could be closer but that could be said of most all razors.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used an electric razor for many years.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I still love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Must be fully charged to do most of both legs</li>
            <li>It is good as a hedgetrimmer, but not the best tool for putting green manicuring.  </li>
            <li>And you have to make sure the cap is always on the shaver when you aren&#x27;t using it because it has foil shaver heads like a mans shaver.  </li>
            <li>She claims is an excellent razor, with only one change she could recommend - a cord rather than a receptacle for charging.  </li>
            <li>She would prefer to have it charge on the counter top rather than attached to a wall socket.</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>I love using this one in the shower.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I still have to use my husbands trimmers because they work better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I can trim better with a pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>So now I am looking for something better.</li>
            <li>Great love it,works really well.</li>
            <li>I had ordered this from a catalog which cost a lot more.</li>
            <li>As a shaver, it works OK, within the limits of how electric shavers tend to.</li>
            <li>Even after doing this many times, it did not give a close shave.  </li>
            <li>Plus for the money I was expecting much better.</li>
            <li>I have used electric shavers exclusively for more than 15 yrs.</li>
            <li>I love the charger that just plugs into the outlet.  </li>
            <li>maybe better.</li>
            <li>thought it was supposed to be safe, but NOOOOO</li>
            <li>Love my daughter for introducing it to me.  </li>
            <li>I like it sooo much better</li>
            <li>I would say it is just ok.  </li>
            <li>and it works ok in some areas</li>
            <li>Very close shave for an electric razer &amp; great battery life.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>There must be better products out there.</li>
            <li>So, I tried this one because there have been so many sold</li>
            <li>Love my Panasonic shaver.  </li>
            <li>Love the shaver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied - and the Amazon processing and shipping speed was super, too.</li>
            <li>Its gives nice clean shave, I have used remington shaver before, but this one is much better.</li>
            <li>And so am I ;)  !!!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and razors irritate me, I bought this Panasonic because I had seen several reviews as being very good and the price was very good.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice clean shave on a mans beard.</li>
            <li>I cant vouch for the ease of use but the end results are pretty good.. :)</li>
            <li>Instructions say it&#x27;ll take a couple weeks of steady shaving to get the &amp;#34;best result&amp;#34;, but I am already happy with its performance.</li>
            <li>This electric razor is light weight and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is a high quality product for a great price.</li>
            <li>The price was great as I purchased a diderent brand and much high and didn&#x27;t even work at all.  </li>
            <li>Works good on short or fine hair but not that great on course or longer hair.</li>
            <li>fantastic shaver easy to use &amp; does an amazing job.  </li>
            <li>Works better than my husband&#x27;s electric; like the trimmer; can use on my face and underarms without pinching; cleans easily and most important--no nicks like with a blade.  </li>
            <li>great product easy to use very functional&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>The razor is easy to handle and gives a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good shaver-</li>
            <li>My wife loved it, first time&lt;</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as good as my first.  </li>
            <li>The panasonic ES2216PC is the best shaver I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li>So, the shaver is pretty good.</li>
            <li>This one, though priced higher, does not seem to be as good.</li>
            <li>Good Price and Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>I have been using an electric shaver for years, I loved the first one I got.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I have found that the battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Charge lasted good at first but stopped holding a charge after a year or so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d still say the ES2216PC is a good razor, but I&#x27;m definitely super excited about my replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the unit at the original $39.99, but cannot recommend its purchase at any price!</li>
            <li>It is worth every bit of the money paid for it!!  </li>
            <li>I was using scissors instead until I got my new shaver, which has a great bikini trimmer attachment, though not adjustable.</li>
            <li>I saw a lot of great reviews and needed a new Razor forever</li>
            <li>Not as good as the Remington Smooth and Silky razor that I used to own in regard to closeness of shave, but still decent.</li>
            <li>The flexible head really helps get into the curves, which is important to me as a plus sized lady with a great deal of curves.</li>
            <li>This razor does the best when used dry.</li>
            <li>For those quick times when you need just to tidy up those hairs</li>
            <li>Nice charger,and quick charging unit.</li>
            <li>I was able to easily shave her legs without her experiencing any pain.</li>
            <li>do not want anything to interfere with the already excellent performance of this shaver while using in dry</li>
            <li>It gives me a nice, smooth shave and is comfortable \\&quot;sitting\\&quot; in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I expected this product to be one of the best since its from the reputable panasonic brand.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a reasonably priced, nice looking, and effective shaver.</li>
            <li>I feel so much more comfortable shaving because I am confident that I won&#x27;t end up bleeding at the end of my shaving</li>
            <li>Wife &amp; Grand Daughter both love the ease of shave &amp; smooth silky results the Panasonic</li>
            <li>but it is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It shaved both legs and bikini areas without any problems, and was very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and clean after use.  </li>
            <li>I wish I knew which kind of electric shaver I had right before this one because that was a much better shaver.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it will work fine.</li>
            <li>just keep it clean and charged!</li>
            <li>Surprised and very pleased, love it!</li>
            <li>It worked very nicely when it arrived, but I have to wonder if the unit I received was refurbished rather than brand new.  </li>
            <li>Skin looks nice and clean after shaving - not razor smooth, but no visible stubble either.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s very good, a regular shaver still shaves closer.  </li>
            <li>Very good buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what the manufacturer claims which is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>There are certainly other methods to get better results, but this shaver is perfect for a quick and easy touch up!</li>
            <li>when I use a razor blade however I am fortunate to not have many ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>This shaver is the most comfortable razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars only because 5 would be perfect, and few things are perfect.  </li>
            <li>They will both get you there, but one is going to be a lot quieter, faster, and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally safe and pain free.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy shaving more with the Panasonic</li>
            <li>Perhaps some adjustments need to be made, but she has not been happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had, though I detest the color (pink).  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s back to the search for the ideal ladies&#x27; shaver.</li>
            <li>No you will never get that lovely smooth feeling you might get with a safety razor or waxing or whatever</li>
            <li>but it is also more comfortable for me and easier to use.</li>
            <li>The pivoting head makes for a more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Women&#x27;s Smooth and Silky Foil Shaver and I love it.</li>
            <li>This is the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent and wish I would have purchased something like this years ago.</li>
            <li>My cheap disposables work better for a closer shave.</li>
            <li>Good shaver, much quieter</li>
            <li>good price, fast delivery for upcoming trip.</li>
            <li>This is very convenient though, &amp; does a good job.  </li>
            <li>It really cuts good.  </li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and I guess you get what you pay for in terms of good electric razors.</li>
            <li>NOT AS CLOSE AS A BLADE, BUT GOOD FOR A FAST TOUCH UP IN THE SHOWER,WHEN SHE DOESN&#x27;T HAVE TIME TO SHAVE</li>
            <li>this good is extremely reasonable, so</li>
            <li>A GOOD RAZOR FOR THE PRICE  FAST SHIP</li>
            <li>Good buy and reasonable shipping time.</li>
            <li>the attachments are very useful, love that the head has some give and moves a bit.</li>
            <li>Great Razor easy to use and clean, obviously not a smooth shave as a blade, but great as u&#x3D;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and very precise.</li>
            <li>I just got the Norelco 8250 Speed XL and it was sweet!</li>
            <li>Back to looking for a good shaver!</li>
            <li>My wife has had two other electric razors and feels this is her best yet.  </li>
            <li>I do have to shave a day or so more often, but for the tradeoff (no razorburn) it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li>I have a lot of panasonic other stuff and very happy</li>
            <li>Not bad for over 15 years!</li>

            <li>still runs strong.  </li>
            <li>My wife bought hers three years ago and it is still going strong</li>
            <li>The cleancut did an amazing job of the very intimate brazilian-type shave, but couldn&#x27;t touch the flat-laying outer hair.  </li>
            <li>a couple of years ago and liked it very much.</li>
            <li>however the tool is very precise and easy to use plus quick.</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave with this and am very glad I chose this one.  </li>
            <li>It gave an amazingly close shave (comparative to the ES2207P), and caught ALL of the hairs in a line the first time.</li>
            <li>It is easy to operate and does a fine job .</li>
            <li>It falls apart real easily and doesn&#x27;t shave very closely.</li>
            <li>I think in the summer when I am shaving more frequently it may be more effective.</li>
            <li>and I feel that I got a really nice, pretty close shave.  </li>
            <li>I liked this item at first</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not the battery - the device works fine and has a strong charge once it turns on.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a pretty nice razor</li>
            <li>got this for my sister who&#x27;s currently in the hospital and not allowed to use razors (blood disease) and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Was thrilled with this razor for the first 3 months.  </li>
            <li>Liked that it has pop up trimmer that works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super easy to clean and very easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome and works swiftly and easily and hair doesn&#x27;t grow back very fast at all.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES2216C is hands down the best women&#x27;s electric shaver I&#x27;ve had in years.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the BEST electric shaver!</li>
            <li>Right Size right everything!!!</li>
            <li>The price was perfect, the quality was more that what I expected, and the color has a nice soft look</li>
            <li>Its comfortable to hold making it easy to use as well as convenient being cordless.</li>
            <li>I did use it in the shower and it held up fine.</li>
            <li>It worked just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>You can basically use it anywhere and it will be fine.</li>
            <li>it is fine.</li>
            <li>, it works fine.</li>
            <li>and it would work fine.</li>
            <li>Suits my purpose fine.</li>
            <li>clipper works just fine too.</li>
            <li>Works just fine  still would prefer a closer shave .</li>
            <li>I first bought a Norelco back in the 90&#x27;s and it was the best ever.</li>
            <li>Shaver works fine - not as close as I would like when doing underarms.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s works fine</li>
            <li>If your hair is fine and baby like, you have to go over and over the hair repeatedly to get it off.</li>
            <li>but it does a fine job.  </li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t even shave her fine hair.  </li>
            <li>but it was fine for a while after that</li>
            <li>WHAT MY WIFE TOLD ME WORKS FINE,</li>
            <li>Have never had to replace blades and it still charges up fine.  </li>
            <li>Does job just fine.  </li>
            <li>Not even the fine hairs.  </li>
            <li>I am not a bear, and I&#x27;m not baby fine.</li>
            <li>Shaves fine.  </li>
            <li>I have used it in both in and out the shower and it works fine in places.</li>
            <li>I love that I can take this to my fitness club and do a quick touch up in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Quick suggestion or tip use body scrub before !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works quickly, efficiently, and I love it.</li>
            <li>And it would be OK for a quick \\&quot;I forgot to shave</li>
            <li>I can do a quick touch up on my legs and save a ton of money on razor blades!  </li>
            <li>ok for a quick shave.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t go back and forth between blades and an electric shaver, if you decide to go electric,and I would recomend you give it a try, stick with it, a good one like this makes it easy!</li>
            <li>By reading reviews, I found out a lot of men use a hair trimmer on their face, as it is much gentler, and also works much better on longer hairs, but no one ever mentioned this for women!  </li>

            <li>To top it off, I live in Las Vegas where it is sunny and nice 9 months out of the year.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This razor is easy to use and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This razor is easy to use, gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>The hair on my legs is fine and light</li>
            <li>I Replaced my monthly brazilians with this little tool and although it doesn&#x27;t get quite as smooth as the day after a brazilian, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>This shaver is very comfortable &amp; easy to use &amp; gives a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li>With respect to delivery it was timely and accurate.  </li>
            <li>Description of the product was accurate and works as described.  </li>
            <li>This is better than I expected and not as great as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Which is HUGE for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A huge plus for me is that it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>She was SO happy that she could have SMOOTH legs again without the risks involved when using a regular razor!</li>
            <li>Charges quickly, easy to clean and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Made a HUGE difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do wish the charger light would change colors or turn off</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>it was a fluke issue and that the replacement product would be glitch free.  </li>
            <li>it &amp;#34;skips&amp;#34;, meaning it does not glide smoothly along the legs.</li>
            <li>Use a light touch.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but it does not leave the skin smooth as the Remington&#x27;s she had.</li>
            <li>Legs feel quite smooth.</li>
            <li>While it does not feel baby butt smooth</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>It cuts close and smooth.</li>
            <li>The battery holds a charge well and it is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Feels cheap, doesn&#x27;t shave well.</li>
            <li>If you want uber smooth legs...</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This product holds a charge and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>this shaver is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Clean up is really easy as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use this product several times now and am extremely happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Just a light touch along the skin is all that&#x27;s needed for a close shave.</li>
            <li>It is easy to charge and clean.</li>
            <li>Overall, great shaver for the price but one drawback.  </li>
            <li>PROS: smooth, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Pivoting head is fantastic for bikini area and lower--can get all the nooks and crannies.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed how smooth my legs felt after using this product.</li>
            <li>this is a great addition to my personal collection of \\&quot;lady gadgets\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;prior</li>
            <li>skin silky smooth after a shave-</li>
            <li>Packaged extremely securely.</li>
            <li>I never knew that trying a nickel free razor would be the answer.</li>
            <li>But for just regular shaving, they work great.</li>
            <li>Worth the money if your satisfied with an electric shave vs. blade.</li>
            <li>And you don&#x27;t stay hair free for eight weeks like it says.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the swiveling head, it feels like it goes around my knees and</li>
            <li>so when Amazon emailed  that it was available, I &#x27;jumped&#x27; at the chance --</li>
            <li>Close shave, easy to clean and</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This razor lasted about 1.5 years with that light use.  </li>
            <li>was almost as smooth as with a non-electric razor!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always thought that my options were razor or waxing, neither of which is comfortable</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t ever get my legs really smooth, but it does the required job.  </li>
            <li>It gives a close, smooth shave on legs.  </li>
            <li>The on/off buttons and head are really cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>and it gives a really smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>In and out of the shower its fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is much heavier than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic shaver gives me a close, smooth shave -- almost like shaving with a razor, but without the nicks and bumpy rash.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels silky smooth, like when I used to use razors, and I am so grateful for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Face Moisture Shave, Fragrance Free, 11 oz]]</li>
            <li>It delivers a closer shave, and is quite comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never used an electric razor that works like a real blade; amazing.</li>
            <li>If you want touch smooth legs for your man though, get a five blade razor or something.</li>
            <li>But this works great for last minute beach legs!!!</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Also, I found the set cheaper on 1800 parts dot com with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great razor for the price, but I needed to go over each area on my legs several times to remove all the hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it for the peach fuzz on my face and light hair on my arms.  </li>
            <li>It takes a couple times to go over to get it smooth.</li>
            <li>(my leg hair is too light for it to be effective)and</li>
            <li>While it does not make my legs razor smooth, the hair is not as visible.</li>
            <li>happy with, it that with doing this I do not have any problems with red irritated skin</li>
            <li>The light still comes on when it&#x27;s plugged into the charger, but it won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean and works well.&lt;br /&gt;Fits</li>
            <li>razor shape was comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>have 3 bichons and will use on them once they get use to the sound</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Could never get a smooth feel at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s rather easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth shave and no &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; afterwards.</li>
            <li>When that happens the recharge light won&#x27;t go on eventually it will stop running.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shave completely smooth</li>
            <li>overall great product.</li>
            <li>Handles well, shaves close, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>She gave me a telephone number to call which was not toll free.  </li>
            <li>I asked for and received a toll-free number, but when I called it I was referred to the non-toll free number.  </li>
            <li>B000Q6RHJA Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeable]] did.</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth shave and no nicks and irritation.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel they leave my legs smooth, but they do the trick in a rush.</li>
            <li>its not as smooth as a wax</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It does legs and underarms comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Granted, the others were cheap.  </li>
            <li>It is light in weight and flexible.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>you just don&#x27;t get the smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, charge, and clean.</li>
            <li>Of course I then learned that returning it was only a happy fantasy.</li>
            <li>I bought this with the primary intention of the bikini area.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>Wife has had this for several years and it works great.  </li>
            <li>The shaver runs smoothly and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>cheap as this was</li>
            <li>Great for younger ladies who just need to get up and leave for school.</li>
            <li>This shaver does a fantastic job; it&#x27;s a close shave with one time</li>
            <li>Works well, but feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>In all, I am happy enough with the purchase.</li>
            <li>In all, I am happy enough with the purchase.</li>
            <li>This razor gave me a close smooth shave with no issues.</li>
            <li>This razor is great for a last minute shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to operate and to clean.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a razor, buy a cheap $7 disposable and be done with it.</li>
            <li>well which is important.</li>
            <li>still felt stubble after about 20 minutes of trying to get a smooth shave on my legs.</li>
            <li>Kinda cheap.</li>
            <li>But, if you are looking for a smooth bikini shave, this product does not deliver.</li>
            <li>Is easy to clean and holds the charge for quite some time.</li>
            <li>Gets you relatively smooth.</li>
            <li>I like a smooth shave</li>
            <li>I wanted to try an electric razor I could use while comfortably seated.  </li>
            <li>(My boyfriend loves my smooth legs, and I can let him touch them now without recoiling away in pain).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>This works perfectly if you have a modern vanity arrangement in your bathroom, with a plug above the sink.  </li>
            <li>So far,  so good.  </li>
            <li>Had it for about a month, so far so good</li>
            <li>So far not so good.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Although it does not give as close of a shave as my good old Venus and</li>
            <li>I used to use an old men&#x27;s Norelco on my legs years ago, and it worked fairly well.</li>
            <li>but it seems to hold a charge and so far so good.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good and gets pretty close.</li>
            <li>So far it is good.</li>
            <li>point blank, came on time, looks good, and i need six more words so&lt;</li>
            <li>Received the razor very quickly, was very easy to use &amp; gives a very close cut.</li>
            <li>Amazon is very good about returns and it went right back with no</li>
            <li>Excellent value for money (and means less chance of her using my razor!).</li>
            <li>This is a good inexpensive wet or dry shaver, it is a perfect gift and is easy to use any where</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t bought a new shaver in quite some time and am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>We are not allowed to use a plain razor so this product was a welcome addition to my toiletries !</li>
            <li>The price was right and everything went smoothly!</li>
            <li>Other reviews were very good.</li>
            <li>Should have gone to Amazon in the first place!!</li>
            <li>I love it, it cuts close and has a good charge, as well as easy to handle (even for a mobility limited person).</li>
            <li>good value, exactly as discribed, fast dhipping, Would recomend, works well on bikini area, works well in shower, easy to clean</li>
            <li>The one advantage to this shaver is the wet/dry function which is very useful for using in the shower.</li>
            <li>And the bikini attachment is very useful as it has three length</li>
            <li>Very useful, cut every thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this one works just fine on chest hair , arm hair , special parts hair</li>
            <li>Nice design, good quality, fairly quiet, fast and easy to use, but...</li>
            <li>Does a clean and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Needs light to tell when battery is ending and a brush to clean it.</li>
            <li>Close, clean, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I found the bikini line shaver thing is not all that great, but I have another trimmer for that :) It does a good enough job for a quick touch up for this old, married chick.</li>
            <li>I found the bikini line shaver thing is not all that great, but I have another trimmer for that :) It does a good enough job for a quick touch up for this old, married chick.</li>
            <li>The comb attachment is going straight into the trash because it just leaves hairs too long, but heres the greatest part</li>
            <li>Underarm and bikini shaving is super close without causing razorburn, easy for beach days that I just need a touch-up.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this razor is that it&#x27;s a pretty pink color.</li>
            <li>It is really easy when you just need to do a quick job when running out in shorts.</li>
            <li>quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Great razor, stays charged for a long time and is comfortable to use -- doesn&#x27;t pinch.</li>
            <li>the first electric shaver that i have ever purchased that really did a good job</li>
            <li>Given the dubious product quality I&#x27;d already experienced, I didn&#x27;t spring for their offer (throw more money down the drain?), and they wouldn&#x27;t do anything else for me.</li>
            <li>Always use it wet with regular soap, and you&#x27;ll be very happy with it for many years!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being able to shave dry is super nice as well!</li>
            <li>This new razor has wonderful improvements such as a floating head and charge station</li>
            <li>Apart from that, it&#x27;s super easy to clean, to use, etc.</li>
            <li>this item is good why can I say something about this item  short and easy.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this razor was magic!  </li>
            <li>I got a lot of positive comments about this product and so far it works great on my body.</li>
            <li>It is great and stays charge a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The great thing is that the charge holds for a long time and it never cuts skin.</li>
            <li>that was a long time ago and it seems they&#x27;ve improved greatly since then.</li>
            <li>The convenience of availability when needed (it keeps a charge for long periods) and the pivoting head are great features.  </li>
            <li>So I purchased this one and so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor and I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li>So far, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>what I paid, I&#x27;m not terribly disappointed though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for about five months and originally wrote a glowing 5-star review of it.</li>
            <li>It was a great price, although it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for long, I wish that it was a closer shave</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading the reviews I was quite excited about this razor.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this item as both a razor for my legs and to trim my bikini line.  </li>
            <li>but when you want to be lazy, it&#x27;s PERFECT!!!</li>
            <li>originally bought this February 25, 2014.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad when I first used this shaver</li>
            <li>I am NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li>OK for the price, but 10 months after purchase,  I&#x27;m buying a higher quality men&#x27;s shaver..  </li>
            <li>; I had originally switched because the Remington&#x27;s charger lead had oxidized.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor.</li>
            <li>I purchased this in July 2012 and at first it worked ok</li>
            <li>Works great and holds the charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>but so far i&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I don&#x27;t know how I lived without one!</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s important to get a full charge on the battery.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work ok the first time out of the package.</li>
            <li>and it was worth it!  </li>
            <li>Love it, this is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>The very first time I used this, things started out fine.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, so I think very often it gets pushed away rather than</li>
            <li>So, yes, not perfect but a seriously good razor at a very good price.</li>
            <li>Considering what the price is for some higher-end drugstore disposable razors, I would say this is a very good buy and will certainly last much longer than a multi-pack of Ladies Gillette&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other razors and this is by far the best one!</li>
            <li>Was smooth on my skin, no discomfort, good for bikini line for a quick fix but as others have said not quite as smooth as shaving, but very similar to the &amp;#34;one day after shaving&amp;#34; feeling of hair growth with this.</li>
            <li>I like that you can remove the head to clean it after you are done.  </li>
            <li>I will be hesitant to take it apart to clean it again, even so.</li>
            <li>Clean up takes me about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>I was diligent to clean the shaver as directed after each use, and to keep the protective plastic cap on.</li>
            <li>It is convenient to use, recharge, and clean.  </li>
            <li>glad I ordered this one and amazing enough</li>
            <li>It works great using it dry.</li>
            <li>The razor come apart so you can replace the razor and to clean it.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t expect a squeaky clean shave...</li>
            <li>Also it took FOREVER to get one clean shaven spot.</li>
            <li>Wet use is better but still not as good as I like.</li>
            <li>If it is good enough for their smooth, curvy, tender faces</li>
            <li>Eazy to use and eazy to clean.</li>
            <li>I clean it and charge it often and have never had an issue.  </li>
            <li>that you can take a tissue and clean out.</li>
            <li>I get to clean it.</li>
            <li>I use it and enjoy having it around when I just need a quick shave without hoping in the shower</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend the Noxema bikini razors to clean things up</li>
            <li>Charges quickly, provides a smooth shave, the trim tool works well.</li>
            <li>, it looks like a clean shave (just doesn&#x27;t feel that way).  </li>
            <li>I bought it after reading the mixed reviews but so far it is an excellent shaver.</li>
            <li>My old one leaves me nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend anyone buying this, it&#x27;s great in the shower or dry...</li>
            <li>and it gave a clean close shave on my legs and my underarms.</li>
            <li>I followed the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations on how to keep it clean after each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great for a dry close shave.  </li>
            <li>Would love for someone to make a women&#x27;s electric shaver that really does give that close, smooth, shave that we all want.</li>
            <li>Make sure you charge the shaver for a FULL 24 HOURS before first use.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even bother with the dry route, or you won&#x27;t be happy.  </li>
            <li>Works cleanly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>I use it for dry shaving and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>and it has worked very nicely, but its long term quality is still to be tested.</li>
            <li>I purchased it based on the many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>There are so many positive points of this product.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>When it died I was happy to find the exact same one available.</li>
            <li>While true that this razor does not shave quite as close as a non-electric triple razor might, it still works great dry shaving in a hurry or in the shower splashing on lots of shave lotion.</li>
            <li>The quality looks really good and the way the head foils float and pivot seems to keep it on the skin better than other shavers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Good for quick shave if I&#x27;m not caring about how smooth I&#x27;m going to feel and only about how hair-free</li>
            <li>Will use my razor for special occasions.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this shaver.</li>
            <li>and sometimes it injure specially when  when the battery low&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The special attachment pulls the hair.</li>
            <li>And boy was I right!</li>
            <li>Bought for my wife for convenience and portability, works great, keeps charge for along time, charges quickly, works as well in shower or dry..</li>
            <li>I get a clean shave, of course not like a razor, but still very good for times when it&#x27;s not easy or practical to jump in the shower or stick your legs in the sink or use shave creams or jells.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t like typical electric razors that kind of pull the hair as it shaves, it&#x27;s painless and I love that!</li>
            <li>For the first few months, the shaver worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>This product worked great for the first two times but on my third use it started pinching my skin, grabbing and pulling the hair on my bikini line...</li>
            <li>Great that you can get it wet and not have to worry about it.  </li>
            <li>When it would no longer work, I have gone thru a lot of different brands and models of shaver and have never found one that work like the first one, until now, this is a great shaver.</li>
            <li>I am STOKED to use this in the summer because though it does not give you as close of a shave as a normal razor it keeps your legs visibly smooth with zero irritation, which is all you need most of the time for wearing shorts and stuff.</li>
            <li>The amount of time I save from not having to do the old routine is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Been buying same for yrs good.</li>
            <li>Also, it does not do a good job of removing all hairs, especially around the knee area.</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor quite some time ago but waited to write a review until I had used it enough times to give it a fair rating.  </li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s a good shaver for a last minute shave on the rush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product that promises what it delivers, I don&#x27;t expect it to shave like a traditional razor because it&#x27;s not one!  </li>
            <li>but I suppose good enough.</li>
            <li>Its a cool idea</li>
            <li>While this is clearly better than the Clio (that is not saying much.  </li>
            <li>I thought nothing would be good as a regular razor on my legs, but this one works just as well.</li>
            <li>The product literally does not function as it should without a close to full charge, which should not be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend getting a men&#x27;s shaver if you want the full experience.  </li>
            <li>And yes, it is cool how water immersible it is.  </li>
            <li>If you are mowing the entire field, it should be good for that purpose, but if you want to hedge with ease, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I recommend the extremely cheap but useful</li>
            <li>It kind of hurt to use on my under-arms, but I have sensitive under-arms.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;ll never be as smooth as a razor shave, but it&#x27;s SO worth it to not have to deal with the razor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once, it doesn&#x27;t get close like a razor on your legs, but it does good enough for the bikini area</li>
            <li>it is good enough for our legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>liked the old one also and didn&#x27;t want to change brands.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this has been a good purchase for me.</li>
            <li>Good product, I personally don&#x27;t like the pivoting head</li>
            <li>I bought because it was Panasonic and had good reviews on various websites.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>but overall this is a good razor.  </li>
            <li>It definitely hasn&#x27;t saved me time and it hasn&#x27;t given me good shave once</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work out, but after two months I can&#x27;t give it any more chances.</li>
            <li>Overall its a good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>wish I would have never bought this....will trash this and go back to the good ol razor and shaving cream</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut or nick skin and is kind to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Thankfully it is a straight handle, which is important for someone who is ambidextrous!</li>
            <li>Not as good as my former Remington shaver.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t alert you when it has reached a full charge.</li>
            <li>At this point, it was taking a good ten minutes just to shave about a couple of square inches of skin, so I cast it aside and returned to Venus.</li>
            <li>the wife loved her Christmas present.</li>
            <li>Not as close as a blade razor but good enough if you&#x27;re not picky about being picky</li>
            <li>She believes it to be the finest ladies razor produced and thanks to Amazon.com for their many offerings with the consumer always in mind.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>good enough for shaving legs, under arms and face.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;WET/DRY&amp;#34; claim is also true; I&#x27;ve used it in and out of the shower, even dropped it once onto a tile floor</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a good value and does the job well enough for me.</li>
            <li>Very Dissapointed in this process of replacing the razor that I truly love.</li>
            <li>thank sweet baby Jesus for guys that know about knives and stuff..  </li>
            <li>thank sweet baby Jesus for guys that know about knives and stuff.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I go over the hairs, in what direction, how much pressure I use -</li>
            <li>and I was still able to get a really close shave.</li>
            <li>We returned it with full refund and bought another.  </li>
            <li>It works when you need it and for the money was a overall good buy.</li>
            <li>considering I bought this because it had such good reviews.</li>
            <li>I used to have a Remington (cord plug in) and loved it, had it for close to 10 years and the end of the plug got a short in it.  </li>
            <li>I tried to replace it with the same model but couldn&#x27;t find it, so I bought another Remington assuming it would be just as good.  </li>
            <li>Good enough for me.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cost a lot, that&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>Good basic razor.  </li>
            <li>I only have one good power outlet in my bathroom, and this interferes with plugging in my blowdryer.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The price is not bad</li>
            <li>Gets the job done, not a bad product.</li>
            <li>I did not get scraped up, I didn&#x27;t get any irritation, and I have VERY sensitive skin that reddens very easily.</li>
            <li>I did not get scraped up, I didn&#x27;t get any irritation, and I have VERY sensitive skin that reddens very easily.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a new electric razor and not having any success in stores (all they had were the kind that yanks the hair out).  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic Wed Dry Lady Shaver is by far the BEST shaver I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li>However, I get used to the sound very quickly, and since the shave is shorter, it doesn&#x27;t have to be on for very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re a first time electric razor buyer, I strongly recommend this razor to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bikini attachment is very useful and the entire head assembly is easy to use, easy to disassemble for cleaning, and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bikini attachment is one of the other reasons I chose this shaver, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>i always read other peoples reviews before buying and it has worked out great.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works great.  </li>
            <li>and it worked fine when i first started using it.</li>
            <li>that said, I have really enjoyed this electric razor and I mostly use it for times when I don&#x27;t want to spend the time using a regular razor with shaving cream..  </li>
            <li>Although it is more convenient to have an electric razor, it seems like I need to shave more often than with a regular razor.</li>
            <li>or when you just need a quick shave.</li>
            <li>job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beret looses it charge quickly, and over time, it worsens.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It actually gives you a nice, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>shavers wound up in the trash too quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is my quick go between</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a super close shave though, maybe try something else.</li>
            <li>It is what I would consider adequate.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a razor for quick shaves without having to use shaving cream or use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It charges quickly and holds the charge well.  </li>
            <li>Is adequate for the money.  </li>
            <li>No, it isn&#x27;t super close</li>
            <li>After about a month it didn&#x27;t work as well and would die quickly.</li>
            <li>The razor is adequate.  </li>
            <li>After researching several types, I decided on the Panasonic ES2216PC for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;She thinks its awesome and has been using it for several years now.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Fast and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The product charges quickly and lasts for about 5 days of continuous use.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s more quiet than most.</li>
            <li>It trimming blade catches and pulls hair, and the blades dulled quickly.  </li>
            <li>Was looking for something to use for quick touchups between blade shaves.  </li>
            <li>of course if you take a super close look, u will still see it .</li>
            <li>Luckily I tried mixing water now</li>
            <li>and he also uses it on a daily basis to keep his pubic area nice and smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SO darned quick</li>
            <li>You have to almost scrap it along your skin, mind you hold your skin taunt, and go over the same area in many directions, many times.</li>
            <li>This is a must if you want to quickly shave without water.</li>
            <li>So much better than my older shaver.  </li>
            <li>It gives a super close shave on my legs, underarms and bikini area.  </li>
            <li>Got this because I&#x27;m pregnant and shaving areas</li>
            <li>The pivoting head is super and I also use &amp; like the bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and very versatile because you can use it in or out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I felt the older model worked better</li>
            <li>the item did come in quick.</li>
            <li>I like the product for a quick shave of my legs.</li>
            <li>I use it when I&#x27;m on the run for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li>I have used an electric razor for many years, and have struggled to find a decent one.</li>
            <li>(Because it is quick to use and can be used dry).&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Okay so I bought this razor after finding out that I am HIGHLY allergic to nickel.</li>
            <li>Uses it dry and it is quick and easy, and gives a pretty good shave, according to her.</li>
            <li>It has a nice long reach and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i am very pleased not only with this purchase, but with the customer service of the seller as well!</li>
            <li>The wet/dry feature is nice, and the swivel top is really the big selling point of this shaver.</li>
            <li>It worked great, except for the battery charge (instead of 12 hours, it lasted on average 45 minutes per charge).</li>
            <li>I use it instead of a normal razor if I&#x27;m in a hurry and just want to make sure I have no visible hair.</li>
            <li>this is my second one I purchased and Ali am very pleased</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, i use it to shave my beard also ;)</li>
            <li>And then the very first time I used it, the button to lift the pop up trimmer broke.  </li>
            <li>(This happened the very first time I used it, so it wasn&#x27;t because it hadn&#x27;t been cleaned).</li>
            <li>I when back to the Panasonic and am very satisfied</li>
            <li>This Panasonic shaves as close as my old Lady Remington did and is far superior to the Lady Remington shavers available today.</li>
            <li>I have used older Panasonic shavers and really thought they provided a nice close shave and lasted long(1 year) for the price($30).</li>
            <li>if your looking for an easy fast way to get a super ravor like shave not the product for you.</li>
            <li>Does a decent shave job, nowhere near a razor&#x27;s closeness, but when I don&#x27;t want to stand in the shower for 30 minutes, this shaver is good.</li>
            <li>Good for a quick dry shave, doesn&#x27;t work well in the shower.</li>
            <li>A product with that many good reviews means it is liked, and is a decent enough design to hold its own against the more expensive electric razors out there.</li>
            <li>Cost more to replace the head than buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I would like to see Panasonic come out with a new model of this product with better battery technology.  </li>
            <li>I am new to electric shavers but I am pleased with how this performs.  </li>
            <li>I am new to the electric razor thing,but It works just ok in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I primarily bought it for the bikini area (which I usually wax) and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I had a Remington that did great but battery died less than a year.</li>
            <li>It shaves very close for an electric shaver, and the design makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>Long story short its great !</li>
            <li>I just tried this shaver using it dry on my legs and trimming up my strip of pubic hair and loved the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used a couple of times and seems to do a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s excellent for eliminating visible hairs but does FEEL a tad prickly with my dense dark natural hair.</li>
            <li>The moving head makes it easy to use and very efficient.</li>
            <li>Easy to have charged up and ready any time.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and works really well.</li>
            <li>Have used this shaver for quite a while now - cleans easy, holds a charge and shaves really well without pinching or causing redness.</li>
            <li>It allows you to keep the shaver easily within reach and ready to go.</li>
            <li>Shave as good in shower as dry...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s gentle and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The shaver still works fine with one side, but since I love it so much, I want to get a new one.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m ever going to give another female a gift, you better believe it&#x27;s going to be one of these jammies!</li>
            <li>Be aware of the return policy!</li>
            <li>this is exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>All said, it is a much earned 5 stars!!</li>
            <li>when I first got it!  </li>
            <li>was excellent, far less than retail stores.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price, accurate description, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use, light weight, however I do prefer the old fashioned &amp;#34;plug type shavers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>original intention was to have something handy for a quick decent-ish dry shave.</li>
            <li>It does such a great job that you really can use it every-other-day and still stay nice and smooth down there</li>
            <li>This is a great little shaver for an electric.  </li>
            <li>I set out in search of a product that worked great, and found this little beauty.</li>
            <li>Finally a Shaver that doesnot pull, miss fine hairs and most of all does not leave me flapping my arms when I shave my underarms.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very fast when the battery is full</li>
            <li>I love the curve of the handle it makes shaving in certain areas of the body much easier.</li>
            <li>I loved it when it worked, but it was so much of a hassle (buying three razors in a row with the same exact problem, sheesh!)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but overall I found it easy to use, not too loud, effective, and travel friendly.</li>
            <li>She says it is comfortable to use and performs very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something I would use if I didn&#x27;t have time to shave with a razor before going to the gym, but not if I really wanted my legs to feel smooth.</li>
            <li>was the highest end model available at the time and has been working very well for over 5 years.  </li>
            <li>was the highest end model available at the time and has been working very well for over 5 years.  </li>
            <li>and I prefer a really close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The shave is great, but just expect to do it almost everyday.</li>
            <li>It worked great in the beginning, but then after a few months it would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It is great for the winter when you don&#x27;t want to shave everyday.</li>
            <li>it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Try this razor, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>it works far better than I thought an electric one would.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor before, so I have no comparison, but so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have not had as much success with my legs.  </li>
            <li>Not at all useful, I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think you&#x27;ll find the plastic is far more</li>
            <li>the cost of this shaver, but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>just so I feel that I get some of my moneys worth out of it.</li>
            <li>bought it as a gift for my mom, as an elderly customer she seems satisfied with her shaver, don&#x27;t know much about how much detail and&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>also bought an epilator to do my legs so that I won&#x27;t have to shave as often, but I plan on keeping this for my more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Actually would have liked a razor that you could use with or without a cord but couldn&#x27;t find one.</li>
            <li>The best way to get the closest possible shave is (as another reviewer noted) pulling your skin taut and wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>the bickini attachment isn&#x27;t really worth it.</li>
            <li>I got the Braun Silk Epil: twice the price but a million times worth it.</li>
            <li>To test it out, I used it on a small area on my arm and it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver&#x27;s swiveling head is useful because it moves with the curve of the leg.</li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised by how close it is able to get.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the shaver and the extra components that come with it because they are helpful as well if you ever decide to use them! :)</li>
            <li>The top of the box has the adapter that plugs directly into the shaver.  </li>
            <li>Also, for those of us who are no longer young (i.e., thin-skinned), this is a gentle and effective alternative.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get nearly as close as I&#x27;d like, and I have cut myself more times than I can count.</li>
            <li>Overall the razor is nice, sensitive to my skin, and works well for the most part.  </li>
            <li>It seems like my old one that bit the dust was much better.</li>
            <li>, I believe it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>You can take it through security at the airport (which has come in handy multiple times), and you don&#x27;t have to jump in the shower in order to shave when you are running out of time.  </li>
            <li>So my razer wins over the split between my wife and daughter.</li>
            <li>Old one worked better.</li>
            <li>Stays charged for several uses and the pop-up feature is nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it shaves much better than my old shaver (which was not a Panasonic).</li>
            <li>and it is worth</li>
            <li>This razor is not as good as I expected.  </li>
            <li>So far I have been really pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>electric shaver has been worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The blade is spining and not cutting.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with quality - close shave and holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The pivoting head and multiple blades seem to have been nicely designed with a woman&#x27;s needs in mind.  </li>
            <li>and it is still by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It plugs directly into the wall and the shaver sits on top of it</li>
            <li>but SO FAR it&#x27;s better than this model.</li>
            <li>The razor works okay, as far as electric shavers go.</li>
            <li>I rarely take time to write reviews</li>
            <li>It is handy for last min shaving.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Kind of reminds me of how it feels the day after I shave when the hair just starts to grow back.</li>
            <li>It was worth it.  </li>
            <li>but it sure does not beat my old fashion blade and shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price</li>
            <li>Never had an electric razor work worth a hoot and this one just followed suit.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I love this because I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and that makes my ROI so incredibly worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It shaves so close to the skin, it feels like I had a fresh waxing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a powerful tool that does the job well.</li>
            <li>and I liked it enough to get</li>
            <li>only thing I liked about this shaver was how well it did on my underarms.  </li>
            <li>Because is isn&#x27;t as powerful as the Remington, it is gentler on more sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t catch.  </li>
            <li>I believe this would be a wonderful purchase for anyone who is tired of razor blade cuts .  </li>
            <li>The convenient wall charger is nice to save counter space, and it allows her to have it charged and ready at all times, because my young daughter will use it sometimes also.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t shave worth a lick.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the closeness and shaving action on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the closeness and shaving action on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I had a old Panasonic electric and this one is so much better.</li>
            <li>I love it and plan to order another one for my 16 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>Product is OK but not made as well as my old Panasonic model that this replaced.</li>
            <li>Actually useful unlike the Remington model.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After picking this one, I can say that my old one was much better.</li>
            <li>Worth the investment.</li>
            <li>This one was in the right price range, had good reviews and didn&#x27;t have a whole of extra fancy nonsense.</li>
            <li>Wish it could take full range input (90V-240V) - That would have made it clutter free and easy to use internationally.</li>
            <li>The shaver does a pretty good job, but not as close a shave as I would like when dry.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver 2 months and a half months ago and it worked great for the first two months.  </li>
            <li>As other reviews mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t really give a super-smooth shave, but if that isn&#x27;t important to you, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>Evidently the blades don&#x27;t stay sharp forever, but while they are new, they really work great!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it is any better than most other e-shavers.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older my body hair has gotten sparser and it was always rather fine</li>
            <li>Please understand that this is just my opinion (which is worth about as much as a fart in the wind), but for the cost, it is certainly worth trying!</li>
            <li>This shaver is worth every penny, it shaves clean and leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I can no longer use a regular razor due to health problems, and this shaver was the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li>I am used to being able to take shavers apart to clean them and then put them back together.  </li>
            <li>I would give this five stars, but the extendable trimmer collects hair quite easily making it less effective.</li>
            <li>with a good charge the razor works well and it will last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>Keeping it, due to its good price and blade but with a grudge</li>
            <li>I read all the other reviews on how good this razor was.</li>
            <li>Very user friendly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found any other shaver that can do as good.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know of any shining examples of other shavers that work well and offer good customer service in this price range...</li>
            <li>Right?  </li>
            <li>to this i was always fighting with disposable shavers that never did the job right but since owning this-</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>Worked right out of box without charging.  </li>
            <li>she was right</li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>Right out of the package, I turned it on.</li>
            <li>right at the outlet</li>
            <li>I also like the charger that does not require any cords, but plugs right into the outlet.  </li>
            <li>And when you&#x27;re all done, the shaver rests on a convenient charging system which plugs right into the wall, vertically or horizontally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used it right away</li>
            <li>Received it right on time and used it right out of the box.</li>
            <li>With the shaving gel I use, it glides right over my skin and takes my unwanted hair off.</li>
            <li>i tried it and she is right.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t be from foil dullness since it started happening right out of the box.</li>
            <li>So now it doesn&#x27;t plug in right unless I balance it just so...</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s absolutely right.</li>
            <li>Husband pointed it out right away.</li>
            <li>I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>no longer give reviews right away because I have found that with time the products either change or my opinion does</li>
            <li>I like it that I can use it right after shower.</li>
            <li>Have used the shaver several times and am delighted with it - shaves closely, smoothly, quietly and (very important) gently - would recommend to all.</li>
            <li>This product was great for the first few months.</li>
            <li>For the first few times, it was great.</li>
            <li>After this first use, it was clear I would not be satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it as a bikini trimmer and it&#x27;s great for that, but as a shaver it&#x27;s not ideal.</li>
            <li>It gave a nice close shave when used dry, and the bikini-attachment worked well for a nice short trim.</li>
            <li>I love this razor, works great wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Even if I have to go back and forth once or twice to get a good close shave (I understand that is normal for electric razors?), I do not suffer razor rash at all.</li>
            <li>Grandma&#x27;s was a replacement for her old Remington &amp; Grand Daughters her first shaver.  </li>
            <li>They work well, are very easy to clean, and above all, maintain a reasonable price coming from a manufacturer like Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and tend to easily get ingrown hairs, so this product has been a blessing for me.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and no back pain when I finished.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold while shaving and the head moves up and down nicely on your legs.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box did not cut just grabed hair very pain full.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been less than impressed with the overall results.</li>
            <li>The design is comfortable and easy to hold at the proper angle.  </li>
            <li>The unit is light and cordless, making it easy to manipulate for underarm and back of legs, etc.,</li>
            <li>Pick either wet or dry and be impressed, but don&#x27;t try &#x27;damp&#x27; shaving, it doesn&#x27;t do as well.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something that I could use quickly in the morning, but it takes more time then they regular razor.</li>
            <li>The shaver is quiet and does okay for a quick shave.  </li>
            <li>First of all, shipping was quick, and I found this product to be exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this fresh out of the box, I was amazed.</li>
            <li>I am so happy there is no more water, shaving cream involved.</li>
            <li>This electric shaver/razor does a pretty good job compared to any other form of hair removal, once you come to terms with the fact that you&#x27;ll never get that weird-kicking-the-sheets close shave that you get with your draw-the-blood razorblade.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair (still hairy) and very sensitive skins.  </li>
            <li>Very positive experience with this razor, the first electric women&#x27;s shaver we ever bought.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a way to remove all of the hair \\&quot;down there\\&quot; but couldn&#x27;t find a good option.  </li>
            <li>I will only work on very fine hair, like hair that has never been cut before.</li>
            <li>Device is exactly what I expected, Easy to use, love it</li>
            <li>Very pleased with how this razor gives a nice close shave wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>When I come here to order new blades, I see they are no longer available.</li>
            <li>There was no irritaion and there certainly was no pain at all!</li>
            <li>Seems easy to clean and take apart/put back together.</li>
            <li>I had used this razor previously and knew it was a good product.  </li>
            <li>As far as electronic shavers go, they are never as good as regular blade razors.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is very quiet compared to the old one and does a good job of shaving.  </li>
            <li>so I thought it would be a good replacement, however it does nothing near what regular shaving can do.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have the option to shave dry.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that I can use it dry and also like  that it  fits a woman&#x27;s hands nicely.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean with simple instructions&lt;</li>
            <li>Easy to clean with simple instructions&lt;</li>
            <li>Gentle and quick.  </li>
            <li>I previously had a Conair razor which I loved</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice razor, but my only concern is that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t really give a close shave.</li>
            <li>shower gel did, I liked that I could use it dry</li>
            <li>Cleaning the razor is easy and it isn&#x27;t too loud while you are using it.  </li>
            <li>It is easy on the skin in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Actually it&#x27;s the 2nd one I have owned, the 1st one lasted me 30 years so getting one without a cord was great.  </li>
            <li>She had previously tried my Panasonic men&#x27;s shaver and loved it, so that&#x27;s why I decided to buy her an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>The unit is quiet, easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li>and I was able to get better coverage that way, but even so there are a few it just can&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li>The transaction was fast and easy and would highly recommend to friends,</li>
            <li>The pivoting head is not in any way useful, didn&#x27;t seem to make any positive difference.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s also pink, love it!).</li>
            <li>She likes it so much she insisted on having a second one to have handy for travel and, worried that something might happened to the first one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this one for 6 months, but not to long ago, I bought another one, the &amp;#34;Cleancut PS335 T-Shape Personal shaver&amp;#34; and I think that is more effective than the panasonic.</li>
            <li>I actually previously bought this item for my daughter, and loved it so much that i had to buy one for myself!</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my wife who is very picky about her razor (pretty bold on my part).  </li>
            <li>Product has nice design for easy handling,even for small ladies hands.</li>
            <li>I have had exceptional experience with Panasonic products, and have, in other reviews, lauded their cameras and Men&#x27;s razor, pointing to this item as a better option than the Clio based on the reviews on this site (and having owned an earlier model in this line).  </li>
            <li>You can rinse it after a few strokes just like a regular razor, but the best way is to remove the top to rinse so that&#x27;s an extra step -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, as promised.  </li>
            <li>I received the item in one day which was so very fast.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>I like this razor very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle</li>
            <li>It was a gift to the wife and she enjoys it very much.  </li>
            <li>However, it&amp;iexcl;¦s very fast and convenient.</li>
            <li>I have very light hair on my legs and not coarse.</li>
            <li>MY wife likes this shaver very much</li>
            <li>Even tho you won&#x27;t get silky smooth legs, like with a razor, it does a great job and in less time than traditional shaving.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a blind friend with sensitive skin and diabetes and she is very happy with the product and said that is was easy to set up and is performing well.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, it is very easy to clean and is rechargeable, so for that it gets a positive spin.</li>
            <li>the ease of use or that a remarkable product cost so little!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as close a shave as a razor, consider it leaving a fine sandpaper feel versus a slick feel, but fine sandpaper is good enough for me!</li>
            <li>It holds the charge long and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to get a good shave</li>
            <li>Love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it wet, in fact the instructions say to run it under water to clean it.</li>
            <li>Not enough of a clean smooth cut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used it in the shower, but in dry conditions it&#x27;s somewhat comfortable and easy to operate and maintain.</li>
            <li>While it worked alright, this works better, particularly on finer hairs, and the sensitive knee areas.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty old Norelco rotary shaver that still work fine.</li>
            <li>So, though the smoothness of my legs may last for fewer days as compared to a razor shave, it is quick and easy to shave again.  </li>
            <li>It has a small footprint, making it better for travel than most, BUT I use it primarily at home (and would think that most other people do as well).  </li>
            <li>To be honest, you can never get as close a shave as a regular shaver using a gel, bath soap or moisturizer but this certainly gives you a VERY CLOSE SHAVE.  </li>
            <li>I could have just bought a replacement top, but instead bought a new shaver and tried many other brands.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m married............</li>
            <li>My first Panasonic shaver lasted 10 years.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what was specified.  </li>
            <li>For medical reasons I will no longer be able to use a blade</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if they don&#x27;t want anyone to be able to open the product.</li>
            <li>I finally feel like a woman again! :-)</li>
            <li>But overall  pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This is my first electronic shaver</li>
            <li>Then today is the first time I ever used an electric razor in my 40</li>
            <li>first thing I wish to say to everyone complaining about an electric razor not being as close as a blade.</li>
            <li>I had to go over most areas multiple times.</li>
            <li>After a more than a week of using this shaver I sent it back to Amazon for a refund.</li>
            <li>Now, no electric shaver will cut as close as a blade, but this comes pretty close.</li>
            <li>Now I have put it in a drawer and will most likely throw it in trash in a couple years.  </li>
            <li>i get a pretty close shave with it.</li>
            <li>It shaves pretty close</li>
            <li>i must say i just used this shaver for the first time</li>
            <li>Exactly like in the picture, with about a 1.5\\&quot; box below it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I will continue to use this product, and will most likely not find a need for a blade-razor again!!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter as a first razor.</li>
            <li>I bought my wife her first electric razor about 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Her favorite used a chemical solution to rinse out the razor, but sadly, it only lasted 1 1/2 years before failing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a regular razor but it is more convenient.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s what I tried first.  </li>
            <li>Much better than my last electric razor.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor, so I have nothing to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor that I have ever brought.</li>
            <li>I am still using it from the first charge from when I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I was able to continue use for a short time like that, but then it started tearing my skin.</li>
            <li>I still use it here and there, but it&#x27;s not my first choice for hair removal.</li>
            <li>This is my first ever wet/dry shaver</li>
            <li>If you order this item, opt for the higher priced model, I wish I had.</li>
            <li>If one of my nieces takes it, I&#x27;ll order the higher priced model.</li>
            <li>The charge doesn&#x27;t last for more than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>The whole point of an electric razor for me is to save time, so this is going to have to go!</li>
            <li>The head is larger and pivots more.  </li>
            <li>The head is larger and pivots more.  </li>
            <li>surprised me by how smooth, painless this one works, after my first use!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>My first electric was a Remington.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well in lieu of shaving with a \\&quot;real\\&quot; razor.  </li>
            <li>so I was hesitant to use or buy it at first</li>
            <li>The product works much better as a hair trimmer than an actual razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I only paid $26 bucks for it.hair guard (bikini attachment).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I only paid $26 bucks for it.</li>
            <li>Okay for last minute shaves when I wasn&#x27;t expecting to show any leg.</li>
            <li>First one was June 2011, then this one in December 2011.</li>
            <li>With the first I thought it was my fault, by letting my guy shave his face with it a couple of times before it started pulling.</li>
            <li>It runs out of juice FAST!</li>
            <li>You have to go over the same spot many times to get all of the hairs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>When I first got this shaver a couple years ago, I hadn&#x27;t had an electric shaver before.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother getting a replacement until a couple weeks ago, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t replace it with the same shaver.</li>
            <li>I also used it on the bikini area but keep in mind that I trimmed first and then shaved.</li>
            <li>My big idea was to be able to shave out of the shower b/c</li>
            <li>Of course a razor has better results that last longer too.</li>
            <li>First you think it might just need adjust since it has 3 levels of height.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of time to shave, but I don&#x27;t have to shave very often, so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a seasoned user of electric shavers, and this is at the bottom of the heap.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions and allowed the shaver to fully charge before the first use.  </li>
            <li>This is the first out of hundreds of products I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon that I am unsatisfied with.</li>
            <li>Definitely looking for a better one...</li>
            <li>No nicks, and you can do it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware that the batteries are crappy, and not replaceable on this model.</li>
            <li>First one lasted 5 months -</li>
            <li>My first electric at 60</li>
            <li>It sure beats constantly buying batteries though!</li>
            <li>My first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>yes, this shaver is noisy, much louder than the ES2207P, so don&#x27;t plan on using it in the library!</li>
            <li>This shaver holds its charge well and has never failed me.</li>
            <li>After all, it&#x27;s not the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is easy to clean and is holding up well even to minor abuse.  </li>
            <li>really like that this electric razor is fully immersible so that I can use it in the shower!</li>
            <li>takes many passes to get a &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; shave with coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I will go over and over the same spot many times trying to cut a hair it missed</li>
            <li>but this is the first time I wrote a review.</li>
            <li>I t shaves pretty close.</li>
            <li>In recent years they have redesigned their product and I have not been completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Would probably work better on coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different options including exfoliating creams, scrubs, waxing, and laser hair removal</li>
            <li>If I spend more time shaving my legs with a regular razor then maybe this would work.</li>
            <li>The first lasted 14 months.</li>
            <li>--there was always hair left on my legs and the bikini trimmer wasn&#x27;t much better.</li>
            <li>Very versatile and useful for them.[[ASIN:B000G0GW6K Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver with Bikini Attachment, Mauve]]</li>
            <li>After first use it fell(of course).</li>
            <li>The shave is close and makes the leg feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It does cut the hair pretty darn close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wish they wouldn&#x27;t plug the charger in my office, the pink glow is kind of distracting.</li>
            <li>but it gets pretty close.</li>
            <li>My first shaver in years</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>First I have ever used with a pivoting head.</li>
            <li>I had given up on electric razors years ago as not being able to shave close enough.</li>
            <li>, I wanted to do my research first.</li>
            <li>I will pay more attention to next time.</li>
            <li>Be aware that it doesn&#x27;t get rid of all the stubble-</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>although  you do have to hold it to keep it on the shaving head - but is does a very close &amp; painless job!</li>
            <li>I thought that was pretty soon for time to replace blades etc.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first shaver that cut so close</li>
            <li>Overall I&amp;iexcl;¦m satisfied, but probably will by men&amp;iexcl;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for exactly 5 months now.</li>
            <li>It does not give razor burn and is great on delicate skin.</li>
            <li>I love this Razor, Just wish it would last, Have purchased two and they both died.  </li>
            <li>It works like a charm and gives me a pretty close shave, despite it being an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge a long time and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>My daughter really likes it!</li>
            <li>The first one I gave to him</li>
            <li>Thanks alot!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x60;s a pretty close shave , in fact.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is designed pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>but it comes pretty close.  </li>
            <li>Very time consuming but for me it was worth the result</li>
            <li>First hold your skin taunt because this puppy bites and if it gets a ahold of you, there will be blood.</li>
            <li>I fuss with this one for ususally 20-30 minutes for the same results and a lot more redness.</li>
            <li>So I looked online at reviews - should have done that first-</li>
            <li>Many posters have mentioned that this is &#x27;only&#x27; if your leg hair is longer than 1/4 inch.  </li>
            <li>I have searched and tried many different ones</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still operating exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience</li>
            <li>/&gt;Opinion - It did an OK job of shaving my legs, it always left a bit of stubble</li>
            <li>Having owned several women&#x27;s rechargeable shavers - a couple which didn&#x27;t hold up or perform well, my wife has been highly satisfied with the PANASONIC ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver.  </li>
            <li>More often than not, I&#x27;d get outside and find all sorts of hair that was missed.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t know exactly what to expect.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the razor, but I like it well enough that I will keep it until it dies and try another brand.</li>
            <li>It hurt and left too many hairs.</li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as even the most basic disposable razor.</li>
            <li>First, as wet/dry shaver goes for us ladies, this one is pretty great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Take it slow and you&#x27;ll be happy with the results.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t pleased and sent mine back (and I never return anything).  </li>
            <li>**) and recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i only say is that i love it</li>
            <li>My first one lasted about 4 hours.</li>
            <li>the first one i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure I&#x27;m going back to the shaver</li>
            <li>Have used one of these for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Really, it is like a battery operated toy razor!  </li>
            <li>Its my first time using an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still working like it did when I first got it.</li>
            <li>It gives a close shave  next to a razor ..you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>It is a fairly close shave on the legs (not totally smooth but no visible hairs).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the razor, but I like it well enough that I will keep it until it dies and try another brand.ng your leg pretty fast, and you don&#x27;t have to pay that much attention, so it goes quickly.</li>
            <li>the super high end men&#x27;s razors might offer that</li>
            <li>So far, I am completely satisfied with my new Panasonic Shaver.  </li>
            <li>I was completely surprised at how much I love using this new shaver...</li>
            <li>I think that shaving with this razor actually takes longer than just shaving with a regular razor in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this razor is that it is okay to use both wet &amp; dry which makes it very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It does not provide as close a shave as a razor, but it is so easy and quick that I don&#x27;t mind using it more frequently than a conventional razor.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, close shave, quiet, not a lot of vibration, and quick.  </li>
            <li>trimmer works especially well before the electric shaver for a smooth result quickly without skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>trimmer works especially well before the electric shaver for a smooth result quickly without skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>Will probably use this dry most of the time, and while blade shaves will always be smoother, this is perfectly useful for what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Have used this shaver dry for 3 weeks and enjoy its close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The weight of it can make the plug in come out of the wall easily for the charger, so my suggestion for buyers is to find a plug in where it won&#x27;t get bumped as its is top heavy.</li>
            <li>I mean I am a fairly intelligent person who read all the directions and literally no hair comes out when I use it.</li>
            <li>I chose this shaver after reading reviews of several electric shavers online, and this one had the most positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Shaving head is a little large, but does follow body fairly well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really get the purpose of the bikini attachment but other than that I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I owned a Panasonic previously ( years ago) and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The men&#x27;s razor was still great, but shaving was taking too long, especially for longer hairs and large areas.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The men&#x27;s razor was still great, but shaving was taking too long, especially for longer hairs and large areas.  </li>
            <li>My legs look better and I have been enjoying wearing dresses at least once a week for the first time in my life</li>
            <li>I am a shaving cream and razor kind of gal but due to some health issues I needed to buy a ladies shaver.  </li>
            <li>I bought the same shaver again, thinking that whatever broke was just a fluke and that the new shaver would be just as wonderful as it had been for the first few months.</li>
            <li>It looks a bit large and clunky, but is actually very gentle when using it.</li>
            <li>I have only had it for a few days but have used it in all body areas and it does a very good job.</li>
            <li>The shaver is more than adequate for the legs but not for underarm or other parts of the body.</li>
            <li>This really isn&#x27;t a *terrible* shaver (it does cut your hair!), but once you use a *great* shaver, you realize just how incredibly SUB-PAR this one is.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, reasonably quiet, and gives a closer shave than I expected, given that I have only used it dry and using shaving gel and water is recommended for the best results.</li>
            <li>But any men&#x27;s model should be fine, they appear to all be engineered to a higher standard than the women&#x27;s model - it&#x27;s not necessary to buy the top of the line, and I found the charging station superfluous after a year or</li>

            <li>Failed rather quickly, and while it worked, results were far from the best.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t think i&#x27;d like the guard for trimming, but i actually rather enjoyed how much easier it made shaping everything up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s close enough in most areas - the areas that really matter - and didn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li>So far she seems to be enjoying it and has no complaints thus far.</li>
            <li>Although more expensive it works just as well and is a good replacement product.  </li>
            <li>Used the shaver 2 or 3 times and found it better than expected - well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this Panasonic shaver not only because it works well, but because it is gentle.</li>
            <li>It is, however, safer than a blade, so if you are willing to carry a certain amount of weight and bulk, this might be the answer.</li>
            <li>It is, however, safer than a blade, so if you are willing to carry a certain amount of weight and bulk, this might be the answer.</li>
            <li>but this shaver has a nice long handle and pivotal head that allows me to do just that without breaking the precautions that I have due to the surgery.  </li>
            <li>So nice to be able to use it wet or dry!  </li>
            <li>For someone with super sensitive skin, this shaver is a godsend!</li>
            <li>This one takes a few times to use it right, but once you get over the learning cure its amazing</li>
            <li>I wouldnt recommend it, i do recommend purchasing one that costs a little more and offers better performance.</li>
            <li>I decided on this shaver based on the positive reviews</li>
            <li>so after seeing positive reviews, ordered this model.</li>
            <li>I bought it after I read all the positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>About positive reviews....</li>
            <li>and it is a positive way for me to shave safley</li>
            <li>We did a lot of research when looking for a shaver and this one had a lot of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews and the positive track record I&#x27;ve had with Panasonic products, I went for it.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t give the product five stars simply because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a five star product I still think it&#x27;s about as good as you&#x27;ll get when it comes to ladies&#x27; wet dry shavers, which let&#x27;s be honest</li>
            <li>Great product, left my other one in Colorado on vacation</li>
            <li>So after a lot of research and a long hesitation to spend more again on shaving equipment, I purchased an Oster cordless hair trimmer (for dogs) and an Andis Outliner blade  </li>
            <li>So after a lot of research and a long hesitation to spend more again on shaving equipment, I purchased an Oster cordless hair trimmer (for dogs) and an Andis Outliner blade  </li>
            <li>He likes all that he has and his shopping process has been pretty straight forward.</li>
            <li>Much easier than a razor and hot water.</li>
            <li>First was for me and than one for my daughter-in-law  who is still telling me how much she loves it.  </li>
            <li>and it takes pretty much 24 hours to fully charge.  </li>
            <li>I started my tween shaving with this first to ease into the whole process.</li>
            <li>It still took me 2 passes to get a reasonably clean shave, and was not especially smooth or comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that could have been better (and the main reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars) is the charging method.</li>
            <li>Trying to find a decent razor designed for a woman is time consuming and tedious at best.</li>
            <li>but I am thrilled that I no longer have to apologize about my hairy legs when I have MRI&#x27;s and other tests!</li>
            <li>The pivot action of the head and the pop up trimmer are fabulous additions that I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Each time, the ES2216PC would work ok for a few months, but before long the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 1 or 2 shaves, and in general just seemed to underperform, not leaving my legs very smooth.  </li>
            <li>She barely used it in the winter and about every 3 days in the spring/summer due to having super fine hair on her legs (lucky!).  </li>
            <li>Nowhere as good as a plain razor, but decent.</li>
            <li>The first time over my legs I used a light touch and it left a bit of stubble.</li>
            <li>: It comes apart for easy cleaning and future replacement of blades.</li>
            <li>For anyone wanting a CLOSER shave, there are the masochistic epilators, or the one shaver which actually burns and removes the hair (for three easy payments of $$$...</li>
            <li>Luck.he masochistic epilators, or the one shaver which actually burns and removes the hair (for three easy payments of $$$...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be easy to break the shaver or the recharge unit, especially while it is charging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to shave better dry than wet&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now in the dry mode and love it.  </li>
            <li>I use it dry most often</li>
            <li>Shaving with an ordinary Gillette Venus is much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Being able to use it in the shower or dry when I&#x27;m in a hurry without any difference is what amazes me.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shave close enough and its not durable because it comes apart easily.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin in my bikini area and it just didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li>I found using shaving creams is still better than shaving completely dry as it will cut closer.</li>
            <li>hairs on my legs were short and spiky and should have been easy for a shaver to grasp, but this one did not work.  </li>
            <li>; easily and actually popped out on one occasion.</li>
            <li>The shaver has definitely come in handy for a quick dry shave</li>
            <li>Smoothest shave is with soap and water, but I&#x27;m content with dry shave most weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably my own fault from buying a Panisonic over the Lady Remington&#x27;s I&#x27;ve previously owned.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better if you have to quickly dry shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, cause have had many shavers over the years and using it dry is just my style.</li>
            <li>previous electric razor was a wet/dry Remington that I really liked and used for 3+ years, but I bought this one to replace it since it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore</li>
            <li>Better dry.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use,  shaves close enough, and stays charged as stated.</li>
            <li>Also, the charge held nicely when I first got it, but after a few months didn&#x27;t perform as well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This shaver has long battery life and shaves fairly close to a traditional razor.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a good replacement for my remington - not real happy with this one.  </li>
            <li>I was informed by the representative that I would need to e-mail my receipt to a certain department, which I did.  </li>
            <li>The head is rather large and not convenient on curves.  </li>
            <li>but you can certainly use it in the shower as well.</li>
            <li>The price of blades is exorbitant, and they&#x27;ve become so large that it&#x27;s become</li>
            <li>Too large.  </li>
            <li>fuzz\\&quot; women of a certain age get.  </li>
            <li>Pure torchure.  </li>
            <li>It is too large for bikini area trimming.</li>
            <li>: I didn&#x27;t want to recommend any particular men&#x27;s model, just that you buy a men&#x27;s electric razor instead, but due to popular demand, here is the model of men&#x27;s shaver I purchased:</li>

            <li>Oh and forget the days where I used a brand new razor!!</li>
            <li>The charge seems to last a long time, and it worked best with shaving cream while wet.</li>
            <li>not a super close shave, but great for bringing on short trips</li>
            <li>Does a great job either wet or dry.</li>
            <li>It does a good job for me - but I&#x27;ve only used it in the dry mode.  </li>
            <li>, i think it&#x27;s better on dry skin, but if you don&#x27;t have much time to shave and have to use it on the shower</li>
            <li>I realize that you&#x27;re not going to get the same kind of shave as a regular razor, but as someone who has extra sensitive skin everywhere, my time of using good old razors is at an end, particularly with summer approaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I used the razor the first time, it nicked my ankle area, but shaved the rest of my legs as well or better than other rechargeable ladies razors.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor back in June, and it was fine.</li>
            <li>After 1 year this razor simply doesn&#x27;t cut my fine hair anymore.</li>
            <li>It completely removed all of the hair and left it very smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It showed up yesterday in its nice little box.</li>
            <li>and I have been able to trim, but not able to shave it clean.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive areas are fine no cuts or rashes so far.....</li>
            <li>After using it for the first time, I wanted to clean it and hence was trying to open its outer foil.</li>
            <li>Works great on short hair, but when used on hair a little longer (1/2&amp;#34; or so)</li>
            <li>Holds a charge very well, takes up little counter space, and gives a nice shave.  </li>
            <li>Before if I wanted to wear shorts without little red irritation spots I had to do a rain dance, pray, massage my legs with peacock feathers, and hope that my skin was having a happy day.</li>
            <li>It does a good job shaving if you press hard.</li>
            <li>This works great, but need to be careful with handling, if it falls, it won&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
            <li>Perfect length and consistency, I was afraid it would end up patchy</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to start this process.  </li>
            <li>However, it is really convenient.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin as smooth as a razor, only the smallest stubble.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I have even used this in the bath and it works really well there too.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make too much noise.  </li>
            <li>But this one is real close, if you work at it a bit.</li>
            <li>I agree that it has a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>I really like the charging station.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t really expect to use it -</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I expected better performance from Panasonic than this though.</li>
            <li>She really likes the cordless feature.</li>
            <li>I used a cheaper conair shaver where the blades were sharper &amp; gave me a much closer shave, almost like the razor and never had ingrowths either.</li>
            <li>Really??</li>
            <li>It might work better if used it wet with shaving gel or something</li>
            <li>but shes fast with a standard/manual razor and doesnt have the patience to work with the electric one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quick shipping, fast charging and wet/dry shave almost as close as a blade?</li>
            <li>) my opinion is much revised.  </li>
            <li>Still, very convenient for when I just don&#x27;t feel like showering to shave.  </li>
            <li>but you&#x27;d have to re-shave in 2 days or so depending how fast your leg hair grows.</li>
            <li>Very scratchy.</li>
            <li>Well, that doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li>The blades contour to my underarms and legs and give me a very close shave with no pulling or</li>
            <li>I hold my skin back and shave against the grain for a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I found it to be very time consuming and perilous.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this ladies razor really does the trick.  </li>
            <li>So much for my faith in panasonic razors.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t shave very well.</li>
            <li>This shaver is really convenient and functional.</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend not using it there!  </li>
            <li>I recharged once, cleaned it faithfully, and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>very promptly.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver was as advertsed, and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Just wish they made one that you can actually get a smooth shave</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it wouldn&#x27;t give a real close trim</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t even do much of anything but cause pain and pulling.  </li>
            <li>: You cannot get a straight line with this thing.</li>
            <li>I am very knowledgeable about what makes things run and why they do not.</li>
            <li>It shaves very well.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the wet mode will be better, but that wasn&#x27;t the intent.</li>
            <li>It cuts close &amp; leaves your skin feeling very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>a week recharge &amp; it is ready to go.</li>
            <li>This has made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>I was ready to toss the razors...</li>
            <li>so for the underarms, it doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li>Now when I say it cuts it, it doesn&#x27;t really go in there to do its job.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really cut as close or as well</li>
            <li>It included a hair guard attachment and there&#x27;s a piece that you can push up, the part of the blade, when you&#x27;re ready to start.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a razor that really cuts close, this isn&#x27;t the one.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a razor that really cuts close, this isn&#x27;t the one.</li>
            <li>It let my armpit very irritated.</li>
            <li>Very dissappointed with this product.</li>
            <li>The foil section does absolutely nothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After much looking and review reading I settled on this Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The real breakthrough was the bikini trimmer...</li>
            <li>This is an absolute REVELATION in shaving.</li>
            <li>The person said that she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry i can&#x27;t say much on it.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave at all.  </li>
            <li>I am still searching for one that works really well for me.</li>
            <li>I love the pink, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as close??</li>
            <li>The pop-up razor really doesn&#x27;t work efficiently.</li>
            <li>being said this one works really well for the price.  </li>
            <li>Not all women love pink.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a nickel-free razor option because I was trying to figure out why my legs itched so much after shaving.</li>
            <li>A wet shave seems to do better.  </li>
            <li>But, it did pull my hair a bit, but I could&#x27;ve been going too fast.</li>
            <li>She really likes the trimmer attachment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expected more.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t provide much of a close shave either.</li>
            <li>Not looking for a really close shave, just looking for controlled and manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really use it for an all over shave, as it&#x27;s still faster and smoother just to razor shave up to the shorts line on my leg.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shave very well.  </li>
            <li>the shaver never looses power, always ready to go and stays charged during use.  </li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really buy it for that</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting from an electric razor, but I really expected better than this.</li>
            <li>Leaves too much stubble.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t shave very close and would nick me during shaving and hurt.  </li>
            <li>It took a couple of tries to get used to it, but now I love it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>the bikini trimmer, cant really use it too well.&lt;br /&gt;we</li>
            <li>Really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>As for the noise I don&#x27;t really care much.</li>
            <li>Convenient to use always ready and fully charged.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s capable of giving a close shave.</li>
            <li>It was used, placed on the charger (correctly with the charging light on) and the next morning it would not turn on.</li>
            <li>Very good&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li>There is no way I can use this and still feel comfortable wearing a skirt or shorts in public.</li>
            <li>Yesterday I bought another one and everything was much smoother and faster.</li>
            <li>This one does not shave very close at all.  </li>
            <li>This company needs to really do some work on quality control.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like electric shavers</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that I can use it in the shower and</li>
            <li>Thanks for making my life easier.</li>
            <li>My wife was constantly buying cheap battery operated razers for her and my daughter to use.  </li>
            <li>and I like the blade options so that you can simply do a close trim or a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted a reasonably priced shaver which did what I needed it to</li>
            <li>My hair grows fast and is course</li>
            <li>but I expected better results</li>
            <li>But I won&#x27;t be using it much.  </li>
            <li>I had just as much stubble unless I \\&quot;scrubbed\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it in the shower, but find the pivoting head really helps get a close shave.</li>
            <li>I really like my electric razor.</li>
            <li>I received it as a gift and was very hopeful.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been much of an issue for me.  </li>
            <li>Close shave, thanks in part to the flexible head.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t grab hair very well</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not holding out much hope.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After six months of use, however, I&#x27;m very unsatisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it still hurts yours legs while in use, still does not give as close of a shave as using a cheap-o razor and frankly is far from worth the price.  </li>
            <li>read the reviews and bought this shaver for my wife for christmas, she loves it ,works very well for her.</li>
            <li>thanks panasonic</li>
            <li>She told me she really likes it.</li>
            <li>- it gets VERY close to the skin.</li>
            <li>Very close shave.  </li>
            <li>This shaver really does the job for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li>chose this one based on reviews and honestly expected a bit better.  </li>
            <li>The longer hair shaver piece isn&#x27;t as powerful as my old one, but nonetheless it does the job.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>really really rreally really really really like it.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the way this Panasonic cut so close and left my wifes legs as smooth as you know what.</li>
            <li>works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>You will get silky smooth legs for the same price</li>
            <li>Very close shave</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my mother in law who had very swollen legs as a result of cancer.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a struggle to accomplish much with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost a toy mocking the real thing..  </li>
            <li>but the charger is a real pain</li>
            <li>She just leaves plugged in and it is always ready when she needs it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with this in the winter months, but in the summer with shorts I use a wet disposable razor.</li>
            <li>I saw a lot of complaints about this not shaving very close...</li>
            <li>Gets a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>It is very durable.</li>
            <li>I am really used to manual razors, but this one does well in the shower.  </li>
            <li>If you use wet be sure to have something on the skin besides just water.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Very close, fast shave.</li>
            <li>This works very well,,,I</li>
            <li>I should have know it wouldn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Really does very close shaving.</li>
            <li>And it really doesn&#x27;t need much maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very well and always get 3-4 shaves before charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t pull at all unless I&#x27;m going WAY too fast, has never nicked me once, and really hugs my legs because of the pivoting head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try another brand and spend a bit more than the $30 I spent on it.</li>
            <li>Compared to the Remington, it is very underpowered and does not give a close shave on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I found myself re-shaving the same area with a throw away razor just to get smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping for a really close shave, it just didn&#x27;t work like I had hoped .</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It still does not shave as close as a manual razor, but it does very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This thing has caused me so much stress, I&#x27;d rather poke needles in my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This is absolute garbage.  </li>
            <li>Cuts really close.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave, which I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with electric shavers so when I decided to buy one to escape</li>
            <li>Actually I can&#x27;t really rate this one yet.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really like this razor.  </li>
            <li>Much easier than standing on my head in the shower.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave and you never have to replace any batteries.  </li>
            <li>And work very well</li>
            <li>:Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>It does a very close shave and the battery lasts for</li>
            <li>She tells me it pulls a bit and doesn&#x27;t really give her a close shave on her legs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and holds a charge well (over a week when only using it briefly each day).  </li>
            <li>This was a very inexpensive razor but it did the job well....</li>
            <li>It just sticks straight up off of the block.</li>
            <li>much else needs to be said.</li>
            <li>I would recomend this shaver because it really seems to get close to the body.  </li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t feel smooth after shaving comparing with the regular razor shaving.</li>
            <li>is very usefull and very higienic...</li>
            <li>When this does shave, it doesn&#x27;t get very close and it doesn&#x27;t work very well in the shower.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.  </li>
            <li>AM VERY</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable, and delivered on time.</li>
            <li>It never stayed charged as instructed - one use drained much of the battery, and it lives in the charging stand.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter when she was 10 and ready to start shaving.  </li>
            <li>This shave seems to perform very well, as advertised.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>The only reason why mine lost one side was because of my own human error.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this razor for a few weeks now &amp; am loving the convenience of not having to lather up in the tub if I want to shave.</li>
            <li>I purchased it to replace my old razor that finally died after many years of use.</li>
            <li>This product cannot be rated properly by someone who expects the same kind of close shave that a razor would provide.</li>
            <li>rose above my expectations and I definitely  recommend this to any woman!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant in purchasing it because of some of the negative reviews I read, but the description and price was all good for me.  </li>
            <li>This is good in a pinch (like, you&#x27;re running late and realize you haven&#x27;t shaved your legs), but don&#x27;t expect a close or long-lasting shave.</li>
            <li>The charger is a little cube that allows for the shaver to sit right on top of the cube when it is plugged into the wall plug in.</li>
            <li>To me comfort and safety are very important, as is getting a close shave (it is relatively simple and cheap to get one without the other).  </li>
            <li>used this every single day since I&#x27;ve received it, and it has not disappointed me yet!</li>
            <li>It is very convient for major jobs and a quick touch up if I prefer to not use a razor.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle to use, and the shave is not as close as if I use a manual razor, but it does the trick quickly and relatively quietly.  </li>
            <li>The one positive thing about it though, is that it did stay charged for a decent period of time.</li>
            <li>I noticed that regardless of the angle I held the shaver at, the left side of the shaver would always work better than the right, making it so that I had to repeat the area multiple times.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really comment on this right now as this is a Christmas gift for my 90 year old mother</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as a normal razor, but also doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin as much; it works all right dry but better</li>
            <li>The only thing is it just makes my hair grow easily and faster than normal..</li>
            <li>But I love being able to use it dry for other areas!</li>
            <li>Well, more of a pink purple, but still very pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in All, I fully recommend this electric razor to anyone who needs an inexpensive decent razor to use, UNLESS you want want a shave that works like a blade, then I recommend that you save your money and stick with blades.</li>
            <li>With the long hair trimmer it easily cuts longer hair that the comb of the product won&#x27;t pick up.</li>
            <li>, stores easily, charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Comes with a bikini attachment (I have yet to try,) and nice clear plastic cover to protect the heads from dust and other things.</li>
            <li>This model is a little larger than my first one, although still good weight and size, and convient to use.</li>
            <li>Using it wet seems to be better for this particular area.</li>
            <li>It definitely still leaves a small stubble, but if you are looking for something electronic for safety or what not, this is definitely the best choice in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I have to replace it 2-3 times per year--but many other shavers are $90</li>
            <li>I like to be environmentally friendly and choose electric shaver for last 25 years.</li>
            <li>and I had to attach them one after the other for better results; with this shaver I don&#x27;t have to do anything but to charge it, use it</li>
            <li>It also takes several swipes instead of just one-but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Works well, better than the other electric corded/cordless razors I had tried.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it does what it is advertised to do and does it better than other shavers that I have tried.</li>
            <li>But I like electric so much better now, because I don&#x27;t feel like I have to shave every other day</li>
            <li>From the very first shave, I barely made it through one shave before needing to recharge.  </li>
            <li>Exfoliating and moisturizing, as other reviewers recommended provides even better results.</li>
            <li>it does a better job than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I suggest that you get familiar with the shaver prior to using it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited to use this and not have to spend time in the shower with a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>It shaves close and love the attachments for other grooming issues.  </li>
            <li>I had a sharp memory of the many cuts during all my years of shaving.</li>
            <li>Plus ain&#x27;t nobody got time to be that thorough on a normal day!</li>
            <li>It performs better than any other women&#x27;s shaver I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>
            <li>Be advised that it works 100 times better wet!  </li>
            <li>Better than any other electric I have used.</li>
            <li>I hoped for more at the time because my Panasonic shaver is extremely good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, while I suspect this shaver is good for large areas like legs, it is just adequate for your ladyparts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish it would of had come with was a brush to clean the blades out.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t shave as finely as a razor, but you avoid the nicks that are common with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;The bikini attachment is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t tear at hairs.</li>
            <li>Shave is smooth, fast, recharge lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t nick skin.  </li>
            <li>Well I haven&#x27;t had this panasonic as long, but so far its still 90% better.</li>
            <li>Also the blades cannot go back in when you take it out to clean</li>
            <li>The previous ones were excellent, I expected the same from this one...</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t intend to use it as my main shaving tool</li>
            <li>It works; it&#x27;s easy to clean; it&#x27;s small and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space; however, the shave leaves something to be desired.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that the stubble falls out of the razor to the floor and you have to clean it up</li>
            <li>I liked that it could be used in the shower, but the battery does not hold a charge for too long - I have to keep it on the charger constantly.  </li>
            <li>I have used other Ladies&#x27; shavers in the past and this, by far, is the best one of all!  </li>
            <li>This razor received a high rating on consumer reports but I found it to be very ineffective.  </li>
            <li>And you can buy new blades on Amazon which just makes the whole process that much easier.  </li>
            <li>The dry option is nice  for last minute use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it mostly dry but have used it wet as well, with equally good results.</li>
            <li>have super sensitive skin, so I get bumps from razor shaving in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it both wet and dry, either way it gave a good close shave.</li>
            <li>This razor seems to nick my skin more frequently for dry shaves (haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I just use this on dry legs and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Panasonic ES-LT41-K (the same one my hubby has used happily for over a year), and after using it several months, will never buy another pink shaver targeted at women again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blades frequently do not run smoothly and they will hurt you.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really shave that closely, when compared to a normal razor.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m usually pretty sensitive.  </li>
            <li>- my hair grows so fast that within hours after a normal shave</li>
            <li>So it doesn&#x27;t matter to me too much that this shave isn&#x27;t 100% as close as a normal shave.  </li>
            <li>However, I couldn&#x27;t find enough compelling evidence to spend 10x as much, or even 3x as much -</li>
            <li>Although more expensive (yet still reasonably priced, imo) than the women&#x27;s shaver, the ES-LT41-K delivers much better value.  </li>
            <li>I had to replace my old Remington electric shaver and purchased their newer model first.</li>
            <li>I was pleasently surprised after trying this razor for the first time.</li>
            <li>This works better than your average electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Same thing happened; returned it for a full refund and bought another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and so far it is working pretty well.</li>
            <li>Not bad, actually.</li>
            <li>I have thick dark hair that it pulled and skipped over, my mother has fine light hair that it did better with</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend using this razor wet, however for a quick shave dry works good too.</li>
            <li>I have even received comments from the other guys at my club wanting to know what I do to keep things looking so attractive down there</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hands down, the men&#x27;s shaver is better.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good shaver and does its job, but I&#x27;m going to try my little Remington again</li>
            <li>So new razor it is!</li>
            <li>I just used my new razor out of the shower and it worked so well!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave close at all, misses hairs left and right and occasionally pulls, hurts the skin if you are not super careful to have it at the perfect angle, where it doesn&#x27;t cut.  </li>
            <li>It does, however, work great on those hard to get spots like the back of my knee</li>
            <li>The charger is great, it takes up as little space as possible which is a major plus in my book.</li>
            <li>http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ES2207P-Curves-rechargeable-Ladies/dp/B0018A32XS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1343180022&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;Panasonic+ES2207P I don&#x27;t care for the new shaver as much as I did this model.</li>
            <li>I am buying another one today, because there&#x27;s a $5 difference between the blades for it and a whole new razor.</li>
            <li>I have kept it super clean, but the blades just got dull very very fast.</li>
            <li>The wide head makes it easy to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use and gave my legs the appearance of being shaven, but my legs still felt rough and stubbly.  </li>
            <li>Previously had a Remington which shaved better and closer.</li>
            <li>As many of the previous reviews have said, it will NOT leave your legs super-smooth the way a non-electic razor does.  </li>
            <li>While I enjoyed this product while it lasted, after less than 10-months</li>
            <li>I use this dry and my legs are still smooth and stay that way for a couple days, just like a blade shave.</li>
            <li>Just so you know, the razor is definitely pink--mauve means a purple-ish pink, but this is just a rosy pink--it is nice, but not mauve.</li>
            <li>I purchased this one because of the lower price combined with well over 300 decent reviews.</li>
            <li>replaced an older Panasonic ladies shaver that I had had for 20 years, but should have replaced sooner.  </li>
            <li>you want a portable, rechargeable (haven&#x27;t had it die on me yet), decent shaver - go for this one.</li>
            <li>My current wet/dry electric shaver finally died after many years of use.  </li>
            <li>I made sure it&#x27;s fully charged and all it would do it would actually pull my hair but not shave it at all even though I&#x27;d run it multiple times over one area of my leg...</li>
            <li>I will just note that this particular razor is the low end of the line and the others are likely better.  </li>
            <li>I will just note that this particular razor is the low end of the line and the others are likely better.  </li>
            <li>i bought the wahl shaver, mainly because of the brand name.  </li>
            <li>Charges quickly and holds the charge through an extensive shave.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job at shaving but takes forever to charge.</li>
            <li>Decent for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a device that would give a close shave without cutting my skin, and also do a good job at being precise so that I could leave some hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the reviews and was hoping to get a decent razor.  </li>
            <li>My wife now has 2 dead razors and I must take them apart to remove 2 good batteries for proper disposal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I do want to say that the Panasonic ES2207P razor, which seems to be this exact same razor WITHOUT the pivoting head, gives a shave that feels exactly like I have used a manual</li>
            <li>Especially on those days when I forgot and need a quick shave.</li>
            <li>Need charger&#x27;s like was on the older models with a cord.  </li>
            <li>I chose this particular one because of the feedback</li>
            <li>When charging, there is no green light to tell you the shaver is charged as it remains red.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as close as a wax job but does a decent job.</li>
            <li>It misses most of the hairs and you have to go over the same spot several times to get a hair to cut.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this particular item is defective and does not represent the quality of the product?</li>
            <li>It seems to charge quickly and holds a charge for what seems like several shaving incidents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since the Remington had been so reliable with a decently close shave, I went with another one.</li>
            <li>My main problem is, once the battery stops charging, you can&#x27;t replace the battery.</li>
            <li>she says a charge lasts forever, only complain, the shave isn&#x27;t super close</li>
            <li>getting older and needing a safer way to shave.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this since reviews were decent.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it over a classic razor for the bikini region.</li>
            <li>My most recent purchase is the second one of these that I have bought.  </li>
            <li>However, I already have another smaller shaver for this and didn&#x27;t need a replacement, especially if it should be able to do my legs as well.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t expecting the same results as an actual blade razor or more costly electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You cannot go wrong purchasing this especially at this awesome price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this razor is decent.</li>
            <li>it works in the shower just like it said takes a great charge and charge last at least 2 shaves for me</li>
            <li>Also useful if it has been a while as a brushclearing tool before more delicate methods are required.</li>
            <li>I could see how if you have dark, coarse hair on your legs, you might not be happy with the results of this razor as the shave would last maybe 1 day before you would see the hair growth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like a shaver that would at least be reliable for a year, preferably more!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, OK as a trimmer for the bikini area but not a full on replacement razor.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hold a charge long and the blades were original and probably dulled</li>
            <li>This one does an amazing job once you get used to holding it the right direction, and leaves almost nothing behind.  </li>
            <li>However, it has a pretty wide swath, you can go back and forth along your leg pretty fast, and you don&#x27;t have to pay that much attention, so it goes quickly.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptic that this shaver was going to be THAT much better than the previous one, as it was just 10 dollars more.</li>
            <li>I was expecting for it to be just a little better than that, not silky smooth on a dry run, but smoother than what I got.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually use it in the shower and think it just great dry.</li>
            <li>, if you want something quick, easy, and reliable for small areas and have sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t like razors, then I 100% recommend this!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everyone that I purchased these for rates it as highly as I do.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor to beginners or anyone that has been shaving for years.</li>
            <li>This was highly rated so I bought it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this ladies shaver.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>For an electric razor, I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>It exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>If you find one with a charger that has a cord, I would recommend it highly, but not this one.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this razor</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am sure this item will not last 20 years like my old one, as it already doesn&#x27;t hold a charge well enough to shave very close.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an electric razor, I highly recommend this one for the price.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The noise level is too high like a tractor.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>Both offered high praise for the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried at least ten different ones and this is, by FAR, the best that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Finally he got sick of me using his and told me to get my own. :p  </li>
            <li>Do I consider it a particularly close shave for someone like myself who normally uses an Intuition razor?</li>
            <li>but you will get a decent shave quickly and it works very well dry.</li>
            <li>Needed new blades and found it cheaper to get a whole new shaver.  </li>
            <li>I do not feel that it works very well, and it takes many times of use in the same spot to remove even a limited amout of hair.</li>
            <li>Have only used this a few times, but working good so far!</li>
            <li>While it does a little more time to get the shave that I like, bikini  </li>
            <li>What I know is that my wife bought this, and my life just got a little better...</li>
            <li>Love this little shaver and the bikini attachment is an added bonus.  </li>
            <li>Sure it takes a little longer but its not like I&#x27;m going anywhere.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little longer than you&#x27;d think, with more passes, to use an electric shaver over a hand held manual razor.</li>
            <li>For the first few months of use this electric shaver worked fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very slow and does not do a good job.</li>
            <li>My last razor, this same brand and model, needed a new charger and blades which cost more than a new razor.  </li>
            <li>It works at the first few times, but not as clean as the straight razor.</li>
            <li>It will be especially nice when we are traveling in our RV where the shower is so small it is hard to shave with a blade.</li>
            <li>I have coarse, dark hair that grows quickly and fair skin, so I normally shave with a razor every other day.  </li>
            <li>I got this shaver to replace my 10 year old Remington that I really miss.</li>
            <li>I assume the break occurred while I was cleaning it or reattaching the head, although I am surprised since I feel like I handled the product reasonably.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been very reliable.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I don&#x27;t have that problem with this one, but the foil makes it harder to get a neat close shave.</li>
            <li>and so far it shaves very well.</li>
            <li>Underarms are as smooth with this razor as with a traditional 3-blade throw-away razor, and this one has a pivoting head that glides across my skin much easier than any traditional razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>On a wet run, it&#x27;s smoother, but, again, not silky smooth or as smooth as I expected</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not as close or as smooth a shave as wet shaving</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the product often enough or owned it long enough yet, but, thus far, it has provided a good, close shave, and i have no complaints.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;boxy&#x27; part plugs in to the wall (like normal),</li>
            <li>, I do wish it had a cord like a normal appliance!&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>My Husband was able to cut it with his heavy duty scissors.</li>
            <li>The only thing I am not crazy about is that it doesn&#x27;t have a charging station, if just has a plug for the wall that you put the razor in,  it does not work well at my house based on the way my outlets are setup.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say that this is an okay shaver for the price, but if you can afford it, get a slightly more expensive and higher quality shaver that will shave evenly.</li>
            <li>razor itself seems a bit &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;, since most of the parts are made of plastic, and it isn&#x27;t quite as heavy as the Phillips Norelco Men&#x27;s shaver which I have.  </li>
            <li>Also, razor was so wide (versus the similar razor with only 1 foil) that I could not get a good shave in my underarms or around my knees.</li>
            <li>I had this same shaver for so many years that I can&#x27;t remember how long I had it.</li>
            <li>I just get a big smile to think about it...</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver a few months ago and still love it.  </li>
            <li>I was warned electric razors don&#x27;t get as close as a normal razor</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the dulling was an issue with my use or care of the razor, as I didn&#x27;t use it very often to begin with (not more than three times a week at MOST)</li>
            <li>This razor is okay in a pinch, but I do not get a close enough shave and the battery does not hold out that long.</li>
            <li>I use a normal razor for my legs</li>
            <li>It still gets closer than I can manage with a normal razor, but doesn&#x27;t cause irritation even when shaving against the grain.  </li>
            <li>The flexible head is fun to play with, but too wide to be entirely comfortable for my smaller curves when I&#x27;m trying to get a close shave, so consider the head dimensions when purchasing.</li>
            <li>My old one was from another company and at first I tried to buy exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li>I will rate each thing I tried with this razor 1-5, 5 rating good and 1 rating poor.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product,it didn&#x27;t live up to them.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend this as a high quality razor, particularly for people with sensitive skin or nickel</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may be better for women with normal thickness hair, but mine is super thin and uncooperative.</li>
            <li>I live in an old house and all my outlets are very close to the floor.</li>
            <li>Also, hot water makes your skin swell slightly, so after you cool off the hair sticks out farther than at the time of shaving.  </li>
            <li>Razor only works ok when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>ill say the best results were when dry.</li>
            <li>, after you use it... rinse the blades off, like take the part off and rinse it out... dry it with a towel real quick, then put it back together.  </li>
            <li>(nope, no totally silky soft skin), nor will you shave as quickly, so stop looking at electric razors to save time...</li>
            <li>word of caution about the charger, which is a 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch block that plugs into the wall: the blades of the charger plug are vertical blades on the left and right below the socket for the razor device charger plug.  </li>
            <li>, it is off the vanity right up next to the electrical plug.</li>
            <li>A plain recharging cord would be much more convenient but it wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker.  </li>
            <li>The blades did not last very long, and the replacement blades and foil cost more than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, and I expect to have it deliver a super sharp shave for at least a year.</li>
            <li>Most electric razors still pinch in those areas, but this one doesn&#x27;t as long as I keep the skin flat while working.  </li>
            <li>Not worth the cost when it broke so easily</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another reviewer said that this is excellent as a dry shaver OR a wet shaver but not very good if you try to shave damp skin (say, after a shower).</li>
            <li>It is bigger than the one I bought in Japan several years ago, but works fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge space-savings over the other alcohol-rinse system that she had previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using this as my shaving solution around anything other than tights.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>This is really disappointing, as I thought I&#x27;d found something that was really good!</li>
            <li>There is nothing unique about this wet shaver...</li>
            <li>; It is a trimmer though so don&#x27;t expect it to keep your legs and other areas silky smooth.</li>
            <li>If I squeezed the head it would work a little but something just wasn&#x27;t catching properly on the inside.  </li>
            <li>I thought of buying a new charger but guess what..</li>
            <li>and I found the new blades cost as much as a new razor.</li>
            <li>And if it does wear out in a year, I can afford to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>I have had a Remington WDF6000 for years and needed to purchase a new razor.  </li>
            <li>I went to purchase a new blade and foil</li>
            <li>I new</li>
            <li>Like \\&quot;Kari\\&quot; from Colorado, I&#x27;ve always used Remington ladies razors and needed a new one, so I started researching and found this Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a new Replacement Shaver Foil and Blade Set, so we&#x27;ll see if that solves the problem.</li>
            <li>The new ones seem to pull on my skin/hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me or the people I live with.</li>
            <li>, I had to buy a new one every year.</li>
            <li>I looked into buying a new battery but the cost of it didnt make sense.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li>so I decided to get a new one.</li>
            <li>Now I have to buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li>and they told to place order for new blades.</li>
            <li>so I bought her a new one.  </li>
            <li>She likes the new shaver.</li>
            <li>Not as close as shave as a new razor though.</li>
            <li>if we live through the electrocution, they&#x27;ll get sued, so no cord.</li>
            <li>Have had one before but was needing new battery and head so for the price</li>
            <li>I just bought a new one.</li>
            <li>I might as well buy a new one and toss this thing in the trash, where it belongs.  </li>
            <li>This new model seems flimsy and not made as well, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>When the blades on this get dull, I&#x27;ll be throwing it away instead of buying more blades (which by the way cost as much as the shaver).</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it takes a very tight fitting wall socket to keep the unit plugged in.</li>
            <li>I was okay with the lame shave on my thighs just because it&#x27;s a huge pain to use the disposable there, and it&#x27;s finer hair than my calves, so</li>
            <li>The second issue, is the fit of the&lt;br /&gt;shaver into the recharge unit is such that it requires \\&quot;fiddling\\&quot; to set it in place--especially if the unit is plugged into the wall while trying to reinsert the shaver.</li>
            <li>Now it takes more than a few passes of the shaver on my skin to completely remove hair.</li>
            <li>The power button on my particular unit is easy to hit accidentally and I find that I&#x27;ve turned it off during a shave a few</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care how fast it grows back.</li>
            <li>I have tried it in the shower also, probably glides better when wet, but I prefer to use outside of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It does an okay job of shaving my legs if I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to shave in the regular wet, shaving cream fashion, but I can still feel some stubble.</li>
            <li>The fact that I can do a quick touch-up dry shave anytime</li>
            <li>I used it to cut longer hairs, then I&#x27;d go back with a regular razor to get it completely smooth.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a closer shave and isn&#x27;t irritating to the less sensitive skin), but I find that an electric razor works best for my underarms and bikini area.  </li>
            <li>It had been so long since I had an electric shaver, and I am glad I purchased this one.&lt;br /&gt;Holds charge a long time.</li>
            <li>(although I would personally recommend wet with gel, it glides better that way)</li>
            <li>Pretty good, get&#x27;s dull after 3 months of every other day use.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and you can use it dry or wet.</li>
            <li>Also I had an unopened package of replacement blades that fit the same shaver, (and they are no small expense), so that was a big factor in my decision to purchase this replacement.</li>
            <li>This area is very sensitive on me and this electric razor was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My Situation:&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This replaced an very old shaver I had.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I just replaced the blades for the first time, thinking I&#x27;d get the same performance as brand new, but that was not the case.</li>
            <li>Granted there is a large price difference (between the Men&#x27;s exceptional razor and the women&#x27;s mediocre one)</li>
            <li>I thought an electric would be fine, because I have severe arthritis and can not bend over in the shower to use a razor.&lt;br /&gt;After the first shave the blades were already dull.</li>
            <li>so I get a pretty close shave that personally works for me.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt one bit, even in sensitive areas!</li>
            <li>The first Panasonic I had lasted 6 years, and finally the metal hair cutters broke.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>CHEAP and INFERIOR NOT WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li>This was the second shaver I tried (first one was not Panasonic)</li>
            <li>was actually my second try at this product -- the foil on the first one broke.</li>
            <li>The first was ordered Feb 14 2013 and the second Nov 14 2014.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well especially for the money.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor because I do not have enough hot water in my apartment to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>Apparently that&#x27;s too much to ask of this piece of junk.</li>
            <li>broke on the first use, despite me following package instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Upon first fall it broke into three pieces, we had put it back together</li>
            <li>I owned one exactly the same brand and product.</li>
            <li>I Love this, no more having to shave legs in the shower, I can do this before and even when just popping out to the shops, no it does not shave as close as a razor but what does?  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would say, after having it for around 2 years now, is that the battery life is not as stellar as it once was.</li>
            <li>She seems to use it pretty regularly.  </li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money or time!</li>
            <li>It is pretty but looks are deceiving especially in this case.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted ten years.  </li>
            <li>She says it works better than other, cheaper razors, but occasionally leaves longer hairs on her legs that it does not cut.</li>
            <li>On the first day that I used this thing, I couldn&#x27;t get the pop up trimmer to stay in place - it finally broke.  </li>
            <li>The charger is cordless, you place the shaver on the brick you plug into the wall directly!</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like it because I wasn&#x27;t used to a big electric razor.</li>
            <li>First of all I have to say...if you CAN use a regular blade razor with shaving cream, soap, or what have you, DO IT!  </li>
            <li>Funny thing is, this one is actually cheaper than the one I had before</li>
            <li>I have pretty coarse hair</li>
            <li>The granddaughter actually invited me into the bathroom to witness and offer ideas for he first shaving.</li>
            <li>It has a small charger that plugs into to the wall outlet, with a post on top that fits in the bottom of the charger.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and could not find in local stores.</li>
            <li>Its pretty quiet, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not my favorite, the trimmer is almost pointless.</li>
            <li>It did not come with any sort of way to keep all the components together when not in use, but that is an easy fix I will go get a little makeup bag to store it in....</li>
            <li>I use hair conditioner, you just need a little something to act as a lube to glide easy over skin.</li>
            <li>This one was the same physical effort but without the clean shaving blades to it.</li>
            <li>I tried it both in the shower and on dry skin, and I like it on dry skin better.</li>
            <li>I expect a brand new shaver to very cleanly cut in one past.</li>
            <li>My old Panasonic es2045 died so I needed to get something new.  </li>
            <li>After my old electric shaver gave out, I looked around for a new one for a month or so.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned/dry/light colored hair - sometimes I do have to run it over the same area a few times to make sure everything is taken down as far as possible, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting any different.</li>
            <li>The shape is comfortable for my small hands and it does not weigh much.  </li>
            <li>I am using this only as a DRY Shaver and seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>You basically have to charge it upright but the unit itself is so heavy, it can easily fall out of the socket.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned two of these and since the second one did what the first one did, I have to say they&#x27;re complete garbage.  </li>
            <li>It worked fairly well at first, but before a year was even up, it stopped cutting my hairs.</li>
            <li>That one did a great close shave, but sometimes it pinched the delicate parts a bit, so you had to be real careful.</li>
            <li>NIce idea on the pop up trimmer; but I think I&#x27;d rather have a larger shaving area than the small head on this.  </li>
            <li>It rests vertically on top of a small square box that plugs directly into the wall.</li>
            <li>And....I have tried using it with my hair being different lengths (wanting to make sure that it had grown out enough and other times not too much).  </li>
            <li>I just cant say enough positive things about this razor.</li>
            <li>Not powerful but accessible.</li>
            <li>After several months&#x27; use she is a Panasonic convert because of the smoothness, rash free long running time time!</li>
            <li>To much frustration, the new shaver did the same thing!</li>
            <li>First of all, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a really close shave, but I ended up having to go over my legs again with a regular razor and honestly, the regular razor irritated me LESS than this, even wet with shave lotion on.</li>
            <li>It pulls hair, skips right over massive patches of hair and in general is a pain in the ass.</li>
            <li>i personally do not like to shape up my &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; in the shower, so i don&#x27;t know how it will do in the shower, but as for dry it was a smooth process.</li>
            <li>I only wish I had found this sooner - I almost enjoy shaving now, and it can be done quickly, dry, anytime, with no injury.  </li>
            <li>I only wish I had found this sooner - I almost enjoy shaving now, and it can be done quickly, dry, anytime, with no injury.  </li>
            <li>It works better dry than wet.</li>
            <li>Works better wet with shaving cream than dry.</li>
            <li>have not yet used this shaver wet because it is just so much more convenient to use dry.</li>
            <li>Also, I  find it better to shave dry then wet.</li>
            <li>It does work better dry than wet.</li>
            <li>but it irritated my sensitve skin even when wet, and more so dry.  </li>
            <li>Love the wet or dry technologies.</li>
            <li>If I am wearing a bikini I would definitely use my regular razor to get a super close shave though.</li>
            <li>Wife says it does a good job, but is somewhat tedious to clean, due to the \\&quot;articulating\\&quot; head.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li>Shaver\\&quot; 3 times in the past (they die about once every 18 months) and thought this would be better and was only a few bucks more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far less than with shaving though and doesn&#x27;t bother me, but if you&#x27;re looking for completely burn free shaving</li>
            <li>Have only used it dry so far, but the cut is smooth.</li>
            <li>But after using it a few times, it&#x27;s fine now because I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re inclined to razor bumps and bruises, I recommend electric razors in general and the Panasonic in particular.</li>
            <li>Not sure if other folks haven&#x27;t used good razors so they have nothing to compare to or if I got a dud</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as other electric razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>It shaves down clean and smooth with little more than one pass because of the larger multi-foil head and that means less time shaving.</li>
            <li>I like the overall design, mostly the pivoting head, but I think the engine or system is not as powerful as it should be, to get the job done, I have to run it up or down several, several  times and it does not give a close shave, so i have to finish it with another device.</li>
            <li>It works fine, I don&#x27;t see any problems with it, it may a little heavy, but gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Also, I have had to go over certain areas several times to remove hair.</li>
            <li>Typically, you would only find such a great and close shave in the more expensive products.  </li>
            <li>As I had only intended to use the product occasionally and as a supplement to my regular razor, that was fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have wall plugs with horizontal blade holes on the top and bottom, the charger will need an extension of some sort, or one will end up charging razor on it&#x27;s side (which I imagine is extremely hard to do).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did use it for some other body hair removal where I didn&#x27;t mind if it wasn&#x27;t super close and that works well.</li>
            <li>They seem to last longer than other products, and maintenance is easy.  </li>
            <li>Huge waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For a $29 purchase, this clearly was not an option...</li>
            <li>Very tempted to toss it in the back corner of a drawer and get another like my old one.</li>
            <li>After several tries the results did not yield a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>This was not seen or clear in the add to be viewed.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product and I am sorry that did not buy sooner.</li>
            <li>You do have to go over the same section of leg to get it smooth, but that&#x27;s expected with electric.</li>
            <li>It comes with clear instructios to use it and take care of it.</li>
            <li>I have found that if I am patient and use this shaver slower than my old regular razor I can still get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find this one at such a reasonable price for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>so you know when the razor is charged completely.  </li>
            <li>IT WILL NEVER REPLACE A PROFESSIONAL BRAZILIAN WAX...  </li>
            <li>So I returned the razor, and I am back to using my straight razor for a smoother shave.</li>
            <li>and it is loud...</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t remember the last time</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised.</li>
            <li>a power cord; it has two prongs that need to be slipped directly into a wall socket, or,&lt;br /&gt;if desired, plugged into an extension cord.</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in my hand and is not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>When I want a fabulous shave for my legs, I&#x27;ll still use the Mach 5, but for everyday shaving, I like this product for it&#x27;s versatility in and out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of this razor so far.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for an old Remington soft and silky because I could no longer find a replacement head for it.</li>
            <li>It really shaved well, as soon as I got home I investigated further.</li>
            <li>If your thinking about upgrading an old razor or looking to start out</li>
            <li>It charges directly into the wall plug, which eliminates having a dangling cord.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it arrived a day early.</li>
            <li>Bought for my 12 year old daughter, as she was taking 30 minutes to just shave her legs every time.</li>
            <li>I use it to maintain a complete Brazilian shave, and it does not pull or pinch, and I have never had a cut.  </li>
            <li>Close shave and so much faster for daily touch ups.</li>
            <li>I also like that it plugs directly into outlet</li>
            <li>i wondered, wow, where was this shaver when i needed it the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Panasonic left absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>I like the direct plug in recharger.  </li>
            <li>This razor is gentle enough</li>
            <li>this razor is much quieter than my last one!</li>
            <li>slower in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t trust it as far a I can throw it.  </li>
            <li>Well, I guess it was about 12 years old...</li>
            <li>Fast, QUIET, and did the job.  </li>
            <li>Tried replacing my old one when it broke and the conair brand sucked.</li>
            <li>I do like the action and the fact that the head tips and tilts around my bony knees and shin bone.  </li>
            <li>The tin wrapped around the one section fell off completely.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this razor for my young daughter.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>There are multiple lengths and shearing was very</li>
            <li>It makes a loud noise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly quiet, and it holds a charge really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.  </li>
            <li>this was purchased as a gift for my wife , whoneeded to replace her old shaver.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found it in nearly 40 years, but maybe someday....</li>
            <li>I still prefer the old fashioned razor blade and shaving gel method for the closest shave.  </li>
            <li>It might be alright for others, as I have extremely sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>I have an old Remington razor that is 10 years old.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it...</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but the one downside is the battery only lasts about 45 days.</li>
            <li>The shaver is able to get small hairs out with no problem as long as it is very close to the root of the hairs.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to give up my old habits while switching to an electric razor.</li>
            <li>As far as closeness, speed, and comfort, she says 5 stars on all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Not what I would expect from an old reliable company like Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The charger for this product plugs directly into the wall plug in/outlet.</li>
            <li>it was 5 years old and just &amp;#34;ran out of gas&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>But it is fast and it beats all the cuts I get from traditional razors.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve replaced the foils, which doesn&#x27;t seem to have fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using a shaver on anyplace as sensitive as that anyway.</li>
            <li>It takes you straight back to the 2 day after shave.</li>
            <li>Still using my old version of this with just the 1 foil.</li>
            <li>Not anywhere near close to skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old shaver, which was 15 years old.</li>
            <li>I absolutely can not shave my underarms with this razor, I&#x27;ve tried numerous times and it burns and scratches.</li>
            <li>It must be old stock.</li>
            <li>Just like my old one.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic has a swivel head and is much easier to use especially under the arms.</li>
            <li>Did I mention I have sensitive skin?</li>
            <li>Well, so far no irritation.</li>
            <li>SO FAR</li>
            <li>No complaints so far</li>
            <li>old electric Remington, so off to Walmart I went.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies actually pulls the hairs as much as cuts.</li>
            <li>I like how the charger unit plugs directly into an electrical outlet...</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace my old Panasonic; the battery would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li>and I literally have to use 2 of them to completely do my legs ankle to groin.  </li>
            <li>The charger plugs directly into the outlet,with the razor on it.</li>
            <li>I know electric razors don&#x27;t get as close as the real thing, but this Panasonic left me feeling like a wildebeest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this because my skin is so sensitive to everything I needed an alternative.  </li>
            <li>Too loud - doesn&#x27;t have a close shave, but would do in a pinch..</li>
            <li>Have had this razor for several weeks and really like it.</li>
            <li>I only use this shaver for the edge of my bikini area- not the whole thing.  </li>
            <li>so she was satisfied with it since it would at least avoid being cut from a razor nick.  </li>
            <li>The shave is not as close as a razor, but darned near close, and the hair&#x27;s not even visible.  </li>
            <li>I have an old</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, somewhere between this and my old model, Pansonic decided to replace the cord charger with a wall-mounted unit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another point of note about the product is that the charger plugs directly into the wall, so keep that in mind.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely remove the hair.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see that it worked just like the advertisement promised.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li>and I can no longer get the damn thing to sit straight on the charger and actually charge.  </li>
            <li>Now have to pay for shipping to return it and no guarentee it will be fixed</li>
            <li>I had been a shaving with a common Gillete razor before this incident and after many cuts, I decided I needed to switch.  </li>
            <li>Over time, it stopped working very well, until it stopped doing anything... not the motor, but the internal blades.  </li>
            <li>I took it traveling with me and one of the delicate plastic parts on the top of the plug that the handle snaps onto got bent and snapped off.  </li>
            <li>The bikini attachment is a joke, you can&#x27;t use the thing on your armpits without harming the sensitive skin, and</li>
            <li>I wanted to stop paying for products that irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t really do that since it only worked on my legs...</li>
            <li>My old razor used batteries so it saves money not to have to buy batteries all the time.</li>
            <li>Purchased this product for my 10 year old.</li>
            <li>My old shaver took me 10 minutes max.</li>
            <li>Of course it is no where near as close as a razor</li>
            <li>No trouble so far.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;closely.  Very versatile as you can shave underarms and private area w/o worrying about&lt;</li>
            <li>they itch so much after about 30 minutes that only drawing blood will get me to stop scratching my legs (no matter what moisturizer I use), and I don&#x27;t even want to think about the ingrown hairs that develop after a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the product for my 93 year old mother</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bulky, loud and as mentioned, ineffective for what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li>But overall this is making my skin SO much happier.hough.</li>
            <li>But overall this is making my skin SO much happier.</li>
            <li>I take my time shaving and so far I got four shaves and still didn&#x27;t need a recharge</li>
            <li>Obviously if you were to put the charger in the bottom outlet, you&#x27;re going to cover the whole thing</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I received the shaver.  </li>
            <li>It has double heads and some springs or something that helps follow your curves and shave really close.  </li>
            <li>I also use it for underarm hair because it&#x27;s much gentler on my skin than a traditional razor.  </li>
            <li>I bought one for my 29 year old daughter, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping it and as far as electric shavers go</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve been doing the old fashioned razor and shaving cream routine in the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We just bought two more for her as \\&quot;spares\\&quot; in case this gets discontinued in the next few years.</li>
            <li>Only negative that we can tell is that when you charge the unit, there is only an indicator light that it is charging, and it does not show an indicator light when the charging is complete.</li>
            <li>After few months of using it rarely (i don&#x27;t have much hair on my legs or bikini line)</li>
            <li>I fear that I will receive it and have the same problems of which I will have wasted more money on the shaver.</li>
            <li>The style of blades was completely different, it took twice as long to shave (if not more) and it wouldn&#x27;t do a good job at all.  </li>
            <li>After using for several months I broke it by dropping it a few too many times and ran to Walgreens to pick up a replacement, they didn&#x27;t have this model</li>
            <li>Any company that forces you to spend more money (on a low cost item such as this) to send their crap back to them before they&#x27;ll fix/replace it isn&#x27;t standing by their product, isn&#x27;t providing good customer service and isn&#x27;t worth my time and money, nor yours.  </li>
            <li>As others have stated, this is a good (not excellent) shaver.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t say anything good about it.</li>
            <li>The new one broke even quicker than the first, lasting only 1-2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked okay, not as good as a dry razor I use (bikini area), but again I&#x27;m just disappointed that it died.  </li>
            <li>The charge last a long time and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>I mean the legs and armpits are ok, but if you want a close shave in bikini area, forget about this shaver.</li>
            <li>I always used regular razor blades because I thought electric razors weren&#x27;t very effective, this razor proved me wrong.</li>
            <li>Just a little hand soap directly on the foils, rub it in, and turn the razor on and its clean.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my first time using an electric shaver, I switched over from blades two years ago, and the hair wasn&#x27;t even very long.  </li>
            <li>Ditch those ladies specific shavers if you want a clean, close, quiet shave and go out and get yourself a manly shaver for those womanly legs.  </li>
            <li>MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED, COMPARED TO THE OTHER ONE,</li>
            <li>Easy to take for travel no cord small charger.</li>
            <li>yeah, it gets a fairly decent shave on your legs, but only after spending too much time going the same area over and over again...</li>
            <li>The little pop up trimmer works as described, even works when its not popped up - went to clean it and noticed it had a collection of hair there even though I&#x27;d not used it.</li>
            <li>No water, no soap, no mess.</li>
            <li>It leaves behind a small prickle (which I&#x27;m sure most women don&#x27;t like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>It may be a problem if you have super sensitive skin, but I have a skin which is a little sensitive</li>
            <li>I buy the panasonic ES2207P for my wife a few months ago, and it works perfect, close shave, almost like an ordinary razor, without the irritation, so i decide to try with this other one that have and extra foil and pivot head</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not something I can use everyday with getting a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Wife was all smiles after first dry shave!</li>
            <li>Possibly works better for those with less coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Product is fine if you want to take the excessive length off.</li>
            <li>I mainly used it for my bikini area and it irritated my skin just like a regular razor does.</li>
            <li>Amazon, however, has been very prompt with the response to my complaint and has promised to issue a full refund.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted about 6 years, the second one about two years before I had to replace the screen and head and instead of replacing the head for the second time, I purchased this razor.  </li>
            <li>Gave my first one to my mom and replaced later with a conair razor, big mistake, I returned to Amazon and bought another one of these.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first until I was actually able to try it</li>
            <li>I got this shaver to replace my older Remington, but returned it after only one use.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried wet shave yet, but dry shave works fine for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor if you prefer power shavers to actual razors.</li>
            <li>It cuts hair smoothly without pulling or nicking and it isn&#x27;t necessary to keep going back and forth several times over the same area in order to cut all the hair.  </li>
            <li>After reading the review on Amazon, I had  high expectations, but this razor is definitely at the bottom of my list of razors.</li>
            <li>She told me I would need to ship my entire razor to either New York or California to have it fixed.  </li>
            <li>but I will use no other razor if I have to!</li>
            <li>Have not used wet but dry it does not give a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use it for quick shaves when I didn&#x27;t have time for a full one, but it&#x27;s pointless now as to shave any hair takes 5x as long as a shave in the shower with a regular razor.</li>
            <li>This is fine for a rush job -- I still have a little stubble left after shaving.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long time user of straight razors</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even thought of using an electric shaver for more than 25 years and that experience was not a good one.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give nearly as close of a shave as it says it does, and it barely takes the hair away.</li>
            <li>It does everything she wants, she loves the wet/dry functionality, and the battery lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how long the blades stay sharp but replacements appear to be available.  </li>
            <li>The aesthetics of the trimmer is pretty, but don&#x27;t expect your bikini-lined hairs to be the same length because some will be long while others will be nearly gone.</li>
            <li>this one - July 2014 - and after 5 months, it will barely hold a charge to complete shaving both legs.</li>
            <li>When I opened the first razor and examined the switch I found that although it appeared to be closed it was not making an electrical connection.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying a shaver and after careful consideration I decided on this one</li>
            <li>The angle of the design is perfect; it never seems awkward and the size and weight feel natural - not too heavy or bulky.  </li>
            <li>Oh, it is pretty in pink but in this case screw the color.</li>
            <li>She breaks out normally in the armpit area from regular razors.  </li>
            <li>The price is higher than what I spent 5 years ago, but I think Pansonic&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of Remington&#x27;s but have had some trouble with the last ones (battery not lasting, needing to replace the blades more often</li>
            <li>You also have to get used to going over the same patch a few times, but you can be more leisurely since you can shave while watching TV (if single and live by oneself).</li>
            <li>This little razor does it all and cleans up with just a quick rinse under the faucet.</li>
            <li>first few shaves were decent.</li>
            <li>Luckily I have very thin, light leg</li>
            <li>;) It does seem a bit rough on the skin, but nothing major.</li>
            <li>It seems like the blades get dull VERY quickly, even though the information included with the razor claimed the blades would last at least a year or more before needing to be replaced.</li>
            <li>My legs react badly to regular manual razors, so I needed something new.  </li>
            <li>My current Remington was in need of new blades</li>
            <li>My new men&#x27;s shaver has a longer lasting battery with a battery meter and is &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34; versus &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; for the women&#x27;s shaver.  </li>
            <li>it was almost the same price to replace it as to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>I would buy a new one (since the replacement parts were expensive compared to the price of a new shaver, and the battery wasn&#x27;t holding a charge, and there didn&#x27;t seem to be many options) and repeat the frustration.  </li>
            <li>I did not expect Amazon to send me an open box when it says in the description it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li>, I decided to finally shop for a new one, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on it.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend buying this if you are in the market for a new shaver.</li>
            <li>The new Panasonic simply does not cut, it is flimsy, it makes your legs itchy.</li>

            <li>It provides a very close dry shave without causing any razor burn.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re getting ready for work, running late, and it&#x27;s summertime and the only thing clean you have to wear is a skirt?</li>
            <li>but it was a delicate design that is easily damaged if you put it in your suitcase.  </li>
            <li>Anytime I would shave with a razor I would get ingrown hairs and dry rashes no matter how much I exfoliated or used lotion.</li>
            <li>Did not work very well back to my regular razor</li>
            <li>Battery last sooo much compared to my last one!!</li>
            <li>it will last for as long as the first one.</li>
            <li>Since my teenage years, I&#x27;ve tried numerous cordless/electric and straight blade shavers.  </li>
            <li>It is not as close of a shave as a regular razor, but it is much better than what she has been rocking as of late.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut hair very well, so it requires you to go over the same spot several times and</li>
            <li>has a small head like most shavers so it takes a long time to do your legs.  </li>
            <li>The only potential downside (for some) is that this doesn&#x27;t provide a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Not the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried - that distinction goes to my husband&#x27;s Norelco 5603x, much to his chagrin - but not the worst, either.</li>
            <li>I have contacted the company for repair, and after a long time on hold and extreme difficulty reaching an actual human, found out that my only option for repair is to mail it back (at my own expense) and they will determine IF it can be fixed under warranty.  </li>
            <li>, I charged it fully and then tried shaving, I ran it until the battery died and I hadn&#x27;t made it half way through shaving, not because the battery died quickly, but because it shaved so poorly, this razor is suitable for a child&#x27;s toy, but definitely NOT for a woman to shave her legs with</li>
            <li>have never used an electric shaver before so was a little tentative, especially about using it in the shower and getting it wet, but I read all the directions and now that I have used it a few times, I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I actually purchased a second one after the motor on my first one died out from daily usage.</li>
            <li>So that is a major plus.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product because blade razors usually give me razor bumps.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t want to have to mess with hyper-chlorinated water and freshly shaved</li>
            <li>and I still haven&#x27;t managed to learn to shave without major blood loss, so</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>Have only had it two days, but on the first day I used it dry</li>
            <li>If I were to shave every three days with a typical razor I&#x27;d never have hair longer than right after using this.  </li>
            <li>Was going to fix my old one, but it was more expensive than buying a new one.  </li>
            <li>I was really freaked out by the thought of anything sharp going near my nether regions..</li>
            <li>and it shaves my legs in less than five minutes, close and smooth, completely dry.</li>
            <li>Product lives up to its claims -- is comfortable to hold and use, charges rapidly (which it hardly ever needs) and packs</li>
            <li>When I bought this I thought it was going to be just a cheap electric razor that would hardly work.</li>
            <li>I spent my money on this one and will be going back to Remington even though they cost a little more.</li>
            <li>I use this razor for my underarms since I get really bad razor burn and it works great.</li>
            <li>This is a light, although somewhat delicate, instrument that does what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Took it with me on a long vacation and had to spend too much time trying to put it back together after cleaning it.</li>
            <li>It works very well and has a long lasting charge.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy another Remington on the near future!</li>
            <li>I was careful the whole time, but there was no avoiding it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t hold up very well to a minimal fall.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews of how it plugged directly into the wall, I had already purchased a short extension cord for it to plug into, now it can sit on the counter.</li>
            <li>old daughter who began shaving her legs several months ago.</li>
            <li>so I was not really expecting much from this device.</li>
            <li>razor was a Christmas &#x27;10 present, and it&#x27;s BY FAR</li>
            <li>This barely even removes hair and pulls and snags on any you have.</li>
            <li>It barely cuts hair and I purposely didn&#x27;t shave for a while</li>
            <li>To a point, but really feels rough and scratchy while using, this causing me to procrastinate about shaving.</li>
            <li>The women&#x27;s shaver had stopped working very well since it couldn&#x27;t get fully charged long enough to do both legs, frequently leaving me with only one leg shaved.  </li>
            <li>My old one of 25 years finally died &amp; I had to replace it.  </li>
            <li>Recently, I tried out the bikini trimmer attachment, and it completely tore my bikini area apart.  </li>
            <li>The batteries die frequently and unless you shave your legs from all possible angles, it just leaves your legs stubbly.</li>
            <li>I can barely tell a difference after using this razor.</li>
            <li>My wife barely uses this shaver because it either doesn&#x27;t cut well or cuts her skin.  </li>
            <li>I developed a nickel allergy and could no longer use a regular razor, because none of them are nickel-free or hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>There are also no instructions on the web that I can find on how to replace them - we had to take a tiny screw driver and pry out the old ones.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t last a year and never gave me the close shave that my old Lady Remington shaver did.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I did not return it was because I used the shaving parts on my old one.</li>
            <li>Am surprised that the grown back takes almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>results may not be acceptable for everyone, but if you too have course hair and sensitive skin (and I can&#x27;t be the only one out there), it may work for you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I have only used it once</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no slouch in natural science and it makes no sense to me, either theoretically or in practice.</li>
            <li>It performed the same as my first one; however, the battery does not last as long.</li>
            <li>I finally had to replace my nearly 20 yr.</li>
            <li>This barely cut my hair, in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Very close shave,especially when used wet.</li>
            <li>would definitely not use the bikini attachment or get this thing anywhere near my crotch.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying a 2nd one for my 13-year old daughter</li>
            <li>I only used it once so far</li>
            <li>Felt like you couldn&#x27;t get a close enough shave without taking the guard off completely.</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use a regular razor).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s barely getting any hairs off at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It barely shaves any hair.</li>
            <li>Used it a couple of times then went back to her old razor.</li>
            <li>It turned out that the blade closest to the bikini pop-out trimmer had partially popped out and had given me a pretty big cut.</li>
            <li>So I went to an allergist and they said that when you shave with a razor, you are removing the top layer of your skin and what I am allergic to is therefore irritating that layer of skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slow and don&#x27;t make the skin as smooth as I wish .</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s difficult to tell sometimes how honest the recipient is being.</li>
            <li>Not a great razor, but not horrible.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t dare to hope that an electric razor could do a good job on a three month growth, but I was desperate to try something.  </li>
            <li>but I was actually really surprised how close this got for the first few times I shaved.</li>
            <li>I suppose I should have guessed that the shave from this kind of device would be laughable.</li>
            <li>It has poor quality and maybe I should have invested more money in a shaver or tried another brand.</li>
            <li>I came out more confused and unsure than when I went in.</li>
            <li>The trimmers work really well on longer hair -hey, gimme a break, being on hospital bedrest with a timed limit on your daily showers makes it super hard to shave regularly!  </li>
            <li>Their only solution was to package and ship the item to their Texas location, where it would be examined and repaired if possible, or replaced by a new shaver.</li>
            <li>The razor head moves left to right, up and down, in addition to forward and backwards.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how long the new model lasts...</li>
            <li>Even right after shaving my legs were NOT smooth.  </li>
            <li>have not used the shaver actually in the shower yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; part of the \\&quot;wet &amp; dry\\&quot;, but all in all, the experience I&#x27;ve had with it has been positive.</li>
            <li>After reviewing a few different makes and models of electric razors, I chose this one because it claimed super sharp blades and a very close shave.</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and at first I was worried it would give me a rash especially under my arms, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>in case you were too lazy to read or wanted a quick wrap-up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in case you were too lazy to read or wanted a quick wrap-up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re still left with underarm stubble that grows back twice as fast as using a regular razor because you didn&#x27;t go as low.</li>
            <li>But I really like this for shaving my arms and legs, shaves well due to the pivot head.</li>
            <li>Found this razor to be much quieter than the other one.  </li>
            <li>but now it hardly cuts and I&#x27;ve been diligent with keeping it clean and charged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t too heavy and the vibration isn&#x27;t extreme which is nice for people with arthritis or other issues with hand and arm strength and pain.</li>
            <li>After reading all the good reviews, I thought this would be at least as good, if not better, than my other shaver, but it is sadly lacking.</li>
            <li>I dropped this razor from a height of approximately 3 feet to a hard floor surface and it is still working great.</li>
            <li>the few extra dollars.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are very sharp and the \\&quot;hug your leg\\&quot; feel makes sure you legs are shaved</li>
            <li>Obviously won&#x27;t last as long as shaving with a normal razor</li>
            <li>After using regular blade razors my entire adult life, I wanted to try an electric razor and, on the basis of the favorable reviews here on Amazon, decided on this one.  </li>
            <li>I pulled out his Norelco triple headed Speed XL that was at least 2 years old and had rarely been cleaned or had a blade replacement</li>
            <li>Naturally, the shave isn&#x27;t anywhere near as close as with a disposable razor, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li>Not sure what the bikini attachment is useful for since it barely works and always jams with the slighted amount of hair.</li>
            <li>This small handy razor give close cuts and no more cuts.</li>
            <li>Other than the head, I don&#x27;t know where on a woman&#x27;s body the hair is long enough for the guard to be useful....</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is past the 30 days that I have to make a return to Amazon, and the cost of shipping it back to the manufacturer seems better spent buying regular razors until I can afford another electric razor.</li>
            <li>THOSE hairs you just ripped out will take that long to grow back but there is always new hair coming in, so a once a week session is still in order).  </li>
            <li>I can run this &amp;#34;gem&amp;#34; over a single piece of hair over and over in different directions and WOW, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to cut a thing!!</li>
            <li>It can be hard to tackle them with an inflexible razor or even the bladed ones like the Bic Soleil, which are nice and all but don&#x27;t cover nearly as much surface area.</li>
            <li>So I choose this razor hoping to get the same close smooth shave that I got from the straight razor and boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li>My other not cheap shavers would need me to shave 2 or 3 times longer and not feel as smooth or leave stray hairs.</li>
            <li>I have called Panasonic and apparently their phones are not working properly</li>
            <li>I have only used it once, it pulls your hair if your not careful.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it for long, but it suits my purposes so far.</li>
            <li>No long cords.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my old one died but lasted quite a long time and was made sturdy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had much success with electric razors in the past</li>
            <li>i wish it had an indicator for full charge instead of the fixed light that indicates &#x27;connected&#x27; :( )</li>
            <li>Now I usually don&#x27;t pay a lot for them but this purchase was worth it.</li>
            <li>and I wish I had bought one the first time before I wasted my money on another company&#x27;s electric razor.</li>
            <li>at least 4 full leg shaves.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The ability to shave dry is life changing - I can shave easily whenever and wherever I want with minimal fuss and mess.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier than getting up and down out of the bathtub or balancing on one leg in the shower when agility is diminished by age.  </li>
            <li>Not that the shaver is defective or there is anything wrong with it, I just have very fine hair on my legs, which caused it to miss a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li>-- It is one small box that has a plug built right into the box.  </li>
            <li>So far have just used twice dry...</li>
            <li>Totally surprised at how well it works in the shower with shave gel as well as dry.</li>
            <li>Although this product is value priced delivers a very close shave, it broke in less than 6 months.</li>
            <li>shave is not super close (though I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to be).&lt;br</li>
            <li>then I would doing my whole bottom half of one leg with the razor.</li>
            <li>The efficiency saved so much time, and I feel like my shaves are probably half the time</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s close enough to not see the armpit black pots from a certain distance.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I got unlucky--after about 6 months the shaver would barely hold a charge for a few hours (and yes, I generally take good care of my electronics, not leaving them plugged in all the time, and only charging them fully--overnight or for several hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several electric shavers and this particular razor works extremely well.  </li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;ve tried all the other brands, and no other comes close to the shave quality and comfort of this shaver for sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>We bought this to replace my Wife&#x27;s old Shaver (same model - lasted 11 years).Hopefully, this will last as long.</li>
            <li>So far, I have only used it dry</li>
            <li>I treated the shaver gently, stored it in a dry place and cleaned it carefully once a month.  </li>
            <li>You really can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li>It becomes even less useful as a wet razor.</li>
            <li>It really comes down to a personal decision of what works and doesn&#x27;t work for each individual person.  </li>
            <li>Recently I figured out if you make short up and down strokes and go around and around the leg in a spiral, the shave is much closer</li>
            <li>I have not experienced any irritation so far and find that shaving with this is rather quick and pain-free.  </li>
            <li>I was unable to get a smooth shave dry, and it was unconfortable to get shave the whole leg.</li>
            <li>It works very well wet or dry and requires only a fee passes to get all underarm</li>
            <li>I still use it on my knees and armpits because the Remington I bought to replace (wet/dry with the aloe vera strip) cuts me pretty badly in those areas but does an OK job on flat parts of my legs.  </li>
            <li>Would really like a little closer shave, but all in all it does well.</li>
            <li>I am extremely thorough in my quest for a new product--from cleaning products to shavers.  </li>
            <li>The first dry shave was satisfactory although not as close as the shave achieved with my previous electric razor.</li>
            <li>It seemed to go dull VERY quickly - I now have to turn it around backwards and use the other trimming blade to accomplish anything at all.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even give a decently close shave without pressing down, and even then, it&#x27;s inconsistent and stubbly.</li>
            <li>The charger is small and you just engage the shaver to it so that is also does not take up very much room</li>
            <li>I am not sure whether this malfunction was a very rare exception or not (judging by other reviews, it seems like it may be),but</li>
            <li>I can definitely live with that, and I&#x27;ve had the same problem with every other electric I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>For me, it is well worth paying that little extra for when unknown problems arise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor shaves pretty close leaving very little stubble.</li>
            <li>Not as quick and efficient at cutting as my previous Lady Shave by Phillips but that one lasted so long that I&#x27;m sure they don&#x27;t make the same model anymore.</li>
            <li>my pubic area because my boyfriend is not at all fond of too much &amp;#34;grass&amp;#34; down there!  </li>
            <li>(And the recharge is blazing fast - no more leaving my shaver charging overnight to barely get one decent shave before the motor is slowing down.)  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a manual razor due to constant razor burns, etc.  </li>
            <li>I had gotten a Remmington when I first went to college, but was never very pleased with the results - did not hold a charge long enough, gave me lots of nicks and abrasions, especially at the back of the knee -</li>
            <li>The reviews weren&#x27;t bad, the product description was good</li>
            <li>Tried few times not shaving clear so back to old way again</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This shaver works GREAT!</li>
            <li> The ones that worked the best, of course, were the disposable razors but the use of these leads to in-grown hairs and causes severe itchy re-growth.  </li>

            <li> What I like about it is that I get a very good shave, but don&#x27;t have to go through all of the fuss of using shaving cream and razors.  </li>
            <li> I have found the battery life to be very good, as I always leave mine off the charger.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a very good job at all.  </li>
            <li> It is very good product.</li>
            <li> It is  a shame because the shaver is very good otherwise.</li>

            <li> Very good item and deal.</li>
            <li> great and the tilting head is impressive.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it touches and if you use it under your arms, you are in for incredible pain.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver and does a great job.</li>
            <li> but it does the job very nicely, the best electric shaver I have had.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s great to take on trips.</li>
            <li> Nothing great.</li>
            <li> I does not give a close shave when used as a razor but the guard for the trimmer is great.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great</li>
            <li> wasn;t happy about the trimmer peice you can raise up</li>
            <li> Although I was happy with the shaver when I used it, after two uses it did not turn on at all or if it did, it stopped after a minute.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  </li>

            <li> This Panasonic women&#x27;s shaver is a great buy.</li>
            <li> great product.</li>
            <li> Yup, this thing is great, and no bumps or \\&quot;owies\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It also does a great job of underarms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> An optional \\&quot;extension cord\\&quot; for those situations would be a great benefit (ATTN:</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative.  </li>
            <li> - she&#x27;s happy with the way that it shaves.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> The charger conveniently fits into the power outlet vertical or horizontal, which is great if you (like me) have sideways outlets.  </li>
            <li> and it does a great job of getting the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was tempted to return it, but I don&#x27;t think my pits have ever been so happy, so I&#x27;m keeping it.</li>
            <li> a year or two ago and was happy with it</li>

            <li> shave is great</li>
            <li> I had this shaver for 2 weeks, was happy with the closeness.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with product .</li>
            <li> Even the bikini area groomer wasn&#x27;t all that great.  </li>
            <li> We are both happy.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is great....</li>

            <li> I was happy with it until the battery weakened.</li>
            <li> It gives a great, close shave.</li>
            <li> She also experienced some hair pulling when using it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> offered to return it, but she felt it was still great for legs.  </li>
            <li> The shaver does work great day-to-day for grooming.</li>
            <li> lol, like I did.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> Great results.</li>
            <li> The swivel head seems like a great idea</li>
            <li> Figured it would be a great time saver.</li>
            <li> I hope this is an exception to an otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> The bikini attachment is great also.  </li>

            <li> This product is a great shaver.  </li>

            <li> Great for underarms legs and grooming</li>
            <li> The trimmer attachment is great as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: As others have mentioned, this shaver misses tons of hairs.</li>
            <li> Sellers part was great.</li>
            <li> Keep it charged when not using it so haven&#x27;t experienced performance issues.</li>
            <li> and it still works great.</li>
            <li> Battery life is great.</li>

            <li> Does a great job.</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> Like the swivel head - does a great job around the knees.</li>

            <li> I was happy with it.</li>
            <li> The shave isnt as great as i would like it to be.</li>
            <li> Works great on under arms.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase however, because it trims what it needs to trim so that I can wear a swimsuit without...</li>
            <li> The bikini attachment is great too -</li>
            <li> Have used this item for years and still works great.</li>
            <li> It works great on her legs too.  </li>

            <li> so thought this razor would be very handy.  </li>
            <li> The flexibility of the head is very nice and the handle feels ergonomically designed.  </li>
            <li> This shaver works very nicely.  </li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality.</li>
            <li> two pivoting heads are very nice for those bumps and folds all bodies have.</li>
            <li> it works amazing!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing shaver, ladies!</li>
            <li> Durable and amazing. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> The price was amazing too!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been amazing ever since... who would have known!  </li>
            <li> Otherwise amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most impressed with,</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pull hairs, great power, good charge, and</li>
            <li> In use, shaves off the hair perfectly, without the hassle of razor burn :)</li>
            <li> Outstanding quality - awesome price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works great!!</li>
            <li> The shaver is nice!</li>
            <li> Now, my razor is always in its own slot when I need it!</li>
            <li> Good electric shaver, great features.</li>
            <li> But before it died, I loved using it in the shower, worked great everywhere.</li>
            <li> I tried this one after reading many reviews and agree it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Great product and good delivery time</li>
            <li> I love this razor- the pivoting head is perfect for legs.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST one I could find after reviewing many electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how effective it is!</li>
            <li> My daughter enjoyed this purchase and said it was the best razor that she ever had.  </li>
            <li> it is very handy and keeps a good charge.</li>
            <li> My wife says it&#x27;s very easy to use and does a very good job.</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase for the price it has worked</li>
            <li> When deciding to purchase an electric razor, you have to remember that you will get a good shave</li>
            <li> For the price this is a good razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I wanted an electric razor even though I realized the results would not be as good as with a razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the one I used to have that died after 10 years or so.</li>
            <li> (All Good equipment with batteries tells you to do that.)</li>
            <li> It has the \\&quot;GOOD HOUSEKEEPING\\&quot; seal of approval on it.</li>
            <li> (But then if it were, I doubt it would be as good of a product.)</li>
            <li> I have own Panasonic shavers before and it is great to have as a backup</li>
            <li> and we both thought it was good.</li>
            <li> It looks like it would do a good job, but it does not do a good job.  </li>
            <li> I picked this one cause of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Good choice all around.</li>
            <li> Shaver works as good as I expect for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> close shave, keeps a good charge.</li>
            <li> Panasonic fit my needs perfectly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be making the mistake of buying this shaver again, no matter HOW good it was in the beginning.</li>
            <li> This one had good reviews on Consumer Reports, so I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Remington it replaced.</li>
            <li> it would not be fair of me to comment either way.  </li>
            <li> it would not be fair of me to comment either way.  </li>
            <li> battery life is good.  </li>
            <li> it is almost as good as a  blade, but is easier to use.</li>
            <li> had never tried electric shaving, but this Panasonic shaver is inexpensive and has some good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> but does a good job</li>
            <li> I LOVED THE WAY</li>
            <li> There were a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li> This electric razor is good, not great.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> I had been looking everywhere for a good women&#x27;s electric razor and couldn&#x27;t find anything.  </li>
            <li> I went on a hunt for a good razor, hoping that I could find one that would give me a close</li>
            <li> You would assume that the pivoting head on this razor would be a GOOD thing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies, if you are looking for a good, close shave out of an electric razor, don&#x27;t buy this one...get the cheaper one without the pivoting head.  </li>
            <li> Is it wonderful for a girl just getting comfortable with shaving and does it do an acceptable job of it?</li>
            <li> The razor did do a good job for her when it was working though.</li>
            <li> and she loved it.  </li>
            <li> It works great and the razor itself is nice too.  </li>
            <li> When I broke the foil on my Remington (which I LOVED)</li>
            <li> I loved my Remington</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good in a pinch...</li>
            <li> As a shaver, I suppose this is as good as you can get with an electric.  </li>
            <li> and it feels good in my hand.</li>
            <li> To use on the legs its good, but again to get around the knees</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cut me which was good</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> &gt; the good part</li>
            <li> battery still holds a good</li>
            <li> like using the Bikini trimmer, she lets me do that - works good...</li>
            <li> does not do me much good but using it in the shower is beneficial.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> not as good as the one I had before.  </li>
            <li> Fair price if it was really good.</li>
            <li> Keeps a good charge and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> Best comfortable razor.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor</li>
            <li> I am the husband and used a mans electric Braun Series 3 340 and have it for years and it cuts close and the ladies shaver I purchased it because it had good ratings.</li>
            <li> Still looking for a good electric razor, would not recommend  this one at all.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d believe the good reviews but that was a mistake.</li>
            <li> She tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington wet/dry trimmer that I loved, until it stopped working out of nowhere.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve gotten one good shave out of this thing.</li>
            <li> It works but not as good as you would expect it to</li>
            <li> I loved it.  </li>
            <li> It was just as good as using a disposable razor and did not cause any itchy re-growth.  </li>
            <li> it does a really good job.</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> They loved it &amp; plan to purchase one as well.</li>
            <li> This razor does not do a good job at all.</li>
            <li> I loved this shaver until it died 6 months after I bought it.</li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a good charge either.</li>
            <li> so if you are looking for a good shaver this would be it.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Bought this because the reviews stated it was a good shaver.  </li>
            <li> anyway, its good.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I still get a fairly close shave.  </li>
            <li> This one works well and is a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> dose a good job for the price.</li>
            <li> Was packaged good when shipped.</li>
            <li> Good for those of us</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to keep going over and over your leg to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t women get a razor that shaves as good as a man?</li>
            <li> If you can get it for under $25 you&#x27;re getting a good deal</li>
            <li> good buy</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic electric razor and loved it.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for a year and the battery is longer keeping a good charge.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s not as good as a blade shaver</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still really good.</li>
            <li> It holds a good charge and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Almost as good as the husbands shaver.  </li>
            <li> Must be good, I gave it as a Christmas gift and it has been used with no complaints.  </li>
            <li> It was nice to hear her happy about a gift that I bought her.</li>
            <li> This shaver is as good as any disposable/venus type razors out there.</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver to just have.  </li>
            <li> The flip up side burn trimmer is a good feature for my husband.</li>
            <li> I have really loved this razor.</li>
            <li> Maybe you just need to have finer hair for it to be of good use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No where close to being a good shaver.</li>
            <li> I am olive complected and have fairly course hair</li>
            <li> At times it feels like it is not doing a good job although it does shave well.  </li>
            <li> Worked well for two years then fell apart despite good care.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of patience to get a good close shave.</li>
            <li> The battery life seems good.</li>
            <li> The handy recharging device that plugs into the outlet is great.</li>
            <li> I have fair hair and fair skin.</li>
            <li> Swivel head seems like a good feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the price was good .</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loved it..</li>
            <li> The trimmer doesn&#x27;t do a good job at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as advertised.</li>
            <li> She loved it.</li>
            <li> For trimming and leaving hair it is good.  </li>
            <li> Every woman needs a reliable good shaver and this one fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Does a good job.  </li>
            <li> surprisingly nice close smooth shave!!!</li>
            <li> Shaver is awesome; well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is wet/dry and each method performs beautifully.</li>
            <li> She is very pleased with this product and she would recommend it to any one in need of a good shaving device.</li>
            <li> Perfect for when I need a quick shave.</li>
            <li> The shaver arrived quickly and works perfectly just like its predecessor.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair on my legs and it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.</li>
            <li> The best part though and what I am really (really!!)</li>
            <li> IT CHARGE&#x27;S QUICKLY AND SEEMS TO HOLD CHARGE FOR NEEDED LENGTH OF TIME FOR USING IT!!!  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but was happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> My wife is very satisfied with the preformance</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> All in all, very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> After going through a great panasonic electric razor, I thought this was going to be a sure bet.</li>
            <li> My wife use it all the time and is very pleased</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it</li>

            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used an electric shaver for years and am very pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> it works great and will be a great razor for in between full shaves in the shower</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did, it works great.</li>
            <li> Wife is very pleased with the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I was nervous about buying this as some of the reviews weren&#x27;t great, but I love it.</li>
            <li> The pivoting head feature is a great idea, as it makes shaving much more forgivable and seems to reduce irritation.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet, but it&#x27;s great to be able to rinse it under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, no irritation!  </li>
            <li> I have dropped it soooo many times and it turns on an works great.</li>
            <li> great product, i wish it had a more closer shave</li>
            <li> Very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so very glad that I did.  </li>

            <li> Decided to try was very pleased</li>
            <li> She had never used a electric shaver before an is very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I find it works best dry, and it doesn&#x27;t give you the perfect up close shave.</li>
            <li> The price was right, and the razor works wonderfully!  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice razor and I love that it is flexible.</li>
            <li> My razor came when promised, it charged quickly, and does a really nice job!!</li>

            <li> This shaver provides a good close shave and is very easy to use .</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> The trimmer part I love!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more convenient!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on legs and bikini area for about two months and am very pleased and quite impressed with the close shave - never expected the great results I get.  </li>
            <li> It works well which is more than I can say for the one I replaced!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I just wish she would use it more often!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> So I thought if i bought this, it wouldn&#x27;t shave off that top layer!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the bikini feature!  </li>
            <li> I decided to get it based on the reviews - I sure wish I hadn&#x27;t now!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this shaver!  </li>

            <li> I love this shaver!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>

            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be mored pleased!  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t shave often but compared to what I was going through with my allergy, this is WAY better!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> then use the shaver just to be safe!</li>
            <li> first, I was very happy with it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
            <li> ES2216PC is not just for the ladies any more!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this shaver!  </li>
            <li> Now I love it!</li>
            <li> and this one does 10x better job than the one I had before!  </li>
            <li> These things should give you more than a year!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> this was an impluse purchase, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> so I decided to go with this Panasonic and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this shaver!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will still love it a year from now!  </li>
            <li> Ideally, the reason I purchased this is that the cost of blades for Venus and Gilette shavers has skyrocketed, and even shopping at Costco anymore has become super pricey for replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Although we did not need the item and returned, the service was great and we were refunded for the product very quickly.</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave, easy to handle, and great in the shower.</li>
            <li> great razor easy to use and reliable</li>
            <li> It is great for underarms, it seems to move around curves easily.  </li>
            <li> panasonic is a great tread mark... was arrive very quickly...</li>
            <li> As a positive this razor had an excellent battery life.</li>
            <li> Very nice product easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> Leaves legs feeling smooth and works great under arms too.  </li>
            <li> Amazing, is the word I would use to describe this razor.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> I use it on the bikini and underarm area with amazing results.  </li>
            <li> But Amazon is amazing,</li>
            <li> The shaver is great and I feel free of the dread of shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> It is amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice I can use it in the shower without a problem.</li>
            <li> I got a nice close shave...</li>
            <li> I have a nice close shave when finished without all the nicks.</li>
            <li> Panasonic must have own people writing them....</li>
            <li> I honestly thought I&#x27;d use it a couple of times and never touch it again...</li>
            <li> And honestly, even at the &#x27;1&#x27; setting, since it still has the mesh cover on, it didn&#x27;t cut anything.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s nice to not need to sit beside an electrical outlet to use it.</li>
            <li> Story:&lt;br /&gt;I came from a remington WDF3500 razor and I liked it</li>
            <li> No razor burn, no irritated skin, and best of all a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Based on the many great reviews of the Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver with Bikini Attachment, I decided to purchase this shaver and boy am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li> glad i read all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> But then I used it in the shower and that was really nice.  </li>
            <li> cannot speak to the longevity yet, but the blades do a nice job</li>
            <li> It keeps it out of the way, but still handy.  </li>
            <li> in all works nice, the battery seem to work for 45 min at one go.</li>
            <li> Even thought this product got so many good reviews...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a spectacular job on my pits.  </li>
            <li> I also liked the fact that I could shave my legs before I got into the shower, which saves water.</li>
            <li> it gives me the absolute best shave!!!!&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> good for the price made of mostly plastic</li>
            <li> as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I hope one day, the industry can make women shaver comparable to men&#x27;s shaver that has nice dual blades for shaving close and is made of good quality (many of those for men in the market)</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice looking wet-dry shaver.</li>
            <li> Received in a reasonable time and in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li> Pop-up trimmer comes in handy somewhat for already \\&quot;trimmed\\&quot; areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> what kind of products I use to shave with.</li>
            <li> Nice charger also...does not take up room like others.</li>
            <li> but she liked the way it shaved her legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked about it:  </li>
            <li> It is a nice razor, and I like the fact that it is a wet/dry electric razor.</li>
            <li> It is handy it does give a nice shave.</li>
            <li> Performs nicely, even in &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; areas.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver based on the excellent reviews, and to switch from a Remington that didn&#x27;t shave very closely.</li>
            <li> But I have really liked this razor for what it is.</li>
            <li> Performs nicely for my wife.  </li>
            <li> I like a nice close shave and figured I&#x27;d have to give that up by switching to an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I like the closeness of the shave without getting to close, They are convenient to use and handy as well.</li>
            <li> However, my sister tried it on her legs, and she liked it a lot</li>
            <li> The bikini trimmer is not all that effective</li>
            <li> Durable, effective: would buy again.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a closer shave to be honest..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s wet/dry</li>
            <li> Nice close shave and no irritation.  </li>
            <li> The charger is kind of a pain.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice to have a cord</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any kind of indicator that shows battery</li>
            <li> have used it under my arms and it gives a nice close shave there too.</li>
            <li> did not shave as close as I would have liked</li>
            <li> When her birthday arrived this year, I bought her a Panasonic Shaver of her own.  </li>
            <li> Works Great, nice attachment and leaves skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> I liked the pivoting head as you shaved.  </li>
            <li> Nice shaver.</li>
            <li> I really liked this shaver until the battery stopped holding a charge after about 11 weeks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery time is good, charging time OK</li>
            <li> but it would be nice to have some lights to indicated level of charge</li>
            <li> I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Nice product made for ladies.  </li>
            <li> gives a nicely close shave and the bikini attachment</li>
            <li> is nice for trimming as needed.</li>
            <li> Being charitable, if you shave every day, maybe this would work.  </li>
            <li> It was nice to have it up and out of the way for charging in the outlet that I did plug it into, though.</li>
            <li> I really liked it.</li>
            <li> It kind of reminds me of EZ-bake oven..  </li>
            <li> Handy and waterproof.</li>
            <li> She really liked it, our daughter &amp;#34;borrowed it&amp;#34; and loves it too.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to buy a nice razor for myself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest...</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and razor works great!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s handy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x60;s nice to use in the winter months, when one might let herself &#x27;go&#x27; between shavings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x60;s nice to touch up when one does not feel like taking the time in shower to shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gives a nice shave&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> The somewhat flexible head is a nice feature for going over knees and toes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not as close as I&#x27;d have liked, even from an electric razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was durable, and worked well in water, I liked how it charged with no wires, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Nice modifications for feminine body.</li>
            <li> There are not that many good electric razors out there for women</li>
            <li> It gives a nice close shave, as close as you can get without a razor.</li>
            <li> great product  great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular, just an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> that I ever liked this one.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull the skin and gave me a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> and she says it does a nice job.</li>
            <li> The amount of energy I&#x27;ve saved (water energy from not having to be in the shower, and my own energy by not having to lather up).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping, quality product!!!</li>
            <li> The original idea to purchase came as one of my granddaughters was turning 12 and had expressed great interest in shaving her legs.</li>
            <li> but it was decent at best.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this shaver and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great for helping her have a safe, easy way to shave.</li>
            <li> Although this is not a replacement for shaving altogether for me, it works great in the shower as an in-between shaves, don&#x27;t need to be 100% silky smooth, just don&#x27;t want ppl to be able to see hair, kind of shave.</li>
            <li> This works great, its true it doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor, but it does a pretty good job!</li>
            <li> trimmer &amp; attachment works great, when wet is best.</li>
            <li> That said, I think this product is great for quick and convenient shaves out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This is a great item to quickly take care of bikini areas or legs before heading to the beach.  </li>
            <li> Good Product., easy to use, convenient in size.  </li>
            <li> What a great thing for in between and quick shaves.</li>
            <li> my sister really loved using it ,easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Good to have, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great for quick leg shaving</li>
            <li> great for quick fixes/shaves.</li>
            <li> This works great for quick shaves.</li>
            <li> I have had my fair share of electric razors and this one is definitely one of the best!  </li>
            <li> It does a good job, but doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to use</li>
            <li> sit is a very strong &#x27;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is very easy as the heads pop on and off.</li>
            <li> Very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> If I were able to do a back-flip from excitement, I surely would!</li>
            <li> BUT FOR MY MONEY ITS ABOUT THE SECOND BEST THING TO A FULL WAX!!!</li>
            <li> It does not do as good a job as a razor but works just fine.</li>
            <li> Great shaver....very nice design and very gentle to use...</li>
            <li> This is worth the money and a great purchase.  </li>
            <li> As far as electronic razors go, this is the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> A close smooth shave, looked like a good wax</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with the replacement as there is no doubt that it delivers a closer shave than its predecessor did.</li>
            <li> I have owned two of these and this one is by far the best one yet.</li>
            <li> Would have liked it better if it had a stand to put it on when recharging instead of sticking it on an outlet.  </li>
            <li> But this one is by FAR the Best Shaver I&#x27;ve owned!!</li>
            <li> She is quite pleased and plans on getting our daughters their own.</li>
            <li> This one is getting closer, but I&#x27;ll bet if I bought a nice men&#x27;s shaver that it would work better than any ladies shaver on the market.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor that I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> And it does work on your face, but honestly, my husbands 3 headed electric razor works better for my face and does not irritate me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had electric shavers before, but this is by far the BEST</li>
            <li> It is by far the best electric razor I have owned.  </li>
            <li> I had been using an old mens Braun shaver with a cord so this seemed wonderful.  </li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best one I have used.  </li>
            <li> By far the BEST razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I initially liked it better than I do now.</li>
            <li> She is very pleased and so am I because We found the \\&quot;Best of the Best\\&quot;, finally.</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with this shaver, because it&#x27;s easily cleaned and it works really well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and keeps you well groomed!</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> easy to handle and clean---arthritic hands are a bear!  </li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used an elec razor, and it&#x27;s very easy &amp; does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great little machine at a great price!</li>
            <li> But overall, I find the Panasonic shaver does a very good job providing a fairly close shave.  </li>
            <li> Great product, after using other electric shavers this one is the best.close shaves and no nicks or pulling would recommend this to eveyone with sensitive skin!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great, great quality and the batteries last forever.  </li>
            <li> The unit itself is attractive, and I liked it over all, it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> I like it alot more than my old one.&lt;br /&gt;Just perfect! !!!!</li>
            <li> My first razor worked great for about 2 months and then stopped holding a charge.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with how comfortable the shave is from this razor.</li>
            <li> This is a great improvement over my first razor.</li>
            <li> This is the first Panasonic electric shaver I have ever owned; and, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> So, this is my first electric razor, really happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty happy with this item.</li>
            <li> and at first I was really happy with it.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge great and is quick and easy to recharge.  </li>
            <li> And if there are any fine hairs, just forget it!</li>
            <li> Legs and underarms are very smooth after using the product.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li> but over all it makes my legs look very smooth.  </li>
            <li> It also makes them very smooth.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> a cancer surviver it is very important I don&#x27;t get cut</li>
            <li> The results are very smooth (even with thicker hair)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave legs very smooth</li>
            <li> My wife says she loves how the shaver moves over her legs, very comfortable... loves it.</li>
            <li> I also liked that it easily attached to the cordless, plug-in</li>
            <li> the hand nicely and easy to carry when going away.</li>
            <li> Good for a quick leg touch up on the go but</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a super smooth close shave, go with a manual razor, otherwise this is great on the go.</li>
            <li> Amazon price was excellent and I appreciated the super saver</li>
            <li> It cleans easily and has a pop up blade for armpits, which is the most effective tool I have used ever for that area.  </li>
            <li> As a woman of a certain age, this is great to buzz around my face once or twice a week between facials.  </li>
            <li> but it sure is nice for a quick cleanup!</li>
            <li> It is so quick and easy to use!!</li>
            <li> Does not shave any more</li>
            <li> Love the compact way it recharges, no cord.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have mostly used this on trips.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Product is ok.</li>
            <li> who cares about shaving :)</li>
            <li> , it gives good shaves, and it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Love the bikini attachment too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the hope that it would be better and easier than a razor, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I got this more as a trimmer than a razor.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> I have had others that gave a closer shave but paid much more.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten so many nicks.</li>
            <li> I feel I got a better shave on legs/</li>
            <li> may you ladies enjoy like I am!</li>
            <li> WHOO-WHO! :-)</li>
            <li> Much better than any electric razor</li>
            <li> Versus using a razor, I think this shaver gives better results.  </li>
            <li> The charger sits nicely on the counter with the extension cord I bought for it, but even if I did not have the cord, the unit snaps securely in the charger and dose not fall out unless you were to knock it onto something.</li>
            <li> : I was able to purchase an extended warranty for two years for an additional nine dollars.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> As someone else has pointed out the plastic tabs that holds the blades are raised up more than the blades are.  </li>
            <li> Her long-time favorite electric shaver, a version of the Norelco LadyShave, has been discontinued and hers is no longer holding a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t any better.  </li>
            <li> but i love using this for those days when i just don&#x27;t feel like shaving.</li>
            <li> so I guess it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so good, easy to clean and</li>
            <li> I love these shavers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone can ask for more.</li>
            <li> Quite pleased with it for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver -</li>
            <li> WE BOTH LOVE THEM.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SHAVER...</li>
            <li> It does not produce a baby-smooth finish, but like many people have said you&#x27;ll get a result which is like about 12-24 hours after a razor shave.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sooooo much better.</li>
            <li> Since the idea of giving her a razor with actual blades was inconceivable, this razor was considered one of the best out there.  </li>
            <li> her favorite razor ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but instead of running a cord to the razor, the razor snaps in to the top of the plug itself.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok when you don&#x27;t have a lot of time.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I went over the hair, I still had stubble.</li>
            <li> I had better luck when i tried it in the shower with shaving cream, but it was still just so-</li>
            <li> It is better than the Clio, but still bulkier than a disposable blade razor, and not as close.  </li>
            <li> even that they have maintained the quality but not being able to get my hands on one</li>
            <li> It is better than the Clio, but still bulkier than a disposable blade razor, and not as close.  </li>
            <li> even that they have maintained the quality but not being able to get my hands on one</li>
            <li> got a closer and better shaver with my boyfriends</li>
            <li> Love the pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li> i am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have never been a big fan of electric shavers for women, but the Panasonic ES2216PC is probably one of the best I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li> I am in love, Love, LOVE with this Panasonic women&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li> but I noticed that my hair growth is more faster</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> Love it, bought it for my daughter for x-mas</li>
            <li> thought about going with a men&#x27;s razor - it seems like there ought to be something snazzy you get for 10x the price (literally, many men&#x27;s razors do cost 10x what this one costs).  </li>
            <li> Given that women shave more of their bodies than men it surprises me that there aren&#x27;t better shaving options for women.  </li>
            <li> Great item, you will get a very close shave every time.  </li>
            <li> Neither way seems to work better.</li>
            <li> but I was really satisfied with the results of this</li>
            <li> in fact the lighter the touch, the better.  </li>
            <li> It works okay</li>
            <li> It is an okay product.  </li>
            <li> I especially liked how quiet it was.</li>
            <li> It shaves even better in the shower with a shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Remington is much better in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> And it took too many passes.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you did.  </li>
            <li> That gives you a nice smooth movement with the shaver for the varied terrain of your valley.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am okay with this shaver, but it could be better.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off paying more and getting a men&#x27;s Panasonic razor instead.</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch to an electric razor to save time (and also because it is supposed to be better for ingrown hairs).</li>
            <li> In either case simply touching the metal contacts allowed the razor head, which was still attached and in my hand to run.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I had been looking at many stores for this item but none of them carry it anymore.</li>
            <li> but at this price I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> razor works much better on the leg area.</li>
            <li> product feels like it was made much more for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> I did, however, like the shaver, so I decided to give this model one more chance.</li>
            <li> a thousand times better than the philips , braun  and the remingtons Ive tried all of them</li>
            <li> My manual dissposables are better than this over priced shaver.</li>
            <li> I saw it and thought she would just love having a &amp;#34;Pretty Shaver&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It is okay for the price.</li>
            <li> I imagine with some time, I could get better at shaving</li>
            <li> can tell you, though, that now that I have used this shaver, I will use a shaver forever more.</li>
            <li> It does an okay job.</li>
            <li> I love having the freedom of using it wet/dry to shave.</li>
            <li> i think razor is easier than this.search more for better product.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and comfy without razor bumps!</li>
            <li> My scissors does a better job</li>
            <li> a not-so-close shave was okay.</li>
            <li> I spend MORE TIME going over one spot</li>
            <li> Wasting more time.</li>
            <li> Resorted to waxing and I am way happier now :)</li>
            <li> (knowing I have no allergic reaction), I find myself more often than not using this electric razor.</li>
            <li> Yes it costs more</li>
            <li> or so you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> You have great legs and people really notice them and then as you sip your coffee you notice some stray hairs or stubble.</li>
            <li> It takes her more time to do her legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I probably have coarser hair on my legs than most ladies, and this shaver did not cut it at all.  </li>
            <li> love the charging station</li>
            <li> Even if this shaver does not stand the test of time, I am already a convert and will research a more premium model.</li>
            <li> (while I do love the revamped design and the stylish mauve charging dock).</li>
            <li> However, that is just the blades getting deeper and grabbing more of the hairs, and I would never trade that up.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why I have been using those cheap disposable razors all these years!  </li>
            <li> This item worked ok as a razor for my legs (even though it wasn&#x27;t a close shave), but the bikini attachment is a joke.  </li>
            <li> This is great.my wife is enjoying the fact that she dosent  get cut</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased with my purchase of the Panasonic ES2216PC Electric Razor.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor...</li>
            <li> I love this charger.</li>
            <li> okay for the time it worked,</li>
            <li> You can probably do better.</li>
            <li> but it did a better job than this one.  </li>
            <li> (I had just switched from an epilator so anything felt better)  </li>
            <li> (Even then, I still have more &amp;#34;prickles&amp;#34; than I can stand)</li>
            <li> I like the charger stand (it plugs into an outlet and the razor stands on top).</li>
            <li> My mother used to have an electric razor from 20 years ago that worked better...</li>
            <li> After reading many glowing reviews, I was satisfied with going ahead to make the purchase.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it works as well as the rest.</li>
            <li> I have used several electric razors over the years and this one is excellent.  </li>
            <li> Sherry:)</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Seems that it is also better made than the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have to go over my legs many times.</li>
            <li> this one is a good powerful product and I&#x27;m really satisfied with my purchase .</li>
            <li> Also, great because it&#x27;s so fast for shaving if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li> OK, I dont know anything about the batteries of this item...</li>
            <li> therefore her life just got waaayyy better.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> and I am able to shave my legs with a razor every week if I want.</li>
            <li> *most* of the stubble.</li>
            <li> I say most because it never provided a close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver several months ago, and it was the very best electronic shaver I have ever had</li>
            <li> bought this because she would get rashes from using a regular shaver, this has been the best thing for her</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to save time, water, and to get a better shave.</li>
            <li> If you had a Venus or Gillette in your hand, you atleast had better control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m particularly pleased with being able to use it in or out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> Shaved using it and shaving cream and was really pleased at how closely it shaved.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver I am on blood thinner</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out why it does this.</li>
            <li> Skip this and just by a better men&#x27;s electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Love the shave and comfort of this razor.  </li>
            <li> It broke into many pieces and the blades all came apart and the plastic snapped.</li>
            <li> Beaver never so smooth!  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li> It also does a better job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor isn&#x27;t magic.</li>
            <li> I love the pivoting head part esp for going over the knees and underarms.</li>
            <li> Does ok on underarms but</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this shaver and look forward to using it over and over again.  </li>
            <li> I was able to shave 3 times on one charge.  </li>
            <li> im glad i invested in it.</li>
            <li> and I have been very happy with it and plan to take it overseas with me later this year.</li>
            <li> but this one is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Purchase this one which is better quality at a lower price.</li>
            <li> Now they both use it and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I hope you would look for a better shaver given the price of this one.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.</li>
            <li> Just glad I decided to take a chance on this one.</li>
            <li> okay&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this model 3 times (it seems to last 2-3 years before it no longer holds a charge) and have always been very happy with the quality of shave it delivers.  </li>
            <li> It seems to shave OK</li>
            <li> To be on the safe side I always charge it for 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you register with Panasonic so the warranty will be valid.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.</li>
            <li> Works better than anticipated.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Glad I took a chance with it.</li>
            <li> Works ok</li>
            <li> It did an ok job while it lasted,(4 MONTHS).</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t look much better in the end.</li>
            <li> Corded items like this always work better than cordless, but I couldn&#x27;t even find a corded razor so had to go with this one.</li>
            <li> Great to use...doesn&#x27;t get a really close shave</li>
            <li> This makes it much more packable.</li>
            <li> I am pleased and recommend this product for price and performance</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and now I use it more than she does.</li>
            <li> One of the reviews mentioned getting scratched from the plastic casing around the top of the razor.  </li>
            <li> love the wet/dry function.  </li>
            <li> The shaver head is much more mobile than I had imagined</li>
            <li> I purchased it without realizing it was panasonic &amp; its an ok shaver.</li>
            <li> I love the attached bikini trimmer, too.</li>
            <li> but I have always had nice smooth skin after an electric shave.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s used to using a disposable razor which I&#x27;m sure would cut closer.  </li>
            <li> However once I used it found that it pulls the hair, it does not cut them and it irritates my skin more then a razor, I had used a Remington shaver for years but it was time to replace</li>
            <li> I was 100% satisfied with the Wet/Dry Shaver.</li>
            <li> I love this razor for my underarms.</li>
            <li> I also have an Emjoy epilator - which I LOVE, but I wanted something I could take with me on camping trips.</li>
            <li> I started growing chin hairs in my 40s, &amp; after years of plucking every day, more &amp; more each year, a girlfriend told me about the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Epilator &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it for 2010.</li>
            <li> Love the pivoting head.  </li>
            <li> I love mixing water with my shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Love the way it make my skin feel</li>
            <li> Was given as a gift to my grand daughter - she loves it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to charge it in months.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery; Not as happy as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> It is better than the Remington and annie</li>
            <li> Also love the bikini attachment-</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and two more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Much better than the disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I must say I am extremely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer also seems to miss many hairs (and also snags) when I&#x27;m doing my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife, at her request, and she reports that it more than meets her expectations, and she has no complaints about the product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It is just OK.  </li>
            <li> Best spent money on an amazing ladies shaver.  </li>
            <li> I figured it still worked OK</li>
            <li> love this razor.  </li>
            <li> razor itself is ok for what I used it for--touching up when not wanting to use a razor.  </li>
            <li> Also, I love the space saving charger stand.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for my lovely wife.</li>
            <li> She loves it just as much as I love the no stubble on her legs.</li>
            <li> Im glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li> Much better than my Remington</li>
            <li> Love the shaver.  </li>
            <li> i love it..</li>
            <li> On top of all that, I also found it was more work/took more time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several lady&#x27;s electric razors but this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> If there is a better one out there I haven&#x27;t found it.</li>
            <li> So I figured that is okay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for this for sure.</li>
            <li> But I would give 4 stars because the shaver is ok.</li>
            <li> Although this doesn&#x27;t give me a closer shave than a manual razor, I love the fact that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> so I figured being able to trim my legs would be better.</li>
            <li> I was sure to read the reviews before purchasing this shaver, and all reviews were in-line with what I was hoping for out of a shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You do end up needing to shave more because the electric razors always leave a teeny-tiny amount of &amp;#34;peach fuzz,&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s what prevents the ingrown</li>
            <li> a doubt my all time favorite electric razor.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;has made a  good razor and it was worth</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the transaction.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t give to be able to use a blade razor.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a better electric razor out there for women, I have not found it.  </li>
            <li> OK, so I have to go over some spots twice to get all of the hair...</li>
            <li> My legs still felt scratchy after many passes of the shaver.</li>
            <li> my wife love this.thanks</li>
            <li> Everything was absolutely perfect for several months!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This razor does get all the hair(s) and does a nice close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not terribly bothered.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d be better off buying a mans beard and moustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better shavers from Remmington.</li>
            <li> so I really thought this one would be great.</li>
            <li> I love that I can just pop it onto the charger in the wall.</li>
            <li> What more can you want from an electric shaver?</li>
            <li> I had much better luck with my husbands Norelco 3 head shaver.  </li>
            <li> However, this is not a problem for me as I would rather shave more often than deal with irritated skin.</li>
            <li> My last Panasonic shaver lasted more than 20 years and was awesome.</li>
            <li> This one is ok.</li>
            <li> and it is WAY BETTER.</li>
            <li> I love this razor and wish I had purchased it years ago.</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the charging directions and do not leave it charging while not in use or it will ruin the battery.</li>
            <li> Love using it in shower and bath.</li>
            <li> I really really love this shaver.</li>
            <li> The blade came off on one side and it could no longer be used safely.  </li>
            <li> I just kept using it hoping that it would work better, but it never did.  </li>
            <li> If you have a Remington and are looking for a better replacement</li>
            <li> Keeps a charge for more than two uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had one just like this for years but didnt have the swivel top.  </li>
            <li> It works ok, but,</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I want,  but it&#x27;s better than all the razor blade cuts.  </li>
            <li> the shave could be closer but that could be said of most all razors.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used an electric razor for many years.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I still love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Must be fully charged to do most of both legs</li>
            <li> It is good as a hedgetrimmer, but not the best tool for putting green manicuring.  </li>
            <li> And you have to make sure the cap is always on the shaver when you aren&#x27;t using it because it has foil shaver heads like a mans shaver.  </li>
            <li> She claims is an excellent razor, with only one change she could recommend - a cord rather than a receptacle for charging.  </li>
            <li> She would prefer to have it charge on the counter top rather than attached to a wall socket.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> I love using this one in the shower.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I still have to use my husbands trimmers because they work better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I can trim better with a pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> So now I am looking for something better.</li>
            <li> Great love it,works really well.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this from a catalog which cost a lot more.</li>
            <li> As a shaver, it works OK, within the limits of how electric shavers tend to.</li>
            <li> Even after doing this many times, it did not give a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Plus for the money I was expecting much better.</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers exclusively for more than 15 yrs.</li>
            <li> I love the charger that just plugs into the outlet.  </li>
            <li> maybe better.</li>
            <li> thought it was supposed to be safe, but NOOOOO</li>
            <li> Love my daughter for introducing it to me.  </li>
            <li> I like it sooo much better</li>
            <li> I would say it is just ok.  </li>
            <li> and it works ok in some areas</li>
            <li> Very close shave for an electric razer &amp; great battery life.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> There must be better products out there.</li>
            <li> So, I tried this one because there have been so many sold</li>
            <li> Love my Panasonic shaver.  </li>
            <li> Love the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied - and the Amazon processing and shipping speed was super, too.</li>
            <li> Its gives nice clean shave, I have used remington shaver before, but this one is much better.</li>
            <li> And so am I ;)  !!!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and razors irritate me, I bought this Panasonic because I had seen several reviews as being very good and the price was very good.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice clean shave on a mans beard.</li>
            <li> I cant vouch for the ease of use but the end results are pretty good.. :)</li>
            <li> Instructions say it&#x27;ll take a couple weeks of steady shaving to get the &amp;#34;best result&amp;#34;, but I am already happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> This electric razor is light weight and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is a high quality product for a great price.</li>
            <li> The price was great as I purchased a diderent brand and much high and didn&#x27;t even work at all.  </li>
            <li> Works good on short or fine hair but not that great on course or longer hair.</li>
            <li> fantastic shaver easy to use &amp; does an amazing job.  </li>
            <li> Works better than my husband&#x27;s electric; like the trimmer; can use on my face and underarms without pinching; cleans easily and most important--no nicks like with a blade.  </li>
            <li> great product easy to use very functional&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> The razor is easy to handle and gives a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good shaver-</li>
            <li> My wife loved it, first time&lt;</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as good as my first.  </li>
            <li> The panasonic ES2216PC is the best shaver I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li> So, the shaver is pretty good.</li>
            <li> This one, though priced higher, does not seem to be as good.</li>
            <li> Good Price and Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> I have been using an electric shaver for years, I loved the first one I got.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I have found that the battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Charge lasted good at first but stopped holding a charge after a year or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still say the ES2216PC is a good razor, but I&#x27;m definitely super excited about my replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the unit at the original $39.99, but cannot recommend its purchase at any price!</li>
            <li> It is worth every bit of the money paid for it!!  </li>
            <li> I was using scissors instead until I got my new shaver, which has a great bikini trimmer attachment, though not adjustable.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of great reviews and needed a new Razor forever</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Remington Smooth and Silky razor that I used to own in regard to closeness of shave, but still decent.</li>
            <li> The flexible head really helps get into the curves, which is important to me as a plus sized lady with a great deal of curves.</li>
            <li> This razor does the best when used dry.</li>
            <li> For those quick times when you need just to tidy up those hairs</li>
            <li> Nice charger,and quick charging unit.</li>
            <li> I was able to easily shave her legs without her experiencing any pain.</li>
            <li> do not want anything to interfere with the already excellent performance of this shaver while using in dry</li>
            <li> It gives me a nice, smooth shave and is comfortable \\&quot;sitting\\&quot; in my hand.  </li>
            <li> I expected this product to be one of the best since its from the reputable panasonic brand.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a reasonably priced, nice looking, and effective shaver.</li>
            <li> I feel so much more comfortable shaving because I am confident that I won&#x27;t end up bleeding at the end of my shaving</li>
            <li> Wife &amp; Grand Daughter both love the ease of shave &amp; smooth silky results the Panasonic</li>
            <li> but it is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It shaved both legs and bikini areas without any problems, and was very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and clean after use.  </li>
            <li> I wish I knew which kind of electric shaver I had right before this one because that was a much better shaver.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it will work fine.</li>
            <li> just keep it clean and charged!</li>
            <li> Surprised and very pleased, love it!</li>
            <li> It worked very nicely when it arrived, but I have to wonder if the unit I received was refurbished rather than brand new.  </li>
            <li> Skin looks nice and clean after shaving - not razor smooth, but no visible stubble either.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s very good, a regular shaver still shaves closer.  </li>
            <li> Very good buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what the manufacturer claims which is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> There are certainly other methods to get better results, but this shaver is perfect for a quick and easy touch up!</li>
            <li> when I use a razor blade however I am fortunate to not have many ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the most comfortable razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars only because 5 would be perfect, and few things are perfect.  </li>
            <li> They will both get you there, but one is going to be a lot quieter, faster, and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally safe and pain free.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy shaving more with the Panasonic</li>
            <li> Perhaps some adjustments need to be made, but she has not been happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had, though I detest the color (pink).  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s back to the search for the ideal ladies&#x27; shaver.</li>
            <li> No you will never get that lovely smooth feeling you might get with a safety razor or waxing or whatever</li>
            <li> but it is also more comfortable for me and easier to use.</li>
            <li> The pivoting head makes for a more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Women&#x27;s Smooth and Silky Foil Shaver and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent and wish I would have purchased something like this years ago.</li>
            <li> My cheap disposables work better for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, much quieter</li>
            <li> good price, fast delivery for upcoming trip.</li>
            <li> This is very convenient though, &amp; does a good job.  </li>
            <li> It really cuts good.  </li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and I guess you get what you pay for in terms of good electric razors.</li>
            <li> NOT AS CLOSE AS A BLADE, BUT GOOD FOR A FAST TOUCH UP IN THE SHOWER,WHEN SHE DOESN&#x27;T HAVE TIME TO SHAVE</li>
            <li> this good is extremely reasonable, so</li>
            <li> A GOOD RAZOR FOR THE PRICE  FAST SHIP</li>
            <li> Good buy and reasonable shipping time.</li>
            <li> the attachments are very useful, love that the head has some give and moves a bit.</li>
            <li> Great Razor easy to use and clean, obviously not a smooth shave as a blade, but great as u&#x3D;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and very precise.</li>
            <li> I just got the Norelco 8250 Speed XL and it was sweet!</li>
            <li> Back to looking for a good shaver!</li>
            <li> My wife has had two other electric razors and feels this is her best yet.  </li>
            <li> I do have to shave a day or so more often, but for the tradeoff (no razorburn) it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of panasonic other stuff and very happy</li>
            <li> Not bad for over 15 years!</li>

            <li> My wife bought hers three years ago and it is still going strong</li>
            <li> The cleancut did an amazing job of the very intimate brazilian-type shave, but couldn&#x27;t touch the flat-laying outer hair.  </li>
            <li> a couple of years ago and liked it very much.</li>
            <li> however the tool is very precise and easy to use plus quick.</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave with this and am very glad I chose this one.  </li>

            <li> It is easy to operate and does a fine job .</li>
            <li> It falls apart real easily and doesn&#x27;t shave very closely.</li>
            <li> I think in the summer when I am shaving more frequently it may be more effective.</li>
            <li> and I feel that I got a really nice, pretty close shave.  </li>
            <li> I liked this item at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not the battery - the device works fine and has a strong charge once it turns on.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a pretty nice razor</li>
            <li> got this for my sister who&#x27;s currently in the hospital and not allowed to use razors (blood disease) and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Was thrilled with this razor for the first 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Liked that it has pop up trimmer that works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also super easy to clean and very easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome and works swiftly and easily and hair doesn&#x27;t grow back very fast at all.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES2216C is hands down the best women&#x27;s electric shaver I&#x27;ve had in years.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the BEST electric shaver!</li>
            <li> Right Size right everything!!!</li>
            <li> The price was perfect, the quality was more that what I expected, and the color has a nice soft look</li>
            <li> Its comfortable to hold making it easy to use as well as convenient being cordless.</li>
            <li> I did use it in the shower and it held up fine.</li>
            <li> It worked just fine for me.  </li>
            <li> You can basically use it anywhere and it will be fine.</li>
            <li> it is fine.</li>
            <li> , it works fine.</li>
            <li> and it would work fine.</li>
            <li> Suits my purpose fine.</li>
            <li> clipper works just fine too.</li>
            <li> Works just fine  still would prefer a closer shave .</li>
            <li> I first bought a Norelco back in the 90&#x27;s and it was the best ever.</li>
            <li> Shaver works fine - not as close as I would like when doing underarms.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s works fine</li>
            <li> If your hair is fine and baby like, you have to go over and over the hair repeatedly to get it off.</li>
            <li> but it does a fine job.  </li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t even shave her fine hair.  </li>
            <li> but it was fine for a while after that</li>
            <li> WHAT MY WIFE TOLD ME WORKS FINE,</li>
            <li> Have never had to replace blades and it still charges up fine.  </li>
            <li> Does job just fine.  </li>
            <li> Not even the fine hairs.  </li>
            <li> I am not a bear, and I&#x27;m not baby fine.</li>
            <li> Shaves fine.  </li>
            <li> I have used it in both in and out the shower and it works fine in places.</li>
            <li> I love that I can take this to my fitness club and do a quick touch up in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Quick suggestion or tip use body scrub before !</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works quickly, efficiently, and I love it.</li>
            <li> And it would be OK for a quick \\&quot;I forgot to shave</li>
            <li> I can do a quick touch up on my legs and save a ton of money on razor blades!  </li>
            <li> ok for a quick shave.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go back and forth between blades and an electric shaver, if you decide to go electric,and I would recomend you give it a try, stick with it, a good one like this makes it easy!</li>
            <li> By reading reviews, I found out a lot of men use a hair trimmer on their face, as it is much gentler, and also works much better on longer hairs, but no one ever mentioned this for women!  </li>

            <li> I Replaced my monthly brazilians with this little tool and although it doesn&#x27;t get quite as smooth as the day after a brazilian, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very comfortable &amp; easy to use &amp; gives a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li> With respect to delivery it was timely and accurate.  </li>
            <li> Description of the product was accurate and works as described.  </li>
            <li> This is better than I expected and not as great as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Which is HUGE for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A huge plus for me is that it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> She was SO happy that she could have SMOOTH legs again without the risks involved when using a regular razor!</li>
            <li> Charges quickly, easy to clean and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Made a HUGE difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do wish the charger light would change colors or turn off</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> it was a fluke issue and that the replacement product would be glitch free.  </li>
            <li> it &amp;#34;skips&amp;#34;, meaning it does not glide smoothly along the legs.</li>
            <li> Use a light touch.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> but it does not leave the skin smooth as the Remington&#x27;s she had.</li>
            <li> Legs feel quite smooth.</li>
            <li> While it does not feel baby butt smooth</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> It cuts close and smooth.</li>
            <li> The battery holds a charge well and it is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap, doesn&#x27;t shave well.</li>
            <li> If you want uber smooth legs...</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This product holds a charge and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> this shaver is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Clean up is really easy as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this product several times now and am extremely happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Just a light touch along the skin is all that&#x27;s needed for a close shave.</li>
            <li> It is easy to charge and clean.</li>
            <li> Overall, great shaver for the price but one drawback.  </li>
            <li> PROS: smooth, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Pivoting head is fantastic for bikini area and lower--can get all the nooks and crannies.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed how smooth my legs felt after using this product.</li>
            <li> this is a great addition to my personal collection of \\&quot;lady gadgets\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;prior</li>
            <li> skin silky smooth after a shave-</li>
            <li> Packaged extremely securely.</li>
            <li> I never knew that trying a nickel free razor would be the answer.</li>
            <li> But for just regular shaving, they work great.</li>
            <li> Worth the money if your satisfied with an electric shave vs. blade.</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t stay hair free for eight weeks like it says.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the swiveling head, it feels like it goes around my knees and</li>
            <li> so when Amazon emailed  that it was available, I &#x27;jumped&#x27; at the chance --</li>
            <li> Close shave, easy to clean and</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This razor lasted about 1.5 years with that light use.  </li>
            <li> was almost as smooth as with a non-electric razor!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought that my options were razor or waxing, neither of which is comfortable</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t ever get my legs really smooth, but it does the required job.  </li>
            <li> It gives a close, smooth shave on legs.  </li>
            <li> The on/off buttons and head are really cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> and it gives a really smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> In and out of the shower its fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is much heavier than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaver gives me a close, smooth shave -- almost like shaving with a razor, but without the nicks and bumpy rash.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels silky smooth, like when I used to use razors, and I am so grateful for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Face Moisture Shave, Fragrance Free, 11 oz]]</li>
            <li> It delivers a closer shave, and is quite comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric razor that works like a real blade; amazing.</li>
            <li> If you want touch smooth legs for your man though, get a five blade razor or something.</li>
            <li> But this works great for last minute beach legs!!!</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Also, I found the set cheaper on 1800 parts dot com with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great razor for the price, but I needed to go over each area on my legs several times to remove all the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for the peach fuzz on my face and light hair on my arms.  </li>
            <li> It takes a couple times to go over to get it smooth.</li>
            <li> (my leg hair is too light for it to be effective)and</li>
            <li> While it does not make my legs razor smooth, the hair is not as visible.</li>
            <li> happy with, it that with doing this I do not have any problems with red irritated skin</li>
            <li> The light still comes on when it&#x27;s plugged into the charger, but it won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean and works well.&lt;br /&gt;Fits</li>
            <li> razor shape was comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> have 3 bichons and will use on them once they get use to the sound</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Could never get a smooth feel at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s rather easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth shave and no &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; afterwards.</li>
            <li> When that happens the recharge light won&#x27;t go on eventually it will stop running.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave completely smooth</li>
            <li> overall great product.</li>
            <li> Handles well, shaves close, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> She gave me a telephone number to call which was not toll free.  </li>
            <li> I asked for and received a toll-free number, but when I called it I was referred to the non-toll free number.  </li>
            <li> B000Q6RHJA Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeable]] did.</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth shave and no nicks and irritation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel they leave my legs smooth, but they do the trick in a rush.</li>
            <li> its not as smooth as a wax</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It does legs and underarms comfortably.  </li>
            <li> Granted, the others were cheap.  </li>
            <li> It is light in weight and flexible.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> you just don&#x27;t get the smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, charge, and clean.</li>
            <li> Of course I then learned that returning it was only a happy fantasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the primary intention of the bikini area.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> Wife has had this for several years and it works great.  </li>
            <li> The shaver runs smoothly and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> cheap as this was</li>
            <li> Great for younger ladies who just need to get up and leave for school.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a fantastic job; it&#x27;s a close shave with one time</li>
            <li> Works well, but feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> In all, I am happy enough with the purchase.</li>
            <li> In all, I am happy enough with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This razor gave me a close smooth shave with no issues.</li>
            <li> This razor is great for a last minute shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to operate and to clean.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a razor, buy a cheap $7 disposable and be done with it.</li>
            <li> well which is important.</li>
            <li> still felt stubble after about 20 minutes of trying to get a smooth shave on my legs.</li>
            <li> Kinda cheap.</li>
            <li> But, if you are looking for a smooth bikini shave, this product does not deliver.</li>
            <li> Is easy to clean and holds the charge for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Gets you relatively smooth.</li>
            <li> I like a smooth shave</li>
            <li> I wanted to try an electric razor I could use while comfortably seated.  </li>
            <li> (My boyfriend loves my smooth legs, and I can let him touch them now without recoiling away in pain).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> This works perfectly if you have a modern vanity arrangement in your bathroom, with a plug above the sink.  </li>
            <li> So far,  so good.  </li>
            <li> Had it for about a month, so far so good</li>
            <li> So far not so good.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> Although it does not give as close of a shave as my good old Venus and</li>
            <li> I used to use an old men&#x27;s Norelco on my legs years ago, and it worked fairly well.</li>
            <li> but it seems to hold a charge and so far so good.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good and gets pretty close.</li>
            <li> So far it is good.</li>
            <li> point blank, came on time, looks good, and i need six more words so&lt;</li>
            <li> Received the razor very quickly, was very easy to use &amp; gives a very close cut.</li>
            <li> Amazon is very good about returns and it went right back with no</li>
            <li> Excellent value for money (and means less chance of her using my razor!).</li>
            <li> This is a good inexpensive wet or dry shaver, it is a perfect gift and is easy to use any where</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t bought a new shaver in quite some time and am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> We are not allowed to use a plain razor so this product was a welcome addition to my toiletries !</li>
            <li> The price was right and everything went smoothly!</li>
            <li> Other reviews were very good.</li>
            <li> Should have gone to Amazon in the first place!!</li>
            <li> I love it, it cuts close and has a good charge, as well as easy to handle (even for a mobility limited person).</li>
            <li> good value, exactly as discribed, fast dhipping, Would recomend, works well on bikini area, works well in shower, easy to clean</li>
            <li> The one advantage to this shaver is the wet/dry function which is very useful for using in the shower.</li>
            <li> And the bikini attachment is very useful as it has three length</li>
            <li> Very useful, cut every thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this one works just fine on chest hair , arm hair , special parts hair</li>
            <li> Nice design, good quality, fairly quiet, fast and easy to use, but...</li>
            <li> Does a clean and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Needs light to tell when battery is ending and a brush to clean it.</li>
            <li> Close, clean, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I found the bikini line shaver thing is not all that great, but I have another trimmer for that :) It does a good enough job for a quick touch up for this old, married chick.</li>
            <li> I found the bikini line shaver thing is not all that great, but I have another trimmer for that :) It does a good enough job for a quick touch up for this old, married chick.</li>
            <li> The comb attachment is going straight into the trash because it just leaves hairs too long, but heres the greatest part</li>
            <li> Underarm and bikini shaving is super close without causing razorburn, easy for beach days that I just need a touch-up.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this razor is that it&#x27;s a pretty pink color.</li>
            <li> It is really easy when you just need to do a quick job when running out in shorts.</li>
            <li> quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Great razor, stays charged for a long time and is comfortable to use -- doesn&#x27;t pinch.</li>
            <li> the first electric shaver that i have ever purchased that really did a good job</li>
            <li> Given the dubious product quality I&#x27;d already experienced, I didn&#x27;t spring for their offer (throw more money down the drain?), and they wouldn&#x27;t do anything else for me.</li>
            <li> Always use it wet with regular soap, and you&#x27;ll be very happy with it for many years!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being able to shave dry is super nice as well!</li>
            <li> This new razor has wonderful improvements such as a floating head and charge station</li>
            <li> Apart from that, it&#x27;s super easy to clean, to use, etc.</li>
            <li> this item is good why can I say something about this item  short and easy.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this razor was magic!  </li>
            <li> I got a lot of positive comments about this product and so far it works great on my body.</li>
            <li> It is great and stays charge a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The great thing is that the charge holds for a long time and it never cuts skin.</li>
            <li> that was a long time ago and it seems they&#x27;ve improved greatly since then.</li>
            <li> The convenience of availability when needed (it keeps a charge for long periods) and the pivoting head are great features.  </li>
            <li> So I purchased this one and so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor and I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li> So far, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> what I paid, I&#x27;m not terribly disappointed though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about five months and originally wrote a glowing 5-star review of it.</li>
            <li> It was a great price, although it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for long, I wish that it was a closer shave</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the reviews I was quite excited about this razor.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this item as both a razor for my legs and to trim my bikini line.  </li>
            <li> but when you want to be lazy, it&#x27;s PERFECT!!!</li>
            <li> originally bought this February 25, 2014.  </li>
            <li> I was so glad when I first used this shaver</li>
            <li> I am NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li> OK for the price, but 10 months after purchase,  I&#x27;m buying a higher quality men&#x27;s shaver..  </li>
            <li> ; I had originally switched because the Remington&#x27;s charger lead had oxidized.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in July 2012 and at first it worked ok</li>
            <li> Works great and holds the charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> but so far i&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this</li>
            <li> I love it so much, I don&#x27;t know how I lived without one!</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s important to get a full charge on the battery.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work ok the first time out of the package.</li>
            <li> and it was worth it!  </li>
            <li> Love it, this is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this, things started out fine.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, so I think very often it gets pushed away rather than</li>
            <li> So, yes, not perfect but a seriously good razor at a very good price.</li>
            <li> Considering what the price is for some higher-end drugstore disposable razors, I would say this is a very good buy and will certainly last much longer than a multi-pack of Ladies Gillette&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other razors and this is by far the best one!</li>
            <li> Was smooth on my skin, no discomfort, good for bikini line for a quick fix but as others have said not quite as smooth as shaving, but very similar to the &amp;#34;one day after shaving&amp;#34; feeling of hair growth with this.</li>
            <li> I like that you can remove the head to clean it after you are done.  </li>
            <li> I will be hesitant to take it apart to clean it again, even so.</li>
            <li> Clean up takes me about 1 minute.</li>
            <li> I was diligent to clean the shaver as directed after each use, and to keep the protective plastic cap on.</li>
            <li> It is convenient to use, recharge, and clean.  </li>
            <li> glad I ordered this one and amazing enough</li>
            <li> It works great using it dry.</li>
            <li> The razor come apart so you can replace the razor and to clean it.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t expect a squeaky clean shave...</li>
            <li> Also it took FOREVER to get one clean shaven spot.</li>
            <li> Wet use is better but still not as good as I like.</li>
            <li> If it is good enough for their smooth, curvy, tender faces</li>
            <li> Eazy to use and eazy to clean.</li>
            <li> I clean it and charge it often and have never had an issue.  </li>
            <li> that you can take a tissue and clean out.</li>
            <li> I get to clean it.</li>
            <li> I use it and enjoy having it around when I just need a quick shave without hoping in the shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend the Noxema bikini razors to clean things up</li>
            <li> Charges quickly, provides a smooth shave, the trim tool works well.</li>
            <li> , it looks like a clean shave (just doesn&#x27;t feel that way).  </li>
            <li> I bought it after reading the mixed reviews but so far it is an excellent shaver.</li>
            <li> My old one leaves me nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone buying this, it&#x27;s great in the shower or dry...</li>
            <li> and it gave a clean close shave on my legs and my underarms.</li>
            <li> I followed the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations on how to keep it clean after each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great for a dry close shave.  </li>
            <li> Would love for someone to make a women&#x27;s electric shaver that really does give that close, smooth, shave that we all want.</li>
            <li> Make sure you charge the shaver for a FULL 24 HOURS before first use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother with the dry route, or you won&#x27;t be happy.  </li>
            <li> Works cleanly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I use it for dry shaving and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> and it has worked very nicely, but its long term quality is still to be tested.</li>
            <li> I purchased it based on the many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> There are so many positive points of this product.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> When it died I was happy to find the exact same one available.</li>
            <li> While true that this razor does not shave quite as close as a non-electric triple razor might, it still works great dry shaving in a hurry or in the shower splashing on lots of shave lotion.</li>
            <li> The quality looks really good and the way the head foils float and pivot seems to keep it on the skin better than other shavers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Good for quick shave if I&#x27;m not caring about how smooth I&#x27;m going to feel and only about how hair-free</li>
            <li> Will use my razor for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this shaver.</li>
            <li> and sometimes it injure specially when  when the battery low&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The special attachment pulls the hair.</li>
            <li> And boy was I right!</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife for convenience and portability, works great, keeps charge for along time, charges quickly, works as well in shower or dry..</li>
            <li> I get a clean shave, of course not like a razor, but still very good for times when it&#x27;s not easy or practical to jump in the shower or stick your legs in the sink or use shave creams or jells.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t like typical electric razors that kind of pull the hair as it shaves, it&#x27;s painless and I love that!</li>
            <li> For the first few months, the shaver worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for the first two times but on my third use it started pinching my skin, grabbing and pulling the hair on my bikini line...</li>
            <li> Great that you can get it wet and not have to worry about it.  </li>
            <li> When it would no longer work, I have gone thru a lot of different brands and models of shaver and have never found one that work like the first one, until now, this is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> I am STOKED to use this in the summer because though it does not give you as close of a shave as a normal razor it keeps your legs visibly smooth with zero irritation, which is all you need most of the time for wearing shorts and stuff.</li>
            <li> The amount of time I save from not having to do the old routine is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Been buying same for yrs good.</li>
            <li> Also, it does not do a good job of removing all hairs, especially around the knee area.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor quite some time ago but waited to write a review until I had used it enough times to give it a fair rating.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s a good shaver for a last minute shave on the rush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product that promises what it delivers, I don&#x27;t expect it to shave like a traditional razor because it&#x27;s not one!  </li>
            <li> but I suppose good enough.</li>
            <li> Its a cool idea</li>
            <li> While this is clearly better than the Clio (that is not saying much.  </li>
            <li> I thought nothing would be good as a regular razor on my legs, but this one works just as well.</li>
            <li> The product literally does not function as it should without a close to full charge, which should not be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend getting a men&#x27;s shaver if you want the full experience.  </li>
            <li> And yes, it is cool how water immersible it is.  </li>
            <li> If you are mowing the entire field, it should be good for that purpose, but if you want to hedge with ease, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I recommend the extremely cheap but useful</li>
            <li> It kind of hurt to use on my under-arms, but I have sensitive under-arms.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;ll never be as smooth as a razor shave, but it&#x27;s SO worth it to not have to deal with the razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once, it doesn&#x27;t get close like a razor on your legs, but it does good enough for the bikini area</li>
            <li> it is good enough for our legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> liked the old one also and didn&#x27;t want to change brands.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this has been a good purchase for me.</li>
            <li> Good product, I personally don&#x27;t like the pivoting head</li>
            <li> I bought because it was Panasonic and had good reviews on various websites.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> but overall this is a good razor.  </li>
            <li> It definitely hasn&#x27;t saved me time and it hasn&#x27;t given me good shave once</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work out, but after two months I can&#x27;t give it any more chances.</li>
            <li> Overall its a good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> wish I would have never bought this....will trash this and go back to the good ol razor and shaving cream</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut or nick skin and is kind to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Thankfully it is a straight handle, which is important for someone who is ambidextrous!</li>
            <li> Not as good as my former Remington shaver.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t alert you when it has reached a full charge.</li>
            <li> At this point, it was taking a good ten minutes just to shave about a couple of square inches of skin, so I cast it aside and returned to Venus.</li>
            <li> the wife loved her Christmas present.</li>
            <li> Not as close as a blade razor but good enough if you&#x27;re not picky about being picky</li>
            <li> She believes it to be the finest ladies razor produced and thanks to Amazon.com for their many offerings with the consumer always in mind.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> good enough for shaving legs, under arms and face.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;WET/DRY&amp;#34; claim is also true; I&#x27;ve used it in and out of the shower, even dropped it once onto a tile floor</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a good value and does the job well enough for me.</li>
            <li> Very Dissapointed in this process of replacing the razor that I truly love.</li>
            <li> thank sweet baby Jesus for guys that know about knives and stuff..  </li>
            <li> thank sweet baby Jesus for guys that know about knives and stuff.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I go over the hairs, in what direction, how much pressure I use -</li>
            <li> and I was still able to get a really close shave.</li>
            <li> We returned it with full refund and bought another.  </li>
            <li> It works when you need it and for the money was a overall good buy.</li>
            <li> considering I bought this because it had such good reviews.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Remington (cord plug in) and loved it, had it for close to 10 years and the end of the plug got a short in it.  </li>
            <li> I tried to replace it with the same model but couldn&#x27;t find it, so I bought another Remington assuming it would be just as good.  </li>
            <li> Good enough for me.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cost a lot, that&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> Good basic razor.  </li>
            <li> I only have one good power outlet in my bathroom, and this interferes with plugging in my blowdryer.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The price is not bad</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, not a bad product.</li>
            <li> I did not get scraped up, I didn&#x27;t get any irritation, and I have VERY sensitive skin that reddens very easily.</li>
            <li> I did not get scraped up, I didn&#x27;t get any irritation, and I have VERY sensitive skin that reddens very easily.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a new electric razor and not having any success in stores (all they had were the kind that yanks the hair out).  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic Wed Dry Lady Shaver is by far the BEST shaver I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li> However, I get used to the sound very quickly, and since the shave is shorter, it doesn&#x27;t have to be on for very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re a first time electric razor buyer, I strongly recommend this razor to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bikini attachment is very useful and the entire head assembly is easy to use, easy to disassemble for cleaning, and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bikini attachment is one of the other reasons I chose this shaver, and it works great.  </li>
            <li> i always read other peoples reviews before buying and it has worked out great.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works great.  </li>
            <li> and it worked fine when i first started using it.</li>
            <li> that said, I have really enjoyed this electric razor and I mostly use it for times when I don&#x27;t want to spend the time using a regular razor with shaving cream..  </li>
            <li> Although it is more convenient to have an electric razor, it seems like I need to shave more often than with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> or when you just need a quick shave.</li>
            <li> job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beret looses it charge quickly, and over time, it worsens.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It actually gives you a nice, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> shavers wound up in the trash too quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is my quick go between</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a super close shave though, maybe try something else.</li>
            <li> It is what I would consider adequate.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a razor for quick shaves without having to use shaving cream or use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It charges quickly and holds the charge well.  </li>
            <li> Is adequate for the money.  </li>
            <li> No, it isn&#x27;t super close</li>
            <li> After about a month it didn&#x27;t work as well and would die quickly.</li>
            <li> The razor is adequate.  </li>
            <li> After researching several types, I decided on the Panasonic ES2216PC for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;She thinks its awesome and has been using it for several years now.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Fast and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The product charges quickly and lasts for about 5 days of continuous use.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s more quiet than most.</li>
            <li> It trimming blade catches and pulls hair, and the blades dulled quickly.  </li>
            <li> Was looking for something to use for quick touchups between blade shaves.  </li>
            <li> of course if you take a super close look, u will still see it .</li>
            <li> Luckily I tried mixing water now</li>
            <li> and he also uses it on a daily basis to keep his pubic area nice and smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO darned quick</li>
            <li> You have to almost scrap it along your skin, mind you hold your skin taunt, and go over the same area in many directions, many times.</li>
            <li> This is a must if you want to quickly shave without water.</li>
            <li> So much better than my older shaver.  </li>
            <li> It gives a super close shave on my legs, underarms and bikini area.  </li>
            <li> Got this because I&#x27;m pregnant and shaving areas</li>
            <li> The pivoting head is super and I also use &amp; like the bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and very versatile because you can use it in or out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt the older model worked better</li>
            <li> the item did come in quick.</li>
            <li> I like the product for a quick shave of my legs.</li>
            <li> I use it when I&#x27;m on the run for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> I have used an electric razor for many years, and have struggled to find a decent one.</li>
            <li> (Because it is quick to use and can be used dry).&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Okay so I bought this razor after finding out that I am HIGHLY allergic to nickel.</li>
            <li> Uses it dry and it is quick and easy, and gives a pretty good shave, according to her.</li>
            <li> It has a nice long reach and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i am very pleased not only with this purchase, but with the customer service of the seller as well!</li>
            <li> The wet/dry feature is nice, and the swivel top is really the big selling point of this shaver.</li>
            <li> It worked great, except for the battery charge (instead of 12 hours, it lasted on average 45 minutes per charge).</li>
            <li> I use it instead of a normal razor if I&#x27;m in a hurry and just want to make sure I have no visible hair.</li>
            <li> this is my second one I purchased and Ali am very pleased</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, i use it to shave my beard also ;)</li>
            <li> And then the very first time I used it, the button to lift the pop up trimmer broke.  </li>
            <li> (This happened the very first time I used it, so it wasn&#x27;t because it hadn&#x27;t been cleaned).</li>
            <li> I when back to the Panasonic and am very satisfied</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaves as close as my old Lady Remington did and is far superior to the Lady Remington shavers available today.</li>
            <li> I have used older Panasonic shavers and really thought they provided a nice close shave and lasted long(1 year) for the price($30).</li>
            <li> if your looking for an easy fast way to get a super ravor like shave not the product for you.</li>
            <li> Does a decent shave job, nowhere near a razor&#x27;s closeness, but when I don&#x27;t want to stand in the shower for 30 minutes, this shaver is good.</li>
            <li> Good for a quick dry shave, doesn&#x27;t work well in the shower.</li>
            <li> A product with that many good reviews means it is liked, and is a decent enough design to hold its own against the more expensive electric razors out there.</li>
            <li> Cost more to replace the head than buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I would like to see Panasonic come out with a new model of this product with better battery technology.  </li>
            <li> I am new to electric shavers but I am pleased with how this performs.  </li>
            <li> I am new to the electric razor thing,but It works just ok in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I primarily bought it for the bikini area (which I usually wax) and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington that did great but battery died less than a year.</li>
            <li> It shaves very close for an electric shaver, and the design makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Long story short its great !</li>
            <li> I just tried this shaver using it dry on my legs and trimming up my strip of pubic hair and loved the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a couple of times and seems to do a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s excellent for eliminating visible hairs but does FEEL a tad prickly with my dense dark natural hair.</li>
            <li> The moving head makes it easy to use and very efficient.</li>
            <li> Easy to have charged up and ready any time.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and works really well.</li>
            <li> Have used this shaver for quite a while now - cleans easy, holds a charge and shaves really well without pinching or causing redness.</li>
            <li> It allows you to keep the shaver easily within reach and ready to go.</li>
            <li> Shave as good in shower as dry...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s gentle and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The shaver still works fine with one side, but since I love it so much, I want to get a new one.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m ever going to give another female a gift, you better believe it&#x27;s going to be one of these jammies!</li>
            <li> Be aware of the return policy!</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> All said, it is a much earned 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> when I first got it!  </li>
            <li> was excellent, far less than retail stores.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, accurate description, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use, light weight, however I do prefer the old fashioned &amp;#34;plug type shavers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> original intention was to have something handy for a quick decent-ish dry shave.</li>
            <li> It does such a great job that you really can use it every-other-day and still stay nice and smooth down there</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver for an electric.  </li>
            <li> I set out in search of a product that worked great, and found this little beauty.</li>
            <li> Finally a Shaver that doesnot pull, miss fine hairs and most of all does not leave me flapping my arms when I shave my underarms.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very fast when the battery is full</li>
            <li> I love the curve of the handle it makes shaving in certain areas of the body much easier.</li>
            <li> I loved it when it worked, but it was so much of a hassle (buying three razors in a row with the same exact problem, sheesh!)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but overall I found it easy to use, not too loud, effective, and travel friendly.</li>
            <li> She says it is comfortable to use and performs very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something I would use if I didn&#x27;t have time to shave with a razor before going to the gym, but not if I really wanted my legs to feel smooth.</li>
            <li> was the highest end model available at the time and has been working very well for over 5 years.  </li>
            <li> was the highest end model available at the time and has been working very well for over 5 years.  </li>
            <li> and I prefer a really close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The shave is great, but just expect to do it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> It worked great in the beginning, but then after a few months it would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It is great for the winter when you don&#x27;t want to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Try this razor, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> it works far better than I thought an electric one would.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor before, so I have no comparison, but so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have not had as much success with my legs.  </li>
            <li> Not at all useful, I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think you&#x27;ll find the plastic is far more</li>
            <li> the cost of this shaver, but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> just so I feel that I get some of my moneys worth out of it.</li>
            <li> bought it as a gift for my mom, as an elderly customer she seems satisfied with her shaver, don&#x27;t know much about how much detail and&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> also bought an epilator to do my legs so that I won&#x27;t have to shave as often, but I plan on keeping this for my more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Actually would have liked a razor that you could use with or without a cord but couldn&#x27;t find one.</li>
            <li> The best way to get the closest possible shave is (as another reviewer noted) pulling your skin taut and wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> the bickini attachment isn&#x27;t really worth it.</li>
            <li> I got the Braun Silk Epil: twice the price but a million times worth it.</li>
            <li> To test it out, I used it on a small area on my arm and it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver&#x27;s swiveling head is useful because it moves with the curve of the leg.</li>
            <li> But I was pleasantly surprised by how close it is able to get.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the shaver and the extra components that come with it because they are helpful as well if you ever decide to use them! :)</li>
            <li> The top of the box has the adapter that plugs directly into the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Also, for those of us who are no longer young (i.e., thin-skinned), this is a gentle and effective alternative.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get nearly as close as I&#x27;d like, and I have cut myself more times than I can count.</li>
            <li> Overall the razor is nice, sensitive to my skin, and works well for the most part.  </li>
            <li> It seems like my old one that bit the dust was much better.</li>
            <li> , I believe it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> You can take it through security at the airport (which has come in handy multiple times), and you don&#x27;t have to jump in the shower in order to shave when you are running out of time.  </li>
            <li> So my razer wins over the split between my wife and daughter.</li>
            <li> Old one worked better.</li>
            <li> Stays charged for several uses and the pop-up feature is nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it shaves much better than my old shaver (which was not a Panasonic).</li>
            <li> and it is worth</li>
            <li> This razor is not as good as I expected.  </li>
            <li> So far I have been really pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> electric shaver has been worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The blade is spining and not cutting.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with quality - close shave and holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The pivoting head and multiple blades seem to have been nicely designed with a woman&#x27;s needs in mind.  </li>
            <li> and it is still by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It plugs directly into the wall and the shaver sits on top of it</li>
            <li> but SO FAR it&#x27;s better than this model.</li>
            <li> The razor works okay, as far as electric shavers go.</li>
            <li> I rarely take time to write reviews</li>
            <li> It is handy for last min shaving.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Kind of reminds me of how it feels the day after I shave when the hair just starts to grow back.</li>
            <li> It was worth it.  </li>
            <li> but it sure does not beat my old fashion blade and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price</li>
            <li> Never had an electric razor work worth a hoot and this one just followed suit.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I love this because I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and that makes my ROI so incredibly worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It shaves so close to the skin, it feels like I had a fresh waxing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a powerful tool that does the job well.</li>
            <li> and I liked it enough to get</li>
            <li> only thing I liked about this shaver was how well it did on my underarms.  </li>
            <li> Because is isn&#x27;t as powerful as the Remington, it is gentler on more sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t catch.  </li>
            <li> I believe this would be a wonderful purchase for anyone who is tired of razor blade cuts .  </li>
            <li> The convenient wall charger is nice to save counter space, and it allows her to have it charged and ready at all times, because my young daughter will use it sometimes also.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t shave worth a lick.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the closeness and shaving action on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the closeness and shaving action on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I had a old Panasonic electric and this one is so much better.</li>
            <li> I love it and plan to order another one for my 16 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> Product is OK but not made as well as my old Panasonic model that this replaced.</li>
            <li> Actually useful unlike the Remington model.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After picking this one, I can say that my old one was much better.</li>
            <li> Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This one was in the right price range, had good reviews and didn&#x27;t have a whole of extra fancy nonsense.</li>
            <li> Wish it could take full range input (90V-240V) - That would have made it clutter free and easy to use internationally.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a pretty good job, but not as close a shave as I would like when dry.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver 2 months and a half months ago and it worked great for the first two months.  </li>
            <li> As other reviews mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t really give a super-smooth shave, but if that isn&#x27;t important to you, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Evidently the blades don&#x27;t stay sharp forever, but while they are new, they really work great!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it is any better than most other e-shavers.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older my body hair has gotten sparser and it was always rather fine</li>
            <li> Please understand that this is just my opinion (which is worth about as much as a fart in the wind), but for the cost, it is certainly worth trying!</li>
            <li> This shaver is worth every penny, it shaves clean and leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I can no longer use a regular razor due to health problems, and this shaver was the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li> I am used to being able to take shavers apart to clean them and then put them back together.  </li>
            <li> I would give this five stars, but the extendable trimmer collects hair quite easily making it less effective.</li>
            <li> with a good charge the razor works well and it will last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Keeping it, due to its good price and blade but with a grudge</li>
            <li> I read all the other reviews on how good this razor was.</li>
            <li> Very user friendly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any other shaver that can do as good.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know of any shining examples of other shavers that work well and offer good customer service in this price range...</li>
            <li> Right?  </li>
            <li> to this i was always fighting with disposable shavers that never did the job right but since owning this-</li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> Worked right out of box without charging.  </li>
            <li> she was right</li>
            <li> The price is right too.</li>
            <li> Right out of the package, I turned it on.</li>
            <li> right at the outlet</li>
            <li> I also like the charger that does not require any cords, but plugs right into the outlet.  </li>
            <li> And when you&#x27;re all done, the shaver rests on a convenient charging system which plugs right into the wall, vertically or horizontally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used it right away</li>
            <li> Received it right on time and used it right out of the box.</li>
            <li> With the shaving gel I use, it glides right over my skin and takes my unwanted hair off.</li>
            <li> i tried it and she is right.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be from foil dullness since it started happening right out of the box.</li>
            <li> So now it doesn&#x27;t plug in right unless I balance it just so...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s absolutely right.</li>
            <li> Husband pointed it out right away.</li>
            <li> I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> no longer give reviews right away because I have found that with time the products either change or my opinion does</li>
            <li> I like it that I can use it right after shower.</li>
            <li> Have used the shaver several times and am delighted with it - shaves closely, smoothly, quietly and (very important) gently - would recommend to all.</li>
            <li> This product was great for the first few months.</li>
            <li> For the first few times, it was great.</li>
            <li> After this first use, it was clear I would not be satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I mostly use it as a bikini trimmer and it&#x27;s great for that, but as a shaver it&#x27;s not ideal.</li>
            <li> It gave a nice close shave when used dry, and the bikini-attachment worked well for a nice short trim.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, works great wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Even if I have to go back and forth once or twice to get a good close shave (I understand that is normal for electric razors?), I do not suffer razor rash at all.</li>
            <li> Grandma&#x27;s was a replacement for her old Remington &amp; Grand Daughters her first shaver.  </li>
            <li> They work well, are very easy to clean, and above all, maintain a reasonable price coming from a manufacturer like Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and tend to easily get ingrown hairs, so this product has been a blessing for me.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and no back pain when I finished.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold while shaving and the head moves up and down nicely on your legs.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box did not cut just grabed hair very pain full.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been less than impressed with the overall results.</li>
            <li> The design is comfortable and easy to hold at the proper angle.  </li>
            <li> The unit is light and cordless, making it easy to manipulate for underarm and back of legs, etc.,</li>
            <li> Pick either wet or dry and be impressed, but don&#x27;t try &#x27;damp&#x27; shaving, it doesn&#x27;t do as well.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something that I could use quickly in the morning, but it takes more time then they regular razor.</li>
            <li> The shaver is quiet and does okay for a quick shave.  </li>
            <li> First of all, shipping was quick, and I found this product to be exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this fresh out of the box, I was amazed.</li>
            <li> I am so happy there is no more water, shaving cream involved.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver/razor does a pretty good job compared to any other form of hair removal, once you come to terms with the fact that you&#x27;ll never get that weird-kicking-the-sheets close shave that you get with your draw-the-blood razorblade.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair (still hairy) and very sensitive skins.  </li>
            <li> Very positive experience with this razor, the first electric women&#x27;s shaver we ever bought.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a way to remove all of the hair \\&quot;down there\\&quot; but couldn&#x27;t find a good option.  </li>
            <li> I will only work on very fine hair, like hair that has never been cut before.</li>
            <li> Device is exactly what I expected, Easy to use, love it</li>
            <li> Very pleased with how this razor gives a nice close shave wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> When I come here to order new blades, I see they are no longer available.</li>
            <li> There was no irritaion and there certainly was no pain at all!</li>
            <li> Seems easy to clean and take apart/put back together.</li>
            <li> I had used this razor previously and knew it was a good product.  </li>
            <li> As far as electronic shavers go, they are never as good as regular blade razors.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is very quiet compared to the old one and does a good job of shaving.  </li>
            <li> so I thought it would be a good replacement, however it does nothing near what regular shaving can do.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have the option to shave dry.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can use it dry and also like  that it  fits a woman&#x27;s hands nicely.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean with simple instructions&lt;</li>
            <li> Easy to clean with simple instructions&lt;</li>
            <li> Gentle and quick.  </li>
            <li> I previously had a Conair razor which I loved</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice razor, but my only concern is that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t really give a close shave.</li>
            <li> shower gel did, I liked that I could use it dry</li>
            <li> Cleaning the razor is easy and it isn&#x27;t too loud while you are using it.  </li>
            <li> It is easy on the skin in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Actually it&#x27;s the 2nd one I have owned, the 1st one lasted me 30 years so getting one without a cord was great.  </li>
            <li> She had previously tried my Panasonic men&#x27;s shaver and loved it, so that&#x27;s why I decided to buy her an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The unit is quiet, easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li> and I was able to get better coverage that way, but even so there are a few it just can&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> The transaction was fast and easy and would highly recommend to friends,</li>
            <li> The pivoting head is not in any way useful, didn&#x27;t seem to make any positive difference.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s also pink, love it!).</li>
            <li> She likes it so much she insisted on having a second one to have handy for travel and, worried that something might happened to the first one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one for 6 months, but not to long ago, I bought another one, the &amp;#34;Cleancut PS335 T-Shape Personal shaver&amp;#34; and I think that is more effective than the panasonic.</li>
            <li> I actually previously bought this item for my daughter, and loved it so much that i had to buy one for myself!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife who is very picky about her razor (pretty bold on my part).  </li>
            <li> Product has nice design for easy handling,even for small ladies hands.</li>
            <li> I have had exceptional experience with Panasonic products, and have, in other reviews, lauded their cameras and Men&#x27;s razor, pointing to this item as a better option than the Clio based on the reviews on this site (and having owned an earlier model in this line).  </li>
            <li> You can rinse it after a few strokes just like a regular razor, but the best way is to remove the top to rinse so that&#x27;s an extra step -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle, as promised.  </li>
            <li> I received the item in one day which was so very fast.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle on my skin</li>
            <li> I like this razor very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle</li>
            <li> It was a gift to the wife and she enjoys it very much.  </li>
            <li> However, it&amp;iexcl;¦s very fast and convenient.</li>
            <li> I have very light hair on my legs and not coarse.</li>
            <li> MY wife likes this shaver very much</li>
            <li> Even tho you won&#x27;t get silky smooth legs, like with a razor, it does a great job and in less time than traditional shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a blind friend with sensitive skin and diabetes and she is very happy with the product and said that is was easy to set up and is performing well.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, it is very easy to clean and is rechargeable, so for that it gets a positive spin.</li>
            <li> the ease of use or that a remarkable product cost so little!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close a shave as a razor, consider it leaving a fine sandpaper feel versus a slick feel, but fine sandpaper is good enough for me!</li>
            <li> It holds the charge long and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to get a good shave</li>
            <li> Love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it wet, in fact the instructions say to run it under water to clean it.</li>
            <li> Not enough of a clean smooth cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used it in the shower, but in dry conditions it&#x27;s somewhat comfortable and easy to operate and maintain.</li>
            <li> While it worked alright, this works better, particularly on finer hairs, and the sensitive knee areas.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty old Norelco rotary shaver that still work fine.</li>
            <li> So, though the smoothness of my legs may last for fewer days as compared to a razor shave, it is quick and easy to shave again.  </li>
            <li> It has a small footprint, making it better for travel than most, BUT I use it primarily at home (and would think that most other people do as well).  </li>
            <li> To be honest, you can never get as close a shave as a regular shaver using a gel, bath soap or moisturizer but this certainly gives you a VERY CLOSE SHAVE.  </li>
            <li> I could have just bought a replacement top, but instead bought a new shaver and tried many other brands.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m married............</li>
            <li> My first Panasonic shaver lasted 10 years.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what was specified.  </li>
            <li> For medical reasons I will no longer be able to use a blade</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if they don&#x27;t want anyone to be able to open the product.</li>
            <li> I finally feel like a woman again! :-)</li>
            <li> But overall  pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is my first electronic shaver</li>
            <li> Then today is the first time I ever used an electric razor in my 40</li>
            <li> first thing I wish to say to everyone complaining about an electric razor not being as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> I had to go over most areas multiple times.</li>
            <li> After a more than a week of using this shaver I sent it back to Amazon for a refund.</li>
            <li> Now, no electric shaver will cut as close as a blade, but this comes pretty close.</li>
            <li> Now I have put it in a drawer and will most likely throw it in trash in a couple years.  </li>
            <li> i get a pretty close shave with it.</li>
            <li> It shaves pretty close</li>
            <li> i must say i just used this shaver for the first time</li>
            <li> Exactly like in the picture, with about a 1.5\\&quot; box below it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I will continue to use this product, and will most likely not find a need for a blade-razor again!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as a first razor.</li>
            <li> I bought my wife her first electric razor about 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Her favorite used a chemical solution to rinse out the razor, but sadly, it only lasted 1 1/2 years before failing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a regular razor but it is more convenient.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s what I tried first.  </li>
            <li> Much better than my last electric razor.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor, so I have nothing to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor that I have ever brought.</li>
            <li> I am still using it from the first charge from when I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I was able to continue use for a short time like that, but then it started tearing my skin.</li>
            <li> I still use it here and there, but it&#x27;s not my first choice for hair removal.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever wet/dry shaver</li>
            <li> If you order this item, opt for the higher priced model, I wish I had.</li>
            <li> If one of my nieces takes it, I&#x27;ll order the higher priced model.</li>
            <li> The charge doesn&#x27;t last for more than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> The whole point of an electric razor for me is to save time, so this is going to have to go!</li>
            <li> The head is larger and pivots more.  </li>
            <li> The head is larger and pivots more.  </li>
            <li> surprised me by how smooth, painless this one works, after my first use!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> My first electric was a Remington.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well in lieu of shaving with a \\&quot;real\\&quot; razor.  </li>
            <li> so I was hesitant to use or buy it at first</li>
            <li> The product works much better as a hair trimmer than an actual razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I only paid $26 bucks for it.hair guard (bikini attachment).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I only paid $26 bucks for it.</li>
            <li> Okay for last minute shaves when I wasn&#x27;t expecting to show any leg.</li>
            <li> First one was June 2011, then this one in December 2011.</li>
            <li> With the first I thought it was my fault, by letting my guy shave his face with it a couple of times before it started pulling.</li>
            <li> It runs out of juice FAST!</li>
            <li> You have to go over the same spot many times to get all of the hairs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> When I first got this shaver a couple years ago, I hadn&#x27;t had an electric shaver before.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother getting a replacement until a couple weeks ago, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t replace it with the same shaver.</li>
            <li> I also used it on the bikini area but keep in mind that I trimmed first and then shaved.</li>
            <li> My big idea was to be able to shave out of the shower b/c</li>
            <li> Of course a razor has better results that last longer too.</li>
            <li> First you think it might just need adjust since it has 3 levels of height.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of time to shave, but I don&#x27;t have to shave very often, so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a seasoned user of electric shavers, and this is at the bottom of the heap.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and allowed the shaver to fully charge before the first use.  </li>
            <li> This is the first out of hundreds of products I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon that I am unsatisfied with.</li>
            <li> Definitely looking for a better one...</li>
            <li> No nicks, and you can do it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware that the batteries are crappy, and not replaceable on this model.</li>
            <li> First one lasted 5 months -</li>
            <li> My first electric at 60</li>
            <li> It sure beats constantly buying batteries though!</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver.</li>
            <li> yes, this shaver is noisy, much louder than the ES2207P, so don&#x27;t plan on using it in the library!</li>
            <li> This shaver holds its charge well and has never failed me.</li>
            <li> After all, it&#x27;s not the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is easy to clean and is holding up well even to minor abuse.  </li>
            <li> really like that this electric razor is fully immersible so that I can use it in the shower!</li>
            <li> takes many passes to get a &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; shave with coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I will go over and over the same spot many times trying to cut a hair it missed</li>
            <li> but this is the first time I wrote a review.</li>
            <li> I t shaves pretty close.</li>
            <li> In recent years they have redesigned their product and I have not been completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Would probably work better on coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different options including exfoliating creams, scrubs, waxing, and laser hair removal</li>
            <li> If I spend more time shaving my legs with a regular razor then maybe this would work.</li>
            <li> The first lasted 14 months.</li>
            <li> --there was always hair left on my legs and the bikini trimmer wasn&#x27;t much better.</li>
            <li> Very versatile and useful for them.[[ASIN:B000G0GW6K Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver with Bikini Attachment, Mauve]]</li>
            <li> After first use it fell(of course).</li>
            <li> The shave is close and makes the leg feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It does cut the hair pretty darn close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wish they wouldn&#x27;t plug the charger in my office, the pink glow is kind of distracting.</li>
            <li> but it gets pretty close.</li>
            <li> My first shaver in years</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> but it is pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> First I have ever used with a pivoting head.</li>
            <li> I had given up on electric razors years ago as not being able to shave close enough.</li>
            <li> , I wanted to do my research first.</li>
            <li> I will pay more attention to next time.</li>
            <li> Be aware that it doesn&#x27;t get rid of all the stubble-</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> although  you do have to hold it to keep it on the shaving head - but is does a very close &amp; painless job!</li>
            <li> I thought that was pretty soon for time to replace blades etc.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first shaver that cut so close</li>
            <li> Overall I&amp;iexcl;¦m satisfied, but probably will by men&amp;iexcl;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for exactly 5 months now.</li>
            <li> It does not give razor burn and is great on delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I love this Razor, Just wish it would last, Have purchased two and they both died.  </li>
            <li> It works like a charm and gives me a pretty close shave, despite it being an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge a long time and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes it!</li>
            <li> The first one I gave to him</li>
            <li> Thanks alot!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x60;s a pretty close shave , in fact.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is designed pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> but it comes pretty close.  </li>
            <li> Very time consuming but for me it was worth the result</li>
            <li> First hold your skin taunt because this puppy bites and if it gets a ahold of you, there will be blood.</li>
            <li> I fuss with this one for ususally 20-30 minutes for the same results and a lot more redness.</li>
            <li> So I looked online at reviews - should have done that first-</li>
            <li> Many posters have mentioned that this is &#x27;only&#x27; if your leg hair is longer than 1/4 inch.  </li>
            <li> I have searched and tried many different ones</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still operating exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience</li>
            <li> /&gt;Opinion - It did an OK job of shaving my legs, it always left a bit of stubble</li>
            <li> Having owned several women&#x27;s rechargeable shavers - a couple which didn&#x27;t hold up or perform well, my wife has been highly satisfied with the PANASONIC ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver.  </li>
            <li> More often than not, I&#x27;d get outside and find all sorts of hair that was missed.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t know exactly what to expect.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the razor, but I like it well enough that I will keep it until it dies and try another brand.</li>
            <li> It hurt and left too many hairs.</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as even the most basic disposable razor.</li>
            <li> First, as wet/dry shaver goes for us ladies, this one is pretty great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Take it slow and you&#x27;ll be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t pleased and sent mine back (and I never return anything).  </li>
            <li> **) and recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i only say is that i love it</li>
            <li> My first one lasted about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> the first one i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure I&#x27;m going back to the shaver</li>
            <li> Have used one of these for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Really, it is like a battery operated toy razor!  </li>
            <li> Its my first time using an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still working like it did when I first got it.</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave  next to a razor ..you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> It is a fairly close shave on the legs (not totally smooth but no visible hairs).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the razor, but I like it well enough that I will keep it until it dies and try another brand.ng your leg pretty fast, and you don&#x27;t have to pay that much attention, so it goes quickly.</li>
            <li> the super high end men&#x27;s razors might offer that</li>
            <li> So far, I am completely satisfied with my new Panasonic Shaver.  </li>
            <li> I was completely surprised at how much I love using this new shaver...</li>
            <li> I think that shaving with this razor actually takes longer than just shaving with a regular razor in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this razor is that it is okay to use both wet &amp; dry which makes it very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It does not provide as close a shave as a razor, but it is so easy and quick that I don&#x27;t mind using it more frequently than a conventional razor.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, close shave, quiet, not a lot of vibration, and quick.  </li>
            <li> trimmer works especially well before the electric shaver for a smooth result quickly without skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> trimmer works especially well before the electric shaver for a smooth result quickly without skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> Will probably use this dry most of the time, and while blade shaves will always be smoother, this is perfectly useful for what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Have used this shaver dry for 3 weeks and enjoy its close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The weight of it can make the plug in come out of the wall easily for the charger, so my suggestion for buyers is to find a plug in where it won&#x27;t get bumped as its is top heavy.</li>
            <li> I mean I am a fairly intelligent person who read all the directions and literally no hair comes out when I use it.</li>
            <li> I chose this shaver after reading reviews of several electric shavers online, and this one had the most positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Shaving head is a little large, but does follow body fairly well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really get the purpose of the bikini attachment but other than that I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I owned a Panasonic previously ( years ago) and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The men&#x27;s razor was still great, but shaving was taking too long, especially for longer hairs and large areas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The men&#x27;s razor was still great, but shaving was taking too long, especially for longer hairs and large areas.  </li>
            <li> My legs look better and I have been enjoying wearing dresses at least once a week for the first time in my life</li>
            <li> I am a shaving cream and razor kind of gal but due to some health issues I needed to buy a ladies shaver.  </li>
            <li> I bought the same shaver again, thinking that whatever broke was just a fluke and that the new shaver would be just as wonderful as it had been for the first few months.</li>
            <li> It looks a bit large and clunky, but is actually very gentle when using it.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a few days but have used it in all body areas and it does a very good job.</li>
            <li> The shaver is more than adequate for the legs but not for underarm or other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> This really isn&#x27;t a *terrible* shaver (it does cut your hair!), but once you use a *great* shaver, you realize just how incredibly SUB-PAR this one is.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, reasonably quiet, and gives a closer shave than I expected, given that I have only used it dry and using shaving gel and water is recommended for the best results.</li>
            <li> But any men&#x27;s model should be fine, they appear to all be engineered to a higher standard than the women&#x27;s model - it&#x27;s not necessary to buy the top of the line, and I found the charging station superfluous after a year or</li>

            <li> Failed rather quickly, and while it worked, results were far from the best.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t think i&#x27;d like the guard for trimming, but i actually rather enjoyed how much easier it made shaping everything up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s close enough in most areas - the areas that really matter - and didn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> So far she seems to be enjoying it and has no complaints thus far.</li>
            <li> Although more expensive it works just as well and is a good replacement product.  </li>
            <li> Used the shaver 2 or 3 times and found it better than expected - well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this Panasonic shaver not only because it works well, but because it is gentle.</li>
            <li> It is, however, safer than a blade, so if you are willing to carry a certain amount of weight and bulk, this might be the answer.</li>
            <li> It is, however, safer than a blade, so if you are willing to carry a certain amount of weight and bulk, this might be the answer.</li>
            <li> but this shaver has a nice long handle and pivotal head that allows me to do just that without breaking the precautions that I have due to the surgery.  </li>
            <li> So nice to be able to use it wet or dry!  </li>
            <li> For someone with super sensitive skin, this shaver is a godsend!</li>
            <li> This one takes a few times to use it right, but once you get over the learning cure its amazing</li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend it, i do recommend purchasing one that costs a little more and offers better performance.</li>
            <li> I decided on this shaver based on the positive reviews</li>
            <li> so after seeing positive reviews, ordered this model.</li>
            <li> I bought it after I read all the positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> About positive reviews....</li>
            <li> and it is a positive way for me to shave safley</li>
            <li> We did a lot of research when looking for a shaver and this one had a lot of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews and the positive track record I&#x27;ve had with Panasonic products, I went for it.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t give the product five stars simply because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a five star product I still think it&#x27;s about as good as you&#x27;ll get when it comes to ladies&#x27; wet dry shavers, which let&#x27;s be honest</li>
            <li> Great product, left my other one in Colorado on vacation</li>
            <li> So after a lot of research and a long hesitation to spend more again on shaving equipment, I purchased an Oster cordless hair trimmer (for dogs) and an Andis Outliner blade  </li>
            <li> So after a lot of research and a long hesitation to spend more again on shaving equipment, I purchased an Oster cordless hair trimmer (for dogs) and an Andis Outliner blade  </li>
            <li> He likes all that he has and his shopping process has been pretty straight forward.</li>
            <li> Much easier than a razor and hot water.</li>
            <li> First was for me and than one for my daughter-in-law  who is still telling me how much she loves it.  </li>
            <li> and it takes pretty much 24 hours to fully charge.  </li>
            <li> I started my tween shaving with this first to ease into the whole process.</li>
            <li> It still took me 2 passes to get a reasonably clean shave, and was not especially smooth or comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that could have been better (and the main reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars) is the charging method.</li>
            <li> Trying to find a decent razor designed for a woman is time consuming and tedious at best.</li>
            <li> but I am thrilled that I no longer have to apologize about my hairy legs when I have MRI&#x27;s and other tests!</li>
            <li> The pivot action of the head and the pop up trimmer are fabulous additions that I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Each time, the ES2216PC would work ok for a few months, but before long the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 1 or 2 shaves, and in general just seemed to underperform, not leaving my legs very smooth.  </li>
            <li> She barely used it in the winter and about every 3 days in the spring/summer due to having super fine hair on her legs (lucky!).  </li>
            <li> Nowhere as good as a plain razor, but decent.</li>
            <li> The first time over my legs I used a light touch and it left a bit of stubble.</li>
            <li> : It comes apart for easy cleaning and future replacement of blades.</li>
            <li> For anyone wanting a CLOSER shave, there are the masochistic epilators, or the one shaver which actually burns and removes the hair (for three easy payments of $$$...</li>
            <li> Luck.he masochistic epilators, or the one shaver which actually burns and removes the hair (for three easy payments of $$$...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be easy to break the shaver or the recharge unit, especially while it is charging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to shave better dry than wet&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now in the dry mode and love it.  </li>
            <li> I use it dry most often</li>
            <li> Shaving with an ordinary Gillette Venus is much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Being able to use it in the shower or dry when I&#x27;m in a hurry without any difference is what amazes me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave close enough and its not durable because it comes apart easily.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin in my bikini area and it just didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> I found using shaving creams is still better than shaving completely dry as it will cut closer.</li>
            <li> hairs on my legs were short and spiky and should have been easy for a shaver to grasp, but this one did not work.  </li>
            <li> ; easily and actually popped out on one occasion.</li>
            <li> The shaver has definitely come in handy for a quick dry shave</li>
            <li> Smoothest shave is with soap and water, but I&#x27;m content with dry shave most weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably my own fault from buying a Panisonic over the Lady Remington&#x27;s I&#x27;ve previously owned.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better if you have to quickly dry shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , cause have had many shavers over the years and using it dry is just my style.</li>
            <li> previous electric razor was a wet/dry Remington that I really liked and used for 3+ years, but I bought this one to replace it since it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore</li>
            <li> Better dry.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use,  shaves close enough, and stays charged as stated.</li>
            <li> Also, the charge held nicely when I first got it, but after a few months didn&#x27;t perform as well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This shaver has long battery life and shaves fairly close to a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good replacement for my remington - not real happy with this one.  </li>
            <li> I was informed by the representative that I would need to e-mail my receipt to a certain department, which I did.  </li>
            <li> The head is rather large and not convenient on curves.  </li>
            <li> but you can certainly use it in the shower as well.</li>
            <li> The price of blades is exorbitant, and they&#x27;ve become so large that it&#x27;s become</li>
            <li> Too large.  </li>
            <li> fuzz\\&quot; women of a certain age get.  </li>
            <li> Pure torchure.  </li>
            <li> It is too large for bikini area trimming.</li>
            <li> : I didn&#x27;t want to recommend any particular men&#x27;s model, just that you buy a men&#x27;s electric razor instead, but due to popular demand, here is the model of men&#x27;s shaver I purchased:</li>

            <li> Oh and forget the days where I used a brand new razor!!</li>
            <li> The charge seems to last a long time, and it worked best with shaving cream while wet.</li>
            <li> not a super close shave, but great for bringing on short trips</li>
            <li> Does a great job either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It does a good job for me - but I&#x27;ve only used it in the dry mode.  </li>
            <li> , i think it&#x27;s better on dry skin, but if you don&#x27;t have much time to shave and have to use it on the shower</li>
            <li> I realize that you&#x27;re not going to get the same kind of shave as a regular razor, but as someone who has extra sensitive skin everywhere, my time of using good old razors is at an end, particularly with summer approaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I used the razor the first time, it nicked my ankle area, but shaved the rest of my legs as well or better than other rechargeable ladies razors.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor back in June, and it was fine.</li>
            <li> After 1 year this razor simply doesn&#x27;t cut my fine hair anymore.</li>
            <li> It completely removed all of the hair and left it very smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It showed up yesterday in its nice little box.</li>
            <li> and I have been able to trim, but not able to shave it clean.  </li>
            <li> My sensitive areas are fine no cuts or rashes so far.....</li>
            <li> After using it for the first time, I wanted to clean it and hence was trying to open its outer foil.</li>
            <li> Works great on short hair, but when used on hair a little longer (1/2&amp;#34; or so)</li>
            <li> Holds a charge very well, takes up little counter space, and gives a nice shave.  </li>
            <li> Before if I wanted to wear shorts without little red irritation spots I had to do a rain dance, pray, massage my legs with peacock feathers, and hope that my skin was having a happy day.</li>
            <li> It does a good job shaving if you press hard.</li>
            <li> This works great, but need to be careful with handling, if it falls, it won&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
            <li> Perfect length and consistency, I was afraid it would end up patchy</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to start this process.  </li>
            <li> However, it is really convenient.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin as smooth as a razor, only the smallest stubble.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I have even used this in the bath and it works really well there too.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make too much noise.  </li>
            <li> But this one is real close, if you work at it a bit.</li>
            <li> I agree that it has a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> I really like the charging station.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t really expect to use it -</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I expected better performance from Panasonic than this though.</li>
            <li> She really likes the cordless feature.</li>
            <li> I used a cheaper conair shaver where the blades were sharper &amp; gave me a much closer shave, almost like the razor and never had ingrowths either.</li>
            <li> Really??</li>
            <li> It might work better if used it wet with shaving gel or something</li>
            <li> but shes fast with a standard/manual razor and doesnt have the patience to work with the electric one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quick shipping, fast charging and wet/dry shave almost as close as a blade?</li>
            <li> ) my opinion is much revised.  </li>
            <li> Still, very convenient for when I just don&#x27;t feel like showering to shave.  </li>
            <li> but you&#x27;d have to re-shave in 2 days or so depending how fast your leg hair grows.</li>
            <li> Very scratchy.</li>
            <li> Well, that doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li> The blades contour to my underarms and legs and give me a very close shave with no pulling or</li>
            <li> I hold my skin back and shave against the grain for a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I found it to be very time consuming and perilous.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this ladies razor really does the trick.  </li>
            <li> So much for my faith in panasonic razors.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t shave very well.</li>
            <li> This shaver is really convenient and functional.</li>
            <li> so I highly recommend not using it there!  </li>
            <li> I recharged once, cleaned it faithfully, and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> very promptly.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver was as advertsed, and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Just wish they made one that you can actually get a smooth shave</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t give a real close trim</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t even do much of anything but cause pain and pulling.  </li>
            <li> : You cannot get a straight line with this thing.</li>
            <li> I am very knowledgeable about what makes things run and why they do not.</li>
            <li> It shaves very well.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the wet mode will be better, but that wasn&#x27;t the intent.</li>
            <li> It cuts close &amp; leaves your skin feeling very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> a week recharge &amp; it is ready to go.</li>
            <li> This has made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> I was ready to toss the razors...</li>
            <li> so for the underarms, it doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li> Now when I say it cuts it, it doesn&#x27;t really go in there to do its job.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really cut as close or as well</li>
            <li> It included a hair guard attachment and there&#x27;s a piece that you can push up, the part of the blade, when you&#x27;re ready to start.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a razor that really cuts close, this isn&#x27;t the one.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a razor that really cuts close, this isn&#x27;t the one.</li>
            <li> It let my armpit very irritated.</li>
            <li> Very dissappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> The foil section does absolutely nothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After much looking and review reading I settled on this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The real breakthrough was the bikini trimmer...</li>
            <li> This is an absolute REVELATION in shaving.</li>
            <li> The person said that she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry i can&#x27;t say much on it.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave at all.  </li>
            <li> I am still searching for one that works really well for me.</li>
            <li> I love the pink, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as close??</li>
            <li> The pop-up razor really doesn&#x27;t work efficiently.</li>
            <li> being said this one works really well for the price.  </li>
            <li> Not all women love pink.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a nickel-free razor option because I was trying to figure out why my legs itched so much after shaving.</li>
            <li> A wet shave seems to do better.  </li>
            <li> But, it did pull my hair a bit, but I could&#x27;ve been going too fast.</li>
            <li> She really likes the trimmer attachment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected more.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t provide much of a close shave either.</li>
            <li> Not looking for a really close shave, just looking for controlled and manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really use it for an all over shave, as it&#x27;s still faster and smoother just to razor shave up to the shorts line on my leg.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave very well.  </li>
            <li> the shaver never looses power, always ready to go and stays charged during use.  </li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really buy it for that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting from an electric razor, but I really expected better than this.</li>
            <li> Leaves too much stubble.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t shave very close and would nick me during shaving and hurt.  </li>
            <li> It took a couple of tries to get used to it, but now I love it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> the bikini trimmer, cant really use it too well.&lt;br /&gt;we</li>
            <li> Really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li> As for the noise I don&#x27;t really care much.</li>
            <li> Convenient to use always ready and fully charged.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s capable of giving a close shave.</li>
            <li> It was used, placed on the charger (correctly with the charging light on) and the next morning it would not turn on.</li>
            <li> Very good&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li> There is no way I can use this and still feel comfortable wearing a skirt or shorts in public.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I bought another one and everything was much smoother and faster.</li>
            <li> This one does not shave very close at all.  </li>
            <li> This company needs to really do some work on quality control.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like electric shavers</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that I can use it in the shower and</li>
            <li> Thanks for making my life easier.</li>
            <li> My wife was constantly buying cheap battery operated razers for her and my daughter to use.  </li>
            <li> and I like the blade options so that you can simply do a close trim or a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted a reasonably priced shaver which did what I needed it to</li>
            <li> My hair grows fast and is course</li>
            <li> but I expected better results</li>
            <li> But I won&#x27;t be using it much.  </li>
            <li> I had just as much stubble unless I \\&quot;scrubbed\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it in the shower, but find the pivoting head really helps get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I really like my electric razor.</li>
            <li> I received it as a gift and was very hopeful.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been much of an issue for me.  </li>
            <li> Close shave, thanks in part to the flexible head.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t grab hair very well</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not holding out much hope.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After six months of use, however, I&#x27;m very unsatisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it still hurts yours legs while in use, still does not give as close of a shave as using a cheap-o razor and frankly is far from worth the price.  </li>
            <li> read the reviews and bought this shaver for my wife for christmas, she loves it ,works very well for her.</li>
            <li> thanks panasonic</li>
            <li> She told me she really likes it.</li>
            <li> - it gets VERY close to the skin.</li>
            <li> Very close shave.  </li>
            <li> This shaver really does the job for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> chose this one based on reviews and honestly expected a bit better.  </li>
            <li> The longer hair shaver piece isn&#x27;t as powerful as my old one, but nonetheless it does the job.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> really really rreally really really really like it.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the way this Panasonic cut so close and left my wifes legs as smooth as you know what.</li>
            <li> works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> You will get silky smooth legs for the same price</li>
            <li> Very close shave</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother in law who had very swollen legs as a result of cancer.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a struggle to accomplish much with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost a toy mocking the real thing..  </li>
            <li> but the charger is a real pain</li>
            <li> She just leaves plugged in and it is always ready when she needs it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with this in the winter months, but in the summer with shorts I use a wet disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of complaints about this not shaving very close...</li>
            <li> Gets a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> It is very durable.</li>
            <li> I am really used to manual razors, but this one does well in the shower.  </li>
            <li> If you use wet be sure to have something on the skin besides just water.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Very close, fast shave.</li>
            <li> This works very well,,,I</li>
            <li> I should have know it wouldn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Really does very close shaving.</li>
            <li> And it really doesn&#x27;t need much maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very well and always get 3-4 shaves before charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t pull at all unless I&#x27;m going WAY too fast, has never nicked me once, and really hugs my legs because of the pivoting head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try another brand and spend a bit more than the $30 I spent on it.</li>
            <li> Compared to the Remington, it is very underpowered and does not give a close shave on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I found myself re-shaving the same area with a throw away razor just to get smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for a really close shave, it just didn&#x27;t work like I had hoped .</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It still does not shave as close as a manual razor, but it does very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This thing has caused me so much stress, I&#x27;d rather poke needles in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This is absolute garbage.  </li>
            <li> Cuts really close.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave, which I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with electric shavers so when I decided to buy one to escape</li>
            <li> Actually I can&#x27;t really rate this one yet.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really like this razor.  </li>
            <li> Much easier than standing on my head in the shower.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave and you never have to replace any batteries.  </li>
            <li> And work very well</li>
            <li> :Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> It does a very close shave and the battery lasts for</li>
            <li> She tells me it pulls a bit and doesn&#x27;t really give her a close shave on her legs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and holds a charge well (over a week when only using it briefly each day).  </li>
            <li> This was a very inexpensive razor but it did the job well....</li>
            <li> It just sticks straight up off of the block.</li>
            <li> much else needs to be said.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this shaver because it really seems to get close to the body.  </li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t feel smooth after shaving comparing with the regular razor shaving.</li>
            <li> is very usefull and very higienic...</li>
            <li> When this does shave, it doesn&#x27;t get very close and it doesn&#x27;t work very well in the shower.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.  </li>
            <li> AM VERY</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable, and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> It never stayed charged as instructed - one use drained much of the battery, and it lives in the charging stand.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter when she was 10 and ready to start shaving.  </li>
            <li> This shave seems to perform very well, as advertised.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li> The only reason why mine lost one side was because of my own human error.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a few weeks now &amp; am loving the convenience of not having to lather up in the tub if I want to shave.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to replace my old razor that finally died after many years of use.</li>
            <li> This product cannot be rated properly by someone who expects the same kind of close shave that a razor would provide.</li>
            <li> rose above my expectations and I definitely  recommend this to any woman!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant in purchasing it because of some of the negative reviews I read, but the description and price was all good for me.  </li>
            <li> This is good in a pinch (like, you&#x27;re running late and realize you haven&#x27;t shaved your legs), but don&#x27;t expect a close or long-lasting shave.</li>
            <li> The charger is a little cube that allows for the shaver to sit right on top of the cube when it is plugged into the wall plug in.</li>
            <li> To me comfort and safety are very important, as is getting a close shave (it is relatively simple and cheap to get one without the other).  </li>
            <li> used this every single day since I&#x27;ve received it, and it has not disappointed me yet!</li>
            <li> It is very convient for major jobs and a quick touch up if I prefer to not use a razor.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle to use, and the shave is not as close as if I use a manual razor, but it does the trick quickly and relatively quietly.  </li>
            <li> The one positive thing about it though, is that it did stay charged for a decent period of time.</li>
            <li> I noticed that regardless of the angle I held the shaver at, the left side of the shaver would always work better than the right, making it so that I had to repeat the area multiple times.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really comment on this right now as this is a Christmas gift for my 90 year old mother</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as a normal razor, but also doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin as much; it works all right dry but better</li>
            <li> The only thing is it just makes my hair grow easily and faster than normal..</li>
            <li> But I love being able to use it dry for other areas!</li>
            <li> Well, more of a pink purple, but still very pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in All, I fully recommend this electric razor to anyone who needs an inexpensive decent razor to use, UNLESS you want want a shave that works like a blade, then I recommend that you save your money and stick with blades.</li>
            <li> With the long hair trimmer it easily cuts longer hair that the comb of the product won&#x27;t pick up.</li>
            <li> , stores easily, charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Comes with a bikini attachment (I have yet to try,) and nice clear plastic cover to protect the heads from dust and other things.</li>
            <li> This model is a little larger than my first one, although still good weight and size, and convient to use.</li>
            <li> Using it wet seems to be better for this particular area.</li>
            <li> It definitely still leaves a small stubble, but if you are looking for something electronic for safety or what not, this is definitely the best choice in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have to replace it 2-3 times per year--but many other shavers are $90</li>
            <li> I like to be environmentally friendly and choose electric shaver for last 25 years.</li>
            <li> and I had to attach them one after the other for better results; with this shaver I don&#x27;t have to do anything but to charge it, use it</li>
            <li> It also takes several swipes instead of just one-but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Works well, better than the other electric corded/cordless razors I had tried.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it does what it is advertised to do and does it better than other shavers that I have tried.</li>
            <li> But I like electric so much better now, because I don&#x27;t feel like I have to shave every other day</li>
            <li> From the very first shave, I barely made it through one shave before needing to recharge.  </li>
            <li> Exfoliating and moisturizing, as other reviewers recommended provides even better results.</li>
            <li> it does a better job than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I suggest that you get familiar with the shaver prior to using it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this and not have to spend time in the shower with a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> It shaves close and love the attachments for other grooming issues.  </li>
            <li> I had a sharp memory of the many cuts during all my years of shaving.</li>
            <li> Plus ain&#x27;t nobody got time to be that thorough on a normal day!</li>
            <li> It performs better than any other women&#x27;s shaver I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>
            <li> Be advised that it works 100 times better wet!  </li>
            <li> Better than any other electric I have used.</li>
            <li> I hoped for more at the time because my Panasonic shaver is extremely good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, while I suspect this shaver is good for large areas like legs, it is just adequate for your ladyparts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish it would of had come with was a brush to clean the blades out.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t shave as finely as a razor, but you avoid the nicks that are common with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;The bikini attachment is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t tear at hairs.</li>
            <li> Shave is smooth, fast, recharge lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t nick skin.  </li>
            <li> Well I haven&#x27;t had this panasonic as long, but so far its still 90% better.</li>
            <li> Also the blades cannot go back in when you take it out to clean</li>
            <li> The previous ones were excellent, I expected the same from this one...</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t intend to use it as my main shaving tool</li>
            <li> It works; it&#x27;s easy to clean; it&#x27;s small and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space; however, the shave leaves something to be desired.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the stubble falls out of the razor to the floor and you have to clean it up</li>
            <li> I liked that it could be used in the shower, but the battery does not hold a charge for too long - I have to keep it on the charger constantly.  </li>
            <li> I have used other Ladies&#x27; shavers in the past and this, by far, is the best one of all!  </li>
            <li> This razor received a high rating on consumer reports but I found it to be very ineffective.  </li>
            <li> And you can buy new blades on Amazon which just makes the whole process that much easier.  </li>
            <li> The dry option is nice  for last minute use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it mostly dry but have used it wet as well, with equally good results.</li>
            <li> have super sensitive skin, so I get bumps from razor shaving in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it both wet and dry, either way it gave a good close shave.</li>
            <li> This razor seems to nick my skin more frequently for dry shaves (haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I just use this on dry legs and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES-LT41-K (the same one my hubby has used happily for over a year), and after using it several months, will never buy another pink shaver targeted at women again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades frequently do not run smoothly and they will hurt you.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really shave that closely, when compared to a normal razor.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually pretty sensitive.  </li>
            <li> - my hair grows so fast that within hours after a normal shave</li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t matter to me too much that this shave isn&#x27;t 100% as close as a normal shave.  </li>
            <li> However, I couldn&#x27;t find enough compelling evidence to spend 10x as much, or even 3x as much -</li>
            <li> Although more expensive (yet still reasonably priced, imo) than the women&#x27;s shaver, the ES-LT41-K delivers much better value.  </li>
            <li> I had to replace my old Remington electric shaver and purchased their newer model first.</li>
            <li> I was pleasently surprised after trying this razor for the first time.</li>
            <li> This works better than your average electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Same thing happened; returned it for a full refund and bought another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and so far it is working pretty well.</li>
            <li> Not bad, actually.</li>
            <li> I have thick dark hair that it pulled and skipped over, my mother has fine light hair that it did better with</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend using this razor wet, however for a quick shave dry works good too.</li>
            <li> I have even received comments from the other guys at my club wanting to know what I do to keep things looking so attractive down there</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hands down, the men&#x27;s shaver is better.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good shaver and does its job, but I&#x27;m going to try my little Remington again</li>
            <li> So new razor it is!</li>
            <li> I just used my new razor out of the shower and it worked so well!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave close at all, misses hairs left and right and occasionally pulls, hurts the skin if you are not super careful to have it at the perfect angle, where it doesn&#x27;t cut.  </li>
            <li> It does, however, work great on those hard to get spots like the back of my knee</li>
            <li> The charger is great, it takes up as little space as possible which is a major plus in my book.</li>
            <li> http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ES2207P-Curves-rechargeable-Ladies/dp/B0018A32XS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1343180022&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;Panasonic+ES2207P I don&#x27;t care for the new shaver as much as I did this model.</li>
            <li> I am buying another one today, because there&#x27;s a $5 difference between the blades for it and a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> I have kept it super clean, but the blades just got dull very very fast.</li>
            <li> The wide head makes it easy to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use and gave my legs the appearance of being shaven, but my legs still felt rough and stubbly.  </li>
            <li> Previously had a Remington which shaved better and closer.</li>
            <li> As many of the previous reviews have said, it will NOT leave your legs super-smooth the way a non-electic razor does.  </li>
            <li> While I enjoyed this product while it lasted, after less than 10-months</li>
            <li> I use this dry and my legs are still smooth and stay that way for a couple days, just like a blade shave.</li>
            <li> Just so you know, the razor is definitely pink--mauve means a purple-ish pink, but this is just a rosy pink--it is nice, but not mauve.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one because of the lower price combined with well over 300 decent reviews.</li>
            <li> replaced an older Panasonic ladies shaver that I had had for 20 years, but should have replaced sooner.  </li>
            <li> you want a portable, rechargeable (haven&#x27;t had it die on me yet), decent shaver - go for this one.</li>
            <li> My current wet/dry electric shaver finally died after many years of use.  </li>
            <li> I made sure it&#x27;s fully charged and all it would do it would actually pull my hair but not shave it at all even though I&#x27;d run it multiple times over one area of my leg...</li>
            <li> I will just note that this particular razor is the low end of the line and the others are likely better.  </li>
            <li> I will just note that this particular razor is the low end of the line and the others are likely better.  </li>
            <li> i bought the wahl shaver, mainly because of the brand name.  </li>
            <li> Charges quickly and holds the charge through an extensive shave.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job at shaving but takes forever to charge.</li>
            <li> Decent for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a device that would give a close shave without cutting my skin, and also do a good job at being precise so that I could leave some hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews and was hoping to get a decent razor.  </li>
            <li> My wife now has 2 dead razors and I must take them apart to remove 2 good batteries for proper disposal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I do want to say that the Panasonic ES2207P razor, which seems to be this exact same razor WITHOUT the pivoting head, gives a shave that feels exactly like I have used a manual</li>
            <li> Especially on those days when I forgot and need a quick shave.</li>
            <li> Need charger&#x27;s like was on the older models with a cord.  </li>
            <li> I chose this particular one because of the feedback</li>
            <li> When charging, there is no green light to tell you the shaver is charged as it remains red.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close as a wax job but does a decent job.</li>
            <li> It misses most of the hairs and you have to go over the same spot several times to get a hair to cut.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this particular item is defective and does not represent the quality of the product?</li>
            <li> It seems to charge quickly and holds a charge for what seems like several shaving incidents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since the Remington had been so reliable with a decently close shave, I went with another one.</li>
            <li> My main problem is, once the battery stops charging, you can&#x27;t replace the battery.</li>
            <li> she says a charge lasts forever, only complain, the shave isn&#x27;t super close</li>
            <li> getting older and needing a safer way to shave.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this since reviews were decent.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it over a classic razor for the bikini region.</li>
            <li> My most recent purchase is the second one of these that I have bought.  </li>
            <li> However, I already have another smaller shaver for this and didn&#x27;t need a replacement, especially if it should be able to do my legs as well.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t expecting the same results as an actual blade razor or more costly electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong purchasing this especially at this awesome price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this razor is decent.</li>
            <li> it works in the shower just like it said takes a great charge and charge last at least 2 shaves for me</li>
            <li> Also useful if it has been a while as a brushclearing tool before more delicate methods are required.</li>
            <li> I could see how if you have dark, coarse hair on your legs, you might not be happy with the results of this razor as the shave would last maybe 1 day before you would see the hair growth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like a shaver that would at least be reliable for a year, preferably more!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, OK as a trimmer for the bikini area but not a full on replacement razor.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hold a charge long and the blades were original and probably dulled</li>
            <li> This one does an amazing job once you get used to holding it the right direction, and leaves almost nothing behind.  </li>
            <li> However, it has a pretty wide swath, you can go back and forth along your leg pretty fast, and you don&#x27;t have to pay that much attention, so it goes quickly.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptic that this shaver was going to be THAT much better than the previous one, as it was just 10 dollars more.</li>
            <li> I was expecting for it to be just a little better than that, not silky smooth on a dry run, but smoother than what I got.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use it in the shower and think it just great dry.</li>
            <li> , if you want something quick, easy, and reliable for small areas and have sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t like razors, then I 100% recommend this!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyone that I purchased these for rates it as highly as I do.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor to beginners or anyone that has been shaving for years.</li>
            <li> This was highly rated so I bought it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this ladies shaver.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> For an electric razor, I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> It exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you find one with a charger that has a cord, I would recommend it highly, but not this one.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this razor</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am sure this item will not last 20 years like my old one, as it already doesn&#x27;t hold a charge well enough to shave very close.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an electric razor, I highly recommend this one for the price.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The noise level is too high like a tractor.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> Both offered high praise for the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least ten different ones and this is, by FAR, the best that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Finally he got sick of me using his and told me to get my own. :p  </li>
            <li> Do I consider it a particularly close shave for someone like myself who normally uses an Intuition razor?</li>
            <li> but you will get a decent shave quickly and it works very well dry.</li>
            <li> Needed new blades and found it cheaper to get a whole new shaver.  </li>
            <li> I do not feel that it works very well, and it takes many times of use in the same spot to remove even a limited amout of hair.</li>
            <li> Have only used this a few times, but working good so far!</li>
            <li> While it does a little more time to get the shave that I like, bikini  </li>
            <li> What I know is that my wife bought this, and my life just got a little better...</li>
            <li> Love this little shaver and the bikini attachment is an added bonus.  </li>
            <li> Sure it takes a little longer but its not like I&#x27;m going anywhere.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little longer than you&#x27;d think, with more passes, to use an electric shaver over a hand held manual razor.</li>
            <li> For the first few months of use this electric shaver worked fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very slow and does not do a good job.</li>
            <li> My last razor, this same brand and model, needed a new charger and blades which cost more than a new razor.  </li>
            <li> It works at the first few times, but not as clean as the straight razor.</li>
            <li> It will be especially nice when we are traveling in our RV where the shower is so small it is hard to shave with a blade.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, dark hair that grows quickly and fair skin, so I normally shave with a razor every other day.  </li>
            <li> I got this shaver to replace my 10 year old Remington that I really miss.</li>
            <li> I assume the break occurred while I was cleaning it or reattaching the head, although I am surprised since I feel like I handled the product reasonably.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been very reliable.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I don&#x27;t have that problem with this one, but the foil makes it harder to get a neat close shave.</li>
            <li> and so far it shaves very well.</li>
            <li> Underarms are as smooth with this razor as with a traditional 3-blade throw-away razor, and this one has a pivoting head that glides across my skin much easier than any traditional razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> On a wet run, it&#x27;s smoother, but, again, not silky smooth or as smooth as I expected</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not as close or as smooth a shave as wet shaving</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product often enough or owned it long enough yet, but, thus far, it has provided a good, close shave, and i have no complaints.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;boxy&#x27; part plugs in to the wall (like normal),</li>
            <li> , I do wish it had a cord like a normal appliance!&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> My Husband was able to cut it with his heavy duty scissors.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am not crazy about is that it doesn&#x27;t have a charging station, if just has a plug for the wall that you put the razor in,  it does not work well at my house based on the way my outlets are setup.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say that this is an okay shaver for the price, but if you can afford it, get a slightly more expensive and higher quality shaver that will shave evenly.</li>
            <li> razor itself seems a bit &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;, since most of the parts are made of plastic, and it isn&#x27;t quite as heavy as the Phillips Norelco Men&#x27;s shaver which I have.  </li>
            <li> Also, razor was so wide (versus the similar razor with only 1 foil) that I could not get a good shave in my underarms or around my knees.</li>
            <li> I had this same shaver for so many years that I can&#x27;t remember how long I had it.</li>
            <li> I just get a big smile to think about it...</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver a few months ago and still love it.  </li>
            <li> I was warned electric razors don&#x27;t get as close as a normal razor</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the dulling was an issue with my use or care of the razor, as I didn&#x27;t use it very often to begin with (not more than three times a week at MOST)</li>
            <li> This razor is okay in a pinch, but I do not get a close enough shave and the battery does not hold out that long.</li>
            <li> I use a normal razor for my legs</li>
            <li> It still gets closer than I can manage with a normal razor, but doesn&#x27;t cause irritation even when shaving against the grain.  </li>
            <li> The flexible head is fun to play with, but too wide to be entirely comfortable for my smaller curves when I&#x27;m trying to get a close shave, so consider the head dimensions when purchasing.</li>
            <li> My old one was from another company and at first I tried to buy exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> I will rate each thing I tried with this razor 1-5, 5 rating good and 1 rating poor.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product,it didn&#x27;t live up to them.</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend this as a high quality razor, particularly for people with sensitive skin or nickel</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may be better for women with normal thickness hair, but mine is super thin and uncooperative.</li>
            <li> I live in an old house and all my outlets are very close to the floor.</li>
            <li> Also, hot water makes your skin swell slightly, so after you cool off the hair sticks out farther than at the time of shaving.  </li>
            <li> Razor only works ok when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> ill say the best results were when dry.</li>
            <li> , after you use it... rinse the blades off, like take the part off and rinse it out... dry it with a towel real quick, then put it back together.  </li>
            <li> (nope, no totally silky soft skin), nor will you shave as quickly, so stop looking at electric razors to save time...</li>
            <li> word of caution about the charger, which is a 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch block that plugs into the wall: the blades of the charger plug are vertical blades on the left and right below the socket for the razor device charger plug.  </li>
            <li> , it is off the vanity right up next to the electrical plug.</li>
            <li> A plain recharging cord would be much more convenient but it wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker.  </li>
            <li> The blades did not last very long, and the replacement blades and foil cost more than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, and I expect to have it deliver a super sharp shave for at least a year.</li>
            <li> Most electric razors still pinch in those areas, but this one doesn&#x27;t as long as I keep the skin flat while working.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the cost when it broke so easily</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another reviewer said that this is excellent as a dry shaver OR a wet shaver but not very good if you try to shave damp skin (say, after a shower).</li>
            <li> It is bigger than the one I bought in Japan several years ago, but works fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge space-savings over the other alcohol-rinse system that she had previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using this as my shaving solution around anything other than tights.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> This is really disappointing, as I thought I&#x27;d found something that was really good!</li>
            <li> There is nothing unique about this wet shaver...</li>
            <li> ; It is a trimmer though so don&#x27;t expect it to keep your legs and other areas silky smooth.</li>
            <li> If I squeezed the head it would work a little but something just wasn&#x27;t catching properly on the inside.  </li>
            <li> I thought of buying a new charger but guess what..</li>
            <li> and I found the new blades cost as much as a new razor.</li>
            <li> And if it does wear out in a year, I can afford to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> I have had a Remington WDF6000 for years and needed to purchase a new razor.  </li>
            <li> I went to purchase a new blade and foil</li>
            <li> I new</li>
            <li> Like \\&quot;Kari\\&quot; from Colorado, I&#x27;ve always used Remington ladies razors and needed a new one, so I started researching and found this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a new Replacement Shaver Foil and Blade Set, so we&#x27;ll see if that solves the problem.</li>
            <li> The new ones seem to pull on my skin/hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me or the people I live with.</li>
            <li> , I had to buy a new one every year.</li>
            <li> I looked into buying a new battery but the cost of it didnt make sense.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> so I decided to get a new one.</li>
            <li> Now I have to buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> and they told to place order for new blades.</li>
            <li> so I bought her a new one.  </li>
            <li> She likes the new shaver.</li>
            <li> Not as close as shave as a new razor though.</li>
            <li> if we live through the electrocution, they&#x27;ll get sued, so no cord.</li>
            <li> Have had one before but was needing new battery and head so for the price</li>
            <li> I just bought a new one.</li>
            <li> I might as well buy a new one and toss this thing in the trash, where it belongs.  </li>
            <li> This new model seems flimsy and not made as well, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> When the blades on this get dull, I&#x27;ll be throwing it away instead of buying more blades (which by the way cost as much as the shaver).</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it takes a very tight fitting wall socket to keep the unit plugged in.</li>
            <li> I was okay with the lame shave on my thighs just because it&#x27;s a huge pain to use the disposable there, and it&#x27;s finer hair than my calves, so</li>
            <li> The second issue, is the fit of the&lt;br /&gt;shaver into the recharge unit is such that it requires \\&quot;fiddling\\&quot; to set it in place--especially if the unit is plugged into the wall while trying to reinsert the shaver.</li>
            <li> Now it takes more than a few passes of the shaver on my skin to completely remove hair.</li>
            <li> The power button on my particular unit is easy to hit accidentally and I find that I&#x27;ve turned it off during a shave a few</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care how fast it grows back.</li>
            <li> I have tried it in the shower also, probably glides better when wet, but I prefer to use outside of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It does an okay job of shaving my legs if I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to shave in the regular wet, shaving cream fashion, but I can still feel some stubble.</li>
            <li> The fact that I can do a quick touch-up dry shave anytime</li>
            <li> I used it to cut longer hairs, then I&#x27;d go back with a regular razor to get it completely smooth.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a closer shave and isn&#x27;t irritating to the less sensitive skin), but I find that an electric razor works best for my underarms and bikini area.  </li>
            <li> It had been so long since I had an electric shaver, and I am glad I purchased this one.&lt;br /&gt;Holds charge a long time.</li>
            <li> (although I would personally recommend wet with gel, it glides better that way)</li>
            <li> Pretty good, get&#x27;s dull after 3 months of every other day use.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and you can use it dry or wet.</li>
            <li> Also I had an unopened package of replacement blades that fit the same shaver, (and they are no small expense), so that was a big factor in my decision to purchase this replacement.</li>
            <li> This area is very sensitive on me and this electric razor was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My Situation:&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This replaced an very old shaver I had.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I just replaced the blades for the first time, thinking I&#x27;d get the same performance as brand new, but that was not the case.</li>
            <li> Granted there is a large price difference (between the Men&#x27;s exceptional razor and the women&#x27;s mediocre one)</li>
            <li> I thought an electric would be fine, because I have severe arthritis and can not bend over in the shower to use a razor.&lt;br /&gt;After the first shave the blades were already dull.</li>
            <li> so I get a pretty close shave that personally works for me.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt one bit, even in sensitive areas!</li>
            <li> The first Panasonic I had lasted 6 years, and finally the metal hair cutters broke.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> CHEAP and INFERIOR NOT WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> This was the second shaver I tried (first one was not Panasonic)</li>
            <li> was actually my second try at this product -- the foil on the first one broke.</li>
            <li> The first was ordered Feb 14 2013 and the second Nov 14 2014.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well especially for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because I do not have enough hot water in my apartment to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> Apparently that&#x27;s too much to ask of this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> broke on the first use, despite me following package instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Upon first fall it broke into three pieces, we had put it back together</li>
            <li> I owned one exactly the same brand and product.</li>
            <li> I Love this, no more having to shave legs in the shower, I can do this before and even when just popping out to the shops, no it does not shave as close as a razor but what does?  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would say, after having it for around 2 years now, is that the battery life is not as stellar as it once was.</li>
            <li> She seems to use it pretty regularly.  </li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money or time!</li>
            <li> It is pretty but looks are deceiving especially in this case.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted ten years.  </li>
            <li> She says it works better than other, cheaper razors, but occasionally leaves longer hairs on her legs that it does not cut.</li>
            <li> On the first day that I used this thing, I couldn&#x27;t get the pop up trimmer to stay in place - it finally broke.  </li>
            <li> The charger is cordless, you place the shaver on the brick you plug into the wall directly!</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like it because I wasn&#x27;t used to a big electric razor.</li>
            <li> First of all I have to say...if you CAN use a regular blade razor with shaving cream, soap, or what have you, DO IT!  </li>
            <li> Funny thing is, this one is actually cheaper than the one I had before</li>
            <li> I have pretty coarse hair</li>
            <li> The granddaughter actually invited me into the bathroom to witness and offer ideas for he first shaving.</li>
            <li> It has a small charger that plugs into to the wall outlet, with a post on top that fits in the bottom of the charger.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and could not find in local stores.</li>
            <li> Its pretty quiet, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, the trimmer is almost pointless.</li>
            <li> It did not come with any sort of way to keep all the components together when not in use, but that is an easy fix I will go get a little makeup bag to store it in....</li>
            <li> I use hair conditioner, you just need a little something to act as a lube to glide easy over skin.</li>
            <li> This one was the same physical effort but without the clean shaving blades to it.</li>
            <li> I tried it both in the shower and on dry skin, and I like it on dry skin better.</li>
            <li> I expect a brand new shaver to very cleanly cut in one past.</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic es2045 died so I needed to get something new.  </li>
            <li> After my old electric shaver gave out, I looked around for a new one for a month or so.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned/dry/light colored hair - sometimes I do have to run it over the same area a few times to make sure everything is taken down as far as possible, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting any different.</li>
            <li> The shape is comfortable for my small hands and it does not weigh much.  </li>
            <li> I am using this only as a DRY Shaver and seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li> You basically have to charge it upright but the unit itself is so heavy, it can easily fall out of the socket.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these and since the second one did what the first one did, I have to say they&#x27;re complete garbage.  </li>
            <li> It worked fairly well at first, but before a year was even up, it stopped cutting my hairs.</li>
            <li> That one did a great close shave, but sometimes it pinched the delicate parts a bit, so you had to be real careful.</li>
            <li> NIce idea on the pop up trimmer; but I think I&#x27;d rather have a larger shaving area than the small head on this.  </li>
            <li> It rests vertically on top of a small square box that plugs directly into the wall.</li>
            <li> And....I have tried using it with my hair being different lengths (wanting to make sure that it had grown out enough and other times not too much).  </li>
            <li> I just cant say enough positive things about this razor.</li>
            <li> Not powerful but accessible.</li>
            <li> After several months&#x27; use she is a Panasonic convert because of the smoothness, rash free long running time time!</li>
            <li> To much frustration, the new shaver did the same thing!</li>
            <li> First of all, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a really close shave, but I ended up having to go over my legs again with a regular razor and honestly, the regular razor irritated me LESS than this, even wet with shave lotion on.</li>
            <li> It pulls hair, skips right over massive patches of hair and in general is a pain in the ass.</li>
            <li> i personally do not like to shape up my &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; in the shower, so i don&#x27;t know how it will do in the shower, but as for dry it was a smooth process.</li>
            <li> I only wish I had found this sooner - I almost enjoy shaving now, and it can be done quickly, dry, anytime, with no injury.  </li>
            <li> I only wish I had found this sooner - I almost enjoy shaving now, and it can be done quickly, dry, anytime, with no injury.  </li>
            <li> It works better dry than wet.</li>
            <li> Works better wet with shaving cream than dry.</li>
            <li> have not yet used this shaver wet because it is just so much more convenient to use dry.</li>
            <li> Also, I  find it better to shave dry then wet.</li>
            <li> It does work better dry than wet.</li>
            <li> but it irritated my sensitve skin even when wet, and more so dry.  </li>
            <li> Love the wet or dry technologies.</li>
            <li> If I am wearing a bikini I would definitely use my regular razor to get a super close shave though.</li>
            <li> Wife says it does a good job, but is somewhat tedious to clean, due to the \\&quot;articulating\\&quot; head.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li> Shaver\\&quot; 3 times in the past (they die about once every 18 months) and thought this would be better and was only a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far less than with shaving though and doesn&#x27;t bother me, but if you&#x27;re looking for completely burn free shaving</li>
            <li> Have only used it dry so far, but the cut is smooth.</li>
            <li> But after using it a few times, it&#x27;s fine now because I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re inclined to razor bumps and bruises, I recommend electric razors in general and the Panasonic in particular.</li>
            <li> Not sure if other folks haven&#x27;t used good razors so they have nothing to compare to or if I got a dud</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as other electric razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> It shaves down clean and smooth with little more than one pass because of the larger multi-foil head and that means less time shaving.</li>
            <li> I like the overall design, mostly the pivoting head, but I think the engine or system is not as powerful as it should be, to get the job done, I have to run it up or down several, several  times and it does not give a close shave, so i have to finish it with another device.</li>
            <li> It works fine, I don&#x27;t see any problems with it, it may a little heavy, but gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Also, I have had to go over certain areas several times to remove hair.</li>
            <li> Typically, you would only find such a great and close shave in the more expensive products.  </li>
            <li> As I had only intended to use the product occasionally and as a supplement to my regular razor, that was fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have wall plugs with horizontal blade holes on the top and bottom, the charger will need an extension of some sort, or one will end up charging razor on it&#x27;s side (which I imagine is extremely hard to do).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did use it for some other body hair removal where I didn&#x27;t mind if it wasn&#x27;t super close and that works well.</li>
            <li> They seem to last longer than other products, and maintenance is easy.  </li>
            <li> Huge waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a $29 purchase, this clearly was not an option...</li>
            <li> Very tempted to toss it in the back corner of a drawer and get another like my old one.</li>
            <li> After several tries the results did not yield a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> This was not seen or clear in the add to be viewed.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product and I am sorry that did not buy sooner.</li>
            <li> You do have to go over the same section of leg to get it smooth, but that&#x27;s expected with electric.</li>
            <li> It comes with clear instructios to use it and take care of it.</li>
            <li> I have found that if I am patient and use this shaver slower than my old regular razor I can still get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find this one at such a reasonable price for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> so you know when the razor is charged completely.  </li>
            <li> IT WILL NEVER REPLACE A PROFESSIONAL BRAZILIAN WAX...  </li>
            <li> So I returned the razor, and I am back to using my straight razor for a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> and it is loud...</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t remember the last time</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised.</li>
            <li> a power cord; it has two prongs that need to be slipped directly into a wall socket, or,&lt;br /&gt;if desired, plugged into an extension cord.</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in my hand and is not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> When I want a fabulous shave for my legs, I&#x27;ll still use the Mach 5, but for everyday shaving, I like this product for it&#x27;s versatility in and out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this razor so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for an old Remington soft and silky because I could no longer find a replacement head for it.</li>
            <li> It really shaved well, as soon as I got home I investigated further.</li>
            <li> If your thinking about upgrading an old razor or looking to start out</li>
            <li> It charges directly into the wall plug, which eliminates having a dangling cord.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it arrived a day early.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 12 year old daughter, as she was taking 30 minutes to just shave her legs every time.</li>
            <li> I use it to maintain a complete Brazilian shave, and it does not pull or pinch, and I have never had a cut.  </li>
            <li> Close shave and so much faster for daily touch ups.</li>
            <li> I also like that it plugs directly into outlet</li>
            <li> i wondered, wow, where was this shaver when i needed it the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Panasonic left absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> I like the direct plug in recharger.  </li>
            <li> This razor is gentle enough</li>
            <li> this razor is much quieter than my last one!</li>
            <li> slower in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t trust it as far a I can throw it.  </li>
            <li> Well, I guess it was about 12 years old...</li>
            <li> Fast, QUIET, and did the job.  </li>
            <li> Tried replacing my old one when it broke and the conair brand sucked.</li>
            <li> I do like the action and the fact that the head tips and tilts around my bony knees and shin bone.  </li>
            <li> The tin wrapped around the one section fell off completely.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for my young daughter.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> There are multiple lengths and shearing was very</li>
            <li> It makes a loud noise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly quiet, and it holds a charge really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.  </li>
            <li> this was purchased as a gift for my wife , whoneeded to replace her old shaver.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found it in nearly 40 years, but maybe someday....</li>
            <li> I still prefer the old fashioned razor blade and shaving gel method for the closest shave.  </li>
            <li> It might be alright for others, as I have extremely sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I have an old Remington razor that is 10 years old.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it...</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but the one downside is the battery only lasts about 45 days.</li>
            <li> The shaver is able to get small hairs out with no problem as long as it is very close to the root of the hairs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to give up my old habits while switching to an electric razor.</li>
            <li> As far as closeness, speed, and comfort, she says 5 stars on all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Not what I would expect from an old reliable company like Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The charger for this product plugs directly into the wall plug in/outlet.</li>
            <li> it was 5 years old and just &amp;#34;ran out of gas&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> But it is fast and it beats all the cuts I get from traditional razors.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve replaced the foils, which doesn&#x27;t seem to have fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using a shaver on anyplace as sensitive as that anyway.</li>
            <li> It takes you straight back to the 2 day after shave.</li>
            <li> Still using my old version of this with just the 1 foil.</li>
            <li> Not anywhere near close to skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old shaver, which was 15 years old.</li>
            <li> I absolutely can not shave my underarms with this razor, I&#x27;ve tried numerous times and it burns and scratches.</li>
            <li> It must be old stock.</li>
            <li> Just like my old one.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic has a swivel head and is much easier to use especially under the arms.</li>
            <li> Did I mention I have sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> Well, so far no irritation.</li>
            <li> SO FAR</li>
            <li> No complaints so far</li>
            <li> old electric Remington, so off to Walmart I went.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies actually pulls the hairs as much as cuts.</li>
            <li> I like how the charger unit plugs directly into an electrical outlet...</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my old Panasonic; the battery would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> and I literally have to use 2 of them to completely do my legs ankle to groin.  </li>
            <li> The charger plugs directly into the outlet,with the razor on it.</li>
            <li> I know electric razors don&#x27;t get as close as the real thing, but this Panasonic left me feeling like a wildebeest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this because my skin is so sensitive to everything I needed an alternative.  </li>
            <li> Too loud - doesn&#x27;t have a close shave, but would do in a pinch..</li>
            <li> Have had this razor for several weeks and really like it.</li>
            <li> I only use this shaver for the edge of my bikini area- not the whole thing.  </li>
            <li> so she was satisfied with it since it would at least avoid being cut from a razor nick.  </li>
            <li> The shave is not as close as a razor, but darned near close, and the hair&#x27;s not even visible.  </li>
            <li> I have an old</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, somewhere between this and my old model, Pansonic decided to replace the cord charger with a wall-mounted unit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another point of note about the product is that the charger plugs directly into the wall, so keep that in mind.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely remove the hair.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see that it worked just like the advertisement promised.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li> and I can no longer get the damn thing to sit straight on the charger and actually charge.  </li>
            <li> Now have to pay for shipping to return it and no guarentee it will be fixed</li>
            <li> I had been a shaving with a common Gillete razor before this incident and after many cuts, I decided I needed to switch.  </li>
            <li> Over time, it stopped working very well, until it stopped doing anything... not the motor, but the internal blades.  </li>
            <li> I took it traveling with me and one of the delicate plastic parts on the top of the plug that the handle snaps onto got bent and snapped off.  </li>
            <li> The bikini attachment is a joke, you can&#x27;t use the thing on your armpits without harming the sensitive skin, and</li>
            <li> I wanted to stop paying for products that irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really do that since it only worked on my legs...</li>
            <li> My old razor used batteries so it saves money not to have to buy batteries all the time.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my 10 year old.</li>
            <li> My old shaver took me 10 minutes max.</li>
            <li> Of course it is no where near as close as a razor</li>
            <li> No trouble so far.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;closely.  Very versatile as you can shave underarms and private area w/o worrying about&lt;</li>
            <li> they itch so much after about 30 minutes that only drawing blood will get me to stop scratching my legs (no matter what moisturizer I use), and I don&#x27;t even want to think about the ingrown hairs that develop after a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the product for my 93 year old mother</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bulky, loud and as mentioned, ineffective for what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> But overall this is making my skin SO much happier.hough.</li>
            <li> But overall this is making my skin SO much happier.</li>
            <li> I take my time shaving and so far I got four shaves and still didn&#x27;t need a recharge</li>
            <li> Obviously if you were to put the charger in the bottom outlet, you&#x27;re going to cover the whole thing</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I received the shaver.  </li>
            <li> It has double heads and some springs or something that helps follow your curves and shave really close.  </li>
            <li> I also use it for underarm hair because it&#x27;s much gentler on my skin than a traditional razor.  </li>
            <li> I bought one for my 29 year old daughter, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping it and as far as electric shavers go</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been doing the old fashioned razor and shaving cream routine in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We just bought two more for her as \\&quot;spares\\&quot; in case this gets discontinued in the next few years.</li>
            <li> Only negative that we can tell is that when you charge the unit, there is only an indicator light that it is charging, and it does not show an indicator light when the charging is complete.</li>
            <li> After few months of using it rarely (i don&#x27;t have much hair on my legs or bikini line)</li>
            <li> I fear that I will receive it and have the same problems of which I will have wasted more money on the shaver.</li>
            <li> The style of blades was completely different, it took twice as long to shave (if not more) and it wouldn&#x27;t do a good job at all.  </li>
            <li> After using for several months I broke it by dropping it a few too many times and ran to Walgreens to pick up a replacement, they didn&#x27;t have this model</li>
            <li> Any company that forces you to spend more money (on a low cost item such as this) to send their crap back to them before they&#x27;ll fix/replace it isn&#x27;t standing by their product, isn&#x27;t providing good customer service and isn&#x27;t worth my time and money, nor yours.  </li>
            <li> As others have stated, this is a good (not excellent) shaver.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t say anything good about it.</li>
            <li> The new one broke even quicker than the first, lasting only 1-2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked okay, not as good as a dry razor I use (bikini area), but again I&#x27;m just disappointed that it died.  </li>
            <li> The charge last a long time and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> I mean the legs and armpits are ok, but if you want a close shave in bikini area, forget about this shaver.</li>
            <li> I always used regular razor blades because I thought electric razors weren&#x27;t very effective, this razor proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> Just a little hand soap directly on the foils, rub it in, and turn the razor on and its clean.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my first time using an electric shaver, I switched over from blades two years ago, and the hair wasn&#x27;t even very long.  </li>
            <li> Ditch those ladies specific shavers if you want a clean, close, quiet shave and go out and get yourself a manly shaver for those womanly legs.  </li>
            <li> MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED, COMPARED TO THE OTHER ONE,</li>
            <li> Easy to take for travel no cord small charger.</li>
            <li> yeah, it gets a fairly decent shave on your legs, but only after spending too much time going the same area over and over again...</li>
            <li> The little pop up trimmer works as described, even works when its not popped up - went to clean it and noticed it had a collection of hair there even though I&#x27;d not used it.</li>
            <li> No water, no soap, no mess.</li>
            <li> It leaves behind a small prickle (which I&#x27;m sure most women don&#x27;t like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> It may be a problem if you have super sensitive skin, but I have a skin which is a little sensitive</li>
            <li> I buy the panasonic ES2207P for my wife a few months ago, and it works perfect, close shave, almost like an ordinary razor, without the irritation, so i decide to try with this other one that have and extra foil and pivot head</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not something I can use everyday with getting a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Wife was all smiles after first dry shave!</li>
            <li> Possibly works better for those with less coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Product is fine if you want to take the excessive length off.</li>
            <li> I mainly used it for my bikini area and it irritated my skin just like a regular razor does.</li>
            <li> Amazon, however, has been very prompt with the response to my complaint and has promised to issue a full refund.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted about 6 years, the second one about two years before I had to replace the screen and head and instead of replacing the head for the second time, I purchased this razor.  </li>
            <li> Gave my first one to my mom and replaced later with a conair razor, big mistake, I returned to Amazon and bought another one of these.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first until I was actually able to try it</li>
            <li> I got this shaver to replace my older Remington, but returned it after only one use.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried wet shave yet, but dry shave works fine for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor if you prefer power shavers to actual razors.</li>
            <li> It cuts hair smoothly without pulling or nicking and it isn&#x27;t necessary to keep going back and forth several times over the same area in order to cut all the hair.  </li>
            <li> After reading the review on Amazon, I had  high expectations, but this razor is definitely at the bottom of my list of razors.</li>
            <li> She told me I would need to ship my entire razor to either New York or California to have it fixed.  </li>
            <li> but I will use no other razor if I have to!</li>
            <li> Have not used wet but dry it does not give a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it for quick shaves when I didn&#x27;t have time for a full one, but it&#x27;s pointless now as to shave any hair takes 5x as long as a shave in the shower with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> This is fine for a rush job -- I still have a little stubble left after shaving.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of straight razors</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even thought of using an electric shaver for more than 25 years and that experience was not a good one.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give nearly as close of a shave as it says it does, and it barely takes the hair away.</li>
            <li> It does everything she wants, she loves the wet/dry functionality, and the battery lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long the blades stay sharp but replacements appear to be available.  </li>
            <li> The aesthetics of the trimmer is pretty, but don&#x27;t expect your bikini-lined hairs to be the same length because some will be long while others will be nearly gone.</li>
            <li> this one - July 2014 - and after 5 months, it will barely hold a charge to complete shaving both legs.</li>
            <li> When I opened the first razor and examined the switch I found that although it appeared to be closed it was not making an electrical connection.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying a shaver and after careful consideration I decided on this one</li>
            <li> The angle of the design is perfect; it never seems awkward and the size and weight feel natural - not too heavy or bulky.  </li>
            <li> Oh, it is pretty in pink but in this case screw the color.</li>
            <li> She breaks out normally in the armpit area from regular razors.  </li>
            <li> The price is higher than what I spent 5 years ago, but I think Pansonic&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of Remington&#x27;s but have had some trouble with the last ones (battery not lasting, needing to replace the blades more often</li>
            <li> You also have to get used to going over the same patch a few times, but you can be more leisurely since you can shave while watching TV (if single and live by oneself).</li>
            <li> This little razor does it all and cleans up with just a quick rinse under the faucet.</li>
            <li> first few shaves were decent.</li>
            <li> Luckily I have very thin, light leg</li>
            <li> ;) It does seem a bit rough on the skin, but nothing major.</li>
            <li> It seems like the blades get dull VERY quickly, even though the information included with the razor claimed the blades would last at least a year or more before needing to be replaced.</li>
            <li> My legs react badly to regular manual razors, so I needed something new.  </li>
            <li> My current Remington was in need of new blades</li>
            <li> My new men&#x27;s shaver has a longer lasting battery with a battery meter and is &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34; versus &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; for the women&#x27;s shaver.  </li>
            <li> it was almost the same price to replace it as to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> I would buy a new one (since the replacement parts were expensive compared to the price of a new shaver, and the battery wasn&#x27;t holding a charge, and there didn&#x27;t seem to be many options) and repeat the frustration.  </li>
            <li> I did not expect Amazon to send me an open box when it says in the description it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> , I decided to finally shop for a new one, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on it.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend buying this if you are in the market for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> The new Panasonic simply does not cut, it is flimsy, it makes your legs itchy.</li>

            <li> B002N5MHLK Panasonic ES-LA93-K, Arc4 Electric Razor, Men&#x27;s 4-Blade with Multi-Flex Pivoting Head and Dual Motor, Premium Automatic Clean &amp; Charge Station Included, Wet or Dry Operation]] and my review of it: http://smile.amazon.com/review/R1BB4BSB822648/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It provides a very close dry shave without causing any razor burn.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re getting ready for work, running late, and it&#x27;s summertime and the only thing clean you have to wear is a skirt?</li>
            <li> but it was a delicate design that is easily damaged if you put it in your suitcase.  </li>
            <li> Anytime I would shave with a razor I would get ingrown hairs and dry rashes no matter how much I exfoliated or used lotion.</li>
            <li> Did not work very well back to my regular razor</li>
            <li> Battery last sooo much compared to my last one!!</li>
            <li> it will last for as long as the first one.</li>
            <li> Since my teenage years, I&#x27;ve tried numerous cordless/electric and straight blade shavers.  </li>
            <li> It is not as close of a shave as a regular razor, but it is much better than what she has been rocking as of late.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut hair very well, so it requires you to go over the same spot several times and</li>
            <li> has a small head like most shavers so it takes a long time to do your legs.  </li>
            <li> The only potential downside (for some) is that this doesn&#x27;t provide a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Not the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried - that distinction goes to my husband&#x27;s Norelco 5603x, much to his chagrin - but not the worst, either.</li>
            <li> I have contacted the company for repair, and after a long time on hold and extreme difficulty reaching an actual human, found out that my only option for repair is to mail it back (at my own expense) and they will determine IF it can be fixed under warranty.  </li>
            <li> , I charged it fully and then tried shaving, I ran it until the battery died and I hadn&#x27;t made it half way through shaving, not because the battery died quickly, but because it shaved so poorly, this razor is suitable for a child&#x27;s toy, but definitely NOT for a woman to shave her legs with</li>
            <li> have never used an electric shaver before so was a little tentative, especially about using it in the shower and getting it wet, but I read all the directions and now that I have used it a few times, I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it and it works great.  </li>
            <li> I actually purchased a second one after the motor on my first one died out from daily usage.</li>
            <li> So that is a major plus.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because blade razors usually give me razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to have to mess with hyper-chlorinated water and freshly shaved</li>
            <li> and I still haven&#x27;t managed to learn to shave without major blood loss, so</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> Have only had it two days, but on the first day I used it dry</li>
            <li> If I were to shave every three days with a typical razor I&#x27;d never have hair longer than right after using this.  </li>
            <li> Was going to fix my old one, but it was more expensive than buying a new one.  </li>
            <li> I was really freaked out by the thought of anything sharp going near my nether regions..</li>
            <li> and it shaves my legs in less than five minutes, close and smooth, completely dry.</li>
            <li> Product lives up to its claims -- is comfortable to hold and use, charges rapidly (which it hardly ever needs) and packs</li>
            <li> When I bought this I thought it was going to be just a cheap electric razor that would hardly work.</li>
            <li> I spent my money on this one and will be going back to Remington even though they cost a little more.</li>
            <li> I use this razor for my underarms since I get really bad razor burn and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is a light, although somewhat delicate, instrument that does what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Took it with me on a long vacation and had to spend too much time trying to put it back together after cleaning it.</li>
            <li> It works very well and has a long lasting charge.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy another Remington on the near future!</li>
            <li> I was careful the whole time, but there was no avoiding it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold up very well to a minimal fall.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews of how it plugged directly into the wall, I had already purchased a short extension cord for it to plug into, now it can sit on the counter.</li>
            <li> old daughter who began shaving her legs several months ago.</li>
            <li> so I was not really expecting much from this device.</li>
            <li> razor was a Christmas &#x27;10 present, and it&#x27;s BY FAR</li>
            <li> This barely even removes hair and pulls and snags on any you have.</li>
            <li> It barely cuts hair and I purposely didn&#x27;t shave for a while</li>
            <li> To a point, but really feels rough and scratchy while using, this causing me to procrastinate about shaving.</li>
            <li> The women&#x27;s shaver had stopped working very well since it couldn&#x27;t get fully charged long enough to do both legs, frequently leaving me with only one leg shaved.  </li>
            <li> My old one of 25 years finally died &amp; I had to replace it.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I tried out the bikini trimmer attachment, and it completely tore my bikini area apart.  </li>
            <li> The batteries die frequently and unless you shave your legs from all possible angles, it just leaves your legs stubbly.</li>
            <li> I can barely tell a difference after using this razor.</li>
            <li> My wife barely uses this shaver because it either doesn&#x27;t cut well or cuts her skin.  </li>
            <li> I developed a nickel allergy and could no longer use a regular razor, because none of them are nickel-free or hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> There are also no instructions on the web that I can find on how to replace them - we had to take a tiny screw driver and pry out the old ones.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last a year and never gave me the close shave that my old Lady Remington shaver did.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I did not return it was because I used the shaving parts on my old one.</li>
            <li> Am surprised that the grown back takes almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> results may not be acceptable for everyone, but if you too have course hair and sensitive skin (and I can&#x27;t be the only one out there), it may work for you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I have only used it once</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no slouch in natural science and it makes no sense to me, either theoretically or in practice.</li>
            <li> It performed the same as my first one; however, the battery does not last as long.</li>
            <li> I finally had to replace my nearly 20 yr.</li>
            <li> This barely cut my hair, in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Very close shave,especially when used wet.</li>
            <li> would definitely not use the bikini attachment or get this thing anywhere near my crotch.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying a 2nd one for my 13-year old daughter</li>
            <li> I only used it once so far</li>
            <li> Felt like you couldn&#x27;t get a close enough shave without taking the guard off completely.</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use a regular razor).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s barely getting any hairs off at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It barely shaves any hair.</li>
            <li> Used it a couple of times then went back to her old razor.</li>
            <li> It turned out that the blade closest to the bikini pop-out trimmer had partially popped out and had given me a pretty big cut.</li>
            <li> So I went to an allergist and they said that when you shave with a razor, you are removing the top layer of your skin and what I am allergic to is therefore irritating that layer of skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow and don&#x27;t make the skin as smooth as I wish .</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s difficult to tell sometimes how honest the recipient is being.</li>
            <li> Not a great razor, but not horrible.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t dare to hope that an electric razor could do a good job on a three month growth, but I was desperate to try something.  </li>
            <li> but I was actually really surprised how close this got for the first few times I shaved.</li>
            <li> I suppose I should have guessed that the shave from this kind of device would be laughable.</li>
            <li> It has poor quality and maybe I should have invested more money in a shaver or tried another brand.</li>
            <li> I came out more confused and unsure than when I went in.</li>
            <li> The trimmers work really well on longer hair -hey, gimme a break, being on hospital bedrest with a timed limit on your daily showers makes it super hard to shave regularly!  </li>
            <li> Their only solution was to package and ship the item to their Texas location, where it would be examined and repaired if possible, or replaced by a new shaver.</li>
            <li> The razor head moves left to right, up and down, in addition to forward and backwards.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long the new model lasts...</li>
            <li> Even right after shaving my legs were NOT smooth.  </li>
            <li> have not used the shaver actually in the shower yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; part of the \\&quot;wet &amp; dry\\&quot;, but all in all, the experience I&#x27;ve had with it has been positive.</li>
            <li> After reviewing a few different makes and models of electric razors, I chose this one because it claimed super sharp blades and a very close shave.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and at first I was worried it would give me a rash especially under my arms, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> in case you were too lazy to read or wanted a quick wrap-up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in case you were too lazy to read or wanted a quick wrap-up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re still left with underarm stubble that grows back twice as fast as using a regular razor because you didn&#x27;t go as low.</li>
            <li> But I really like this for shaving my arms and legs, shaves well due to the pivot head.</li>
            <li> Found this razor to be much quieter than the other one.  </li>
            <li> but now it hardly cuts and I&#x27;ve been diligent with keeping it clean and charged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t too heavy and the vibration isn&#x27;t extreme which is nice for people with arthritis or other issues with hand and arm strength and pain.</li>
            <li> After reading all the good reviews, I thought this would be at least as good, if not better, than my other shaver, but it is sadly lacking.</li>
            <li> I dropped this razor from a height of approximately 3 feet to a hard floor surface and it is still working great.</li>
            <li> the few extra dollars.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are very sharp and the \\&quot;hug your leg\\&quot; feel makes sure you legs are shaved</li>
            <li> Obviously won&#x27;t last as long as shaving with a normal razor</li>
            <li> After using regular blade razors my entire adult life, I wanted to try an electric razor and, on the basis of the favorable reviews here on Amazon, decided on this one.  </li>
            <li> I pulled out his Norelco triple headed Speed XL that was at least 2 years old and had rarely been cleaned or had a blade replacement</li>
            <li> Naturally, the shave isn&#x27;t anywhere near as close as with a disposable razor, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the bikini attachment is useful for since it barely works and always jams with the slighted amount of hair.</li>
            <li> This small handy razor give close cuts and no more cuts.</li>
            <li> Other than the head, I don&#x27;t know where on a woman&#x27;s body the hair is long enough for the guard to be useful....</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is past the 30 days that I have to make a return to Amazon, and the cost of shipping it back to the manufacturer seems better spent buying regular razors until I can afford another electric razor.</li>
            <li> THOSE hairs you just ripped out will take that long to grow back but there is always new hair coming in, so a once a week session is still in order).  </li>
            <li> I can run this &amp;#34;gem&amp;#34; over a single piece of hair over and over in different directions and WOW, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to cut a thing!!</li>
            <li> It can be hard to tackle them with an inflexible razor or even the bladed ones like the Bic Soleil, which are nice and all but don&#x27;t cover nearly as much surface area.</li>
            <li> So I choose this razor hoping to get the same close smooth shave that I got from the straight razor and boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> My other not cheap shavers would need me to shave 2 or 3 times longer and not feel as smooth or leave stray hairs.</li>
            <li> I have called Panasonic and apparently their phones are not working properly</li>
            <li> I have only used it once, it pulls your hair if your not careful.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it for long, but it suits my purposes so far.</li>
            <li> No long cords.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my old one died but lasted quite a long time and was made sturdy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had much success with electric razors in the past</li>
            <li> i wish it had an indicator for full charge instead of the fixed light that indicates &#x27;connected&#x27; :( )</li>
            <li> Now I usually don&#x27;t pay a lot for them but this purchase was worth it.</li>
            <li> and I wish I had bought one the first time before I wasted my money on another company&#x27;s electric razor.</li>
            <li> at least 4 full leg shaves.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The ability to shave dry is life changing - I can shave easily whenever and wherever I want with minimal fuss and mess.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier than getting up and down out of the bathtub or balancing on one leg in the shower when agility is diminished by age.  </li>
            <li> Not that the shaver is defective or there is anything wrong with it, I just have very fine hair on my legs, which caused it to miss a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li> -- It is one small box that has a plug built right into the box.  </li>
            <li> So far have just used twice dry...</li>
            <li> Totally surprised at how well it works in the shower with shave gel as well as dry.</li>
            <li> Although this product is value priced delivers a very close shave, it broke in less than 6 months.</li>
            <li> shave is not super close (though I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to be).&lt;br</li>
            <li> then I would doing my whole bottom half of one leg with the razor.</li>
            <li> The efficiency saved so much time, and I feel like my shaves are probably half the time</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s close enough to not see the armpit black pots from a certain distance.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I got unlucky--after about 6 months the shaver would barely hold a charge for a few hours (and yes, I generally take good care of my electronics, not leaving them plugged in all the time, and only charging them fully--overnight or for several hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several electric shavers and this particular razor works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;ve tried all the other brands, and no other comes close to the shave quality and comfort of this shaver for sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> We bought this to replace my Wife&#x27;s old Shaver (same model - lasted 11 years).Hopefully, this will last as long.</li>
            <li> So far, I have only used it dry</li>
            <li> I treated the shaver gently, stored it in a dry place and cleaned it carefully once a month.  </li>
            <li> You really can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It becomes even less useful as a wet razor.</li>
            <li> It really comes down to a personal decision of what works and doesn&#x27;t work for each individual person.  </li>
            <li> Recently I figured out if you make short up and down strokes and go around and around the leg in a spiral, the shave is much closer</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any irritation so far and find that shaving with this is rather quick and pain-free.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to get a smooth shave dry, and it was unconfortable to get shave the whole leg.</li>
            <li> It works very well wet or dry and requires only a fee passes to get all underarm</li>
            <li> I still use it on my knees and armpits because the Remington I bought to replace (wet/dry with the aloe vera strip) cuts me pretty badly in those areas but does an OK job on flat parts of my legs.  </li>
            <li> Would really like a little closer shave, but all in all it does well.</li>
            <li> I am extremely thorough in my quest for a new product--from cleaning products to shavers.  </li>
            <li> The first dry shave was satisfactory although not as close as the shave achieved with my previous electric razor.</li>
            <li> It seemed to go dull VERY quickly - I now have to turn it around backwards and use the other trimming blade to accomplish anything at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even give a decently close shave without pressing down, and even then, it&#x27;s inconsistent and stubbly.</li>
            <li> The charger is small and you just engage the shaver to it so that is also does not take up very much room</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether this malfunction was a very rare exception or not (judging by other reviews, it seems like it may be),but</li>
            <li> I can definitely live with that, and I&#x27;ve had the same problem with every other electric I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> For me, it is well worth paying that little extra for when unknown problems arise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor shaves pretty close leaving very little stubble.</li>
            <li> Not as quick and efficient at cutting as my previous Lady Shave by Phillips but that one lasted so long that I&#x27;m sure they don&#x27;t make the same model anymore.</li>
            <li> my pubic area because my boyfriend is not at all fond of too much &amp;#34;grass&amp;#34; down there!  </li>
            <li> (And the recharge is blazing fast - no more leaving my shaver charging overnight to barely get one decent shave before the motor is slowing down.)  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a manual razor due to constant razor burns, etc.  </li>
            <li> I had gotten a Remmington when I first went to college, but was never very pleased with the results - did not hold a charge long enough, gave me lots of nicks and abrasions, especially at the back of the knee -</li>
            <li> The reviews weren&#x27;t bad, the product description was good</li>
            <li> Tried few times not shaving clear so back to old way again</li>
            <li> first (afraid to cut myself) and inability to move quickly.</li>
            <li> Also, the blades seem to go dull very quickly- afte about a month and a half of moderate use!</li>
            <li> My rating of 4 is because I&#x27;ve only used the shaver a couple of times, so can&#x27;t speak for the length of the charge, or how long the blades stay sharp under normal use.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this razor hold a much longer charge than previous ones I have owned, but it also provides a close shave even dry.</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering a Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro, Black/silver, made for men.</li>
            <li> (One reviewer mentioned some other razor, saying everyone would like it better, but the cost was three times of this one with MUCH WORSE reviews, and I could not warrant over a hundred dollars for it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it is adequate--no better or worse than any other electric razor I have owned.</li>
            <li> hope it lasts for several years, like my little Panasonic hair trimmer that is still going strong after at least ten years, but sadly only takes batteries.</li>
            <li> &quot; I was a little taken aback at first since I could actually FEEL the shave this time, rather than the ES2207P which would just drag over my skin.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m looking for an adequate replacement for my old Remington 5000 which still works, by the way, but is getting a little dull</li>
            <li> and I have not had any skin irritation like other shavers that claim to be made for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My old one died and I went Panasonic as the other company didn&#x27;t carry the one I was use to.  </li>
            <li> Apparently it was an important piece that renders the entire razor absolutely useless if gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even went as far as shaving one leg with the disposable razor and the other with this razor.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, my big concern was that the charge would not last long enough.</li>
            <li> I think the price is a little high for me to try it again.</li>
            <li> It works quickly &amp; shaves closer than other electric razors I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much I will use it in the future</li>
            <li> My last razor had to sit on the counter (taking up room) and had such a long cord with it between the charger and the plug.  </li>
            <li> This razor requires you to go over the same area multiple times; as a consequence it takes a long time to shave.  </li>
            <li> Then one day it cut out again, and came back just long enough for me to finish some armpit shearing.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts longer than expected and after a few uses you get a pretty close shave for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I just as well have used a dull blade.</li>
            <li> It shaves closely without biting the sensitive areas and can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I was previously using a 20 year old electric shaver which started acting up a bit</li>
            <li> I use it dry so far, I have yet to use it wet.</li>
            <li> I shaves much closer &amp; has less drag.</li>
            <li> It works very well under the shower, and a rash from shaving is a thing from the past.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor this past April for my daughter who hasn&#x27;t used it that much</li>
            <li> I had an old man&#x27;s facial electric razor (10 years old at least).  </li>
            <li> I am lazy so this electric razor really helps to get the job done</li>
            <li> I never thought I will have to write negative review for this product when I used it for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> Oh.. another thing that I didn&#x27;t like about the panasonic is that while I was shaving, I could feel how is pulling the hair out, so that&#x27;s not fun when you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> First, the issues with these shavers are so common they give you the list of problems to choose from before you even speak to a person.  </li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic shaver to replace an old Remington shaver that was probably due for retirement long ago.  </li>
            <li> The only reasons it even took that long was b/c</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery charge.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t trim the hair unless you grow it out long enough.  </li>
            <li> The charge seems to last for a long period of time.  </li>
            <li> i found that if i use bikini device it will trim the hair long enough to show!</li>
            <li> If my leg hair gets too long (like in the winter), I use my husband&#x27;s attachment to get the hairs close enough to shave with this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> It will get hair off you body but not nearly as close as a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I use the pop up trimmer for my bikini area and the long hairs on my upper thighs.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you are supposed to go over the same place 10 times, but it took way too long.</li>
            <li> I was a long time user of the Lady Remington shavers but the last two I bought</li>
            <li> They last a long time.</li>
            <li> 2 springs fell out and it took too long to get the shaver back to working order.</li>
            <li> Will see how long it last now.</li>
            <li> The blades and outer foil supposedly last a long time</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time with regular use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, this product flat out</li>
            <li> The charge also last a long time.  </li>
            <li> and I have trouble using a normal razor).</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick, course leg hair.  </li>
            <li> So when that \\&quot;malevolent\\&quot; shaver died (good riddance), I tooled around Amazon looking for a replacement that had two characteristics: (1) designed for women; and (2) \\&quot;benevolent.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Although if using wet, make sure your arms/legs are wet and not damp as I found it does drag on the skin a little unless completely dry or wet!</li>
            <li> There has been no more razor burn for me and previous razor bumps are healing quickly.</li>
            <li> (except that it is too loud to use if other people are here!)</li>
            <li> It occasionally scratches my legs but the marks go away pretty quickly and it isn&#x27;t that painful.</li>
            <li> I would have paid a dollar or two more for metal, or at least hard plastic, buttons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent much more on other electric shavers that did a worse job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my new Panasonic for a few weeks now and have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone, unless you don&#x27;t mind buying a new one every few months.</li>
            <li> The charge doesn&#x27;t last very long either.</li>
            <li> : Very long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t last very long...</li>
            <li> Only a dry shave.</li>
            <li> I have only used this dry</li>
            <li> instead of something like a dock, which most rechargeable razors (both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s) have, this razor snaps on to a tiny plug which hangs awkwardly, precipitously off the wall.  </li>
            <li> I have only used the Panasonic shaver dry at this point.  </li>
            <li> I have dark and copious hair, so my legs really show dark hair.</li>
            <li> My Panasonic shaver is less than a year old.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this in the shower, dry only.  </li>
            <li> I only have used this in dry conditions and for camping.</li>
            <li> I use it dry only and on my legs.</li>
            <li> Whether I use it dry, or in the shower with a soapy lather, the results are the same.</li>
            <li> (I have only used it dry.)</li>
            <li> Just pop the head off, rinse all the parts, let dry, put back together.</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s unrealistic to expect any electric razor to give you as smooth a shave as a traditional razor</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it in the shower, only dry use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this razor dry (out of the shower).  </li>
            <li> I do have to admit that it did fall off the toilet tank once</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;ve had quite a few, as my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> We began full-time RV living several months ago and limited shower space is a fact of life now.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, both positive and negative, I decided to give this shaver a try.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s close enough to feel fairly smooth and look completely presentable - and I have thick dark hair and very pale</li>
            <li> It will cut (wet or dry), however, it will never compete with a straight razor, as this razor seems to leave a little &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I clean this shaver after each use according to the directions in the instruction booklet and use the shaver on a full charge, so the performance issues are not due to a dirty shaver or a weak charge.</li>
            <li> Due to the large amount covered I can cut my shaving time in half!</li>
            <li> But worse than that is that it never really gave me a good shave on my legs (and has been progressively worse recently).</li>
            <li> Also, the original plastic packaging was incredibly difficult to open</li>
            <li> I only used it dry and will only use the wet feature for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have only had this razor for a month and a half and have only used it several times.</li>
            <li> I have tried it wet, wet with shaving cream and dry, and none of the methods I have used have produced a shave anywhere near my manual throw-away razor.  </li>
            <li> Need multiple passes over your legs to get a close shave, and even then, the shave is not particularly close.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the shaver wet yet nor utilized its other sensitive features.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, this will not give as close a shave as with a razor, but any man who&#x27;s used the two different methods of shaving will tell you the same.  </li>
            <li> It is not really all that sharp feel like my old electric razor.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why manufacturers can&#x27;t make a high end razor for women.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver 2 or 3 times over the years after having a hard time choosing a women&#x27;s shaver that seemed to work well at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> It spends more time pulling the hair than cutting it.  </li>
            <li> I am one of those lazy women who forget about an important meeting at work until I&#x27;m in the shower and running late.</li>
            <li> was looking for the expensive model that my wife wanted, but she is happy with this... especially for the 10percent price from the expensive ones...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it more than 5 times and it just isn&#x27;t cutting it anymore.</li>
            <li> I realize it&#x27;s only $30 but for only 9 months of use, not worth it.</li>
            <li> I would take one in puke green as long as it worked as well as my old [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time and gets all the hair.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to switch over to an electric shaver from a razor, you will be disappointed by the results because electric shavers just cannot physically shave as closely, but a few minutes with this shaver every day gives a good enough shave for me.</li>
            <li> I wish now that I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to use it because I would have returned it.  </li>
            <li> Long hair cutter doesn&#x27;t cut well either.</li>
            <li> The long hair attachment worked well.</li>
            <li> I got what I expected, and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that it didn&#x27;t exceed my expectations, but did meet them satisfactorily.</li>
            <li> The wet/lather actually seemed to leave the hairs longer, plus there was water streaming everywhere making it harder to see.  </li>
            <li> It holds a LONG charge.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to switch to an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it takes twice as long</li>
            <li> Does the job when my leg hairs get long.  </li>
            <li> if your hair is long at all, it won&#x27;t even work.  </li>
            <li> Also, after a few months, I&#x27;ve found that the motor seems to be weakening considerably, even when it&#x27;s fully charged-</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t hold the charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long to get one of these?  </li>
            <li> If I let the leg hairs get too long they yank at the hairs and it takes forever to shave it all.  </li>
            <li> What a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about this device a long time</li>
            <li> lasts for a long time&lt;br /&gt;great value for money</li>
            <li> long hair trimmer does not &amp;</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It will take me a long time to time, and a long time to shave.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers simply don&#x27;t do that, and cannot be expected to.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe how long it took just trying to get all the hair off, which never happened.</li>
            <li> Received earlier than expected and well packaged</li>
            <li> Plus, no matter how careful I am, I ALWAYS get razor burn because I have such sensitve skin.  </li>
            <li> charged a long time.use it anywhere</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver, but this thing shaves well in or out of water.  </li>
            <li> Definitely does not work as well as expected.</li>
            <li> I guess that should be expected though, since it&#x27;s not such a close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that since it&#x27;s heavy it just slides out of some outlets completely.  </li>
            <li> Keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> wish i would have discovered it a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> The close shave lasts  as long as razor shaving.  </li>
            <li> It is larger than I had expected and doesn&#x27;t work for that area.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the way that the charger is set up but that is a minor thing at this time.</li>
            <li> I like that the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to be the&lt;br /&gt;problem as it won&#x27;t hold a charge for long.  </li>
            <li> I can understand if the razor hasn&#x27;t been charged&lt;br /&gt;in a long time, but this happens every time I take the razor off the charger.  </li>
            <li> Keeps a charge for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We took it apart and my dad found that the connectors were slipping, so he put them back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a really long time time now.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why it took me this long to try electric razors</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just used to having a long cord-style charger.</li>
            <li> Holds the charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> It only partially worked on my arms.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t believe Panasonic was willing to put their name on such a poor product.</li>
            <li> Plus, it took loads of battery, and was not large enough to shave anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it was the trimmer that broke on the second, it was certainly not my fault.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> I have not tried it as a wet shaver, only dry shaving.</li>
            <li> , I have to go over the same spot several times before it even gets half of the hairs.</li>
            <li> You are less likely to get a cut from the shaver especially when you shave under your arms.</li>
            <li> Have only used this dry and not in the shower, so cannot speak to how well it works when wet.  </li>
            <li> I follow another reviewer&#x27;s advice and only use it if my skin is completely dry or completely wet</li>
            <li> It will cut you from time to time, but it&#x27;s strong where this device fails (still pink, though).</li>
            <li> The bulky size makes it tough to get in the tight spaces needed for the smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor after studying other higher-priced razors &amp; decided that this was a good price/performance bargain and also because I had really not heard of a bad Panasonic product.</li>
            <li> This ladies shaver, the panasonic ES2216PC was purchased for my wife through Amazon.com as she has constantly complained about other razors and their ability to give a close shave without having to spend so much valuable time going over and over the same areas, sometimes having to finish the job with a blade razor.</li>
            <li> I think it would really hurt if you are going for the Brazilian look, because it has yanked a couple of hairs that it shouldn&#x27;t have in the past!  </li>
            <li> It does not take long to charge and it holds its charge for a VERY LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> so, I&#x27;ve wanted to dry one of these since I&#x27;ve heard they&#x27;ve come a long way.  </li>
            <li> However, after about two months, I noticed it was shaving less and less efficiently - I would have to go over the same part of my leg literally 5 or 6 times to get a decent shave (both wet and dry)!</li>
            <li> I literally watched the hair hit the blade and not be cut, and I have very thin, light body hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this because after a surgery on my back, I was left with very little feeling in the back of my thighs.  </li>
            <li> both my legs look half shaved (I don&#x27;t mean one half smooth</li>
            <li> Needed an electric razor to use mostly for underarm area as waxing is getting too expensive!</li>
            <li> I did not know there was such a thing as a wet use electric razor, YEA!</li>
            <li> It shaves as close as any other electric razor I have seen but don&#x27;t expect it to be the same as a blade.</li>
            <li> All of the other shavers (up to $75) pulled hairs, left hair, couldn&#x27;t take a charge, or had no power.  </li>
            <li> (but, honestly it is not much smaller or lighter than other electric razors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (but, honestly it is not much smaller or lighter than other electric razors).  </li>
            <li> I always had to shave my pitts every day, with this shaver I only have to do them every other day.</li>
            <li> and I have to go over the skin several times but other than that</li>
            <li> I recently purchased roughly 4 weeks ago !</li>
            <li> I only bought it to remove the little bits that I can&#x27;t see to get with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Due to my herniated disk in my back, I can no longer do the job in the shower and need to sit.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I dont like it that it is PINK!</li>
            <li> Due to eczema outbreaks on my legs, I cannot use a regular razor at times.  </li>
            <li> Hope this one lasts a little longer than the last several I have ordered.  </li>
            <li> With the other reviews I trusted it would last longer than a year.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors long enough to know that they will never shave as close as a conventional razor</li>
            <li> I have not tried this on dry skin yet.  </li>
            <li> I can use this razor dry</li>
            <li> I use it dry and it works well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll reserve this for dry use.</li>
            <li> It did not work well when I used it dry</li>
            <li> I used it dry because that&#x27;s what I want it for</li>
            <li> so my review will reflect a dry shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dry shaving is a breeze.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to shave dry with electrics</li>
            <li> and i opt for the \\&quot;dry shave\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;i have been using this shaver for approx 9 mths and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I prefer dry, but in the shower does work too.</li>
            <li> This razor worked great for about one month, now, even with regular cleaning, it is terrible.</li>
            <li> The dry shaving results did not meet our expectations.  </li>
            <li> so I suggest using it when you&#x27;re dry.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my legs and underarms dry.  </li>
            <li> prefer using it dry just because I find it easier to manuever it</li>
            <li> Dry has worked well for me.</li>
            <li> : I had to downgrade it from a 5 star because dry</li>
            <li> I have courser hair that needs to be shaved every 1-1.5 days to be presentable - using this item dry</li>
            <li> Using it dry (if I have ti use shaving cream,.</li>
            <li> I can sit in my recliner and dry shave my legs.</li>
            <li> Close cut dry, and I like how the head moves as well as the foil part too.</li>
            <li> With this shaver I can dry shave under my arms and legs and get a close shave that lasts.</li>
            <li> I can use this in the shower or use it dry.</li>
            <li> and I always cleaned it and stored it in a dry place after using it, so</li>
            <li> I have been using it dry</li>
            <li> The razor cost less than $30; it&#x27;s not worth paid calls and shipping costs and who knows how long a wait to get it fixed.  </li>
            <li> I read reviews and purchased this knowing that when used DRY your skin must be DRY NOT DAMP.  </li>
            <li> This one leaves you feeling a bit dry after shaving.  </li>
            <li> Gives a close shave without nicks or scrapes as a dry razor.  </li>
            <li> I usually dry shave my legs and am used to not having the closest shave, so</li>
            <li> &amp; I even shaved dry.</li>
            <li> I use it dry</li>
            <li> I use it on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> And I used it dry.</li>
            <li> I have always used it dry</li>
            <li> Convenient, simple, not a bit of trouble after four months of regular use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just rough and not smooth like my old one.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d hate to think what may have happened if I were using it on a more sensitive area, which it is advertised for).</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a traditional razor without serious razor burn no matter what brand of razor, type of blade, variety of shaving cream, etc.  </li>
            <li> This razor does not live up to the task.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s serviceable enough for day-to-day shaving as long as no one is getting down and inspecting your legs.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it for women with thick hair/ for those who have problem with ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> and I do mean old Remington (dates back to 1990&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t remove a single hair there.</li>
            <li> And I like the charger that allows the razor to recharge on the wall plug not the counter saving limited space.</li>
            <li> What a waste of $30, Amazon customer service is usually great, but this has been a disappointing experience to say the least.</li>
            <li> If asked, I would recommend this razor for those who are looking for a supplement to traditional razors and do not have dark, course hair.</li>
            <li> too expensive when compared with the full product cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that I own one (which I had to procure elseplace :(  </li>
            <li> Terrible at holding a charge - good for one use only then has to go back on the plug!</li>
            <li> The problem is those prongs that push into the recharge unit eventually work there way loose.  </li>
            <li> shaved dry, haven&#x27;t used the wet dry functionality.</li>
            <li> It takes longer for a dry shave to have the precision and smoothness as a wet shave, but I can use this razor on dry skin and have NO skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> I used the product three times, once dry, once wet and then dry again.</li>
            <li> So I finally broke down and bought this razor in the hopes of easier shaving.</li>
            <li> But I recently had 3 surgeries and could not reach down to shave my legs in the shower, so I use this shaver on my legs and it does well but not as well as a razor.  </li>
            <li> Like Kari, I ended up with scratches up and down my legs that actually burned until they healed (from the raised sides)..OUCH!!</li>
            <li> defiantly cuts down on regular shaves if you have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> then you can tell when it&#x27;s running low because it starts slowing down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this type of shaver before, so perhaps my expectations weren&#x27;t warranted, but this shaver does not shave very closely at all, especially in tight areas.</li>
            <li> So now I have spent money on a shaver that worked for less than 2 months, just long enough to not be eligible for return.</li>
            <li> I find I prefer the dry!  </li>
            <li> and the thing doesn&#x27;t even cut dry leg hair!</li>
            <li> -I&#x27;ve found my legs are dry after using it, and apply lotion-voila!</li>
            <li> I previously had the less expensive model from Panasonic and it works a lot better.</li>
            <li> Use it either wet or dry, damp does not work well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried using it in the shower; so, can&#x27;t comment on that; however, compared with previous electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned, it is definitely a big improvement.</li>
            <li> have used it wet with lather and dry.  </li>
            <li> I previously wrote a review for this shaver saying that it did not get a close enough shave, in comparison to my Remington.</li>
            <li> I have tried both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whomever came up with the idea that women need to shave half their bodies to go outside was probably a)</li>
            <li> I have followed the instructions that another reviewer provided about fully charging the shaver and shaving fully wet or fully dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> It does the job, both dry and wet.</li>
            <li> wet or dry, with or without shaving cream, doesn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I do know that it wasn&#x27;t long before we started having trouble with it&#x27;s connection to the charger, having to wiggle it some to get it to make proper contact.</li>
            <li> I have tried it totally dry and wet with water, gel, foam, and body wash</li>
            <li> , i must say that it works as expected, close shave and no irritation, can use it on the tub, on the shower, and dry</li>
            <li> Works well wet and dry.</li>
            <li> Comes with a small simple charger, not one of the big wired ones.</li>
            <li> you can use wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Regrowth stubble is less course using electric shaver than standard razer for me.</li>
            <li> The shaver doesn&#x27;t get a close shave when you use it dry and doesn&#x27;t work at all when you use it wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> This works well wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s advertised to be used wet or dry</li>
            <li> I like that it can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it wet and dry.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed given the price especially considering I got better results with cheaper devices.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a crappy shaver...just was disappointed with the guard on the top.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as advertised  wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I tried wet, dry, with shaving cream, without.</li>
            <li> I find it pulls hair when used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it can be used in both wet and dry shaving</li>
            <li> but i prefer use it dry than wet.</li>
            <li> I like the size and the fact that you can use it in wet or dry places.</li>
            <li> Have used it wet and dry</li>
            <li> Many of my shavers have lasted 3-4 yrs and usually the battery is what fails.  </li>
            <li> I tried it both wet and dry and also used on my legs.</li>
            <li> It abruptly stopped working, with no identifiable cause.</li>
            <li> It trims in some areas and then in other areas, it leaves the hairs long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not as great:&lt;br /&gt;- Shave is not nearly as close as the other electric razors</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, but I had a feeling it wouldn&#x27;t be all that great because of</li>
            <li> The trimmer wouldn&#x27;t slide out anymore, and was loosely held in a partially extended position.</li>
            <li> I even tried this product on my bikini area wet and even tried to trim the area wet with the guard and it just didn&#x27;t work as well as dry use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The foil was so tight that I had to put extra effort to take it off</li>
            <li> and you can knock down a 4 day beard in the shower in nothing flat.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that the charge doesn&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li> Since I live in the South with only 3 months of winter the earlier models were useless.</li>
            <li> When the first shaver, purchased last December, failed to come on--for no evident reason--I called Panasonic customer care.</li>
            <li> I got this little buddy awhile back so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to go all stubble-y when it came to the end of the month where I couldn&#x27;t afford razors.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend got me an electric shaver a little while before that, but it cut me up and left patches of stubble all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try to upgrade to something a little larger</li>
            <li> It is also a little bit noisy during use compared to my Norelco electric shaver I use on my facial hair.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have particularly course or thick hair either - I&#x27;d consider it average...</li>
            <li> cause the cutter things on the edge scratch really hard resulting in sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;bikini attachment,\\&quot; which is a guard so you can leave a little length on some hair, is not useful to me because it is spaced from the blade such that the hair you would be leaving would be quite long for my taste.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting the foils back in straight, and two tiny metal pieces popped out from a crevice behind the foils.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I may scratch myself slightly around the ankle bone (not majorly)</li>
            <li> I thought, &amp;#34;Not bad, much better than shaving my thighs with a disposable.&amp;#34; Well, it broke about six months ago</li>
            <li> It is smooth cutting with no pulling.</li>
            <li> i get at least two complete shaves before i have to recharge again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took me about 3 months to get the replacement, after a number of phone calls and e-mails to the service center.  </li>
            <li> just like I expected.  </li>
            <li> ( sitting) on a chair, yeah!) or wet.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product 3 months back; took it to India, my wife used it for few days and then charger (adaptor) got out.</li>
            <li> Can be used wet.</li>
            <li> It was about what I expected.</li>
            <li> it in the shower with wet legs...</li>
            <li> The skin still feels rough afterwards.</li>
            <li> Never really got a close shave</li>
            <li> For legs it shaves as close as a non-electric razor, but harder to do that with underarms.  </li>
            <li> This was easier to use than I expected.  </li>
            <li> On second thought, I realized that I have been a bit harsh (on the brand).  </li>
            <li> It has an extension blade to shave longer hair and it has not pinched or cut me, but I am careful.  </li>
            <li> I have not used this in a wet situation.</li>
            <li> Results improved with wet shave and shampoo.  </li>
            <li> others have mentioned the charger is not very well designed.  </li>
            <li> You have to go over every section multiple times because it keeps missing hair.</li>
            <li> I also like that I can shave wet if I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have spent the money.  </li>
            <li> But a few months later and it&#x27;s just like the rest of them.</li>
            <li> It never really worked.  </li>
            <li> The product says you can use it wet</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t cut anything at all when you use it wet</li>
            <li> This is my second go round with the shaver.</li>
            <li> It performs no where remotely like it claims to.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely never recommend the Panasonic to anyone.</li>
            <li> so decided on the electric razor as opposed to an epilator as I understand they can be rough on your skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on wet skin yet maybe that would help.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to use one to two times per week to shave my underarms and bikini line, so the shaver has not received heavy use that would explain the problems I am currently experiencing.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work well, such a waste of time and money because i plan to put it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Never tried the wet option.</li>
            <li> It also immediately leaves stubble, and doesn&#x27;t get a remotely close shave at all.</li>
            <li> There have been times that after shaving, my skin is somewhat rough and bumpy.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses, she has gone back to using mine.  </li>
            <li> Only used a few times for bikini trimming (wet/dry).</li>
            <li> I have been careful to follow all instructions and now just want to know how do I return it.</li>
            <li> not really what  I expected,</li>
            <li> so I had absolutely no idea what to expect.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s died in the middle of me shaving quite a few times.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak of ingrown hairs because it has only been a few</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a hand razor but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> And it feels rough, like I&#x27;m shaving with sand paper.  </li>
            <li> wet or with a gel, it&#x27;ll clog up with hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really do not like this razor.</li>
            <li> even then it&#x27;s not a very close cut.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t use it in the shower, so I can&#x27;t comment about using it wet.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The recharge time is minimal.</li>
            <li> and it took 35 minutes to shave because you have to go over the same spot a few times to remove the hair.  </li>
            <li> By the end of August, the pop-up trimmer switch had jammed.  </li>
            <li> Spent months trying to replace my Mangroomer charger - but could never find one.  </li>
            <li> This was expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times</li>
            <li> a wet run would give me.  </li>
            <li> Its such a waste.</li>
            <li> ¦t seem to glide very much on wet skin, even with some  shaving cream.</li>
            <li> So here it sits in the drawer after two tries and that was with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> My second one to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Other still works but some teeth are missing.</li>
            <li> When I used it recently, it was noisy and not a smooth shave - it pulled at the hair.</li>
            <li> not very practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wet shave results were even poorer.</li>
            <li> never have used the &#x27;wet&#x27; option.</li>
            <li> This works well, even when wet.</li>
            <li> I try to only recharge it once a week for a few hours each time.  </li>
            <li> A few months later....</li>
            <li> It must be working as expected or I would know.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a smoothe shave - somewhat like plucking out hairs instead of a shaving.</li>
            <li> I probably would have spent the equivalent in razors</li>
            <li> Wet your skin well and lather up with lots of soap.  </li>
            <li> This one does not seem to cut as well and the &amp;#34;wet option&amp;#34; is not really option.</li>
            <li> I like the pink color, too.</li>
            <li> -- I wish it would all go into a chamber you could then empty instead.  </li>
            <li> so I can not commit about how it performs wet.</li>
            <li> All that said, I am a redhead with insanely sensitive skin and extremely thick hair prone to ingrown hairs and razor burn, and with using this I have had neither.  </li>
            <li> if I use it frequently, never use a razor, and if I tip it at an angle that is recommended against in the directions and press down a bit.</li>
            <li> This slows down the moving razor blades and well, you get long drawn&lt;br /&gt;out</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I thought this would hold up to crazy wear and tear a little better.</li>
            <li> I would buy the older version, that one at least lasted a year!</li>
            <li> Not sure exactly what they mean about that, but I might as well try it.</li>
            <li> Shaves well but doesn&#x27;t get the curves of the sensitive areas, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s new and I hope it continues to give her close shaves because stubble is not good.</li>
            <li> I find it works equally well in and out of the shower, with shaving cream or plain soap.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for the wife as the last one plain wore out from use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to wear a skirt unless I HAVE to, and I&#x27;m certainly not going to shave unless I HAVE</li>
            <li> Plain and simple it rips out my hair no matter where I put it or how i use it.</li>
            <li> For example, the outlet over my bathroom counter sits right under a windowsill; the lack of vertical space renders it useless for charging the Panasonic 2216.</li>
            <li> agree with other reviews that the design of the charger is absolutely terrible, but the razor itself is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other trimmers (Remington and something else I can&#x27;t remember) that slid right over my longer hairs, but Panasonic ES2216PC&#x27;s pop-up trimmer snags on nearly every hair and makes trimming painful.</li>
            <li> I had the last one for several years (of in-shower use) before the motor started to get a bit weaker and the blades a bit dull, and I think an average of $7-10 a year for a shave</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, after a couple months it began to not cut very cleanly, and then began to snag and pull out hairs painfully.  </li>
            <li> I was going up and down my legs in long lines (like a straight razor but going down too) and it was doing a poor job, even shaving twice.</li>
            <li> The reason I am giving it 3 stars is due to the fact that it is not very durable.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend it for anyone who feels too lazy to go through all of the trouble of properly shaving their legs!</li>
            <li> She claims the pop-up trimmer makes using the trimmer uncomfortable since it&#x27;s at the same level as the other blades compared to my shaver&#x27;s pop-up trimmer which is below the level of the main blades.  </li>
            <li> I came out looking like a murder victim with blood running down my legs.</li>
            <li> I usually use it on the bikini line and underarms only so not really a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> There is one thing worse than having a shaver that barely charges up enough power to keep going through one session of shaving - and that&#x27;s having a shaver that snags and PULLS the hair from your body, along with a sliver of flesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it has been a while and the hairs are long they pull a little</li>
            <li> I had previously bought this razor a few years back</li>
            <li> I have course, thick, dark black and fast growing hair and have to shave everyday (if showing any leg).  </li>
            <li> My wife has been using different model of Remington in the past.</li>
            <li> i dropped/broke my other electric razor, replaced it with one from walmart, returned that one and bought this one instead.</li>
            <li> (and what girl wouldn&#x27;t like the pink one!</li>
            <li> My hair is course and due to this</li>
            <li> I tried out the razor in the shower the other day with shaving lather and it still worked well.  </li>
            <li> then the other one was.  </li>
            <li> But I have never used other electric shavers before, so I have nothing to compare with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This does not have any closer of a shave than the other electrics I have used.</li>
            <li> Read over reviews for this and other womens and mens electric razors.</li>
            <li> It did stay in place, but it blocks use of the other plug and is somewhat awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it did not contain a manual  other wis</li>
            <li> However, I would recommend this to anyone who can&#x27;t use a razor due to any reason.</li>
            <li> Only as I read in one of the reviews, it does releases small puffs of hair while shaving.</li>
            <li> and she uses it every other day...</li>
            <li> They do stick out, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re sharp</li>
            <li> Compare some plastic rubbing on your skin with a sharp metal blade</li>
            <li> review may not be helpful to you if you already have electric razor experience and want a comparison to other razors -</li>
            <li> It comes with a pop-out apparatus for this purpose, but it consistently pulls your hair and is essentially useless.</li>
            <li> Do not have a lot of experience with other shavers to make any comparisons but</li>
            <li> Purchsed this razor after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> My legs become extremely itchy after shaving.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver that I&#x27;ve had, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else, but I&#x27;m not incredibly impressed.  </li>
            <li> I got this for myself just the other day after deciding to revisit my hair strategy ([...]).</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have points of comparison for other shavers, so I can&#x27;t tell you how this one rates in relation to all the other shavers in the world.</li>
            <li> I went with this model based on other reviews...and because of the \\&quot;pivoting\\&quot; head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other electric shavers that give a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> It gives a closer shave than any other electric shaver I have used.  </li>
            <li> So you may want to consider their other models.</li>
            <li> So, as a close shaver, it&#x27;s alright, but use extreme caution if you&#x27;re going to use it as a trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> There is no itchy feeling like I used to get with my other disposable razor.</li>
            <li> After five months, however, when shaving my arm-pit, I felt a sharp pain.</li>
            <li> I have tried other shavers made for men, and they just wouldn&#x27;t work well on leg hair.</li>
            <li> I will never again purchase this shaver and recommend you seek other options for your shaving needs.</li>
            <li> I bought this having used other electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I have had this Shaver for about a month now, use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> These small things are so simple, yet not incorporated in design!</li>
            <li> the charge lite is on all the time, not like my other rechargeables.</li>
            <li> For a small area, like underarms, this isn&#x27;t a problem since you can make several passes to get them all.</li>
            <li> I docked one star due to the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; construction.</li>
            <li> Is not really worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Not much different than shavers I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> have just been sticking with my schedule of shaving every other week and using the electric razor for times in-between.</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric razor before, so I don&#x27;t have any other brands to compare this one to.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had the scratching problem other ladies have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I have owned wet/dry shavers in the past that shaved comparably to a regular razor, but this does not.</li>
            <li> I think it shaves a lot closer than some of the other reviewers</li>
            <li> Extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, especially when I have those lazy days</li>
            <li> this shaver has saved the day several times over the past couple months.</li>
            <li> Plus it is pink as a bonus!</li>
            <li> As with other electric razors I&#x27;ve tried, I usually have to go over an area several times to get all the hairs, and every time I&#x27;ve used it on my underarms, I&#x27;ve ended up with razor burn.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the other reviews I&#x27;ve decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> As other mention, the shave is not as close as razor blade.</li>
            <li> I am usually spectical when purchasing prior to testing a product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the Bikini attachment helpful, but other than that</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t buy any other one after having this one.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely upset because it was a Christmas gift from my parents</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me it let razor burn all up my legs the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other razor now.</li>
            <li> Other ladies with date nights, maybe not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> compared to the other same-priced razors.</li>
            <li> Other ladies with date nights, maybe not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> compared to the other same-priced razors.</li>
            <li> One of them is the on/off switch, and the other releases blades.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried any other brand.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the small size of the recharger and that a box or bag did not come with it to store the shaver and the brush, trimmer attachment to leave longer hair and the charger.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> and I had to shave almost every other day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty useless at this point.</li>
            <li> Read other reviews.  </li>
            <li> This is probably my fourth women&#x27;s razor in the past four years.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll take other&#x27;s advice and buy a men&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My other shavers were electric</li>
            <li> Even worse, the trimmers are on both sides, so if you&#x27;re not careful to keep the shaver totally flat against your skin, it will bite into your skin and draw blood.</li>
            <li> : I got it mainly for my bikini area and was a little afraid that the trimmer blades would nick me as my old shaver did</li>
            <li> They wanted $35 for a new adapter, the same price as this stupid thing new.</li>
            <li> reside in a very rural area in the mountains, The closest town is very small with limited shopping.</li>
            <li> I like the shape, but it leaves very long stubble, not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, follow instructions and you will avoid painful cuts that you would get with others.</li>
            <li> Purchased a more expensive one at WalMart and had to return it because it functioned poorly.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer jammed after less than a year of use.</li>
            <li> The only thing it was missing was a cord in case the battery was dead, and I wanted to shave immediately.</li>
            <li> Getting old sucks!  </li>
            <li> I would never expect a pricey Panasonic shaver that is less than a year old with only one to two times per week of usage on a small area of my body to perform poorly at shaving hair at this point in time.</li>
            <li> The front blade is a little rough</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little rough sometimes but it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> It was also a little louder than I expected.  </li>
            <li> This razor did not get as close to the skin, even after pushing really hard with the spring loaded head, it still left hair stubble!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful and grows back very fast and leaves me with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews where intermittent operation was mentioned or where premature battery failure occurred I can only conclude it was caused by this switch.</li>
            <li> A huge disappointment and waste of money!</li>
            <li> It has eliminated the unsightly and painful razor bumps I used to get all over my legs, and leaves my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using various Remington Electric Shavers for the past few years.</li>
            <li> biggest complaint is that the razor ALWAYS misses hairs - you have to go over areas multiple times to even get that not-close shave.</li>
            <li> Lasts a couple days with dark hair.</li>
            <li> but sadly it didn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
            <li> decided that I would try an electric razor again, because the last time I tried them years ago they were not effective in hair removal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it should last at least a year AND have replaceable batteries.</li>
            <li> If your hair is the least bit coarse it doesn&#x27;t cut it!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Too late to return entire razor to Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s still not as close of a shave as I was hoping for, and you have to go over the same areas at least twice.</li>
            <li> (And I have dark leg</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m average height,</li>
            <li> Purchased this around 6 months ago because like most women I hate shaving.</li>
            <li> I hate the peach fuzz on my face, my makeup goes on much better with it gone.  </li>
            <li> However the directions do state that &amp;#34; you will notice a difference after a few weeks of wet shaving.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Slowly though, the back trimmer has stopped working as well.  </li>
            <li> He was like, if you get metal wet and then let it air dry, it will dull the edge of the blade.  </li>
            <li> I would have to spend at least a half hour a day after my shower pressing tissue paper up against the nicks that my razor left me with.  </li>
            <li> I carefully cleaned and dried the razor after the previous uses.</li>
            <li> It has not let us down.</li>
            <li> In this respect, the Pansonic fell down on the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery just kaputs and slows waaaaaaaayyyy down, and then it takes 45 minutes just to do your lower</li>
            <li> Cuts well and doesn&#x27;t bog down.</li>
            <li> Then again, you won&#x27;t get rivulets of blood running down your legs, either</li>
            <li> If I run my hand down my leg, I can feel something, but it isn&#x27;t like a man&#x27;s stubble, or even than noticeable.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s speed down and</li>
            <li> I narrowed it down to this unit, and figured I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li> down side is the trimmer guard that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I wrote down the date I got</li>
            <li> With the Panasonic razor I can go every other day or a little bit longer.  </li>
            <li> I was a little scared in buying this item due the reviews on Amazon, but I took a chance</li>
            <li> Also, when I use a electric razor I usually use it dry</li>
            <li> I was really excited about it because razors give me really bad razor bumps</li>
            <li> This thing has very sharp blade, no accidentally pulling of hair.</li>
            <li> Living in California during a very extreme drought, I have been neglecting to shave my legs as often as I would like to save water.</li>
            <li> Way closer shave with still hardly any irritation, the trimmer gets out way way more hair on my thighs and bikini line and never once snagged it painfully like the ES2216PC did.</li>
            <li> But now I spend less time in the shower and can shave anytime.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a lot less hassle which was what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I had it for less than a week and just gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> Her previous unit had a counter-top recharge&lt;br /&gt;unit</li>
            <li> This is the second time within 6 months that I have bought this product, only to have it fail after the 30-day return window.</li>
            <li> I bought this half a year ago.</li>
            <li> which is hands-down the worst electric razor I have ever used, more of a toy than a \\&quot;personal care\\&quot; item.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc 5 Multi Flex Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Black]]  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d have less nicks with this</li>
            <li> Taking it in and out of charger is difficult since there is not much room near my power supply.</li>
            <li> I still shave in the shower about half the time.  </li>
            <li> Having had a previous shaver that didn&#x27;t shave closely, I was apprehensive about finding 1 that did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver as a disposable every month and a half.</li>
            <li> She says it shaves closer than her previous electric razors with no nicks at all.</li>
            <li> , just looks like I have less hair over all)</li>
            <li> The shaver was the updated version of what the recipient owner previously......</li>
            <li> I found that it does not shave as closely or as evenly as previous electric shavers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Can shave arm pits in less than 5 minutes with or without water.  </li>
            <li> not a super close shave</li>
            <li> Another comparison is that I have jet black leg hair-</li>
            <li> Overall I am pretty disappointed with this razor.</li>
            <li> I echo previous reviews about this not working unless fully charged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had problems with pulled hairs and it doesn&#x27;t cause cuts or scrapes like another brand I had purchased previously.</li>
            <li> and also if it took less time to achieve a charge.</li>
            <li> and I can shave my legs in half the time.</li>
            <li> Holding the shaver at less of an angle puts your skin in contact with the trimmer, which can scratch you if you&#x27;re not paying attention.  </li>
            <li> I do use it to avoid razor burn though, because I get less razor burn from this than a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps they thought this a sleeker design that takes up less counter space?</li>
            <li> This terrible razor has left me looking for better things.</li>
            <li> I typically go Brazilian style.</li>
            <li> and you still have a slight stubble</li>
            <li> I can  do it in less than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Time until death... less than 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a previous panasonic and when I lost the rechargeable battery I decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to this model.</li>
            <li> or I was shipped a previously used one</li>
            <li> I have back problems that make it difficult for me to use a regular razor in the shower.</li>
            <li> It would take forever to get a decent shave with this useless POS.</li>
            <li> It is a little top heavy and bulky, the charger is also very awkwardly shaped.</li>
            <li> So I searched long and hard and saw that this Panasonic model got rave reviews everywhere.</li>
            <li> Both are still in warranty which right now is worthless as you will see later in this review.</li>
            <li> it was noisy and found that when it is you just have to push the head down a little until it clicks and the noise goes away.  </li>
            <li> It would tingle a little, and was the tiniest bit painful in my more delicate zones.</li>
            <li> Contorting oneself in the shower with a sharp implement rubbed all over your body is not a pleasant experience and with my sensitive skin and thick hair</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money and just bought a less expensive electric razor and a different bikini trimmer that actually works.</li>
            <li> I was not able to shower and shave with a blade because I could not get my feet wet.</li>
            <li> Beret leaves light skin scratches behind and at least 1/8\\&quot; stubble behind when shaving the legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver a few times and found it work with an average affect.  </li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD PRODUCT, YOU WOULD HAVE TO KEEP GOING OVER THE SAME SPOT</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t feel that it shaves as close as a non-electronic blade, I&#x27;m not complaining because I don&#x27;t like to mess with shaving cream, and I don&#x27;t think any electronic shavor will shave as close as a razor.  </li>
            <li> Also, as one other reviewer noted, the plastic bits next to the foils are thin and scratched my legs with each pass.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other electric razors in the past, and I can hands down</li>
            <li> but after using the razor I can only surmise that they were pressing down very hard.</li>
            <li> It is an ugly black color, but other than that it is better on every level than this women&#x27;s shaver which now feels like a poorly functioning toy in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> It is an ugly black color, but other than that it is better on every level than this women&#x27;s shaver which now feels like a poorly functioning toy in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> It certainly does not last for 12 days on one charge, so I suppose if that expectation were lowered, I would not have been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes about this electric razor, as I wanted an alternative to regular razors since I get bad razor burn.  </li>
            <li> The shave was alright, not the best, and definitely not worth the ugly painful gouges!</li>
            <li> I looked for a replacement part, but it was just as expensive to replace the part as it was to just buy an entirely new shaver.</li>
            <li> This new one is worse!</li>
            <li> Now my brand new machine is useless until I get a blade.</li>
            <li> Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb whose teeth were black as night (filler).</li>
            <li> Not as close of a shave but less waste in our landfills and can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have typically bought one of these as I would&#x27;ve seen it as a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I have another little trimmer for that stuff.</li>
            <li> It looked a little junky when it came</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately the battery in this razor died in a little over a year,</li>
            <li> Just had a little soap on my skin</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s my little disability problem.  </li>
            <li> that helps make things a little softer -- but still in need of a razor shave.</li>
            <li> Shave could be a little closer though&lt;</li>
            <li> It was definitely a little quieter, but still louder than my hubby&#x27;s Norelco.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver itself seems well made and the little attachment brush helps rid the shaver of longer</li>
            <li> It could have been a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> Basically, this electric razor is functioning, meaning it turns on and off, but it really is pretty useless!</li>
            <li> However, that first shave proved me wrong!</li>
            <li> am not pleased at all.&lt;br /&gt;Really wish I could get a refund or choose some other item.</li>
            <li> After a couple of uses, there is a little clip in the charger that broke off and would no longer hold or charge the shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like it was trying to will the little hairs out just by shaking itself at them.</li>
            <li> Could be a little sharper though.</li>
            <li> But with a little bit of gel to cover the area, then slather water over the spot too.</li>
            <li> This device hurts on some parts of the body, but it still saves you a little time by getting removing the noticeable hair.</li>
            <li> and she had no knicks as in the past with other shavers.</li>
            <li> When I shave using this electric shaver, there&#x27;s always just a little bit of stubble.</li>
            <li> (notice I said just a little bit)</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> the fact that I get a little sandpapery within a day doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> just ok..gets the job done..but takes a little while..</li>
            <li> For bikini area, took a little while to get used to, felt like there was a little pulling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it!</li>
            <li> I had been using my husband&#x27;s old brutal \\&quot;on its last legs\\&quot; shaver, but that machine chewed up my underarms on the lightest setting, even when pressing ever so slightly (almost not at all), to the degree that for 24 hours afterwards my underarms burned where it was agony to move my upper torso.</li>
            <li> Not only was it impossible to get anywhere near a close shave, it gave me a rash.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the razor completely stopped working within less than a month.</li>
            <li> but I am not very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Comb attachment does its job, too, though I noticed the pop-up blade sticks a little after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I had a little trouble connecting it to charge it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gotten really tired of buying and then throwing away those little tiny trimmers, since you can&#x27;t ever find replacement blades for then.</li>
            <li> I was upgraded to this model a few years ago, after my old Panasonic shaver died and the company proved unable to repair it.</li>
            <li> Leave it plugged in and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$.</li>
            <li> The charger, to me, is upside-down -- meaning the shaver hangs from the charger rather than sits on it and sometimes may fall if not really secure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> I am NOT spending $15 on my replacement blades every few months which sometimes end up rusty in my shower.</li>
            <li> Totally dead.</li>
            <li> I thought an electric razor would be a poor alternative, but a necessary one because of my condition.</li>
            <li> AND ONE FOR A DISABLED FRIEND.  </li>
            <li> but when it was dead one day, I reached for my boyfriends electric razor.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES2216PC was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> , I realized that I have been a bit harsh (on the brand).  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money trust me....</li>
            <li> It left behind raised stubble, and when the charge weakens, it snagged.  </li>
            <li> I just feel have wasted money for the bikini extension.</li>
            <li> If you have old/really used outlets (like in a bathroom), it will have trouble staying in the wall.  </li>
            <li> people say their shave was not smooth, I didn&#x27;t have that issue.</li>
            <li> Decided to save myself a few bucks since I didn&#x27;t use the epilator part anyway and bought one of these.  </li>
            <li> My legs are NOT SMOOTH with this razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> when you take it off the charger and turn it on, there&#x27;s a few seconds pause before the motor kicks in.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, but the razor was enclosed in a heavy, difficult-to-open, plastic cover.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> My shaver died after using it a few times per week for 6 months.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Part missing and I returned.</li>
            <li> my toddler gets impatient waiting for me.</li>
            <li> I get maybe a few strands.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Shaving with electric does take a few months to get used to, and you never get as close of a shave as with a disposable one.</li>
            <li> Perhaps part of the problem is the closeness of the shave is so poor that I have to make multiple passes for each section.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a lot of hair behind- especially with my underarms (but happens with my legs too)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money with this product.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
            <li> (http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ES2207P-Curves-rechargeable-Ladies/dp/B0018A32XS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1344406659&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;panasonic+ladies+shaver) that I had for a few months.</li>
            <li> It worked well, but after a few months it started to stop working as well as it did</li>
            <li> This shaver is rechargeable and the charge lasts for a few shaves before needing a recharge.</li>
            <li> Now that it has been a few months, I feel like it is time to review:&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it took me a few times before I learned where I could use this without irritation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse than pulling a bandage off as slowly as possible.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a waste of money &amp; time.</li>
            <li> I am disabled &amp; needed help in this area</li>
            <li> when I called panasonic, they said it sounded as if the foils needed to be replaced, but their warranty DID NOT COVER IT, even though I purchased this shaver a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> This product was purchased on 6/14/15 and as of 8/10/15 it is completely dead and not working.</li>
            <li> bulky, not smooth at all, and battery gave out ( returned )</li>
            <li> In fact it has been quite a few months</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Wall mount charge units are trouble.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First few times I used it, it worked</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> it cuts uneven..</li>
            <li> The shaver is not comfortable to hold, I had to reposition the devise to shaver.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money if I had it to do over.</li>
            <li> I gave a shaver like it to my wife a few years ago and could not find a way to sharpen or replace the head</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit confused about the charger as it doesn&#x27;t indicate when it&#x27;s fully charged (it stays red)</li>
            <li> No parts seem to be worn or broken, yet it simply doesn&#x27;t cut hair any more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> waste of money, threw out packing, etc.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> If I missed an area, or forgot to shave my legs in a few days and want to wear a skirt or shorts, it takes 3 seconds to remedy instead of jumping in the shower.</li>
            <li> The bikini attachment is a waste...</li>
            <li> I have darker skin and usually have problems with ingrown hairs and dark spots.</li>
            <li> Hold the shaver under the water for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> and I used it a few weeks ago while I was visiting her.</li>
            <li> Also...the automated system for Panasonic made me repeat the model number 4 times and gave me the run around worse than any human being</li>
            <li> and there are few missed hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for years now and had quite a few.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i was having trouble shaving my pussy, and i thought an electric razor would help.&lt;br /&gt;WELL</li>
            <li> i was not expecting much from this shaver because the last time i tried an electric shaver, it was crap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use razors (wastes water in shower), wax(messy) , neat(stinky and left behind strays),</li>
            <li> After hundreds of waxing sessions &amp; experiences, I hate the time and money spent, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> The switches are stiff at this point and a little diffiuclt to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> But even though you can feel a little stubble, the hair is not easily noticeable.</li>
            <li> It is at least 10x faster to shave and does not damage my (thin, pale, sensitive) skin.</li>
            <li> It is at least 10x faster to shave and does not damage my (thin, pale, sensitive) skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled, previous ES2207P owners, the ES2216PC is not just an improvement design-wise!</li>
            <li> In less then 5 mins I was done!</li>
            <li> I can put on a skirt, think, &#x27;hmm, should probably shave&#x27; and do it and be out the door in less time than it usually takes me to find my car</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s half the price and works twice as well!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this item when I purchased it because I hate shaving.</li>
            <li> I have uneven skin under my arms,  and have deep pockets, making traditional blade-razors very difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to touch it on your skin pretty hard.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to touch it on your skin pretty hard.</li>
            <li> This particular razor was a disappointment, but I had another from this line</li>
            <li> This particular razor was a disappointment, but I had another from this line</li>
            <li> I am an avid Amazon customer but by far, this is the worst product I have ever purchased from amazon.</li>
            <li> and is not easy to store when not in use.  </li>
            <li> What a mess!</li>
            <li> The other blades are pretty useless because the pivoting head makes it difficult to create any pressure for a close shave.</li>
            <li> The next dry shave, the razor didn&#x27;t appear to be cutting any hair.</li>
            <li> I probably will continue to use it on my inner thighs just because I have a hard time using a regular razor without cutting myself in that area.  </li>
            <li> However, after using it, I quickly became very unhappy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> It bit me under the arm when I pushed down too hard.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to press down hard on your skin--</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to press down too hard at all.  </li>
            <li> Even when pressing it down hard onto my skin, it still didn&#x27;t get the hair.</li>
            <li> I call it my midevil torture device, as it is painful the first couple of times you use it.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend this item if you plan on using it past a few months.</li>
            <li> Usually used a few times per week on my lady areas.</li>
            <li> I have rather thick dark hair</li>
            <li> I have dark thick hair on my legs</li>
            <li> I do NOT need a shaver designed for someone with dark, thick hair.</li>
            <li> After a little over a year it would no longer hold a charge (which seemed like a very short battery life to me) and unfortunately battery replacement was not an option with that shaver.</li>
            <li> Most she has abandoned within a few weeks, they are so awful in terms of performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will get a close shave too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only painful part of this product is trying to get it open!!!</li>
            <li> After the \\&quot;automated assistant\\&quot; was unable to understand what I needed, I was referred to a human who also had trouble understanding what I needed.  </li>
            <li> The only thing thats annoying is that I have to have it fully charged in order for it to completely do its job.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even apply a little pressure on it because it can&#x27;t handle it!  </li>
            <li> For something like this, that&#x27;s ridiculous because it&#x27;s not worth the postage.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if using one dry usually results in a faint stubble left behind, but that&#x27;s what I get.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was a little slow.</li>
            <li> ITS PINK!!!!</li>
            <li> So fellas if you wanna lose that hair just suck up the pride and get over it being pink !!!!</li>
            <li> This shaver does not give a close shave like a razor, which I expected, but I have to go over my legs over and over and very slowly.  </li>
            <li> This razor really isn&#x27;t too bad, but I understand what a lot of people are saying.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as I am  now taking a blood thinner which causes excessive bleeding when you cut yourself.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my wife told me that this unit does not give quite the same results as the ones she had in the past.</li>
            <li> I have looked in the past.</li>
            <li> : UM... It was not FREE!</li>
            <li> Purchased this razor for my 10 year old daughter because she kept cutting herself in the shower.(Shaving against my will....)</li>
            <li> It hold its charge for a few shaves and has not nicked me yet!  </li>
            <li> The only problem is replacing the parts for this shaver is expensive.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time!</li>
            <li> All I can say is I will never buy a small device like this on-line, because there is no \\&quot;store\\</li>
            <li> I will never buy a different brand, or try another expensive brand.  </li>
            <li> I have been undergoing chemotherapy for the past 18 months and lost the hair on my head twice but never the hair on my legs.  </li>
            <li> but this razor didn&#x27;t perform an awful lot better than the toy.  </li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;pop up trimmer\\&quot; is no more poping up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the bikini attachment thing is suppose to work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will add that coming up with the twenty word minimum for this review is difficult for a shaver that you simply want to say that you like it.</li>
            <li> I also found out hair trimmers are used for surgery prep instead of razors to prevent small cuts in the skin.  </li>
            <li> I also found out hair trimmers are used for surgery prep instead ofrazors to prevent small cuts in the skin.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed when I used it.</li>
            <li> I am unable to use a regular razor so waiting for this unit to be repaired and returned to me is not an option.  </li>
            <li> But sadly, it isn&#x27;t as close shave as a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use shavers that are electric.</li>
            <li> However, the pop-up trimmer, which I only used once every one to two weeks, is now useless as it yanks hairs out rather than trims them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely felt the tug and pull, which has then caused weird razor-ish-burn.  </li>
            <li> Has a small charger to plug in the wall.</li>
            <li> Not sure why,</li>
            <li> The double foil doesn&#x27;t allow for curves; it just cannot be used on underarms and is difficult around knees and ankles.</li>
            <li> This thing is pointless.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with item it does not shave well at all</li>
            <li> I had to buy a Norelco men&#x27;s razor with 3-rotating heads, which is what I always used in the past (borrowed from my husband).</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I would be uncomfortable going outside in shorts after using this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have tried battery operated shavers in the past, but none of them gave me a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that it comes with a charger -- no more replacing batteries.  </li>
            <li> Plus the charger does not signal to me when its charged nor does the shaver, so I usually leave it in for an hour before I use it again.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> No more.  </li>
            <li> It eventually failed to charge at all after about a year of very moderate use.</li>
            <li> Had to go over the same spot repeatedly until it was almost uncomfortable before it would remove</li>
            <li> It was not satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> On shorter hair, I still don&#x27;t feel as if it actually shaves, and it scratches uncomfortably against my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 2 months.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry shaver because, well, I am lazy.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it would be an improvement to the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018A32XS/ref&#x3D;oss_product electric razor that I usually purchase.</li>
            <li> Now with that said it isn&#x27;t manual razor slick</li>
            <li> Not sure if they even make shavors that cut close.</li>
            <li> it was DEAD!</li>
            <li> I like the small charger.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, this item never worked properly even though I kept trying.</li>
            <li> There are no redeeming qualities that I can even share.</li>
            <li> Regular razors always caused severe razor burn and waxing was just too expensive to keep up with.  </li>
            <li> and now it is DEAD!  </li>
            <li> For the past 2 weeks, this razor is pulling out every hair</li>
            <li> would now hold a charge,,,,,, not sure if its the shaver or the electrical cord.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not impressed enough to pursue warranty.</li>
            <li> No more cuts</li>
            <li> Over years, it&#x27;s been impossible finding a decent women&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about the purchase yet.</li>
            <li> Usually turns out that when I find something I like they decide to discontinue making it so have learned to stock up on some items.  </li>
            <li> I had a Remington in between and was not satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> I hate to get rid of it, since it isn&#x27;t broken or anything - but unless Panasonic releases a replacement cord charger, it&#x27;s as good as useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when using it dry, it feels like I just have at least a day&#x27;s growth of stubble left behind on my legs.  </li>
            <li> It became painful to use, where it had previously been completely painless.</li>
            <li> I have used it as a dry shaver for a few weeks now, and it&#x27;s completely useless.</li>
            <li> I have a slight tremor in my hands and am prone to cutting myself with a regular shaver.</li>
            <li> This one sits neatly on the charger base, which plugs right into the wall.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is that the switch design is very poor.</li>
            <li> Extremely dissapointed at how poorly it works.</li>
            <li> story began as an effort to leave behind over priced cartridge razors that keep adding blades and other nonsense.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver last fall and it has been with me through thick and thin, literally!</li>
            <li> Still, after several months (no more than 4), the shaver became unbearably painful to use and eventually it became clear that a part was broken (bent wire sticking out and fell off - not good).</li>
            <li> Three months after a horseback riding accident resulting in a broken ankle, I finally got home, leaving hospital and rehab behind.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and course leg hair, which makes it extremely difficult and painful for me to shave my legs on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This shaver didn&#x27;t cause nicks or any problems, just was never very good either.</li>
            <li> Overall, works well and not as painful as other hair removal methods.</li>
            <li> My wife charged it  - the batterys ran out with the first shave -Cut like crap  </li>
            <li> Hate to say it because the reason I bought it was because it had such good reviews, but I think this product is horrible.</li>
            <li> Plus I had to stop using so much gel...went gel crazy!</li>
            <li> not worth your money, worst shaver i ever used, just no good, after i quite using this i went to a cheap battery operated one, been using it about a year now.</li>
            <li> But the plastic slider pieces are so poorly made that I can&#x27;t get them to move half of the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 stars in this case because of my bad experience with the battery of the previous shaver; hopefully that was a fluke but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Hair is less likely to get caught and painfully yanked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even if it died in a few months and has to be replaced, it&#x27;s still less expensive than waxing.</li>
            <li> The underarm area is fine, but it pulls the hairs on the bikini area - very painful!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to shave in college (community) showers.</li>
            <li> but (and this is kinda hard to explain)</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver a while ago, and I hardly use it.  </li>
            <li> Hard to work that with slippery hands.</li>
            <li> but it went dull in about 3 shavings.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re getting hurt, you&#x27;re probably pushing way too hard because the machine is designed to be painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After being disappointed with other brands of women&#x27;s electric shavers I&#x27;ve purchased over the years, I found the Panasonic ES2216PC  Close Curves Wet/Dry Shaver finally works the way an electric shaver should work.  </li>
            <li> I have  hard time picking up my legs</li>
            <li> is hard to use when your hands are wet.&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li> Hard to tell these days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hardly gets any hair at all.</li>
            <li> It is a bit on the dull side.</li>
            <li> It is a bit on the dull side.</li>
            <li> and I have gotten razor-burn and nicks, probably from pushing too hard from trying to get a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the blades were getting dull.  </li>
            <li> Of course, there is the hassle of packing it and mailing, so overall, I am quite unhappy</li>
            <li> I go to water aerobics at least twice a week and shave often</li>
            <li> started making a horrible sound, metal piece on front fell off and not does not remove the hair.  </li>
            <li> It also stunts the growth so you don&#x27;t need to shave as often (at least in my oppinion).  </li>
            <li> Just inconvenient to have to go without shaving a couple days until I buy my next replacement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent years having a difficult time shaving without my legs itching and burning.</li>
            <li> It was dirty, possibly from melted sealant or lubricant used.</li>
            <li> I bought mine from that Drugstore site, not Amazon, so nothing negative toward the seller as I had no experience with them</li>
            <li> It is a bit noisy and the plug in charger is clumsy.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a trimmer (rather than a shaver) and it is NOT effective for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Panasonic shaver for at least two years with no</li>
            <li> Girl on the phone was kinda rude as well.  </li>
            <li> and I am in my late 20&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I wanted that I&#x27;d go for a waxing, at least with wax</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver sucks...</li>
            <li> Used for bikini zone, it pulls on hair terribly unless hair is soft from a recent shower.</li>
            <li> I have also used this on my armpits and bikini area; not one complaint.  </li>
            <li> My daughter said it has been like this since she got it and never liked it.</li>
            <li> I never liked the design to begin with</li>
            <li> I have gotten through 3 shaves without being charged for at least a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> you have to go over and over and over to get any cutting of hairs, especially leg hairs</li>
            <li> I still get at least 30 minutes out of it on a charge.  </li>
            <li> It was at least 45</li>
            <li> I need a light-duty shaver, one that does the job delicately on underarms and legs.</li>
            <li> So in this throw away world I guess that rates at least 4 stars</li>
            <li> I purchased this product b/c I am disabled and was tired of cutting myself with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I took it slow @</li>
            <li> So I went over it again, slowly and experimenting with pressure and direction to see how close of a shave I could get.</li>
            <li> In order for it to work, I have to move it extremely slowly over my leg; and even then, it is so-so.  </li>
            <li> that well because the hairs underarms are really thick.</li>
            <li> I got tired of wasting money on the mens body groomers they are really expensive and most of them are crap .&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have to go slow on thicker hair</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> within 3 minutes it starts to slow</li>
            <li> You have to go slow with it.</li>
            <li> However, even though I had fully discharged the battery before the second recharge, it didn&#x27;t fully (and still will not fully) recharge, so the razor doesn&#x27;t have enough oomph to cut the hair - it just pulls it out very painfully.  </li>
            <li> This one is enough of a disappointment that I am about to purchase my third electric razor in less than a month :(</li>
            <li> This one is enough of a disappointment that I am about to purchase my third electric razor in less than a month :(</li>
            <li> It was horrible and a huge waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I unfortunately dropped my other one.  </li>
            <li> something so small got me so overjoyed!</li>
            <li> I mean for instance you&#x27;re blurry eyed in the morning and shave your legs, pull a skirt and pumps on and get to the office.</li>
            <li> I mean, you turn it on and shave with it</li>
            <li> I mean BEGGED.  </li>
            <li> After all of this I was still too lazy to come on here and write a negative review until today (~6 months after I purchased the razor) - I got it out, charged it, and now the thing doesn&#x27;t even turn on, period, even when plugged into the wall!</li>
            <li> should it fail in an area like needing blades or foil head and other parts.  </li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t need anything resembling a depilatory/epilator--I am aghast that women knowingly seek out any such machine that pulls hair out by the roots, which is inhumane and torture.</li>
            <li> After that time, the shaver kept pulling the hair instead of shaving it, leading to an unpleasant experience and numerous bumps and redspots.</li>
            <li> With normal use, the connection between the razor and charger has loosened to the point that I can no longer force the razor to stand upright on its base.</li>
            <li> serious of an issue is the \\&quot;recharge\\&quot; docking device.</li>
            <li> You may find this inconvenient if you only have floor-height plugs to work with, or if you have children who can access those plugs, or if you want to put it behind a dresser, etc.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try since it was less expensive and sounded like it would work well.</li>
            <li> Both the dry &amp; wet-mode were equally disappointing.</li>
            <li> I wear glasses, ever tried to shave your legs when your half blind?</li>
            <li> A ridiculous product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously thinking of returning it although I don&#x27;t know how Amazon feels about returns of used products.  </li>
            <li> I, seriously, cannot believe that I have gone 33 years without it.  </li>
            <li> They wouldn&#x27;t cut one single hair and it&#x27;s not like I have crazy hair growth or anything.  </li>
            <li> The little things in life really mean a lot!!</li>
            <li> However, the wall unit makes it difficult to charge the razor in tight spaces.</li>
            <li> My wife has complained that it&#x27;s tough to get the hair in the arm-pits and around the ankles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> i get really really bad ingrown hairs and razor bumps when i use a regular razor.</li>
            <li> After a few month, it fails.</li>
            <li> Wet shaving armpits when you&#x27;re already dressed is really inconvenient - this solves that problem.  </li>
            <li> i decided to buy this for Bikini area.since razor gives me rashes and ugly red spots all around the bikini zone.</li>
            <li> Sorry folks we disagree, it is heavy, bulky and it does not give a close shave</li>
            <li> was just too complicated and messy.  </li>
            <li> Not a good trait for a \\&quot;shaver\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is, it is painful to use on your underarms.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no good for bikini areas.</li>
            <li> the plug - it is a square base which plugs directly into the socket, and the shaver stands up on it.  </li>
            <li> The way the shaver is designed to recharge, it sets on a base that plugs directly into the wall.  </li>
            <li> I have been sick and my back is not letting me bend in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I just could not get one.e, but it blocks use of the other plug and is somewhat awkward.    </li>
            <li> The only complaint (nitpick) is the led indicator on the charging base</li>
            <li> I grew sick and tired of the daily beating</li>
            <li> First of all the battery was horrible.</li>
            <li> granted, if you expect it to shave as closely as a regular razor then you will be disappointed</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, this razor was awful from the first time I used it on -</li>
            <li> From the moment I used it, it was weak, it does not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I got the Shaver yesterday, the box was already open.</li>
            <li> duh!  </li>
            <li> I will say that it misses longer hairs, and with the long hair extension it can pull painfully in some areas.</li>
            <li> I go over one place slowly and nothing!</li>
            <li> Pre cutting blade does not cut well, had to trim down for close shave</li>
            <li> This one worked well for six months or so before it began slowing down and pulling on hairs instead of actually cutting them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s swift, cutting down on the pain.</li>
            <li> and I was scared of cutting myself on the very, very sharp edges.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t bad in dry mode.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something in between - less expensive and less painful with no razor burn.</li>
            <li> The other problem my daughter had with it was that the on switch was very difficult to slide.  </li>
            <li> I can shave wet or dry without worrying about nasty razor burn.</li>
            <li> Razor burn is very common</li>
            <li> The only thing I was very unhappy about was the Panasonic sealed plastic packaging.  </li>
            <li> The directions say it&#x27;s very delicate.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> When it was working, it did not deliver a close leg shave unless I went very slowly and used it daily.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> However, by the time I was done, the corners of the razor had nicked me four times- and by nick, I mean take out a triangle chunk of skin!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> If not satisfied the shaver will be returned!!</li>
            <li> A little disappointing.  </li>
            <li> No matter which direction or how carefully I shaved, I would get ugly ingrown hair scars.</li>
            <li> The worse razor ever.</li>
            <li> Not really happy.</li>
            <li> In short, Panasonic needs to redesign the charger base.</li>
            <li> Poor shave.</li>
            <li> Have had electric razors all my life and this is the worse.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is not great</li>
            <li> Was not great</li>
            <li> After getting tired of razor burn and manual shaving, I decided to try an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic shavers for about 12 years now and never has the battery life/closeness been so poor.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately is poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> When used on pubic hair, ended up looking like a poor dog hair cut.  </li>
            <li> I used to have an epilator (with the shaver), and I was tired of the pain...</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was tired of almost killing myself trying to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I hate trying to open them -</li>
            <li> It gives a much worse shave.</li>
            <li> If you are tired of shaving in the shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not happy with it.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I was tired of paying for $20 refill razors.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a total piece of crap...  </li>
            <li> I was using my BF&#x27;s Norelco but he got tired of me forgetting to charge it and made me get my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worse still, over time the charger has ceased working altogether.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> They were almost worse then not shaving at all.  </li>
            <li> and I thought I had broken it.  </li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer switch is already broken.</li>
            <li> the irritating razor burn</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s broken already.</li>
            <li> whether or not you get a unit with a poor battery.</li>
            <li> So poor marks for customer service, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t pull my hair or leave razor burn, it did leave behind stubble.</li>
            <li> Thought my mom&#x27;s electric Remington razor that you have to plug in was outdated</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone who has been skeptical in the past to give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have terrible scarring on my legs resulting from cuts and ingrown hairs from shaving with all different sorts of razors for the past four years.</li>
            <li> I do not understand peoples complaints about the buttons, they have a little locking button to push before sliding it up and the design of the unit would make them very difficult to break them off.</li>
            <li> The wife said waxing would have been less painful.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe there are not more women complaining about how uncomfortable this razor is to use!</li>
            <li> The trimmer is difficult to push up and down, hair clogs in the trimmer and is impossible to get out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple electric razors over the years and this is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for years and this is by far the worst one I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Wife hated it, and it would never sit properly in the charger.</li>
            <li> This one was so lame that it was worse than a mechanical razor.</li>
            <li> This razor is by far the worst electric shaver I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> For the past two years, I&#x27;ve been using another brand of electric shaver that I just hated, but I was too lazy to shop for another one.  </li>
            <li> Was dirty and package  seriously torn and looked used.</li>
            <li> However, I thought I would try this one out and am a little disappointed by comparison.  </li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> but after a little less than 2 years, the spring mechanism that holds it in the base is broken and so it will not charge unless I sit there and hold it in the base......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is so bad about a cord that manufacturers no longer include the option?</li>
            <li> What a waste of plastic &amp; resources :(&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have stuck with my gut feeling on this one, I am so disappointed that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Actuating the switch by pushing and releasing the pin in the base of the battery housing caused the razor head to stop and it would not run until I pushed slightly on the contacts again.</li>
            <li> Because the razor is top-heavy and curves slightly outward, it pulls forward, away from the wall - and off the base of the charger.</li>
            <li> Granted it&#x27;s the only electric shaver I have ever used, but I was very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> With as expensive as razors have become</li>
            <li> i was skeptical when i bought this product, but when i tried it i was amazed at how well it works.</li>
            <li> and I thought I would save money from buying expensive replacement cartridges and save the earth from tossing out blades by buying an electric razor.</li>
            <li> If you accidently pushed the wrong button, the button on the head of the razor, then the cap on the head and the razors inside would go flying across the shower.</li>
            <li> I wrongly assumed that as it was sent to Australia</li>
            <li> It is useless to me.</li>
            <li> If you get a \\&quot;wahl\\&quot;, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry I did.  </li>
            <li> is very nearly useless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for just 5 months and already it fails to closely shave.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I had to return it.  </li>
            <li> and it is difficult to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I take it camping when it&#x27;s too difficult to shave in the campground showers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bikini attachment is a joke, completely useless.</li>
            <li> FRUSTRATING!</li>
            <li> The size of it can be difficult on the surfaces of a petite body.  </li>
            <li> While I like the look and feel of the product, it is useless to give a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I am SO SORRY</li>
            <li> the same horrible rash plus AOUCHHHHH</li>
            <li> But I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they won&#x27;t let me return it either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this</li>
            <li> It tugs and pulls, and can be uncomfortable when working on your bikini area.</li>
            <li> I like this for legs, and at times pits, but I was not impressed with the Bikini popup</li>
            <li> difficult shave one&#x27;s underarms.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, but I would not buy this item again.</li>
            <li> I used it twice but found it to be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> However, after only 4 months (maybe using it twice a week), it is terrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad</li>
            <li> This is the worst shaver that I have ever purchased in my entire life!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition that makes razor shaving difficult.  </li>
            <li> , that wouldn&#x27;t crap out on me after a few months, and eventually decided on this one after researching and reading reviews.</li>
            <li> Turns out that my assumption was totally wrong.</li>
            <li> It does spit hair out randomly all over your leg, it&#x27;s not the nicest thing to see</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> I hate messy shaving.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had difficult hair.</li>
            <li> the replacement blades/foil aren&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s wrong with using a cardboard box?  </li>
            <li> and thought that I would end up saving money by not having to buy those expensive Venus cartridges.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the razor blades I use are so expensive</li>
            <li> but i agree the charger is weird.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have over forty dollars invested in this product, and now it&#x27;s essentially useless.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> But it is completely useless on any hair that has ANY growth beyond stubble.  </li>
            <li> This is useless.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, I purchased two of these, I got one for my daughter and  myself.</li>
            <li> Worse shaver I have ever had!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> It is completely useless for the \\&quot;bikini\\&quot; area, whether using the attachment or not.</li>
            <li> For legs and underarms, it would randomly skip patches of hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my skin is ultra-sensitive and every time I try to shave my legs with a blade razor</li>
            <li> Then the thing would cut off randomly while I was using it, even when fully charged.  </li>
            <li> I also dropped it in the shower and broke the piece that holds the head together making it unusable and also really difficult to replace.</li>
            <li> just became too difficult.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> :  Difficult to charge if you have sideways outlets in your house.</li>
            <li> but sadly I cannot recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Sad to say.</li>
            <li> Based upon my Panasonic electric razor shaving experience, I convinced her to try a Panasonic when her electric razor failed.</li>
            <li> No more bloody ankles or knees.</li>
            <li> Takes long time to shave and does a worst job that a razor.</li>
            <li> It very annoying to do especially with a razor, cream, and that risk of cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> Too bad the charger was poorly designed.</li>
            <li> It randomly snags &amp; pulls your hair instead of cutting it all the time.</li>
            <li> it takes it down to the worst day.</li>
            <li> I am extremely unhappy with this product and Panasonic as a company.  </li>
            <li> anyway I thought to keep from cutting herself</li>
            <li> star deduction for the awkward plug/charger along with the battery life.</li>
            <li> I never intended to become a razor tester, but for some inexplicable reason Amazon will not send rechargable razors to Hawaii.  </li>
            <li> there way also another hair cutting adapter that I will probably never use.</li>
            <li> How disappointing.  </li>
            <li> My daughter enjoys the fact that she doesn&#x27;t have to worry about cutting herself with the razor anymore.  </li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> no worries about cutting yourself with this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and painful.</li>
            <li> At a minimum I have to wait 2-weeks between shaving my legs, which is inconvenient and</li>
            <li> But now that I have been using it for 4 months, it is no longer cutting the hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s horrible....and panasonic&#x27;s customer service is deplorable.</li>
            <li> (She was always cutting herself with a so-called safety razor.)  </li>
            <li> I put it on the clipper setting and started shearing, uh, cutting.</li>
            <li> Disappointing results.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a few months now and it just gives a horrible shave.</li>
            <li> It was extremely disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t feel it, so things got dangerous, haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stopped cutting the hairs all together and even when it did, it pulled the hairs and sometimes even cut me.  </li>
            <li> Beats cutting myself in the shower, however.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few Remington shavers and they were awful.  </li>
            <li> It is awkward to charge.</li>
            <li> but mine would not hold a charge at all and was dirty inside.  </li>
            <li> I had a Remington for a year and it stopped cutting the hair, all together.  </li>
            <li> , I just think it&#x27;s a lousy product!</li>
            <li> even then I have chicken skin and develop a painful leg rash.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have very difficult hair to cut</li>
            <li> But when I opened it up, I was very wrong.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing an electric (battery) razor because they just did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> The charging base is weird but not a problem.</li>
            <li> I order from Amazon as this razor is almost impossible to find anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> For me, this feature made it virtually impossible for me to nick my skin.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but was then shocked at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the quality of this product as it worked poorly.</li>
            <li> , so I suppose that expense isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> Well, it wasn&#x27;t a bad investment, but compared to this Panasonic?</li>
            <li> Found the Panasonic and was hesitant to try it based on some of the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> The cord went bad could not get a replacement.</li>
            <li> Not the seller&#x27;s fault, just a bad product.</li>
            <li> Lots of reviews say bad things about this item&#x27;s battery...</li>
            <li> every time i looked at it i felt bad about myself.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that it gave a close shave.</li>
            <li> The bikini trimmer part is painful</li>
            <li> if i wanted my hair pulled out i would get waxed... extremely painful.</li>
            <li> it no longer aggressively shaves my legs, leaves lots of stray hairs, and even painfully pulls some hairs.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so horribly painful</li>
            <li> This means that when you go to shave longer hairs, the trimmer yanks on them really painfully, and doesn&#x27;t cut them at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Edited to add: It also kept tugging on the hair, which was painful.</li>
            <li> I was really frustrated because I&#x27;d done a bunch of research before purchasing this one and</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, does a very poor job.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with the Panasonic</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> However Im disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Gave me ingrown hairs :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Then you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This thing stinks!</li>
            <li> What a shame..:(</li>
            <li> I was rather disappointed with this electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Thoroughly disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> boy am I disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Remington razors for years and became disappointed with the replacement blades and the length of time (1-2 Years)</li>
            <li> Then it stopped cutting the hairs unless I went over the area 6-7 times!  </li>
            <li> Really disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> I tried using this in the shower and got disappointed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Trying to shave with this thing was a very painful experience instead of cutting the hair if feels like its ripping them out one at a time.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> However, the shaver companies think we are too stupid to figure out you can&#x27;t bring a cord into the shower and.</li>
            <li> The Pivoting head makes it easier to reach those annoying areas (like under the knees.)</li>
            <li> HATE the bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li> I hate using a razor - razor burn, itchy regrowth, etc.</li>
            <li> I HATE stubble in between showers and</li>
            <li> but I just hate taking a lot of time to remove hair.</li>
            <li> it cause i hate being stuck in the shower or tub shaving.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> I really hate this razor.  </li>
            <li> I hate this shaver.</li>
            <li> I hate having to shave all the time</li>
            <li> I hate getting ingrown hairs from razors</li>
            <li> The pivoting head can be annoying.  </li>
            <li> Hate the style of the charger.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating!!  </li>
            <li> and the fact that it is impossible to cut yourself on one of these babys is the icing on the cake!</li>
            <li> Really bad quality!</li>
            <li> I do not have a lot of hair on my legs and hated shaving in the tub.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife so she would stop using my razor, she hated it still uses my Norelco.</li>
            <li> Very bad that power adapter for this model</li>
            <li> I am very frustrated about the quality of this product and the customer service of Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and should have returned it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in it.  </li>
            <li> now I can officially say that I&#x27;m very disappointed with its performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> This ravor is terrible.</li>
            <li> This thing is horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible shaver!</li>
            <li> and it was awful.</li>
            <li> I thought it was the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever had (</li>
            <li> Anyone considering an electric shaver I&#x27;m telling you this is the one to have, you will not be disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to reduce awful in-grown hairs</li>
            <li> It is horrible.  </li>
            <li> Terrible product .</li>
            <li> but this razor has been terrible since day 1</li>
            <li> What a P.O.S. - I think if my goal had been to find the worst razor out there that I would have chosen this monstrosity of torture.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Ugh, it&#x27;s so annoying!</li>
            <li> say this is the worst one I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Horrible shave!  </li>
            <li> This is the worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> and it was horrible.</li>
            <li> worst ever!</li>
            <li> I still have stubbles on my legs after using and it&#x27;s horrible for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> This is terrible.</li>
            <li> Now she can shave her legs in comfort without the risk of a nasty cut.</li>
            <li> so I decided to give this shaver a chance, worst choice ever!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately, this shaver boasts both of these abilities, and so you can now have the worst of both worlds.  </li>
            <li> This was the worst shaver that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Awful!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t deal with Panasonic customer service  - they are terrible!!!</li>

            <li> I like. It but after a while it. Does not shave any more</li>
            <li> Been buying same for yrs good.</li>
            <li> Love this! It holds a charge for a long time and gets all the hair.</li>
            <li> I received my razor yesterday. The worse razor ever. As I was trying to use it my legged was burning and this razor cut my leg up.  I even took pictures of all of my cuts on my leg.</li>
            <li> I like this razor a lot, however, the trimmer part just rips the hair out. Ouch!!</li>
            <li> Item did not charge properly. I had to return the shaver because I couldn&#x27;t get it to hold a charge.</li>
            <li> So far have just used twice dry...once with trimmer extension and once regular flush to the skin. Was smooth on my skin, no discomfort, good for bikini line for a quick fix but as others have said not quite as smooth as shaving, but very similar to the &amp;#34;one day after shaving&amp;#34; feeling of hair growth with this. The trimmer part I love! Perfect length and consistency, I was afraid it would end up patchy however the tool is very precise and easy to use plus quick. Seems easy to clean and take apart/put back together. Stands easily on charging station when not in use. So far so good!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an electric razor.  I wish I would have thought about looking into this option earlier in life.  I am 41.  I have course, thick, dark black and fast growing hair and have to shave everyday (if showing any leg).  With the Panasonic razor I can go every other day or a little bit longer.  It is easy to use, charge lasts about a week for me.  I do wish the charger light would change colors or turn off so you know when the razor is charged completely.  With as expensive as razors have become I started looking at alternatives and this was what I came up with.  I am very happy with my purchase.  You can shave with soap, body wash, or shaving cream.  I have not tried this on dry skin yet.  I love that I can take this to my fitness club and do a quick touch up in the shower.  Easy to hold.  Easy to clean.  This is worth the money and a great purchase.  08/21/2015  I am extremely unhappy with this product and Panasonic as a company.  My first razor worked great for about 2 months and then stopped holding a charge.  I contacted Panasonic at that time, they suggested I send it in to be replaced (at my cost).  I did this thinking it was a fluke issue and that the replacement product would be glitch free.  It took me about 3 months to get the replacement, after a number of phone calls and e-mails to the service center.  The second item worked for a short time so I then again called Panasonic to request a refund of the product, this was on 07/14/2015.  I was informed by the representative that I would need to e-mail my receipt to a certain department, which I did.  I just got off the phone with customer service and yes I spoke with a supervisor to be informed my &#x27;request for a refund&#x27; has been denied and I would need to petition the corporate office via a letter in VA.  I am getting ready to start this process.  I am very frustrated about the quality of this product and the customer service of Panasonic.  All for $41.</li>
            <li> Researched quite awhile before purchasing this razor. Easy to use and close shave. Love the compact way it recharges, no cord.</li>
            <li> I love it!!  It does take about 2-3 weeks for it to be doing its job the best. But now I spend less time in the shower and can shave anytime. Easy to clean and easy to use. I have not used it in the shower yet. Only a dry shave. Love it.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely fashion and works well.  However, this Panasonic model appears chep and flimsy.  I probably would but an upgraded model the next time I was in the market</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife at Christmas and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Pretty good shaver- it doesn&#x27;t really shave that closely, when compared to a normal razor. However, it is really convenient. I have mostly used this on trips. The charge seems to last a long time, and it worked best with shaving cream while wet.</li>
            <li> I love it.  This razor works great - just like I expected.  If you are looking for a razor - this is the one.</li>
            <li> Did not like this razor at all!</li>
            <li> THIS RAZOR IS GREAT FOR USE IN THE SHOWER!!!  IT CHARGE&#x27;S QUICKLY AND SEEMS TO HOLD CHARGE FOR NEEDED LENGTH OF TIME FOR USING IT!!!  IT WILL NEVER REPLACE A PROFESSIONAL BRAZILIAN WAX...  BUT FOR MY MONEY ITS ABOUT THE SECOND BEST THING TO A FULL WAX!!!</li>
            <li> Product is ok. The closest shave I can get feels like the day after shaving with a razor. I don&#x27;t know that it is any better than most other e-shavers.</li>
            <li> This product does the job. It is easy to use and easy to charge. It&#x27;s great to take on trips.</li>
            <li> This is my second shaver in 20 years.  These machines last forever.  Leave it plugged in and use it everyday.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin as smooth as a razor, only the smallest stubble.  I&#x27;m married............who cares about shaving :)</li>
            <li> if your looking for an easy fast way to get a super ravor like shave not the product for you.</li>
            <li> My first Panasonic shaver lasted 10 years.  I was so please with it that I just had to replace it with another Panasonic.  It is so easy to use because it is cordless, it gives good shaves, and it is easy to clean.  I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Product works just as advertised. Love the bikini attachment too. Perfect for when I need a quick shave. Obviously won&#x27;t last as long as shaving with a normal razor but it&#x27;s a lot less hassle which was what i wanted.</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase for the price it has worked well I would recommend this to a friend for purchase</li>
            <li> Nothing great. I purchased this in the hope that it would be better and easier than a razor, but it&#x27;s not. I&#x27;ve been using it in the shower but it &amp;#34;skips&amp;#34;, meaning it does not glide smoothly along the legs. Also, it does not do a good job of removing all hairs, especially around the knee area.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor quite some time ago but waited to write a review until I had used it enough times to give it a fair rating.  When deciding to purchase an electric razor, you have to remember that you will get a good shave but it will never be as close as using an actual razor.  In addition, the coarseness and color of the hair you are shaving will also make a difference in the effectiveness of an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I have really enjoyed this electric razor and I mostly use it for times when I don&#x27;t want to spend the time using a regular razor with shaving cream..  The hair on my legs is fine and light colored so I get a pretty close shave that personally works for me.  I could see how if you have dark, coarse hair on your legs, you might not be happy with the results of this razor as the shave would last maybe 1 day before you would see the hair growth again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are mixed reviews on this razor but I think some people will like it while others will prefer another brand.  It really comes down to a personal decision of what works and doesn&#x27;t work for each individual person.  If asked, I would recommend this razor for those who are looking for a supplement to traditional razors and do not have dark, course hair.</li>
            <li> I use the razor in the shower or while I am taking a bath or while I am watching tv.  It is great and stays charge a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again if something happens to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the fact that it can fall in the tub because it is fully immersable</li>
            <li> I got this shaver to replace my 10 year old Remington that I really miss. I decided on this shaver based on the positive reviews but I think it&#x27;s a good shaver for a last minute shave on the rush. I will probably buy another Remington on the near future!</li>
            <li> I got this more as a trimmer than a razor. It&#x27;s nice I can use it in the shower without a problem. I does not give a close shave when used as a razor but the guard for the trimmer is great.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as I am  now taking a blood thinner which causes excessive bleeding when you cut yourself.  I can use this razor dry ( sitting) on a chair, yeah!) or wet.  The shave is not as close as my disposable razor but acceptable!  It&#x27;s much more convenient!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what was specified.  Legs and underarms are very smooth after using the product.  No stubble.</li>
            <li> Got this for a Christmas present last year and I have to say that I really like it.  It, like all electric razors, doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a regular razor blade but it does work well for me and gives an acceptable close shave.  I have to wear readers to see what I am doing and since I take showers I was always putting off the shaving because I couldn&#x27;t see well enough.  Now I just zap my legs with this razor before I get in the shower and I&#x27;m done in a matter of minutes.  I have even used this in the bath and it works really well there too.  The trimmer works great and so does the adjustable bikini attachment.  I no longer have to panic when I wear capris or a dress that I haven&#x27;t shaved my legs in forever.  I just zap those hairs and go!!  No water, no soap, no mess.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a blind friend with sensitive skin and diabetes and she is very happy with the product and said that is was easy to set up and is performing well.  She keeps the razor on the charger that plugs into the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution about the charger, which is a 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch block that plugs into the wall: the blades of the charger plug are vertical blades on the left and right below the socket for the razor device charger plug.  If you have wall plugs with horizontal blade holes on the top and bottom, the charger will need an extension of some sort, or one will end up charging razor on it&#x27;s side (which I imagine is extremely hard to do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon price was excellent and I appreciated the super saver shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000G0GW6K Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver with Bikini Attachment, Mauve]]</li>
            <li> i was skeptical when i bought this product, but when i tried it i was amazed at how well it works. not only does it work well but it is very easy to clean. the charger is not bulky at all so it fits easily into luggage. it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Needed an electric razor to use mostly for underarm area as waxing is getting too expensive! This area is very sensitive on me and this electric razor was just what I was looking for. Using it wet seems to be better for this particular area. But I love being able to use it dry for other areas! The pivot action of the head and the pop up trimmer are fabulous additions that I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with the Panasonic ES2216PC. I&#x27;ve been a long time user of straight razors and I thought I would save money from buying expensive replacement cartridges and save the earth from tossing out blades by buying an electric razor. So I choose this razor hoping to get the same close smooth shave that I got from the straight razor and boy, was I wrong. This razor did not get as close to the skin, even after pushing really hard with the spring loaded head, it still left hair stubble! The head of th razor also pulled on my skin which hurt! The button to turn the razor on and off, seemed flimsy like it would break at any moment. If you accidently pushed the wrong button, the button on the head of the razor, then the cap on the head and the razors inside would go flying across the shower. What a mess! So I returned the razor, and I am back to using my straight razor for a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  I read it was noisy and found that when it is you just have to push the head down a little until it clicks and the noise goes away.  I use it dry and it works well.  It bit me under the arm when I pushed down too hard.  Use a light touch.  I like the floating head.  Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and finally settled on this razor.  I have never had an electric razor so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but was happy with the results.  One reviewer claimed the razor left lines on their legs and I was a bit put off by that, but after using the razor I can only surmise that they were pressing down very hard. The edges of the razor didn&#x27;t touch my skin at all.  I got a nice close shave...closer than I can get with hand razors! I was also a bit concerned about cleaning the razor but it was a breeze to take apart to clean...took seconds!  The only negative is the packaging.  It took forever for me to get the package open...like breaking into Fort Knox! But, don&#x27;t let that deter you...it&#x27;s a great electric razor!</li>
            <li> This ravor is terrible. It left me with razor burn and didn&#x27;t remove all unwanted hair. Don&#x27;t waste your $$.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver last fall and it has been with me through thick and thin, literally! Today I am ordering another because I accidentally dropped mine on a tile floor and one of the shavers broke off. The shaver still works fine with one side, but since I love it so much, I want to get a new one. I use it almost daily and have had no problems with it. The only reason why mine lost one side was because of my own human error. Try this razor, it&#x27;s well worth the money. You will love it!</li>
            <li> So we all know its NOT as close as a razor..and it is loud...but for the bucks you spend IT WORKS well.&lt;br /&gt;I use it EVERYTHING and it shaves very nice. I wasn;t happy about the trimmer peice you can raise up but it&#x27;s my fault for not reading the instructon. I would bet it states Not us use it on the spot I did....~LOL~</li>
            <li> For the price this is a good razor.  I have had others that gave a closer shave but paid much more.  Do not find the bikini attachment works, but I did not buy it for this purpose.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this is a good (not excellent) shaver.  It does not shave as close as a razor.  This is fine for a rush job -- I still have a little stubble left after shaving.  The charger, to me, is upside-down -- meaning the shaver hangs from the charger rather than sits on it and sometimes may fall if not really secure.</li>
            <li> Love this. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This thing is horrible. Not a close shave what so ever. I&#x27;ve never gotten so many nicks. It actually took some of my skin off!</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this, things started out fine.  However, by the time I was done, the corners of the razor had nicked me four times- and by nick, I mean take out a triangle chunk of skin! I was careful the whole time, but there was no avoiding it. The shave was alright, not the best, and definitely not worth the ugly painful gouges!</li>
            <li> I had used this razor previously and knew it was a good product.  I unfortunately dropped my other one.  This one is sturdy, shaves well and has the bikini attachment.  It&#x27;s a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even thought of using an electric shaver for more than 25 years and that experience was not a good one. For medical reasons I will no longer be able to use a blade so after seeing positive reviews, ordered this model. I have only had it for a few days but have used it in all body areas and it does a very good job. I feel I got a better shave on legs/underarms when using it in the shower but it wasn&#x27;t bad in dry mode. As I&#x27;ve gotten older my body hair has gotten sparser and it was always rather fine so this razor works well for me. Easy to use and easy to clean. The dry option is nice  for last minute use.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It was a short honeymoon. Although I was happy with the shaver when I used it, after two uses it did not turn on at all or if it did, it stopped after a minute. I am hoping I just got a defective one and have requested a replacement because I must use an electric shaver. Also, the original plastic packaging was incredibly difficult to open and I was scared of cutting myself on the very, very sharp edges. Why do they package things this way? It&#x27;s as if they don&#x27;t want anyone to be able to open the product. Of course, there is the hassle of packing it and mailing, so overall, I am quite unhappy</li>
            <li> I have never had an electric razor before, so I can not compare this to another. However, I can compare this to the traditional razors. Although it is more convenient to have an electric razor, it seems like I need to shave more often than with a regular razor. This razor is easy to use and is easy to clean. It does not take long to charge and it holds its charge for a VERY LONG TIME. I do not have to keep going over the same area to get the job done. I have not used the attachment, so I cannot comment on that. Just so you know, the razor is definitely pink--mauve means a purple-ish pink, but this is just a rosy pink--it is nice, but not mauve.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product that promises what it delivers, I don&#x27;t expect it to shave like a traditional razor because it&#x27;s not one!  Don&#x27;t really get the purpose of the bikini attachment but other than that I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> This shaver is easy to handle and I like that you can use it in the shower BUT the shave is not close. It leaves your legs stubbley.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 3 months back; took it to India, my wife used it for few days and then charger (adaptor) got out. I thought of buying a new charger but guess what.. the adaptor cost is around 31 USD (on pansonic offical website). Ah! too expensive when compared with the full product cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting it to work on 50/60 Hz frequency and on 220-240V voltage but I believ, it is not made to work under those cases, though I don&#x27;t think it was written explicity anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May be designed to work only in US; but still... adaptors might go out even in US also.</li>
            <li> My wife is very satisfied with the preformance but she has not used the attachments yet</li>
            <li> I purchased this product b/c I am disabled and was tired of cutting myself with a regular razor. I had it for less than a week and just gave it a shot. When I say that my body resembled Magilla gorilla, I&#x27;m not joking! In about 45min., this razor took care of everything! (legs, underarms and bikini) The only reasons it even took that long was b/c I took it slow @ first (afraid to cut myself) and inability to move quickly. It didn&#x27;t hurt one bit, even in sensitive areas! I can&#x27;t tell which aspect of the shaver I&#x27;m most impressed with, the ease of use or that a remarkable product cost so little! If I were able to do a back-flip from excitement, I surely would! THIS IS AN AWESOME PRODUCT!!! Please understand that this is just my opinion (which is worth about as much as a fart in the wind), but for the cost, it is certainly worth trying! I only used it dry and will only use the wet feature for cleaning. I finally feel like a woman again! :-) If I&#x27;m ever going to give another female a gift, you better believe it&#x27;s going to be one of these jammies! I really can&#x27;t remember the last time something so small got me so overjoyed! Goodbye la brea tar pits and may you ladies enjoy like I am! WHOO-WHO! :-)</li>
            <li> My wife used this when she was on chemo. It served her well.</li>
            <li> Great product, left my other one in Colorado on vacation so I bought another one....it is very handy and keeps a good charge.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using different model of Remington in the past. After checking the reviews I bought this unit as a present for her.&lt;br /&gt;Looks great and the tilting head is impressive. Unfortunately my wife told me that this unit does not give quite the same results as the ones she had in the past. This Panasonic works o.k. but it does not leave the skin smooth as the Remington&#x27;s she had. Now I have to get her a Remington!!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Not as close as shave as advertised.  But overall  pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower and it works great.  I also use it outside the shower and it works just as well.  I like that it is rechargeable and that the head is adjustable. I like that you can remove the head to clean it after you are done.  It has not caused me any irritation and I&#x27;m usually pretty sensitive.  It doesn&#x27;t make too much noise.  The shape is comfortable for my small hands and it does not weigh much.  I like the color and it is easy to use.  This is my first electronic shaver and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  I bought it after I read all the positive reviews on Amazon. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October 2015&lt;br /&gt;I dropped the shaver in the bathtub and it broke from the side. Didn&#x27;t hold up very well to a minimal fall. I was disappointed. Dropping it to four stars.</li>
            <li> I wanted an electric razor even though I realized the results would not be as good as with a razor. I was happily surprised. Does an excellent job for me. Legs feel quite smooth. Much better than any electric razor I have looked in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used manual shavers but thought I&#x27;d try an electric and I cannot say I am impressed.  It doesn&#x27;t shave close at all, misses hairs left and right and occasionally pulls, hurts the skin if you are not super careful to have it at the perfect angle, where it doesn&#x27;t cut.  Into the garbage pail with this one!</li>
            <li> Have purchased 5 of these razors. Started out with one for myself, and then branched out to giving them as female family gifts. Everyone that I purchased these for rates it as highly as I do.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic shaver (2 different models) that not only pulls hair, but has cut me and drawn blood while using. I plan to send this back to the mfr and buy a Remington instead</li>
            <li> Not really happy. Thinking I should have returned it. It&#x27;s not as good as the one I used to have that died after 10 years or so. This one shafs my skin especially when the extender is out. It&#x27;s just rough and not smooth like my old one.</li>
            <li> love this!!!!! i dropped/broke my other electric razor, replaced it with one from walmart, returned that one and bought this one instead. it works amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for a few months now.  Versus using a razor, I think this shaver gives better results.  I recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Last week, after shaving with a razor, I decided that I no longer had the ability to do the acrobatic moves required to shave my legs in the tub. I came out looking like a murder victim with blood running down my legs. So I finally broke down and bought this razor in the hopes of easier shaving. I purchased this one because of the lower price combined with well over 300 decent reviews. A product with that many good reviews means it is liked, and is a decent enough design to hold its own against the more expensive electric razors out there. (One reviewer mentioned some other razor, saying everyone would like it better, but the cost was three times of this one with MUCH WORSE reviews, and I could not warrant over a hundred dollars for it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It showed up yesterday in its nice little box. After reading reviews of how it plugged directly into the wall, I had already purchased a short extension cord for it to plug into, now it can sit on the counter. I followed the instructions about charging it for 12 hours. (All Good equipment with batteries tells you to do that.) Then today is the first time I ever used an electric razor in my 40+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I wish to say to everyone complaining about an electric razor not being as close as a blade. NO ELECTRIC RAZOR WILL CUT AS CLOSE AS A BLADE! But this one is real close, if you work at it a bit. The first time over my legs I used a light touch and it left a bit of stubble. So I went over it again, slowly and experimenting with pressure and direction to see how close of a shave I could get. While it does not feel baby butt smooth it did a real good job. I have only used this dry and I will update once I use it wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: It comes apart for easy cleaning and future replacement of blades. Can be used wet. Until I started looking for this razor I did not know there was such a thing as a wet use electric razor, YEA! The charger sits nicely on the counter with the extension cord I bought for it, but even if I did not have the cord, the unit snaps securely in the charger and dose not fall out unless you were to knock it onto something. It lightweight and easy to use. I do not understand peoples complaints about the buttons, they have a little locking button to push before sliding it up and the design of the unit would make them very difficult to break them off. The Pivoting head makes it easier to reach those annoying areas (like under the knees.) [When using a blade you have to keep it at a constant angle to not cut yourself.] Comes with a bikini attachment (I have yet to try,) and nice clear plastic cover to protect the heads from dust and other things. It has the \\&quot;GOOD HOUSEKEEPING\\&quot; seal of approval on it. I am NOT spending $15 on my replacement blades every few months which sometimes end up rusty in my shower. I do NOT have to shave in the tub doing acrobatics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another PRO: I was able to purchase an extended warranty for two years for an additional nine dollars. For me, it is well worth paying that little extra for when unknown problems arise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: UM... It was not FREE! (But then if it were, I doubt it would be as good of a product.) It did not come with any sort of way to keep all the components together when not in use, but that is an easy fix I will go get a little makeup bag to store it in....PROBLEM SOLVED :&amp;lt;) It does seem a bit rough on the skin, but nothing major. It may be a problem if you have super sensitive skin, but I have a skin which is a little sensitive and I did not notice any adverse effects from using it. This also could be from my inexperience of using an electric razor. ITS PINK!!!! Well, more of a pink purple, but still very pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in All, I fully recommend this electric razor to anyone who needs an inexpensive decent razor to use, UNLESS you want want a shave that works like a blade, then I recommend that you save your money and stick with blades. For anyone wanting a CLOSER shave, there are the masochistic epilators, or the one shaver which actually burns and removes the hair (for three easy payments of $$$...AS SEEN ON TV... What ever brand that is), or laser removal. Anyway, it works for my needs, and it is a KEEPER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck.he masochistic epilators, or the one shaver which actually burns and removes the hair (for three easy payments of $$$...AS SEEN ON TV...

            <li> Purchased this razor for my 10 year old daughter because she kept cutting herself in the shower.(Shaving against my will....) anyway I thought to keep from cutting herself I purchased an electric razor for her. Received the razor very quickly, was very easy to use &amp; gives a very close cut. She loves it. I would highly recommend this razor to beginners or anyone that has been shaving for years.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this shaver for a camping trip knowing I would not have access to a shower for several days. I have own Panasonic shavers before and it is great to have as a backup or when you just need a quick shave. This is a very nice razor and I love that it is flexible. It shaves as close as any other electric razor I have seen but don&#x27;t expect it to be the same as a blade. I don&#x27;t usually use it in the shower and think it just great dry. The great thing is that the charge holds for a long time and it never cuts skin. My teenage daughter borrowed it as well and we both thought it was good. I would definitely recommend this shaver and for the price, it is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Wet/Dry electric shaver is excellent.  Great product for the price.  Would definetly recommend purchasing this product.  Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with my Panasonic Close Curves Shaver. Its comfortable to hold making it easy to use as well as convenient being cordless. I have a nice close shave when finished without all the nicks.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my 11 yr. old daughter who began shaving her legs several months ago. Razors intimidated her and made her nervous. The shaver has performed wonderfully and she loves it! It is easy to hold and use, it is not slippery at all. She has not used it in the shower but there is no reason to think it would not perform well there, too.  2 thumbs up!!  Great product for the price. (and what girl wouldn&#x27;t like the pink one! mine did.)</li>
            <li> Wife says it does a good job, but is somewhat tedious to clean, due to the \\&quot;articulating\\&quot; head.&lt;br /&gt;More serious of an issue is the \\&quot;recharge\\&quot; docking device. Two things noted: One, the unit does not&lt;br /&gt;have a power cord; it has two prongs that need to be slipped directly into a wall socket, or,&lt;br /&gt;if desired, plugged into an extension cord. The combined weight of both the shaver and the recharger is such that&lt;br /&gt;it takes a very tight fitting wall socket to keep the unit plugged in. Her previous unit had a counter-top recharge&lt;br /&gt;unit with a short cord allowing it to be set on the vanity while being plugged into the wall. The second issue, is the fit of the&lt;br /&gt;shaver into the recharge unit is such that it requires \\&quot;fiddling\\&quot; to set it in place--especially if the unit is plugged into the wall while trying to reinsert the shaver. In short, Panasonic needs to redesign the charger base.</li>
            <li> This is my second electric razor. I&#x27;m very pleased with how comfortable the shave is from this razor. It cuts close and smooth. This is a great improvement over my first razor.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the money. I got a cleaner and faster shave from using non-electric things like mach3 or tracer razors.</li>
            <li> Very satisfying purchase experience!</li>
            <li> Pre cutting blade does not cut well, had to trim down for close shave</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this electric shaver.  My legs react badly to regular manual razors, so I needed something new.  I had gotten a Remmington when I first went to college, but was never very pleased with the results - did not hold a charge long enough, gave me lots of nicks and abrasions, especially at the back of the knee - but it&#x27;s possible it was just a faulty device because it finally just stopped working.  I&#x27;ve been using my new Panasonic for a few weeks now and have no complaints.  It hold its charge for a few shaves and has not nicked me yet!  If you are looking to switch over to an electric shaver from a razor, you will be disappointed by the results because electric shavers just cannot physically shave as closely, but a few minutes with this shaver every day gives a good enough shave for me.</li>
            <li> I am quite impressed with this razor and the quality of the workmanship of it. It does exactly what the manufacturer claims which is very refreshing. My hair is course and due to this I&#x27;ve not had much success with electric razors in the past so I was not really expecting much from this device. Yet it has worked great. The battery holds a charge well and it is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Terrible shaver! Feels cheap, doesn&#x27;t shave well. The head falls apart during cleaning and the mechanism to move one of the blades up broke after two weeks of use. I know, it sounds as if I was a shaver abuser but trust me, things in my hands usually last years, this one is just GARBAGE! About positive reviews....Panasonic must have own people writing them....I just can&#x27;t imagine anybody liking this shaver.</li>
            <li> I chose this razor based on the reviews.  I agree that it has a very close shave.  The end result is similar to what a manual razor can accomplish.  I really like the charging station.  My last razor had to sit on the counter (taking up room) and had such a long cord with it between the charger and the plug.  This one sits neatly on the charger base, which plugs right into the wall.  I tried out the razor in the shower the other day with shaving lather and it still worked well.  It was a good purchase-thanks for the reviews!</li>
            <li> Very nice razor, I bought it for the wife.The she likes to use it on her legs in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the shower occasionally. Use it either wet or dry, damp does not work well. Flip the clipper blade up and turn the razor so the heads are following the clipper and you can knock down a 4 day beard in the shower in nothing flat. It gives a nice clean shave on a mans beard. Pop the head off and rinse under the shower head.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;m in college and it&#x27;s hard to shave in college (community) showers. Basically I needed a shaver that I could use outside of the shower. Well this shaver did not meet my expectations. First of all the battery was horrible. It could not keep a charge longer than five minutes even when I charged it for 12 hours (according to the recommendation in the product manual). Secondly it did not shave close enough. I had to go over most areas multiple times. After a more than a week of using this shaver I sent it back to Amazon for a refund.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this purchase. I honestly thought I&#x27;d use it a couple of times and never touch it again... But it hasn&#x27;t been the case at all. It works so well, I use only it now.</li>
            <li> replaced an older Panasonic ladies shaver that I had had for 20 years, but should have replaced sooner.  Good shaver, much quieter then the other one was.  As someone else has pointed out the plastic tabs that holds the blades are raised up more than the blades are.  This can cause red lines on your legs.  I usually use it on the bikini line and underarms only so not really a problem for me.  I use mine in the shower daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really impressed with this shaver. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and it works like a charm.  What I like about it is that I get a very good shave, but don&#x27;t have to go through all of the fuss of using shaving cream and razors.  Now, no electric shaver will cut as close as a blade, but this comes pretty close. I also like it b/c I travel a lot, and the shaver is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> It was about what I expected. Does a decent shave job, nowhere near a razor&#x27;s closeness, but when I don&#x27;t want to stand in the shower for 30 minutes, this shaver is good. The little pop up trimmer works as described, even works when its not popped up - went to clean it and noticed it had a collection of hair there even though I&#x27;d not used it. Haven&#x27;t had any skin issues like some reviewers. I&#x27;m fair skinned/dry/light colored hair - sometimes I do have to run it over the same area a few times to make sure everything is taken down as far as possible, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting any different. Will use my razor for special occasions. Have yet to even attempt under the arms... May not, want to avoid any pain if at all possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HATE the bikini trimmer. Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t really expect to use it - I have another little trimmer for that stuff. I did give it a try though and its bulky as all get-out. And honestly, even at the &#x27;1&#x27; setting, since it still has the mesh cover on, it didn&#x27;t cut anything. Its like using a &#x27;3&#x27; or &#x27;4&#x27; on the smaller trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a portable, rechargeable (haven&#x27;t had it die on me yet), decent shaver - go for this one. If you want uber smooth legs... razors or wax are still better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;Tried it in the shower with wet legs... Really didn&#x27;t work for me. Skittered and skipped all over my skin, without trimming anything. I&#x27;ll reserve this for dry use.</li>
            <li> This shaver works so so. But I have never used other electric shavers before, so I have nothing to compare with. The cut is not too close. The skin still feels rough afterwards. I use it in the shower. The mainternance is easy. It is easy to clean. I expected better performance from Panasonic than this though. I kept it anyway because I won&#x27;t cut myself with it.</li>
            <li> It looked a little junky when it came but I decided to give it a shot. The charger is great, it takes up as little space as possible which is a major plus in my book. The comb attachment is going straight into the trash because it just leaves hairs too long, but heres the greatest part: I got it mainly for my bikini area and was a little afraid that the trimmer blades would nick me as my old shaver did but they didn&#x27;t!! Not even a pinch when I held it to my skin, it resulted in a close shave without any razor burn or irritation whatsoever. Love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it wet, in fact the instructions say to run it under water to clean it. Great little machine at a great price!</li>
            <li> We began full-time RV living several months ago and limited shower space is a fact of life now. Using shave cream and razor can be a hassle so I tried this Panasonic wet/dry rechargeable shaver hoping to make life a bit easier. I have not been disappointed. This product holds a charge and is easy to use and clean. I can&#x27;t say it shaves as close as a Mach III blade, but it gets the job done with ease.</li>
            <li> It looks like it would do a good job, but it does not do a good job.  I will only work on very fine hair, like hair that has never been cut before.</li>
            <li> This was a present for my wife. I made points. She says it is comfortable to use and performs very well. She really likes the cordless feature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to review it but I can&#x27;t use it! I wrongly assumed that as it was sent to Australia It would be Auto Voltage 100-240. End of Story!</li>
            <li> I picked this one cause of the good reviews. It does a good job shaving if you press hard. I don&#x27;t recommend shaving before a shower cause the cutter things on the edge scratch really hard resulting in sensitive skin so it stings in the shower.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas present for my wife.  Her long-time favorite electric shaver, a version of the Norelco LadyShave, has been discontinued and hers is no longer holding a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says this Panasonic is the best she has ever had.  Comfortable, close shave, quiet, not a lot of vibration, and quick.  Believe me, she has tried just about all brands on the market over the years.  Most she has abandoned within a few weeks, they are so awful in terms of performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We just bought two more for her as \\&quot;spares\\&quot; in case this gets discontinued in the next few years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Never really got a close shave but I suppose good enough. I did use it in the shower and it held up fine.</li>
            <li> With respect to delivery it was timely and accurate.  Description of the product was accurate and works as described.  To charge, you snap it into a charger at the bottom, and then plug into the wall.  It needs to be vertical, so you need an outlet that is vertical rather than horizontal.&lt;br /&gt;I have never used an electric shaver before so was a little tentative, especially about using it in the shower and getting it wet, but I read all the directions and now that I have used it a few times, I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it and it works great.  For legs it shaves as close as a non-electric razor, but harder to do that with underarms.  You can rinse it after a few strokes just like a regular razor, but the best way is to remove the top to rinse so that&#x27;s an extra step - but guessing that&#x27;s the same with all electrics.  It fits comfortably in my hand and is not too heavy.  I love that I can use it in the shower.  Good choice all around.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly impressed with the Panasonic Wed/Dry shaver. Underarm and bikini shaving is super close without causing razorburn, easy for beach days that I just need a touch-up. Ideally, the reason I purchased this is that the cost of blades for Venus and Gilette shavers has skyrocketed, and even shopping at Costco anymore has become super pricey for replacement blades. When I want a fabulous shave for my legs, I&#x27;ll still use the Mach 5, but for everyday shaving, I like this product for it&#x27;s versatility in and out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star deduction for the awkward plug/charger along with the battery life. It certainly does not last for 12 days on one charge, so I suppose if that expectation were lowered, I would not have been disappointed. Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is the first Panasonic electric shaver I have ever owned; and, it&#x27;s great.  It gives me a nice, smooth shave and is comfortable \\&quot;sitting\\&quot; in my hand.  I haven&#x27;t tried using it in the shower; so, can&#x27;t comment on that; however, compared with previous electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned, it is definitely a big improvement.</li>
            <li> Its gives nice clean shave, I have used remington shaver before, but this one is much better. The only problem is replacing the parts for this shaver is expensive.</li>
            <li> Shaver works as good as I expect for an electric shaver.  There are certainly other methods to get better results, but this shaver is perfect for a quick and easy touch up!</li>
            <li> close shave, keeps a good charge. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love it.  The wide head makes it easy to get a close shave.  And it&#x27;s nice to not need to sit beside an electrical outlet to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor in May and didn&#x27;t try it out until June.  It did not work well when I used it dry so tried it in shower last week and it wasn&#x27;t any better.  I go to water aerobics at least twice a week and shave often so thought this razor would be very handy.  I wish now that I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to use it because I would have returned it.  Now I have put it in a drawer and will most likely throw it in trash in a couple years.  What a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Recently had hip replacement surgery.  It is a challenge to shave my legs but this shaver has a nice long handle and pivotal head that allows me to do just that without breaking the precautions that I have due to the surgery.  It does a great job, giving a close shave.  I use it mostly dry but have used it wet as well, with equally good results. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great service.  Although we did not need the item and returned, the service was great and we were refunded for the product very quickly.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!! This is the second time within 6 months that I have bought this product, only to have it fail after the 30-day return window. I am extremely disappointed. When the first shaver, purchased last December, failed to come on--for no evident reason--I called Panasonic customer care. What a waste of time! Their only solution was to package and ship the item to their Texas location, where it would be examined and repaired if possible, or replaced by a new shaver. Besides the time factor--sending it and waiting to get it back would take 10-14 days--it would cost me $27. For a $29 purchase, this clearly was not an option... so I bought another one. Same thing happened with the second one. All I can say is I will never buy a small device like this on-line, because there is no \\&quot;store\\&quot; I can take it to physically.</li>
            <li> Ive used ladies electric shavers all my life. I expected this product to be one of the best since its from the reputable panasonic brand. However Im disappointed. It does the job but have to run it several times plus it gives me ingrowths. I used a cheaper conair shaver where the blades were sharper &amp; gave me a much closer shave, almost like the razor and never had ingrowths either. I wouldnt buy another panasonic shaver again in a hurry.</li>
            <li> The bikini shaver pulls hairs out and causes hair follicle cysts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not have any closer of a shave than the other electrics I have used.</li>
            <li> i was not expecting much from this shaver because the last time i tried an electric shaver, it was crap. that was a long time ago and it seems they&#x27;ve improved greatly since then. this shaver is fantastic. granted, if you expect it to shave as closely as a regular razor then you will be disappointed but i love using this for those days when i just don&#x27;t feel like shaving. i get a pretty close shave with it. it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have only had this razor for a month and a half and have only used it several times. After charging overnight it would not turn out. Totally dead. Really?? And of course my return date has expired. I would not recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver for about a month now.  Overall, I like it.  It shaves pretty close and I don&#x27;t have the skin irritation I had with non-electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Great product, after using other electric shavers this one is the best.close shaves and no nicks or pulling would recommend this to eveyone with sensitive skin!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this shaver.  It&#x27;s very gentle, as promised.  I ran into a problem when I tried to give it a Spring Cleaning.  I am used to being able to take shavers apart to clean them and then put them back together.  I ran into a problem with this shaver.  I had a hard time getting the foils back in straight, and two tiny metal pieces popped out from a crevice behind the foils.  I never did get the two pieces to go back in.  The foils are no longer evenly spaced, but the shaver works as well as ever, so I guess it&#x27;s okay.  I will be hesitant to take it apart to clean it again, even so.</li>
            <li> Shopped womens razors till I dropped.  My wife loved it, first time&lt;br /&gt;it gave her a great shave.  She/I would definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the battery in this razor died in a little over a year,</li>
            <li> So glad I found this wet/dry ladies shaver, no more razor, no more wasting money buying razor refill.&lt;br /&gt;I just got it in the mail today and tried it on my leg and then used it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;It is so good, easy to clean and store.&lt;br /&gt;No wonder 285 5-star reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> As far as electronic shavers go, they are never as good as regular blade razors. However this Panasonic is the best I&#x27;ve tried. It definitely still leaves a small stubble, but if you are looking for something electronic for safety or what not, this is definitely the best choice in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Did not work very well back to my regular razor</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this products</li>
            <li> great.. my wife loves it,</li>
            <li> I have tried Panasonic, Remington, Revlon, and even the hair buffers.  I haven&#x27;t found ANY brand that compares to Panasonic.  These shavers last.  The first Panasonic I had lasted 6 years, and finally the metal hair cutters broke.  I could have just bought a replacement top, but instead bought a new shaver and tried many other brands.  All of the other shavers (up to $75) pulled hairs, left hair, couldn&#x27;t take a charge, or had no power.  This is now the 2nd Panasonic I&#x27;ve had and it&#x27;s just as good as my first.  They don&#x27;t pull hairs, great power, good charge, and the price is always low.  I will never buy a different brand, or try another expensive brand.  I love these shavers.</li>
            <li> I have found this to be an excellent choice.  It gets the job done and was inexpensive, too.  I don&#x27;t think anyone can ask for more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this razor so far. It is a fairly close shave on the legs (not totally smooth but no visible hairs). The underarm leaves something to be desired, but its not a deal breaker. Quite pleased with it for the price.</li>
            <li> The closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for an old Remington soft and silky because I could no longer find a replacement head for it. This was highly rated so I bought it. The first time I used it, I just as well have used a dull blade. I used it dry because that&#x27;s what I want it for and it was awful. I couldn&#x27;t shave my legs for days until they healed up. I tried again and got the same. It might work better if used it wet with shaving gel or something but I don&#x27;t want that. It is useless to me. Now I&#x27;m looking for an adequate replacement for my old Remington 5000 which still works, by the way, but is getting a little dull so it takes me longer to shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I broke both my ankles and my foot. I was not able to shower and shave with a blade because I could not get my feet wet. I love this shaver - it works far better than I thought an electric one would. I will continue to use it even when I can shower. It will be especially nice when we are traveling in our RV where the shower is so small it is hard to shave with a blade. I thought an electric razor would be a poor alternative, but a necessary one because of my condition. It turned out to be a great alternative and even after my feet are healed I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Wife likes it, works great</li>
            <li> Bought as a present for my wife. She likes it but shes fast with a standard/manual razor and doesnt have the patience to work with the electric one. This product still worked well, just has a learning curve if you have never used an electric.</li>
            <li> Just bought one of these for my wife who used it tonight. It really shaved well, as soon as I got home I investigated further. It did a great job. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> PANASONIC ES2216 PC.  I BOUGHT ONE FOR MYSELF AND ONE FOR A DISABLED FRIEND.  WE BOTH LOVE THEM.  GREAT PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> Works great on short hair, but when used on hair a little longer (1/2&amp;#34; or so) it pulls them and that hurts!!</li>
            <li> As far as electronic razors go, this is the best I have ever used.  However, I still prefer the closeness of a regular razor blade.  The flexibility of the head is very nice and the handle feels ergonomically designed.  I would prefer a closer shave. I am still getting accustomed to using the electric razor.</li>
            <li> i must say i just used this shaver for the first time and i have never been so impressed..i didnt even have to go over the same area twice. gets the hair off so close..I LOVE THIS SHAVER...</li>
            <li> My Situation:&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and I like a close shave. Razor burn is very common when I use a razor blade however I am fortunate to not have many ingrown hairs. Also, when I use a electric razor I usually use it dry so my review will reflect a dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;My Story:&lt;br /&gt;I came from a remington WDF3500 razor and I liked it but when it was dead one day, I reached for my boyfriends electric razor. WOW! It was such a close shave... Way closer than my remington. It was at that moment I realized that I had to upgrade. I started looking around and after reading the reviews on this razor, I decided to try it. Well I Love it! No razor burn, no irritated skin, and best of all a really close shave. The bikini attachment and the pop up trimmer work great. Clean up is really easy as well. Just a little hand soap directly on the foils, rub it in, and turn the razor on and its clean. Rinse and your done! Clean up takes me about 1 minute. NO EXAGGERATION! The only thing that could have been better (and the main reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars) is the charging method. It is rechargeable witch is awesome but (and this is kinda hard to explain) the plug is the charger. It is NOT a doc with a cord. Its a cool idea but my setup could have used a doc to charge the razor. All in all this razor is great! If your thinking about upgrading an old razor or looking to start out this is the one for you! Hope it helped</li>
            <li> Poor shave. Pinches my skin. Not a close shave. Long hair cutter doesn&#x27;t cut well either. Avoid this one unless you want razor burns.</li>
            <li> This is a light, although somewhat delicate, instrument that does what it is supposed to.  It charges directly into the wall plug, which eliminates having a dangling cord.&lt;br /&gt;It would be easy to break the shaver or the recharge unit, especially while it is charging.</li>
            <li> Received this product.  Two weeks later cleaned it with the brush provided.  started making a horrible sound, metal piece on front fell off and not does not remove the hair.  Have had electric razors all my life and this is the worse.  Cost more to replace the head than buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this product several times now and am extremely happy with it.  It gives a close shave, easy to handle, and great in the shower. Set back on the recharger when done. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a reasonably priced, nice looking, and effective shaver.</li>
            <li> My razor came when promised, it charged quickly, and does a really nice job!! I would definitely recommend this .</li>
            <li> My current wet/dry electric shaver finally died after many years of use.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what brand I wanted and once again went to Amazon.com (best prices and best testimonials).  Based on the many great reviews of the Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver with Bikini Attachment, I decided to purchase this shaver and boy am I glad I did.  This is the best shaver ever!  To be honest, you can never get as close a shave as a regular shaver using a gel, bath soap or moisturizer but this certainly gives you a VERY CLOSE SHAVE.  It also stunts the growth so you don&#x27;t need to shave as often (at least in my oppinion).  The convenience of availability when needed (it keeps a charge for long periods) and the pivoting head are great features.  As you can tell, I am one happy camper.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product often enough or owned it long enough yet, but, thus far, it has provided a good, close shave, and i have no complaints. it arrived a day early.</li>
            <li> bought the panasonic shaver after buying (and returning) another brand&#x27;s shaver, which never did start...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the panasonic works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This Panasonic women&#x27;s shaver is a great buy. It shaves very close for an electric shaver, and the design makes it easy to use. Just a light touch along the skin is all that&#x27;s needed for a close shave. It is easy to charge and clean. I have not tried it as a wet shaver, only dry shaving.</li>
            <li> best i have used. glad i read all the good reviews. i agree with all. great product. highly recommend. try it</li>
            <li> Bought for my 12 year old daughter, as she was taking 30 minutes to just shave her legs every time. She&#x27;s very happy with it so far. Uses it dry and it is quick and easy, and gives a pretty good shave, according to her. She now only takes around 5-10 minutes to shave her legs, which makes us all a lot happier. Only negative that we can tell is that when you charge the unit, there is only an indicator light that it is charging, and it does not show an indicator light when the charging is complete. Otherwise, very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> This was easier to use than I expected.  The long hair attachment worked well. I have been undergoing chemotherapy for the past 18 months and lost the hair on my head twice but never the hair on my legs.  We are not allowed to use a plain razor so this product was a welcome addition to my toiletries ! I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Read over reviews for this and other womens and mens electric razors. This one was in the right price range, had good reviews and didn&#x27;t have a whole of extra fancy nonsense. I realize that you&#x27;re not going to get the same kind of shave as a regular razor, but as someone who has extra sensitive skin everywhere, my time of using good old razors is at an end, particularly with summer approaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping, fast charging and wet/dry shave almost as close as a blade? Yup, this thing is great, and no bumps or \\&quot;owies\\&quot;. It&#x27;s easy to clean, and I expect to have it deliver a super sharp shave for at least a year. I got what I expected, and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that it didn&#x27;t exceed my expectations, but did meet them satisfactorily.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver after trying the [[ASIN:B001IZZX1C Cleancut ES412 Personal Shaver]](also from Amazon).  The cleancut did an amazing job of the very intimate brazilian-type shave, but couldn&#x27;t touch the flat-laying outer hair.  Plus, it took loads of battery, and was not large enough to shave anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic fit my needs perfectly.  It does not produce a baby-smooth finish, but like many people have said you&#x27;ll get a result which is like about 12-24 hours after a razor shave. I only need to shave about every 3 days. I use it to maintain a complete Brazilian shave, and it does not pull or pinch, and I have never had a cut.  It also does a great job of underarms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it wet with lather and dry.  I find I prefer the dry!  The wet/lather actually seemed to leave the hairs longer, plus there was water streaming everywhere making it harder to see.  Also, hot water makes your skin swell slightly, so after you cool off the hair sticks out farther than at the time of shaving.  Dry shaving is a breeze.  If I am damp (after a shower, for instance) I followed the advice given for the Cleancut and dust with baby powder.  I do not know if this will affect the sharpness of the blades or not.  YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the plug - it is a square base which plugs directly into the socket, and the shaver stands up on it.  Exactly like in the picture, with about a 1.5\\&quot; box below it.  This works perfectly if you have a modern vanity arrangement in your bathroom, with a plug above the sink.  You may find this inconvenient if you only have floor-height plugs to work with, or if you have children who can access those plugs, or if you want to put it behind a dresser, etc.  An optional \\&quot;extension cord\\&quot; for those situations would be a great benefit (ATTN: Panasonic!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will continue to use this product, and will most likely not find a need for a blade-razor again!!</li>
            <li> This product was great for the first few months. It gave a nice close shave when used dry, and the bikini-attachment worked well for a nice short trim. I was diligent to clean the shaver as directed after each use, and to keep the protective plastic cap on. Still, after several months (no more than 4), the shaver became unbearably painful to use and eventually it became clear that a part was broken (bent wire sticking out and fell off - not good). I looked for a replacement part, but it was just as expensive to replace the part as it was to just buy an entirely new shaver. So I did - I bought the same shaver again, thinking that whatever broke was just a fluke and that the new shaver would be just as wonderful as it had been for the first few months. To much frustration, the new shaver did the same thing! It became painful to use, where it had previously been completely painless. The new one broke even quicker than the first, lasting only 1-2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be making the mistake of buying this shaver again, no matter HOW good it was in the beginning. I&#x27;d like a shaver that would at least be reliable for a year, preferably more! I would not recommend this product to anyone, unless you don&#x27;t mind buying a new one every few months.</li>
            <li> Someone else said this too, buy the men&#x27;s version it&#x27;s sooooo much better.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as a first razor. Since the idea of giving her a razor with actual blades was inconceivable, this razor was considered one of the best out there.  It has not let us down. My daughter loves how easy it is to use and it does give her a close shave. I may even have to borrow it too! I would definitely suggest this to friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this half a year ago. It works at the first few times, but not as clean as the straight razor. After a few month, it fails. Really bad quality!</li>
            <li> I received the item in one day which was so very fast.  Have only had it two days, but on the first day I used it dry and it worked well.  But then I used it in the shower and that was really nice.  Just had a little soap on my skin and I feel that I got a really nice, pretty close shave.  It worked just fine for me.  I am finding I would rather use this over a razor blade any day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot speak to the longevity yet, but the blades do a nice job and I am so very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very bad that power adapter for this model only 110V. My wife  can&#x27;t use it in Europe. Only for US use.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative.  Not as close of a shave but less waste in our landfills and can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> CHEAP and INFERIOR NOT WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> worked well, but stopped charging almost 2 years ago</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor before, so I have no comparison, but so far I am pleased. It is easy to clean, reasonably quiet, and gives a closer shave than I expected, given that I have only used it dry and using shaving gel and water is recommended for the best results.</li>
            <li> I bought my wife her first electric razor about 8 years ago.  She&#x27;s gone through three since then.  Her favorite used a chemical solution to rinse out the razor, but sadly, it only lasted 1 1/2 years before failing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor was a Christmas &#x27;10 present, and it&#x27;s BY FAR her favorite razor ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes that it can be used in the shower, and that it can be cleaned with tap water.  The power plug is something I&#x27;ve never seen before.  The &#x27;boxy&#x27; part plugs in to the wall (like normal), but instead of running a cord to the razor, the razor snaps in to the top of the plug itself.  It keeps it out of the way, but still handy.  It&#x27;s a huge space-savings over the other alcohol-rinse system that she had previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the best part - she&#x27;s happy with the way that it shaves. And so am I ;)  !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it ever dies, I would buy another one.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I got this in time from amazon.This works great, but need to be careful with handling, if it falls, it won&#x27;t work as expected.The blades seem to run but they don&#x27;t do the job.&lt;br /&gt;But in all works nice, the battery seem to work for 45 min at one go.</li>
            <li> Even thought this product got so many good reviews...it did not work for me. After few months of using it rarely (i don&#x27;t have much hair on my legs or bikini line) it wouldn&#x27;t shave off my hair at all... I made sure it&#x27;s fully charged and all it would do it would actually pull my hair but not shave it at all even though I&#x27;d run it multiple times over one area of my leg...Very disappointing. I thought it was the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever had (the brand I always used before was a basic model of Braun shaver). Panasonic ES2216PC was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product. I don&#x27;t use it in the shower but just when I am sitting around. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a regular razor but it is more convenient. I would recomment this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I previously wrote a review for this shaver saying that it did not get a close enough shave, in comparison to my Remington. I take that back. Yes, the Remington shavers do get a closer shave, but at the expense of irritated skin/razor burn. You can run this along your underarms no problem, and you will not get razor burn. You can basically use it anywhere and it will be fine. This is an excellent product. I actually purchased a second one after the motor on my first one died out from daily usage.</li>
            <li> Works good on short or fine hair but not that great on course or longer hair.</li>
            <li> Plug it in overnight and voila, it works like a charm.  The charger conveniently fits into the power outlet vertical or horizontal, which is great if you (like me) have sideways outlets.  In use, shaves off the hair perfectly, without the hassle of razor burn :)</li>
            <li> This shaver is not great but it&#x27;s ok when you don&#x27;t have a lot of time. I like that you can use it in the shower. It&#x27;s also easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a traditional razor without serious razor burn no matter what brand of razor, type of blade, variety of shaving cream, etc.  So i had been using my husband&#x27;s norelco electric razor.  Finally he got sick of me using his and told me to get my own. :p  This one had good reviews on Consumer Reports, so I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a spectacular job on my pits.  No nicks or cuts, no discomfort and it does a great job of getting the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had as much success with my legs.  I prefer to shave dry with electrics so that&#x27;s what I tried first.  No matter how many times I went over the hair, I still had stubble. I had better luck when i tried it in the shower with shaving cream, but it was still just so-so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was tempted to return it, but I don&#x27;t think my pits have ever been so happy, so I&#x27;m keeping it.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Remington it replaced.</li>
            <li> I never intended to become a razor tester, but for some inexplicable reason Amazon will not send rechargable razors to Hawaii.  At something of a loss (because inventory is slim and dramatically over-priced locally) I bought the [[ASIN:B002HWS4R0 Clio Designs Palmperfect Electric Shaver in Patterns, 1 Shaver]] which is hands-down the worst electric razor I have ever used, more of a toy than a \\&quot;personal care\\&quot; item.  Up to this point I have had exceptional experience with Panasonic products, and have, in other reviews, lauded their cameras and Men&#x27;s razor, pointing to this item as a better option than the Clio based on the reviews on this site (and having owned an earlier model in this line).  Now that I own one (which I had to procure elseplace :(  ) my opinion is much revised.  While this is clearly better than the Clio (that is not saying much.  It&#x27;s the easy-bake oven of razors) it does not hold a candle to either the [[ASIN:B0015MKZZ2 2in1 Smooth&amp;Silky Women&#x27;s shav]] or the panasonic men&#x27;s [[ASIN:B005DKKBP6 Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc 5 Multi Flex Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Black]]  Granted there is a large price difference (between the Men&#x27;s exceptional razor and the women&#x27;s mediocre one) but this razor didn&#x27;t perform an awful lot better than the toy.  It still took me 2 passes to get a reasonably clean shave, and was not especially smooth or comfortable.  To me comfort and safety are very important, as is getting a close shave (it is relatively simple and cheap to get one without the other).  In this respect, the Pansonic fell down on the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did not care for the set-up.  It has a small footprint, making it better for travel than most, BUT I use it primarily at home (and would think that most other people do as well).  instead of something like a dock, which most rechargeable razors (both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s) have, this razor snaps on to a tiny plug which hangs awkwardly, precipitously off the wall.  It did stay in place, but it blocks use of the other plug and is somewhat awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would  *maybe* recommend this as a travel razor.  It is better than the Clio, but still bulkier than a disposable blade razor, and not as close.  It is, however, safer than a blade, so if you are willing to carry a certain amount of weight and bulk, this might be the answer. (but, honestly it is not much smaller or lighter than other electric razors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up to this point I have been very happy with all the Panasonic products I purchased.  This one is enough of a disappointment that I am about to purchase my third electric razor in less than a month :( and this time I will stick with the one I know: Remington!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On second thought, I realized that I have been a bit harsh (on the brand).  This particular razor was a disappointment, but I had another from this line a year or two ago and was happy with it (else I would not have pointed to it in another razor review).  I can not comment on the others in the line at the moment as they are out of reach to me (Amazon won&#x27;t mail them here; local stores don&#x27;t carry them and I have not found anyone else mailing these to Hawaii).  It is possible, probably even that they have maintained the quality but not being able to get my hands on one it would not be fair of me to comment either way.  I will just note that this particular razor is the low end of the line and the others are likely better.  I just could not get one.e, but it blocks use of the other plug and is somewhat awkward.

            <li> Great shaver....very nice design and very gentle to use...</li>
            <li> It does a good job for me - but I&#x27;ve only used it in the dry mode.  Much better than my last electric razor.</li>
            <li> This barely even removes hair and pulls and snags on any you have. I thought I&#x27;d have less nicks with this but actually it gave me some really deep cuts. It also takes forever to use because you have to go over the same spot again and again. Additionally, it gave me razor burn. Definitely don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Like all electric shavers I&#x27;ve ever tried, this is not going to shave as closely as a standard razor. That said, I think this product is great for quick and convenient shaves out of the shower. I was also impressed with the battery life. I took this on a 14 day vacation and was worried because I forgot the charger. Turns out I didn&#x27;t have to worry - it lasted the entire time!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor, so I have nothing to compare it to.  I&#x27;m very happy with the way it shaves.  The head is flexible so it moves with the curves.  I like the way it comes apart so that it can be cleaned.  It has an extension blade to shave longer hair and it has not pinched or cut me, but I am careful.  I have not used this in a wet situation. I received this item sealed packed with a charger and razor cap.  there way also another hair cutting adapter that I will probably never use. The only thing I wish it would of had come with was a brush to clean the blades out.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed. It barely cuts hair and I purposely didn&#x27;t shave for a while just so I could see the different but nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. It was a waste of money trust me....&lt;br /&gt;The bikini trimmer doesn&#x27;t even work right.&lt;br /&gt;I got a closer and better shaver with my boyfriends electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
            <li> Overall, great shaver for the price but one drawback.  PROS: smooth, comfortable shave.  Long lasting battery charge.  Love the pop-up trimmer. No nicks, cuts or burns.  Pivoting head is fantastic for bikini area and lower--can get all the nooks and crannies.  Ergonomic handle easy to grip in shower.  ONE BIG CON:  not durable!  One drop in the shower and it&#x27;s toast.  I haven&#x27;t had one of these last longer than 6 months.  But, I&#x27;ve tried all the other brands, and no other comes close to the shave quality and comfort of this shaver for sensitive areas.  So for around $30 a pop I have to replace it 2-3 times per year--but many other shavers are $90+ each, so I suppose that expense isn&#x27;t bad.  Just inconvenient to have to go without shaving a couple days until I buy my next replacement.</li>
            <li> This was the second shaver I tried (first one was not Panasonic) so was not optimistic. Totally surprised at how well it works in the shower with shave gel as well as dry. Close shave and so much faster for daily touch ups. I also like that it plugs directly into outlet so doesn&#x27;t take up space on the vanity.</li>
            <li> it did not contain a manual  other wis it is fine.</li>
            <li> i bought the wahl shaver, mainly because of the brand name.  If you get a \\&quot;wahl\\&quot;, you can&#x27;t go wrong. Right?  Well, it wasn&#x27;t a bad investment, but compared to this Panasonic? i wondered, wow, where was this shaver when i needed it the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Beret leaves light skin scratches behind and at least 1/8\\&quot; stubble behind when shaving the legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic left absolutely nothing.  A close smooth shave, looked like a good wax job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beret looses it charge quickly, and over time, it worsens.  When shaving in the private areas, where the hair is coarser?  It left behind raised stubble, and when the charge weakens, it snagged.  To the point that i finally threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Panasonic? I thought i had a bikini wax. It is a larger head piece, but because it pivots, you can make the curves.  Plus, because the hair grows in different directions/patterns, you have to work the shaver in the direction the hair grows. Once i figured this out, my shave was fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am very pleased not only with this purchase, but with the customer service of the seller as well!</li>
            <li> it dosent work at all...a total rip off</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a close shave with this shaver.  In fact I have to go over my legs twice to get to where I don&#x27;t feel razor stubble on my legs.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So far,  so good.  Just  could be a closer shave</li>
            <li> I have coarse, dark hair that grows quickly and fair skin, so I normally shave with a razor every other day.  I have never tried an electric shaver before.  I have only used the Panasonic shaver dry at this point.  It was easy to use and gave my legs the appearance of being shaven, but my legs still felt rough and stubbly.  It&#x27;s something I would use if I didn&#x27;t have time to shave with a razor before going to the gym, but not if I really wanted my legs to feel smooth. I tried the bikini attachment,and all it did was catch and pull the hair.  It did not cut it at all.  I would recommend this for people that don&#x27;t have coarse hair or for occasional use when appearance is all that matters.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this ladies shaver. I thought nothing would be good as a regular razor on my legs, but this one works just as well. I was amazed how smooth my legs felt after using this product. I also liked the fact that I could shave my legs before I got into the shower, which saves water.</li>
            <li> This shaver is worth every penny, it shaves clean and leaves your skin soft and smooth. I love the fact that it is wet/dry and each method performs beautifully. You will Not be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> The best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had in over 40 years!!!  I like the direct plug in recharger.  The floating head shaver does an excellent job on legs, around knees, etc.  Very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It does everything they said.</li>
            <li> This shaver was offered at great price through Amazon.  I like the pivoting shave head which makes shaving the knee area and underarms a breeze.</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for years now. This Panasonic Wed Dry Lady Shaver is by far the BEST shaver I have ever used!!! It is very gentle on my skin and I get the closest shave ever in just minutes. I always had to shave my pitts every day, with this shaver I only have to do them every other day. It is very comfortable to hold and use. Anyone considering an electric shaver I&#x27;m telling you this is the one to have, you will not be disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> This thing has very sharp blade, no accidentally pulling of hair. Howerver, charging it is a nightmare because there is no cord at all on the charger. It need to sit directly next to the power supply. Taking it in and out of charger is difficult since there is not much room near my power supply. Keeping it, due to its good price and blade but with a grudge...bah.</li>
            <li> Had it for about a month, so far so good</li>
            <li> this is a great addition to my personal collection of \\&quot;lady gadgets\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;prior to this i was always fighting with disposable shavers that never did the job right but since owning this- i am quite satisfied. it gives me the absolute best shave!!!!&lt;br /&gt;my skin silky smooth after a shave- i use no creams or lather of any sort and i opt for the \\&quot;dry shave\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;i have been using this shaver for approx 9 mths and have no complaints. i get at least two complete shaves before i have to recharge again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ladies- GET IT! YOU WONT REGRET IT :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(the only thing i wish was different was the charger- i wish it had an indicator for full charge instead of the fixed light that indicates &#x27;connected&#x27; :( )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Annie)</li>
            <li> Love this shaver. Very comfortable and leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that it gave a close shave. This is the first electric razor that I have ever brought. It holds a LONG charge. I am still using it from the first charge from when I purchased it. I just had the cleaning. I wish it were a wee bit easier. You have to take off the cover of the razor and use the mini brush that is provided to get in the nook and crannies after each use.</li>
            <li> Convenient. Not powerful but accessible. Charges quickly and holds the charge through an extensive shave. Item arrived quickly. Packaged extremely securely.</li>
            <li> I have never been a big fan of electric shavers for women, but the Panasonic ES2216PC is probably one of the best I have ever owned!  It actually gives you a nice, smooth shave.  I would recommend it for anyone who has been skeptical in the past to give it a try!</li>
            <li> Although this product is value priced delivers a very close shave, it broke in less than 6 months. I only used it about twice weekly. The trimmer wouldn&#x27;t slide out anymore, and was loosely held in a partially extended position. I was able to continue use for a short time like that, but then it started tearing my skin. Also, the charge held nicely when I first got it, but after a few months didn&#x27;t perform as well.&lt;br /&gt;This was actually my second try at this product -- the foil on the first one broke. I assume the break occurred while I was cleaning it or reattaching the head, although I am surprised since I feel like I handled the product reasonably.  Since I did like the close shave, I decided to order another and handle it extra gently.&lt;br /&gt;Since it was the trimmer that broke on the second, it was certainly not my fault.&lt;br /&gt;Both shavers wound up in the trash too quickly. Not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver a while ago, and I hardly use it.  I bought it to use on my legs and bikini area.  I liked that it could be used in the shower, but the battery does not hold a charge for too long - I have to keep it on the charger constantly.  It also does not shave as closely as I would like on my legs, but I do like the bikini attachment.  I still use it here and there, but it&#x27;s not my first choice for hair removal.</li>
            <li> Have only used this a few times, but working good so far! Was temporarily on blood thinners so could not use a razor and bought this to use during the interim. Think I will keep on using!</li>
            <li> This is my first ever wet/dry shaver so I don&#x27;t know if using one dry usually results in a faint stubble left behind, but that&#x27;s what I get.  Results improved with wet shave and shampoo.  Haven&#x27;t tried with cream.  Still, very convenient for when I just don&#x27;t feel like showering to shave.  Comb attachment does its job, too, though I noticed the pop-up blade sticks a little after a few uses.  Hard to work that with slippery hands.</li>
            <li> If you order this item, opt for the higher priced model, I wish I had. The shaver is more than adequate for the legs but not for underarm or other parts of the body. I would have exchanged it, but I threw away the packaging. I would not use the shaver without water and shaving foam, it&#x27;s too scratchy. However I do like how easy it is to recharge with no hanging cords. The charger is small and you just engage the shaver to it so that is also does not take up very much room, it is off the vanity right up next to the electrical plug. If one of my nieces takes it, I&#x27;ll order the higher priced model.</li>
            <li> I am in love, Love, LOVE with this Panasonic women&#x27;s shaver. It does exactly what I need it to do and works perfectly for me. I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to switch to an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this item 3 months back but I am not very satisfied. It smoothes the skin well but I noticed that my hair growth is more faster now.&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;pop up trimmer\\&quot; is no more poping up. So I&#x27;ll not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product--Very satisfied.  Will definitely purchase a Panasonic shaver for my personal use after the quality and performance of this ladies model.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the most comfortable razor I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and have never cut myself of gotten razor burn.  On the downside the shave isn&#x27;t the closest, but it is close enough if you shave often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to shave better dry than wet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is good.  It says it lasts for 7 shaves, but it really only lasts for 2 or 3 if you shave your entire legs twice, but this is longer than others I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviews that the design of the charger is absolutely terrible, but the razor itself is great.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE this shaver!  This is a great item to quickly take care of bikini areas or legs before heading to the beach.  It is very gentle to use, and the shave is not as close as if I use a manual razor, but it does the trick quickly and relatively quietly.  I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for something to use occasionally.  I&#x27;m not sure how the bikini attachment thing is suppose to work.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  This razor is gentle enough you won&#x27;t need that attachment for the bikini area at all.  It holds a charge great and is quick and easy to recharge.  All in all, buy it - you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver! I gave it 4 stars only because 5 would be perfect, and few things are perfect.  I get a very close shave with this and am very glad I chose this one.  I would definately buy this.</li>
            <li> I do like this shaver, however, I still feel a razor shaves closer.  But I recently had 3 surgeries and could not reach down to shave my legs in the shower, so I use this shaver on my legs and it does well but not as well as a razor.  However, I would recommend this to anyone who can&#x27;t use a razor due to any reason. It does not pinch or hurt in anyway and does shave close enough but you&#x27;d have to re-shave in 2 days or so depending how fast your leg hair grows.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. I&#x27;ve spent years having a difficult time shaving without my legs itching and burning. I never knew that trying a nickel free razor would be the answer. I wish is found this out years ago. I am 100% happy with this product!!</li>
            <li> I liked this item at first but it went dull in about 3 shavings. After a couple weeks all it did was pull my hair—ouch!! Was not great and I returned it.</li>
            <li> The wife loves it. If she is happy then that makes me happy. That sums it up for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add that coming up with the twenty word minimum for this review is difficult for a shaver that you simply want to say that you like it.</li>
            <li> Scratchy. Very scratchy. Does it do the job? To a point, but really feels rough and scratchy while using, this causing me to procrastinate about shaving.</li>
            <li> So, this is my first electric razor, really happy with it. Does a clean and smooth shave. Only as I read in one of the reviews, it does releases small puffs of hair while shaving. Well, that doesn&#x27;t bother me much. I just feel have wasted money for the bikini extension. Not at all useful, I don&#x27;t like it. But I really like this for shaving my arms and legs, shaves well due to the pivot head. All in all, very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> trimmer &amp; attachment works great, when wet is best. Razor only works ok when it&#x27;s dry. If you&#x27;re looking for a super smooth close shave, go with a manual razor, otherwise this is great on the go.</li>
            <li> my last electric razor stopped working after 9 years, so i replaced it with this one. this razor is much quieter than my last one! i didn&#x27;t think i&#x27;d like the guard for trimming, but i actually rather enjoyed how much easier it made shaping everything up. i personally do not like to shape up my &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; in the shower, so i don&#x27;t know how it will do in the shower, but as for dry it was a smooth process.</li>
            <li> Best women&#x27;s shaver I have ever owned.  Great appearance and does it&#x27;s job with comfort.  Outstanding quality - awesome price.</li>
            <li> Not the best shaver in the world.  This thing could not get a hold of anything. I would not recommend it.  Maybe is just got one that was defective.</li>
            <li> Works great. First time I&#x27;ve used an elec razor, and it&#x27;s very easy &amp; does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the charger, since you have to \\&quot;hang\\&quot; the razor on it so it takes up the&lt;br /&gt;whole plug area, I do wish it had a cord like a normal appliance!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent Shaver all the way around. I have tried both wet and dry. I prefer dry, but in the shower does work too.</li>
            <li> Finally a Shaver that doesnot pull, miss fine hairs and most of all does not leave me flapping my arms when I shave my underarms. Fantastic !!!</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  I can no longer use a regular razor due to health problems, and this shaver was the perfect solution.  Works great in the shower too!</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with my Panasonic Close Curves Ladies Shaver.  It is convenient to use, recharge, and clean.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using various Remington Electric Shavers for the past few years. My current Remington was in need of new blades and I found the new blades cost as much as a new razor. So I looked around and thought I would try the Panasonic Close Curves because of the flexible shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is head and shoulders above the Remington razors I have used. The blades contour to my underarms and legs and give me a very close shave with no pulling or rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this razor wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li> Love it, bought it for my daughter for x-mas and she uses it every other day... So far so good!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had this shaver 6 months, just now replacing the blades. it is almost as good as a  blade, but is easier to use. you can even use it in the car, if you can shave without looking.&lt;br /&gt;i haven&#x27;t used it in the shower, but i experience  no irritation under arms or bikini area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male, and I&#x27;m a cyclist.  As such, I shave my legs.  After finishing a $40 pack of disposable razor blades, I tried my girlfriends Remington.  While it worked alright, this works better, particularly on finer hairs, and the sensitive knee areas.  She used both on me, and said keep the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned the charger is not very well designed.  If you have old/really used outlets (like in a bathroom), it will have trouble staying in the wall.  An extension cord works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 1 star for charger design.</li>
            <li> The charge doesn&#x27;t last for more than 15 minutes. It does a decent job at shaving but takes forever to charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple electric razors over the years and this is by far the worst. You have to go over every section multiple times because it keeps missing hair. The whole point of an electric razor for me is to save time, so this is going to have to go!</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When shaving longer hair, it will take a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go slower in sensitive areas. Hair is less likely to get caught and painfully yanked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people say their shave was not smooth, I didn&#x27;t have that issue. It may differ from person to person or perhaps it&#x27;s the way you shave. I hold my skin back and shave against the grain for a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Why did no one tell me about electric shaving before?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whomever came up with the idea that women need to shave half their bodies to go outside was probably a) a razor advertiser, and b) a man.  Contorting oneself in the shower with a sharp implement rubbed all over your body is not a pleasant experience and with my sensitive skin and thick hair I found it to be very time consuming and perilous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never tried electric shaving, but this Panasonic shaver is inexpensive and has some good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is great - my hair grows so fast that within hours after a normal shave I have some hair growing anyways.  So it doesn&#x27;t matter to me too much that this shave isn&#x27;t 100% as close as a normal shave.  It&#x27;s close enough to feel fairly smooth and look completely presentable - and I have thick dark hair and very pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  People complain in some reviews about the plastic guards above and below the foils.  They do stick out, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re sharp and they didn&#x27;t bother me at all.  Compare some plastic rubbing on your skin with a sharp metal blade and I think you&#x27;ll find the plastic is far more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to shave dry is life changing - I can shave easily whenever and wherever I want with minimal fuss and mess.  Wet shaving armpits when you&#x27;re already dressed is really inconvenient - this solves that problem.  I also like that I can shave wet if I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review may not be helpful to you if you already have electric razor experience and want a comparison to other razors - but if you&#x27;re a first time electric razor buyer, I strongly recommend this razor to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought about going with a men&#x27;s razor - it seems like there ought to be something snazzy you get for 10x the price (literally, many men&#x27;s razors do cost 10x what this one costs).  However, I couldn&#x27;t find enough compelling evidence to spend 10x as much, or even 3x as much - this ladies razor really does the trick.  And if it does wear out in a year, I can afford to buy a new one.  Although I&#x27;d rather not since that would be environmentally unfriendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do experience some very mild razor burn or irritation in my armpits after shaving with this - I can only tell because I apply witch hazel afterwards and it burns.  It&#x27;s far less than with shaving though and doesn&#x27;t bother me, but if you&#x27;re looking for completely burn free shaving the super high end men&#x27;s razors might offer that experience.&lt;br /&gt;__________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is all I wrote before, *when fully charged*.  If the battery is getting low, it starts yanking on your hairs, taking forever to get anything done, and just overall not working.  I would like to see Panasonic come out with a new model of this product with better battery technology.  The product literally does not function as it should without a close to full charge, which should not be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There should also be a battery meter so you know when to recharge instead of having it die while you&#x27;re trying to shave and rush out the door.  I am tempted to buy a second one, so I can have one charging and one to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I finally upgraded to a men&#x27;s 15000rpm Panasonic shaver.  The difference between that and this women&#x27;s shaver is a Mercedes Benz versus a garbage truck.  They will both get you there, but one is going to be a lot quieter, faster, and more comfortable.  Given that women shave more of their bodies than men it surprises me that there aren&#x27;t better shaving options for women.  I recommend getting a men&#x27;s shaver if you want the full experience.  I paid about 4-5x the cost of this shaver, but it is well worth it.  The women&#x27;s shaver had stopped working very well since it couldn&#x27;t get fully charged long enough to do both legs, frequently leaving me with only one leg shaved.  My new men&#x27;s shaver has a longer lasting battery with a battery meter and is &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34; versus &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; for the women&#x27;s shaver.  The head is larger and pivots more.  It is an ugly black color, but other than that it is better on every level than this women&#x27;s shaver which now feels like a poorly functioning toy in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I didn&#x27;t want to recommend any particular men&#x27;s model, just that you buy a men&#x27;s electric razor instead, but due to popular demand, here is the model of men&#x27;s shaver I purchased: [[ASIN:B002N5MHLK Panasonic ES-LA93-K, Arc4 Electric Razor, Men&#x27;s 4-Blade with Multi-Flex Pivoting Head and Dual Motor, Premium Automatic Clean &amp; Charge Station Included, Wet or Dry Operation]] and my review of it: http://smile.amazon.com/review/R1BB4BSB822648/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm&lt;br /&gt;This was the highest end model available at the time and has been working very well for over 5 years.  But any men&#x27;s model should be fine, they appear to all be engineered to a higher standard than the women&#x27;s model - it&#x27;s not necessary to buy the top of the line, and I found the charging station superfluous after a year or so.&lt;br /&gt;____________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further update:&lt;br /&gt;Another life changing upgrade!&lt;br /&gt;The men&#x27;s razor was still great, but shaving was taking too long, especially for longer hairs and large areas.  So after a lot of research and a long hesitation to spend more again on shaving equipment, I purchased an Oster cordless hair trimmer (for dogs) and an Andis Outliner blade  [[ASIN:B000MC7SQA Andis Outliner Beard Trimmer UltraEdge Detachable Blade, Silver, Size 1/150 (64160)]] to trim longer hairs and shave legs.  By reading reviews, I found out a lot of men use a hair trimmer on their face, as it is much gentler, and also works much better on longer hairs, but no one ever mentioned this for women!  It is at least 10x faster to shave and does not damage my (thin, pale, sensitive) skin. I also found out hair trimmers are used for surgery prep instead of razors to prevent small cuts in the skin.  It does leave a tiny bit of very short stubble, but I can leave the house with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works especially well before the electric shaver for a smooth result quickly without skin irritation.  I only wish I had found this sooner - I almost enjoy shaving now, and it can be done quickly, dry, anytime, with no injury.  Ignore any labels that say they are to trim dog&#x27;s hair, sheep, horses, men&#x27;s head hair, etc.  Hair is hair and trimming is trimming.  As a bonus you could also trim your dog, sheep, horses, and male relatives hair  (with a different blade).ith a battery meter and is &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34; versus &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; for the women&#x27;s shaver.

            <li> My old Panasonic es2045 died so I needed to get something new.  Decided to save myself a few bucks since I didn&#x27;t use the epilator part anyway and bought one of these.  I&#x27;m so sorry I did.  It spends more time pulling the hair than cutting it.  It doesn&#x27;t give a close shave and the trimmer is very nearly useless.  The head is rather large and not convenient on curves.  Very tempted to toss it in the back corner of a drawer and get another like my old one.</li>
            <li> I have had a Remington WDF6000 for years and needed to purchase a new razor.  I did not want to spend the money on the same one I had, which was over $100.  I should have spent the money.  This razor worked great for about one month, now, even with regular cleaning, it is terrible. In order for it to work, I have to move it extremely slowly over my leg; and even then, it is so-so.  My legs are NOT SMOOTH with this razor.</li>
            <li> I would give this five stars, but the extendable trimmer collects hair quite easily making it less effective. I have to keep shutting them off and cleaning it out every two minutes or so. But for just regular shaving, they work great.</li>
            <li> After using regular blade razors my entire adult life, I wanted to try an electric razor and, on the basis of the favorable reviews here on Amazon, decided on this one.  I&#x27;ve used it on legs and bikini area for about two months and am very pleased and quite impressed with the close shave - never expected the great results I get.  It&#x27;s doing the job and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> After going through a great panasonic electric razor, I thought this was going to be a sure bet. I bought it from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and the thing doesn&#x27;t even cut dry leg hair! Piece of junk. It&#x27;s going back. So much for my faith in panasonic razors.</li>
            <li> Great item, you will get a very close shave every time.  Beats regular shavers!!!  I usually use it in the shower. I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> good for the price made of mostly plastic</li>
            <li> Works good. Easy to handle. Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product,it didn&#x27;t live up to them. I was hoping for something that I could use quickly in the morning, but it takes more time then they regular razor. It also doesn&#x27;t shave very well. I find all kinds of spots that get missed. I&#x27;ve tried it with and without the shaving cream. Neither way seems to work better. I use it once in a while to shave, just so I feel that I get some of my moneys worth out of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now in the dry mode and love it.  My old one of 25 years finally died &amp; I had to replace it.  The Panasonic is very quiet compared to the old one and does a good job of shaving.  I like the pivot head as it provides a smoother flow.</li>
            <li> This shaver is really convenient and functional. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. The only thing is the comb for the bikini line doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> My wife charged it  - the batterys ran out with the first shave -Cut like crap  The wife said waxing would have been less painful.</li>
            <li> I read all the other reviews on how good this razor was. I was pretty disappointed when I used it. It&#x27;s not something I can use everyday with getting a clean shave. It gave me razor burn in my armpits too so I highly recommend not using it there!  It doesn&#x27;t trim the hair unless you grow it out long enough.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Mrs. John: The razor works well for me.  I had a little trouble connecting it to charge it but that&#x27;s my little disability problem.  Worth the money if your satisfied with an electric shave vs. blade.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor a few months ago.  For the first few times, it was great. I recharged once, cleaned it faithfully, and it worked very well.  However, even though I had fully discharged the battery before the second recharge, it didn&#x27;t fully (and still will not fully) recharge, so the razor doesn&#x27;t have enough oomph to cut the hair - it just pulls it out very painfully.  Ouch!!! I do not recommend this item if you plan on using it past a few months.</li>
            <li> the razor does an excellent job and the charger set up is convenient to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor in January 2011 and it has stopped working already. I realize it&#x27;s only $30 but for only 9 months of use, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Wife likes it and works well.</li>
            <li> Gave me ingrown hairs :(</li>
            <li> My wife use it all the time and is very pleased</li>
            <li> I thought, if this shaver pinches my underarms, what will it do to my bikini area.  Wouldn&#x27;t trust it as far a I can throw it.  Giving it away.</li>
            <li> This order was received very promptly.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver was as advertsed, and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this purchase!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Battery last sooo much compared to my last one!! Needs light to tell when battery is ending and a brush to clean it.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier version of this shaver. Went I went to purchase a new blade and foil, I found that my Panasonic shaver was a &#x27;historic item&#x27;. Well, I guess it was about 12 years old... So I purchased this one and so far I am very pleased. It provides a close shave. I have followed the instructions that another reviewer provided about fully charging the shaver and shaving fully wet or fully dry. Hopefully, this version will last until it becomes an &#x27;historical item&#x27; too.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic before (similar shape but a different type) and another Barun earlier. I have fine hair (still hairy) and very sensitive skins.  Have tried out a few shavers but not yet found anything really work for me without getting shaver burns.&lt;br /&gt;I found this Panasonic Hypo Allergenic Shaver and thought to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It surprised me by how smooth, painless this one works, after my first use!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I ordered this one and amazing enough it&#x27;s the best shaver I ever used!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> so, I&#x27;ve wanted to dry one of these since I&#x27;ve heard they&#x27;ve come a long way.  And yes, it is cool how water immersible it is.  And I don&#x27;t have anxiety that it is going pull or hurt - so those are improvements.&lt;br /&gt;but if a close shave is what you need, this doesn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;it is my quick go between that helps make things a little softer -- but still in need of a razor shave.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this fresh out of the box, I was amazed. I thought I finally found an electronic razor that actually did something. But a few months later and it&#x27;s just like the rest of them. Doesn&#x27;t cut much...seems dulled already. I wanted to use it for quick shaves when I didn&#x27;t have time for a full one, but it&#x27;s pointless now as to shave any hair takes 5x as long as a shave in the shower with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I was really freaked out by the thought of anything sharp going near my nether regions.. but I was really satisfied with the results of this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally safe and pain free. Will get a close shave too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only painful part of this product is trying to get it open!!!</li>
            <li> Works great, great quality and the batteries last forever.  Needed new blades and found it cheaper to get a whole new shaver.  have had it for about 3 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for just 5 months and already it fails to closely shave.  The battery surges and the outer frame won&#x27;t stay on the shaver unless it&#x27;s taped on.  It worked very nicely when it arrived, but I have to wonder if the unit I received was refurbished rather than brand new.  I contacted customer service with a specific question and they responded with a \\&quot;form letter\\&quot; that didn&#x27;t address my question and that states I have a one-year warranty (my paperwork indicates two years).  I am unable to use a regular razor so waiting for this unit to be repaired and returned to me is not an option.  I bought the unit at the original $39.99, but cannot recommend its purchase at any price!</li>
            <li> Decent for an electric shaver. Just wish they made one that you can actually get a smooth shave</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Not that the shaver is defective or there is anything wrong with it, I just have very fine hair on my legs, which caused it to miss a lot of hair.  Sorry I had to return it.  I was so hoping for it to work.</li>
            <li> This razor is easy to use, gentle and effective.  You don&#x27;t need to press down hard on your skin--in fact the lighter the touch, the better.  It cleans easily and has a pop up blade for armpits, which is the most effective tool I have used ever for that area.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It works okay, it doesn&#x27;t perform as well as I thought it would. I went back to just shaving my legs with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Good battery life, convenient settings, works great!</li>
            <li> This works so so. I bought this to reduce awful in-grown hairs and it is definitely helpful in that but I have to go over each area multiple times and it is difficult to get a close shave. I use it dry most often but I like that it can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> Good Product., easy to use, convenient in size.  Shave could be a little closer though&lt;br /&gt; but does a good job</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Exactly as advertised.  Well packaged &amp; arrived in timely manner.  Would recommend to others.  Used to use Remington but the battery would not last on it.</li>
            <li> It is an okay product.  Sometimes it misses hairs on my legs and I have to go over the skin several times but other than that, it works fine.</li>
            <li> bought it as a gift for my mom, as an elderly customer she seems satisfied with her shaver, don&#x27;t know much about how much detail and&lt;br /&gt;percise work can be done .</li>
            <li> Chose this razor bcz I owned a Panasonic previously ( years ago) and was very pleased with it. This model is a little larger than my first one, although still good weight and size, and convient to use. I&#x27;m amazed at the length of time the charge lasts.</li>
            <li> I have used older Panasonic shavers and really thought they provided a nice close shave and lasted long(1 year) for the price($30). I had this shaver for 2 weeks, was happy with the closeness. After that 2 weeks, I would turn on the shaver and it would act as if the battery was dying out. I would turn it off and then on and it would work fine. This lasted about a week and could not from then on get it to turn on at all. Conveniently my warranty was up. I emailed the company and they sent me a phone number and I called. They gave me all the information to send it back to be repaired. So although the shipping was only $4 to send it to be repaired I fear that I will receive it and have the same problems of which I will have wasted more money on the shaver. I would buy the older version, that one at least lasted a year!</li>
            <li> I LOVED THE WAY IT WORKS ON MY FACE. IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THE PICTURE.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  This did not work well for the bikini hair at all.  I new it wouldn&#x27;t give a real close trim but it didn&#x27;t even do much of anything but cause pain and pulling.  Shaving with an ordinary Gillette Venus is much more comfortable.  As a positive this razor had an excellent battery life.</li>
            <li> It works very well under the shower, and a rash from shaving is a thing from the past. I am so happy with product .</li>
            <li> This razor is quiet and efficient.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these and since the second one did what the first one did, I have to say they&#x27;re complete garbage.  Almost to the point of being a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 to 6 months - when you take it off the charger and turn it on, there&#x27;s a few seconds pause before the motor kicks in. Over the next month or two after that, that pause becomes longer and longer until the unit simply won&#x27;t turn on anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the battery - the device works fine and has a strong charge once it turns on. And I never submerged it in water.  It seems like a defect in the on/off switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you feel like you wouldn&#x27;t mind having to buy one of these every 5 or 6 months then buy it: it does the job well while it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply believe they should last a couple years.  It&#x27;s obvious that Panasonic blew it with this razor.</li>
            <li> I ordered Panasonic Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver with Bikini Attachment, Mauve from Amazon. It arrived on time, but the razor was enclosed in a heavy, difficult-to-open, plastic cover. My Husband was able to cut it with his heavy duty scissors. When I used the razor the first time, it nicked my ankle area, but shaved the rest of my legs as well or better than other rechargeable ladies razors. I especially liked how quiet it was. I also liked that it easily attached to the cordless, plug-in charger.[[ASIN:B000G0GW6K Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver with Bikini Attachment, Mauve]] It shaves even better in the shower with a shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This razor requires you to go over the same area multiple times; as a consequence it takes a long time to shave.  I have used electric shavers for years and this is by far the worst one I have ever used.  Remington is much better in my opinion.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Ladies...I have tried almost every method to shave my legs. I have pretty thick, course leg hair.  Must be my German heritage!  I&#x27;ve use razors (wastes water in shower), wax(messy) , neat(stinky and left behind strays), epi-ladies(which work but take forever to get the job done.  I call it my midevil torture device, as it is painful the first couple of times you use it.  My recommendation for this one is valium!  And you don&#x27;t stay hair free for eight weeks like it says.  THOSE hairs you just ripped out will take that long to grow back but there is always new hair coming in, so a once a week session is still in order).  My first electric was a Remington.  That one lasted a couple of weeks as I didn&#x27;t appreciate the fact that it sounded like a buzz saw and you could hear it running from 2 counties away.  And it took too many passes. I then tried this Panasonic ES2216.  It was definitely a little quieter, but still louder than my hubby&#x27;s Norelco. It worked fairly well at first, but before a year was even up, it stopped cutting my hairs. I would go out in daylight and be horrified at the amount of hair it missed. I replaced the blades and it still wouldn&#x27;t cut my hair.  So while my hubby was away (SHHH!) I pulled out his Norelco triple headed Speed XL that was at least 2 years old and had rarely been cleaned or had a blade replacement and it was like OMG!  Fast, QUIET, and did the job.  So here is what I recommend.  Ditch those ladies specific shavers if you want a clean, close, quiet shave and go out and get yourself a manly shaver for those womanly legs.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.  I just got the Norelco 8250 Speed XL and it was sweet! Women&#x27;s razors just don&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: My shaver died after using it a few times per week for 6 months. I mailed it to Panasonic and received a replacement, the ES207P: http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ES2207P-Curves-rechargeable-Ladies/dp/B0018A32XS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1343180022&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;Panasonic+ES2207P I don&#x27;t care for the new shaver as much as I did this model. We&#x27;ll see how long the new model lasts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this shaver to groom my nether region (\\&quot;bikini\\&quot; seems like a bit of a misnomer, doesn&#x27;t it?). I was looking for a device that would give a close shave without cutting my skin, and also do a good job at being precise so that I could leave some hair. Unfortunately, while I suspect this shaver is good for large areas like legs, it is just adequate for your ladyparts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I like how the shaver head pivots. That gives you a nice smooth movement with the shaver for the varied terrain of your valley. I also like that it is lightweight and can be used in the shower. It is easy to clean and hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You cannot get a straight line with this thing. It comes with a pop-out apparatus for this purpose, but it consistently pulls your hair and is essentially useless. The \\&quot;bikini attachment,\\&quot; which is a guard so you can leave a little length on some hair, is not useful to me because it is spaced from the blade such that the hair you would be leaving would be quite long for my taste. The \\&quot;mauve\\&quot; color is ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am okay with this shaver, but it could be better. If you are mowing the entire field, it should be good for that purpose, but if you want to hedge with ease, look elsewhere. I recommend the extremely cheap but useful Clio, which can be purchased at Walgreens. It will cut you from time to time, but it&#x27;s strong where this device fails (still pink, though).</li>
            <li> I really enjoy shaving more with the Panasonic ES2216PC.  I get a close shave underarm, legs, and in the bikini area.  I love the curve of the handle it makes shaving in certain areas of the body much easier.</li>
            <li> Best bikini shaver ever. Strong power. Tried replacing my old one when it broke and the conair brand sucked. Had to re buy this because its awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews and was hoping to get a decent razor.  It is horrible.  Doesn&#x27;t work well wet or dry.  And....I have tried using it with my hair being different lengths (wanting to make sure that it had grown out enough and other times not too much).  It never really worked.  Even right after shaving my legs were NOT smooth.  They felt like it had been about a day or so since shaving with a regular razor.  How disappointing.  Even the bikini area groomer wasn&#x27;t all that great.  You&#x27;re better off paying more and getting a men&#x27;s Panasonic razor instead.</li>
            <li> After getting tired of razor burn and manual shaving, I decided to try an electric shaver. There were a lot of good reviews so I thought it would be a good replacement, however it does nothing near what regular shaving can do. I have rather thick dark hair and I prefer a really close, smooth shave. This did not do that at all. I was just as stubbly on my legs as when I started. I did use it for some other body hair removal where I didn&#x27;t mind if it wasn&#x27;t super close and that works well. If you are looking for a super close shave though, maybe try something else.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well at all. Just threw it away. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This shaver has long battery life and shaves fairly close to a traditional razor.I like to be environmentally friendly and choose electric shaver for last 25 years.</li>
            <li> This electric razor is good, not great.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is not super close (though I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to be).&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is that the razor ALWAYS misses hairs - you have to go over areas multiple times to even get that not-close shave. I wanted to switch to an electric razor to save time (and also because it is supposed to be better for ingrown hairs). I think that shaving with this razor actually takes longer than just shaving with a regular razor in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this razor is that it is okay to use both wet &amp; dry which makes it very easy to clean. You can just run it under the tap and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> Be aware of the return policy! This Panasonic ES2216 only comes with a 30 day return policy!&lt;br /&gt;My product lasted only 2 months and now has a malfunction.</li>
            <li> Although my wife was very happy with the results when shaving, this product has a design flaw. My wife is now on her second razor of this model and it has stopped working. The first was ordered Feb 14 2013 and the second Nov 14 2014. Both are still in warranty which right now is worthless as you will see later in this review. I am very knowledgeable about what makes things run and why they do not. When the razor is put into the charger one of the pins is pushed into the razor slightly to open a switch that prevents the razor from running while charging. This is a wonderful safety idea that prevents the charger from over heating. Only problem is that the switch design is very poor. When I opened the first razor and examined the switch I found that although it appeared to be closed it was not making an electrical connection. It was dirty, possibly from melted sealant or lubricant used. In either case simply touching the metal contacts allowed the razor head, which was still attached and in my hand to run. Actuating the switch by pushing and releasing the pin in the base of the battery housing caused the razor head to stop and it would not run until I pushed slightly on the contacts again. After reading other reviews where intermittent operation was mentioned or where premature battery failure occurred I can only conclude it was caused by this switch. I have called Panasonic and apparently their phones are not working properly and they can&#x27;t hear me after I have been switched to several departments. Although you must enter your phone number before you can be connected to anyone I never receive a call from them to find out why they can&#x27;t hear me. My wife now has 2 dead razors and I must take them apart to remove 2 good batteries for proper disposal.</li>
            <li> It works well which is more than I can say for the one I replaced! It&#x27;s light weight. go for it!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well in lieu of shaving with a \\&quot;real\\&quot; razor.  It&#x27;s much easier than getting up and down out of the bathtub or balancing on one leg in the shower when agility is diminished by age.  Suits my purpose fine.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Remington Smooth and Silky razor that I used to own in regard to closeness of shave, but still decent. Battery stays charged well for multiple uses. Good for quick shave if I&#x27;m not caring about how smooth I&#x27;m going to feel and only about how hair-free I&#x27;m going to look.</li>
            <li> Love it. Would purchase again</li>
            <li> I had been looking everywhere for a good women&#x27;s electric razor and couldn&#x27;t find anything.  I finally found what I was looking for on Amazon.  The price was right, and the razor works wonderfully!  Should have gone to Amazon in the first place!!</li>
            <li> This shaver works very nicely.  Do not have a lot of experience with other shavers to make any comparisons but it does get the job done.  My daughter enjoys the fact that she doesn&#x27;t have to worry about cutting herself with the razor anymore.  Very happy with the Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a manual razor due to constant razor burns, etc.  I went on a hunt for a good razor, hoping that I could find one that would give me a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this isn&#x27;t it.  You would assume that the pivoting head on this razor would be a GOOD thing.  But it isn&#x27;t.  It does \\&quot;okay\\&quot;, but just isn&#x27;t what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to say that the Panasonic ES2207P razor, which seems to be this exact same razor WITHOUT the pivoting head, gives a shave that feels exactly like I have used a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, if you are looking for a good, close shave out of an electric razor, don&#x27;t buy this one...get the cheaper one without the pivoting head.  You won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
            <li> Purchsed this razor after reading other reviews.  I had another model of a Panasonic razor, which is below this one.  Found this razor to be much quieter than the other one.  It does not scratch as some razors do.  The charge seems to last for a long period of time.  I&#x27;ve had it a month and haven&#x27;t recharged it yet.  It shaves very well. I purchased one for me and another one for my daughter.  We are both happy.</li>
            <li> So far not so good.  The dry shaving results did not meet our expectations.  After several tries the results did not yield a smooth shave.  Perhaps some adjustments need to be made, but she has not been happy with the results so far.  Perhaps the wet mode will be better, but that wasn&#x27;t the intent.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find this item in your stock. I had been looking at many stores for this item but none of them carry it anymore. I had this same razor but broke it so this was an added bonus.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best that I have used. It cuts close &amp; leaves your skin feeling very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Once a week recharge &amp; it is ready to go. I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this so that my daughter can learn to shave her legs. It is what I would consider adequate. It does the job, both dry and wet. Do I consider it a particularly close shave for someone like myself who normally uses an Intuition razor? No. Is it wonderful for a girl just getting comfortable with shaving and does it do an acceptable job of it? Yes. I would never buy one for myself but it&#x27;s great for helping her have a safe, easy way to shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Christmas gift I&#x27;m sure it works great!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this around 6 months ago because like most women I hate shaving. This has made my life so much easier. I have very sensitive skin so I was hesitant to use or buy it at first but at this price I&#x27;m glad I did. I have found the battery life to be very good, as I always leave mine off the charger. Being able to use it in the shower or dry when I&#x27;m in a hurry without any difference is what amazes me. I still have to sometimes use a regular razor on my underarms to get a close shaves but I will use no other razor if I have to!</li>
            <li> My last electric razor was terrific and another brand.  However, I thought I would try this one out and am a little disappointed by comparison.  I do like the action and the fact that the head tips and tilts around my bony knees and shin bone.  It just doesn&#x27;t seem to shave quite as closely as what I was used to.  At this point I will probably go back to a Remingtion razor next time.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected. I wouldnt recommend it, i do recommend purchasing one that costs a little more and offers better performance.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this item when I purchased it because I hate shaving. It very annoying to do especially with a razor, cream, and that risk of cutting yourself. I was ready to toss the razors...but that didn&#x27;t happen. Anyway here&#x27;s my review from personal experience. I will rate each thing I tried with this razor 1-5, 5 rating good and 1 rating poor. Here goes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For underarms:&lt;br /&gt;Rating 1&lt;br /&gt;Ok so for the underarms, it doesn&#x27;t really work that well because the hairs underarms are really thick. It cuts it. Now when I say it cuts it, it doesn&#x27;t really go in there to do its job. It kinda trims off the tops of the hair and you&#x27;re still left with underarm stubble that grows back twice as fast as using a regular razor because you didn&#x27;t go as low. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this underarms because it just didn&#x27;t work well for that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For legs:&lt;br /&gt;Rating 2.5&lt;br /&gt;The razor works much better on the leg area. But again, its still the same. It doesn&#x27;t really cut as close or as well as I would have liked. The product says you can use it wet but it doesn&#x27;t cut anything at all when you use it wet and it takes twice as long so I suggest using it when you&#x27;re dry. After using it, my legs felt stubbly and unattractive. I had to go back to regular razor shaving. With this razor, it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs in one pass so you have to continuously make passes back over those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For bikini area:&lt;br /&gt;Rating 4&lt;br /&gt;The product feels like it was made much more for the bikini area. It included a hair guard attachment and there&#x27;s a piece that you can push up, the part of the blade, when you&#x27;re ready to start. The product works much better as a hair trimmer than an actual razor. I even tried this product on my bikini area wet and even tried to trim the area wet with the guard and it just didn&#x27;t work as well as dry use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, OK as a trimmer for the bikini area but not a full on replacement razor. It includes a neat wall charger that allows the shaver to stand upright (rechargeable) and hair guard (bikini attachment). If you&#x27;re looking for a razor that really cuts close, this isn&#x27;t the one. I&#x27;m just glad I only paid $26 bucks for it.hair guard (bikini attachment). If you&#x27;re looking for a razor that really cuts close, this isn&#x27;t the one. I&#x27;m just glad I only paid $26 bucks for it.</li>
            <li> This worked well for a month, then started to fall apart.  The tin wrapped around the one section fell off completely.  The button that you need to push up to extend the shaving section broke.  The on/off button broke.</li>
            <li> I like this razor. It works well although it doesn&#x27;t get as close a shave as I would like.  I take it camping when it&#x27;s too difficult to shave in the campground showers.  I still shave in the shower about half the time.  So far it&#x27;s been very reliable.</li>
            <li> I went in with no expectations and found the shaver to be perfect for me! I hate using a razor - razor burn, itchy regrowth, etc. This fixes all of that and I can use it daily! It&#x27;s not as close a shave as a razor, consider it leaving a fine sandpaper feel versus a slick feel, but fine sandpaper is good enough for me!</li>
            <li> Contrary to their claims Panasonic does not have the sharpest blades. Previously had a Remington which shaved better and closer. Their advertisement got me but I  will not purchase another Panasonic Shaver. ACM</li>
            <li> Does the job when my leg hairs get long.  It&#x27;s not my standalone shaver, I also use my No No and regular razor and my husband&#x27;s braun for my facial hairs.  I hope one day, the industry can make women shaver comparable to men&#x27;s shaver that has nice dual blades for shaving close and is made of good quality (many of those for men in the market)...I dislike the fact that to this day it has not been done.</li>
            <li> This electric razor is light weight and very easy to use. Gets a close shave. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a razor for quick shaves without having to use shaving cream or use it in the shower.  I just use this on dry legs and it works fine.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor and I am quite pleased. I feel so much more comfortable shaving because I am confident that I won&#x27;t end up bleeding at the end of my shaving session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being able to shave dry is super nice as well! I also enjoy the swiveling head, it feels like it goes around my knees and ankles nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought an epilator to do my legs so that I won&#x27;t have to shave as often, but I plan on keeping this for my more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been searching in stores for this item.. so when Amazon emailed  that it was available, I &#x27;jumped&#x27; at the chance -- good price, fast delivery for upcoming trip. So far, very satisfied. Product lives up to its claims -- is comfortable to hold and use, charges rapidly (which it hardly ever needs) and packs easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace another razor that stopped working. Like another reviewer said you have to go over the area a lot of times to get the hair. It let my armpit very irritated.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor this past April for my daughter who hasn&#x27;t used it that much and it already stopped working.  It won&#x27;t even turn on even though it is fully charged.  Isn&#x27;t there any recourse?!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, follow instructions and you will avoid painful cuts that you would get with others. It&#x27;s easy to clean and very precise. I used to have a shaver with three different heads (trimmers) all separate and I had to attach them one after the other for better results; with this shaver I don&#x27;t have to do anything but to charge it, use it and it&#x27;s done.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, having the support from a well known company as Panasonic gives me relief in case something happens to the product. The company provides all contact info in order to answer my questions whenever I want, which I appreciate. Its replacement parts are non-expensive, long-lasting and also offered through Amazon, which also makes it easier to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fully recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is great....close shave, easy, lightweight. A great purchase, great price.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it.  I just wish she would use it more often! ha ha....</li>
            <li> Terrible product . Don&#x27;t like the shave and also the product is not robust</li>
            <li> The panasonic ES2216PC is the best shaver I&#x27;ve had in a long time. Close shave, easy to clean and the life of the battery is great.&lt;br /&gt;  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice looking wet-dry shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a few weeks now &amp; am loving the convenience of not having to lather up in the tub if I want to shave. It works quickly &amp; shaves closer than other electric razors I&#x27;ve had in the past. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Received in a reasonable time and in excellent condition.  Have used the shaver several times and am delighted with it - shaves closely, smoothly, quietly and (very important) gently - would recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I purchased an almost identical model (Panasonic ES2218VC) in March 2009. I was happy with it until the battery weakened. After a little over a year it would no longer hold a charge (which seemed like a very short battery life to me) and unfortunately battery replacement was not an option with that shaver. I did, however, like the shaver, so I decided to give this model one more chance. Also I had an unopened package of replacement blades that fit the same shaver, (and they are no small expense), so that was a big factor in my decision to purchase this replacement. So far I&#x27;m very happy with the replacement as there is no doubt that it delivers a closer shave than its predecessor did. The wet/dry feature is nice, and the swivel top is really the big selling point of this shaver. I&#x27;m giving 4 stars in this case because of my bad experience with the battery of the previous shaver; hopefully that was a fluke but only time will tell. I do recommend this shaver for the design and performance.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s very good, a regular shaver still shaves closer.  This is very convenient though, &amp; does a good job.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> does not give a close, touchable shave at all. wet or dry, with or without shaving cream, doesn&#x27;t make a difference. Okay for last minute shaves when I wasn&#x27;t expecting to show any leg. Luckily I have very thin, light leg hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini attachment is a joke, completely useless. Pop-up trimmer comes in handy somewhat for already \\&quot;trimmed\\&quot; areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t even come close to a regular razor blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what I paid, I&#x27;m not terribly disappointed though. I&#x27;ve spent much more on other electric shavers that did a worse job.</li>
            <li> I have owned two of these and this one is by far the best one yet. My legs feel like I used a razor with blades. The pivot head on it keeps it from scratching your skin like the ones who do not have the pivot head. Easy to clean. I love it!</li>
            <li> The product does everything it advertises.  Holds a charge very well, takes up little counter space, and gives a nice shave.  An excellent value in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I got tired of wasting money on the mens body groomers they are really expensive and most of them are crap .&lt;br /&gt;this one works just fine on chest hair , arm hair , special parts hair and it has two foils !! yes TWO FOILS for the price of a one foil man groomer and the lil pop up clipper works just fine too. So fellas if you wanna lose that hair just suck up the pride and get over it being pink !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to keep cleaning it out as you use it its totally waterproof so its no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;Its a thousand times better than the philips , braun  and the remingtons Ive tried all of them</li>
            <li> This is my second go round with the shaver. I tried another one but it didn&#x27;t even come close to my satisfaction at the functionality of this one. I recommend it highly. It gives a great, close shave.</li>
            <li> Very dissappointed with this product. Doesn&#x27;t shave close enough and its not durable because it comes apart easily. My manual dissposables are better than this over priced shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would solve my problems! My legs become extremely itchy after shaving. It has nothing to do temperature of water or what kind of products I use to shave with. So I went to an allergist and they said that when you shave with a razor, you are removing the top layer of your skin and what I am allergic to is therefore irritating that layer of skin. FRUSTRATING! So I thought if i bought this, it wouldn&#x27;t shave off that top layer! And BINGO! It works! But sadly, it isn&#x27;t as close shave as a regular razor. But I am so happy that I don&#x27;t get that itchy skin after! So that is a major plus. The shave is great, but just expect to do it almost everyday. It works great using it dry. I haven&#x27;t used it with water yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen daughter.  The size of it can be difficult on the surfaces of a petite body.  She also experienced some hair pulling when using it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I offered to return it, but she felt it was still great for legs.  If you need a precision shaver, this may not be it.</li>
            <li> Was dirty and package  seriously torn and looked used. Part missing and I returned.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for my young daughter.  She barely used it in the winter and about every 3 days in the spring/summer due to having super fine hair on her legs (lucky!).  This razor lasted about 1.5 years with that light use.  The other problem my daughter had with it was that the on switch was very difficult to slide.  The razor did do a good job for her when it was working though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use shavers that are electric. I have to shave with it a lot before the hair is removed. It works better dry than wet. The bikini trimmer part is painful so I don&#x27;t use it. The razor come apart so you can replace the razor and to clean it. It is nice to have the option to shave dry.</li>
            <li> Perfect perfect perfect.</li>
            <li> Shaver Was A Gift-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this as a Gift for my daughter.  She didn&#x27;t want it so I had to return it.  I saw it and thought she would just love having a &amp;#34;Pretty Shaver&amp;#34;.  I was a little disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;F.E. Manuel</li>
            <li> Best, closest shave I have ever had with an electric shaver.  Nice charger also...does not take up room like others.</li>
            <li> Device is exactly what I expected, Easy to use, love it</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a niece and she loved it.  Not just because it was a surprise but she liked the way it shaved her legs.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor 3 years ago on Amazon, and I love it still!! The best electric women&#x27;s razor on the market still. I am buying another one today, because there&#x27;s a $5 difference between the blades for it and a whole new razor. So new razor it is! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the bikini feature!  It works great and the razor itself is nice too.  I haven&#x27;t used it in the water yet but I&#x27;m sure it will work fine.</li>
            <li> This is a second one of these that I got. First one was June 2011, then this one in December 2011. On both of them, the trimmer is starting to pull hairs. With the first I thought it was my fault, by letting my guy shave his face with it a couple of times before it started pulling. But this time, he has not touched it and it&#x27;s pulling hairs again just 4 months in. And I do not see a way to replace a trimmer. I am definitely not getting a 3rd one from them. On to find something else it seems.</li>
            <li> When I broke the foil on my Remington (which I LOVED) it was almost the same price to replace it as to buy a new razor. So I searched long and hard and saw that this Panasonic model got rave reviews everywhere. I decided to get it based on the reviews - I sure wish I hadn&#x27;t now! Not sure if other folks haven&#x27;t used good razors so they have nothing to compare to or if I got a dud but this razor has been terrible since day 1 (I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now). And I don&#x27;t have particularly course or thick hair either - I&#x27;d consider it average...&lt;br /&gt;* It randomly snags &amp; pulls your hair instead of cutting it all the time. (ouch!)&lt;br /&gt;* It runs out of juice FAST! Sometimes I can&#x27;t finish both legs before needing a recharge when it had been charging for days.&lt;br /&gt;* You have to go over the same spot many times to get all of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;* It doesn&#x27;t give a close shave - my Remington was almost as smooth as with a non-electric razor!&lt;br /&gt;* It seemed to go dull VERY quickly - I now have to turn it around backwards and use the other trimming blade to accomplish anything at all. The foil section does absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this razor was awful from the first time I used it on - I should have returned it but just didn&#x27;t take the time to. I loved my Remington and I&#x27;m going to trash this and get one of those instead. What a waste of plastic &amp; resources :(&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I bought mine from that Drugstore site, not Amazon, so nothing negative toward the seller as I had no experience with them - just don&#x27;t like the product!</li>
            <li> My fiance keeps his head shaved and thus, he has several electronic razors. He likes all that he has and his shopping process has been pretty straight forward. Trying to find a decent razor designed for a woman is time consuming and tedious at best. After much looking and review reading I settled on this Panasonic. Oh my god. What a P.O.S. - I think if my goal had been to find the worst razor out there that I would have chosen this monstrosity of torture. It pulls hair, skips right over massive patches of hair and in general is a pain in the ass. It performs no where remotely like it claims to. The best thing about this razor is that it&#x27;s a pretty pink color. I ended up ordering a Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro, Black/silver, made for men. It works like a dream. I would absolutely never recommend the Panasonic to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used.  While I like the look and feel of the product, it is useless to give a close shave.  I have tried it wet, wet with shaving cream and dry, and none of the methods I have used have produced a shave anywhere near my manual throw-away razor.  I have sensitive skin so decided on the electric razor as opposed to an epilator as I understand they can be rough on your skin. At this point I think I&#x27;ll put this shaver in the next garage sale and go back to my throw-away razor!</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver that I&#x27;ve had, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else, but I&#x27;m not incredibly impressed.  For one thing, if I don&#x27;t shave every day, it doesn&#x27;t work well- it doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair.  And forget it if I wait a week or two- if your hair is long at all, it won&#x27;t even work.  Perhaps this is the nature of the beast, but I don&#x27;t like it.  Also, after a few months, I&#x27;ve found that the motor seems to be weakening considerably, even when it&#x27;s fully charged- of course these things will die eventually, but this one seems to have an especially short life.</li>
            <li> I HATE stubble in between showers and this is exactly what I was looking for!  It does NOT give as close a shave as a razor-but I didn&#x27;t expect it to. It also takes several swipes instead of just one-but it&#x27;s worth it! One tip-I&#x27;ve found my legs are dry after using it, and apply lotion-voila!</li>
            <li> Having had a previous shaver that didn&#x27;t shave closely, I was apprehensive about finding 1 that did.  This is it!!  Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works just fine  still would prefer a closer shave . It does the job but still have to use a venus razor  if I don&#x27;t want stubble.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow and don&#x27;t make the skin as smooth as I wish . It take hour to shave instead of a couple of minutes like with a regular blade .</li>
            <li> This is better than I expected and not as great as I had hoped. The shaver does work great day-to-day for grooming. The charge life is only one week if used daily.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean. No nicks.  Shaves well. Would have liked it better if it had a stand to put it on when recharging instead of sticking it on an outlet.  Actually would have liked a razor that you could use with or without a cord but couldn&#x27;t find one. It is okay for the price.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t trim close enough to the leg, stubble within a day.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on wet skin yet maybe that would help.</li>
            <li> I got this for myself just the other day after deciding to revisit my hair strategy ([...]). After reading all the reviews, both positive and negative, I decided to give this shaver a try.&lt;br /&gt;Here are the results:&lt;br /&gt;1. It definitely isn&#x27;t as close a shave as a razor. This isn&#x27;t a date-night solution to shaving (unless you&#x27;re dating someone who&#x27;s into cactus). It&#x27;s serviceable enough for day-to-day shaving as long as no one is getting down and inspecting your legs. I have dark and copious hair, so my legs really show dark hair. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using this as my shaving solution around anything other than tights.&lt;br /&gt;2. The best way to get the closest possible shave is (as another reviewer noted) pulling your skin taut and wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;3. The real breakthrough was the bikini trimmer... I&#x27;ve always thought that my options were razor or waxing, neither of which is comfortable AT ALL. This is an absolute REVELATION in shaving. There are multiple lengths and shearing was very easy.&lt;br /&gt;4. It kind of hurt to use on my under-arms, but I have sensitive under-arms. I imagine with some time, I could get better at shaving painlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have points of comparison for other shavers, so I can&#x27;t tell you how this one rates in relation to all the other shavers in the world. The charge held for my entire session, so no complaints there. The shaver itself seems well made and the little attachment brush helps rid the shaver of longer hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you, though, that now that I have used this shaver, I will use a shaver forever more. I&#x27;m definitely converted!</li>
            <li> This electric shaver is so not quiet. It makes a loud noise. You should charge it after every use. It does an okay job. It could have been a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I like this razor very much. It is very easy to use and you can use it dry or wet.</li>
            <li> My Panasonic shaver is less than a year old. I bought this shaver to use one to two times per week to shave my underarms and bikini line, so the shaver has not received heavy use that would explain the problems I am currently experiencing. For the first few months, the shaver worked perfectly. However, the pop-up trimmer, which I only used once every one to two weeks, is now useless as it yanks hairs out rather than trims them. The regular shaving head also yanks hairs now and then. Now it takes more than a few passes of the shaver on my skin to completely remove hair. I would never expect a pricey Panasonic shaver that is less than a year old with only one to two times per week of usage on a small area of my body to perform poorly at shaving hair at this point in time. I clean this shaver after each use according to the directions in the instruction booklet and use the shaver on a full charge, so the performance issues are not due to a dirty shaver or a weak charge.</li>
            <li> I went with this model based on other reviews...and because of the \\&quot;pivoting\\&quot; head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve liked about it:  The trimmers work really well on longer hair -hey, gimme a break, being on hospital bedrest with a timed limit on your daily showers makes it super hard to shave regularly!  The blades themselves also manage to get quite close to the skin.  I&#x27;ve had no skin irritation with this shaver, while with others I&#x27;ve definitely felt the tug and pull, which has then caused weird razor-ish-burn.  It&#x27;s fairly quiet, and it holds a charge really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about it:  I&#x27;ve had other electric shavers that give a closer shave.  This one doesn&#x27;t ever get my legs really smooth, but it does the required job.  The power button on my particular unit is easy to hit accidentally and I find that I&#x27;ve turned it off during a shave a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the shaver actually in the shower yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; part of the \\&quot;wet &amp; dry\\&quot;, but all in all, the experience I&#x27;ve had with it has been positive.</li>
            <li> Works well, better than the other electric corded/cordless razors I had tried.</li>
            <li> This is the best woman&#x27;s shaver I have ever used.  Period.  It charges quickly and holds the charge well.  It gives a close, smooth shave on legs.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift. The person said that she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry i can&#x27;t say much on it. Probably i will get one&lt;br /&gt;for myself.</li>
            <li> good value, exactly as discribed, fast dhipping, Would recomend, works well on bikini area, works well in shower, easy to clean</li>
            <li> I love having the freedom of using it wet/dry to shave. Especially on those days when I forgot and need a quick shave. It is a high quality product for a great price. I really like it!</li>
            <li> Like \\&quot;Kari\\&quot; from Colorado, I&#x27;ve always used Remington ladies razors and needed a new one, so I started researching and found this Panasonic. I decided to give it a try since it was less expensive and sounded like it would work well. I am SO SORRY I spent my money on this one and will be going back to Remington even though they cost a little more. I can&#x27;t believe there are not more women complaining about how uncomfortable this razor is to use! Like Kari, I ended up with scratches up and down my legs that actually burned until they healed (from the raised sides)..OUCH!! I do NOT get a close shave like I did with my Remington and it takes me twice the time because I have to keep going over and over the same areas. Very disappointed with this purchase!</li>
            <li> No stand for the Shaver or case when not in use. Has a small charger to plug in the wall. Need charger&#x27;s like was on the older models with a cord.  This was not seen or clear in the add to be viewed.</li>
            <li> i decided to buy this for Bikini area.since razor gives me rashes and ugly red spots all around the bikini zone. i found that if i use bikini device it will trim the hair long enough to show! so i used it without the device. the same horrible rash plus AOUCHHHHH it pulled my hair and scratch me.generally i think razor is easier than this.search more for better product.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  It gives a closer shave than any other electric shaver I have used.  I have used it on my legs and underarms dry.  Haven&#x27;t tried in the shower yet.  The only downside is the recharger.  Thank you to the person who included this in her review so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.  A plain recharging cord would be much more convenient but it wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> I got this little buddy awhile back so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to go all stubble-y when it came to the end of the month where I couldn&#x27;t afford razors.  I must say, I am AMAZED.  My boyfriend got me an electric shaver a little while before that, but it cut me up and left patches of stubble all over the place.  This one does an amazing job once you get used to holding it the right direction, and leaves almost nothing behind.  My skin is smooth and comfy without razor bumps!</li>
            <li> It is a nice razor, and I like the fact that it is a wet/dry electric razor. Although it does the job, I was not overly impressed. It is handy it does give a nice shave.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave at all.  Kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li> this was purchased as a gift for my wife , whoneeded to replace her old shaver. she was very satisfied with the shaver and the convenience of doing business with amazon.</li>
            <li> I think it is adequate--no better or worse than any other electric razor I have owned. But that&#x27;s just me. I think razors perform at a different level for women based on various factors. I am still searching for one that works really well for me. Haven&#x27;t found it in nearly 40 years, but maybe someday....</li>
            <li> Wife was all smiles after first dry shave!</li>
            <li> I had one before and it worked wonders! However, it broke so I bought this one. Same brand and all, just different color. I love the pink, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as close?? Not sure why, but it&#x27;s good in a pinch...</li>
            <li> So, the shaver is pretty good. It does it&#x27;s job. But don&#x27;t expect a squeaky clean shave...lol, like I did. Then you&#x27;ll be disappointed. Apart from that, it&#x27;s super easy to clean, to use, etc. the bickini attachment isn&#x27;t really worth it. My scissors does a better job lol. So you may want to consider their other models. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have an indicator that tells you when it finishes charging, so you need to just trust your intellect and your whim.</li>
            <li> Defective product...poor quality</li>
            <li> I used to Buy Mens Shavers- But this one is by FAR the Best Shaver I&#x27;ve owned!! It gets SO Close! very Happy!</li>
            <li> Performs nicely, even in &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; areas.</li>
            <li> When I first got this shaver a couple years ago, I hadn&#x27;t had an electric shaver before. I had nothing to compare it to. I thought, &amp;#34;Not bad, much better than shaving my thighs with a disposable.&amp;#34; Well, it broke about six months ago (a metal piece popped out). I didn&#x27;t bother getting a replacement until a couple weeks ago, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t replace it with the same shaver. I got the Braun Silk Epil: twice the price but a million times worth it. This Panasonic Close Curves is bulky and plasticky. The pop-up razor really doesn&#x27;t work efficiently. In fact, that&#x27;s the problem with the entire shaver--it&#x27;s inefficient. The double foil doesn&#x27;t allow for curves; it just cannot be used on underarms and is difficult around knees and ankles. I was okay with the lame shave on my thighs just because it&#x27;s a huge pain to use the disposable there, and it&#x27;s finer hair than my calves, so a not-so-close shave was okay. I give props for the idea of the adjustable bikini trimmer attachment--I just wish it worked and trimmed the hair. I was using scissors instead until I got my new shaver, which has a great bikini trimmer attachment, though not adjustable. This really isn&#x27;t a *terrible* shaver (it does cut your hair!), but once you use a *great* shaver, you realize just how incredibly SUB-PAR this one is.</li>
            <li> As a shaver, I suppose this is as good as you can get with an electric.  I still prefer the old fashioned razor blade and shaving gel method for the closest shave.  Recently, I tried out the bikini trimmer attachment, and it completely tore my bikini area apart.  I bled all over the place.  So, as a close shaver, it&#x27;s alright, but use extreme caution if you&#x27;re going to use it as a trimmer.  It might be alright for others, as I have extremely sensitive skin... but I definitely won&#x27;t be using it that way again.</li>
            <li> This works great, its true it doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor, but it does a pretty good job! Its very easy to use and it feels good in my hand.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased roughly 4 weeks ago ! Long story short its great ! surprisingly nice close smooth shave!!! I tried both in and out of the shower ill say the best results were when dry. Quick suggestion or tip use body scrub before !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great deal for a great price !!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver based on the excellent reviews, and to switch from a Remington that didn&#x27;t shave very closely. What a disappointment. I like the shape, but it leaves very long stubble, not smooth at all. The on/off buttons and head are really cheap plastic. The blades did not last very long, and the replacement blades and foil cost more than buying a new shaver. I will be buying a different brand intead of refilling, probably back to Remington.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing shaver, ladies! I was skeptical at first but once I read all of the reviews, I decided to try it out for myself. The price is not bad either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer using it dry just because I find it easier to manuever it but you can certainly use it in the shower as well. To test it out, I used it on a small area on my arm and it worked beautifully. Then I used it on my legs. Great results. I also used it on the bikini area but keep in mind that I trimmed first and then shaved. I have to say, I thought I&#x27;d be in for a lot of irritation or pain, but guess what? There was no irritaion and there certainly was no pain at all! I didn&#x27;t even have to apply any ointment on the area. There is no itchy feeling like I used to get with my other disposable razor. I recommend this product to you 100%. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because blade razors usually give me razor bumps. This product worked great for the first two times but on my third use it started pinching my skin, grabbing and pulling the hair on my bikini line... if i wanted my hair pulled out i would get waxed... extremely painful. It also doesn&#x27;t hold the charge for a long time. The swivel head seems like a great idea but it doesn&#x27;t work well, such a waste of time and money because i plan to put it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This is the second I&#x27;ve bought from amazon. They work well, are very easy to clean, and above all, maintain a reasonable price coming from a manufacturer like Panasonic. Recommended</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying a shaver and after careful consideration I decided on this one and I&#x27;m very pleased!  It&#x27;s very gentle and I&#x27;ve used it on my legs, underarms and bikini line.  It&#x27;s also super easy to clean and very easy to manage.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking to try a shaver.</li>
            <li> It is a bit noisy and the plug in charger is clumsy. Otherwise it does what it is advertised to do and does it better than other shavers that I have tried.</li>
            <li> This thing is pointless. My big idea was to be able to shave out of the shower b/c my toddler gets impatient waiting for me. Figured it would be a great time saver. I go over one place slowly and nothing! I get maybe a few strands. I spend MORE TIME going over one spot then I would doing my whole bottom half of one leg with the razor. Of course a razor has better results that last longer too. Don&#x27;t even get me started on the bikini trimmer. First you think it might just need adjust since it has 3 levels of height. Nope!! Forget it. Wasting more time. Just get the darn trimmers out and razor and be done with it. This thing stinks! What a waste of money. Electric razors just never work is what I conclude.</li>
            <li> This shaver is just what I was needing. I do not have a lot of hair on my legs and hated shaving in the tub. This shaver got as close as using a razor and it is so convenient. I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower but why would you when it works so well, out of the shower. I love it!</li>
            <li> I used it for about a month and then just stopped using it because it was so big and clunky. Also it took FOREVER to get one clean shaven spot. I mainly used it for my bikini area and it irritated my skin just like a regular razor does. I have super sensitive skin in my bikini area and it just didn&#x27;t work out. To use on the legs its good, but again to get around the knees it&#x27;s a bit tricky and I needed to pass over the same spot multiple times. It didn&#x27;t cut me which was good but I just hate taking a lot of time to remove hair. Resorted to waxing and I am way happier now :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about five months and originally wrote a glowing 5-star review of it. It worked great, except for the battery charge (instead of 12 hours, it lasted on average 45 minutes per charge). After five months, however, when shaving my arm-pit, I felt a sharp pain. It turned out that the blade closest to the bikini pop-out trimmer had partially popped out and had given me a pretty big cut. I am not sure whether this malfunction was a very rare exception or not (judging by other reviews, it seems like it may be),but it shook me up (I&#x27;d hate to think what may have happened if I were using it on a more sensitive area, which it is advertised for). Amazon, however, has been very prompt with the response to my complaint and has promised to issue a full refund. I hope this is an exception to an otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> Awesome ladies shaver.  I have tried other shavers made for men, and they just wouldn&#x27;t work well on leg hair.</li>
            <li> As many of the previous reviews have said, it will NOT leave your legs super-smooth the way a non-electic razor does.  It is the same with guy&#x27;s face razors, otherwise everyone would just use electrical ones, duh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said this one works really well for the price.  I use it instead of a normal razor if I&#x27;m in a hurry and just want to make sure I have no visible hair.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic I have bought. The angle of the design is perfect; it never seems awkward and the size and weight feel natural - not too heavy or bulky.  The bikini attachment is great also.  I order from Amazon as this razor is almost impossible to find anywhere else.  Don&#x27;t know why as it is the best out there for the price.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared in buying this item due the reviews on Amazon, but I took a chance and I am very happy. The charge last a long time and charges quickly. While it does a little more time to get the shave that I like, bikini  the attachment is great. Another selling point for me is that Amazon sell the replacement parts. Overall this is a great product and I am sorry that did not buy sooner.</li>
            <li> I have an old Remington razor that is 10 years old.  Went by the recommendations, should have stuck with experience.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more expensive shaver like my husband&#x27;s, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like there are any for women. If my leg hair gets too long (like in the winter), I use my husband&#x27;s attachment to get the hairs close enough to shave with this Panasonic. Shaving with electric does take a few months to get used to, and you never get as close of a shave as with a disposable one. But I like electric so much better now, because I don&#x27;t feel like I have to shave every other day anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver&#x27;s swiveling head is useful because it moves with the curve of the leg. You do have to go over the same section of leg to get it smooth, but that&#x27;s expected with electric. It takes a bit of time to shave, but I don&#x27;t have to shave very often, so it&#x27;s worth it. Great product, especially for the price. I purchased an additional set of foils at the same time, but haven&#x27;t had to use them yet.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver!  It is the quietest ever and it gives a really smooth shave.  This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had, though I detest the color (pink).  Not all women love pink.</li>
            <li> It was a great price, although it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for long, I wish that it was a closer shave, I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with item it does not shave well at all</li>
            <li> I hemmed and hawed before buying this here on Amazon. Was looking for a nickel-free razor option because I was trying to figure out why my legs itched so much after shaving. The itching didn&#x27;t stop, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a nickel allergy. But I have really liked this razor for what it is. No, you simply can&#x27;t expect the close shave of a razor blade. But I was pleasantly surprised by how close it is able to get. Never tried the wet option. Dry has worked well for me. Even now that I know I can go back to regular razor blades (knowing I have no allergic reaction), I find myself more often than not using this electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a seasoned user of electric shavers, and this is at the bottom of the heap.  I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic shavers for about 12 years now and never has the battery life/closeness been so poor.  From the very first shave, I barely made it through one shave before needing to recharge.  I followed the directions and allowed the shaver to fully charge before the first use.  Perhaps part of the problem is the closeness of the shave is so poor that I have to make multiple passes for each section.  The multiple passes extends total shave time by several minutes and therefore forces recharging after each shave.  I will never again purchase this shaver and recommend you seek other options for your shaving needs.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this works well and great price ..</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver this is my second one I purchased and Ali am very pleased</li>
            <li> LOVE it! Should have invested in an electric razor years ago.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver as an upgrade. I have bought the \\&quot;Close Curves rechargeable Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver\\&quot; 3 times in the past (they die about once every 18 months) and thought this would be better and was only a few bucks more. But I was wrong. The trimmer is difficult to push up and down, hair clogs in the trimmer and is impossible to get out. The other blades are pretty useless because the pivoting head makes it difficult to create any pressure for a close shave. It doesn&#x27;t keep its charge either. This is the first out of hundreds of products I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon that I am unsatisfied with. Unfortunately they won&#x27;t let me return it either. What a waste of $30, Amazon customer service is usually great, but this has been a disappointing experience to say the least.</li>
            <li> Update 2012.5.17: I had to downgrade it from a 5 star because dry it no longer aggressively shaves my legs, leaves lots of stray hairs, and even painfully pulls some hairs. Wet use is better but still not as good as I like. I keep it well cleaned and rinsed and haven&#x27;t done anything abusive at all. I have a pretty old Norelco rotary shaver that still work fine. Not too happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion is to go buy a Norelco like this wet/dry one as I just did. Yes it costs more but it&#x27;s the best ever and no frustrations! I used a Norelco before for leg shaving and it just doesn&#x27;t get any better for an electric shaver than a Norelco! If you haven&#x27;t used one before it takes some getting used to but once you&#x27;ve used in for a couple weeks or so you&#x27;ll love it. I first bought a Norelco back in the 90&#x27;s and it was the best ever. I&#x27;m totally done with these \\&quot;body\\&quot; or \\&quot;ladies\\&quot; shavers\\&quot;! They&#x27;re junk. The last 2 shavers I&#x27;ve had for my legs worked good for a while and then would leave lots of hair and stubble and start painfully pulling hairs.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Philips-AT810-PowerTouch-Rechargeable-Cordless/dp/B006GQYSC8/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1337298564&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Review: I just tried this shaver using it dry on my legs and trimming up my strip of pubic hair and loved the results. It shaves down clean and smooth with little more than one pass because of the larger multi-foil head and that means less time shaving. My other not cheap shavers would need me to shave 2 or 3 times longer and not feel as smooth or leave stray hairs. I mean for instance you&#x27;re blurry eyed in the morning and shave your legs, pull a skirt and pumps on and get to the office. You have great legs and people really notice them and then as you sip your coffee you notice some stray hairs or stubble. Ugh, it&#x27;s so annoying! The quality looks really good and the way the head foils float and pivot seems to keep it on the skin better than other shavers I&#x27;ve used. I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll leave updates later...ong with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll leave updates later...</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Easy to use and versatile. It comes with clear instructios to use it and take care of it. Will Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> my former shaver no longer charged after two years....so wanted to try a different make.  So far I like it... and it gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this in preparation for our annual mid winter waterpark trip. Didn&#x27;t want to have to mess with hyper-chlorinated water and freshly shaved legs/bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll never be as smooth as a razor shave, but it&#x27;s SO worth it to not have to deal with the razor burn and unrelenting itch of growing-back hair at the bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works quickly, efficiently, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver to anyone. The batteries die frequently and unless you shave your legs from all possible angles, it just leaves your legs stubbly.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this shaver. In and out of the shower its fantastic. The adjustable head and bikini attachment works perfect.</li>
            <li> Get the blue one istead</li>
            <li> I never considered an electric razor until I borrowed someone elses.  I chose this particular one because of the feedback and I am not disappointed.  I was amazed at how close the shave was with no pulling.  What a great thing for in between and quick shaves. I can&#x27;t comment on the battery as I haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet, but I&#x27;ve told all of my friends about this and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Basically, this electric razor is functioning, meaning it turns on and off, but it really is pretty useless! It leaves a lot of hair behind- especially with my underarms (but happens with my legs too), I have to go over the same spot several times before it even gets half of the hairs. It also immediately leaves stubble, and doesn&#x27;t get a remotely close shave at all. And if there are any fine hairs, just forget it! Definitely looking for a better one...</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this shaver.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a pretty good job, but not as close a shave as I would like when dry.  A wet shave seems to do better.  The charge lasts for 4 - 5 shaves.  When charging, there is no green light to tell you the shaver is charged as it remains red. It is comfortable to hold while shaving and the head moves up and down nicely on your legs.</li>
            <li> Shave not as close as I had anticipated it would be.  It is much heavier than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> It will get hair off you body but not nearly as close as a regular razor. I found using shaving creams is still better than shaving completely dry as it will cut closer.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can use it dry and also like  that it  fits a woman&#x27;s hands nicely.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well especially for the money. But, it did pull my hair a bit, but I could&#x27;ve been going too fast.</li>
            <li> This razor does the best when used dry. I tried use it in the shower and it did not shave that well. It is a little top heavy and bulky, the charger is also very awkwardly shaped. Overall, it gets the job done and I have not had any skin irritation like other shavers that claim to be made for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t like. It takes her more time to do her legs.</li>
            <li> Performs nicely for my wife.  She really likes the trimmer attachment.&lt;br /&gt;And, it shaves close with comfort.</li>
            <li> Shaver works fine - not as close as I would like when doing underarms.  I haven&#x27;t tried the bikini attachment yet.  Is adequate for the money.  Next time might spring for a more expensive one.  Works better wet with shaving cream than dry.</li>
            <li> After not having used an electric razor for years, I decided to try this one. I&#x27;m glad I did. It works well.</li>
            <li> This review was written by my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews I was quite excited about this razor.  However, after using it, I quickly became very unhappy with my purchase.  I do not feel that it works very well, and it takes many times of use in the same spot to remove even a limited amout of hair. My legs were red and soar after use. I would not recommend this razor to anyone,</li>
            <li> I probably have coarser hair on my legs than most ladies, and this shaver did not cut it at all.  Amazon is very good about returns and it went right back with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;The hairs on my legs were short and spiky and should have been easy for a shaver to grasp, but this one did not work.  I had to buy a Norelco men&#x27;s razor with 3-rotating heads, which is what I always used in the past (borrowed from my husband).</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> It does not do the job. Very disappointed in this product. I expected more. From the moment I used it, it was weak, it does not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but the one downside is the battery only lasts about 45 days. I&#x27;ve been using this shaver as a disposable every month and a half. The battery just kaputs and slows waaaaaaaayyyy down, and then it takes 45 minutes just to do your lower legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works great. No nicks, and you can do it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware that the batteries are crappy, and not replaceable on this model.</li>
            <li> First one lasted 5 months - just quit working.  Traded it in for a replacement, and that one did the same thing - don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> My first electric at 60+.  Why did I wait so long to get one of these?  I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li> It works fine, I don&#x27;t see any problems with it, it may a little heavy, but gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, does a very poor job. I can barely tell a difference after using this razor. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money with this product.</li>
            <li> This shaver does what it says it will do, but not that well. It tugs and pulls, and can be uncomfortable when working on your bikini area. Doesn&#x27;t provide much of a close shave either. I have probably used it a handful of times since I purchased it.</li>
            <li> My wife barely uses this shaver because it either doesn&#x27;t cut well or cuts her skin.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> i was fooled tothink that the bikini attachment was a shaving part as well as no where did it say it isnt. until i received the item and i saw that its just a trimmer and it didnt work on me at all</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because I do not have enough hot water in my apartment to shave in the shower. I have used it as a dry shaver for a few weeks now, and it&#x27;s completely useless. The shave is not close at all, and I can always both see and feel stubble after using this shaver. I would be uncomfortable going outside in shorts after using this shaver. I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver does a great job!  Perfect for what I needed it for and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Wife hated it, and it would never sit properly in the charger.</li>
            <li> I have tried battery operated shavers in the past, but none of them gave me a close shave.  The Panasonic shaver gives me a close, smooth shave -- almost like shaving with a razor, but without the nicks and bumpy rash.  I like the fact that it comes with a charger -- no more replacing batteries.  I would recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a quality and affordable product.</li>
            <li> The shaver is nice! Now I usually don&#x27;t pay a lot for them but this purchase was worth it. The only thing thats annoying is that I have to have it fully charged in order for it to completely do its job. Plus the charger does not signal to me when its charged nor does the shaver, so I usually leave it in for an hour before I use it again. It sure beats constantly buying batteries though! The shaver is able to get small hairs out with no problem as long as it is very close to the root of the hairs. I have not tried it in my shower though and do not plan to. I do not want to risk it. But if I ever do I will keep in update with this review. Enjoy the shaver and the extra components that come with it because they are helpful as well if you ever decide to use them! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this having used other electric shavers. I like this for legs, and at times pits, but I was not impressed with the Bikini popup and I have been able to trim, but not able to shave it clean.  Not looking for a really close shave, just looking for controlled and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the charging station -- It is one small box that has a plug built right into the box.  The top of the box has the adapter that plugs directly into the shaver.  This battery holds the charge well.  I have taken it off the plug when I feel it is charged, and set it aside for a couple days before I used it again.  It is easy to use in and out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t shave as finely as a razor, but you avoid the nicks that are common with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;The bikini attachment is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t tear at hairs.</li>
            <li> It is bigger than the one I bought in Japan several years ago, but works fine.</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver. Skin looks nice and clean after shaving - not razor smooth, but no visible stubble either. There has been no more razor burn for me and previous razor bumps are healing quickly. I&#x27;ve only had this shaver for a couple of weeks and it has worked very nicely, but its long term quality is still to be tested. Even if this shaver does not stand the test of time, I am already a convert and will research a more premium model.</li>
            <li> good but it doesn&#x27;t shave well  and sometimes it injure specially when  when the battery low&lt;br /&gt; the good part it&#x27;s very fast when the battery is full</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver as an upgrade to the ES2207P (http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ES2207P-Curves-rechargeable-Ladies/dp/B0018A32XS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1344406659&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;panasonic+ladies+shaver) that I had for a few months. It worked well, but after a few months it started to stop working as well as it did and I decided not to give up on Panasonic but rather to try the next model up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I glad I did! Don&#x27;t be fooled, previous ES2207P owners, the ES2216PC is not just an improvement design-wise! (while I do love the revamped design and the stylish mauve charging dock). I was a little skeptic that this shaver was going to be THAT much better than the previous one, as it was just 10 dollars more. However, that first shave proved me wrong! It gave an amazingly close shave (comparative to the ES2207P), and caught ALL of the hairs in a line the first time. The efficiency saved so much time, and I feel like my shaves are probably half the time now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will warn you, they&#x27;re not lying when they say \\&quot;the sharpest blades.\\&quot; I was a little taken aback at first since I could actually FEEL the shave this time, rather than the ES2207P which would just drag over my skin. It would tingle a little, and was the tiniest bit painful in my more delicate zones. However, that is just the blades getting deeper and grabbing more of the hairs, and I would never trade that up. If you&#x27;re getting hurt, you&#x27;re probably pushing way too hard because the machine is designed to be painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must also address the noise concern: yes, this shaver is noisy, much louder than the ES2207P, so don&#x27;t plan on using it in the library! However, I get used to the sound very quickly, and since the shave is shorter, it doesn&#x27;t have to be on for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet used this shaver wet because it is just so much more convenient to use dry. My skin feels silky smooth, like when I used to use razors, and I am so grateful for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just in case you were too lazy to read or wanted a quick wrap-up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent, close shave (for an electric)&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean with simple instructions&lt;br /&gt;- No nicks or cuts&lt;br /&gt;- Long-lasting battery life&lt;br /&gt;- Attachable bikini trimmer with 3 settings plus head cover and cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Noisy/&gt;Just in case you were too lazy to read or wanted a quick wrap-up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent, close shave (for an electric)&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean with simple instructions&lt;br /&gt;- No nicks or cuts&lt;br /&gt;- Long-lasting battery life&lt;br /&gt;- Attachable bikini trimmer with 3 settings plus head cover and cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Noisy</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver a few times and found it work with an average affect.  There have been times that after shaving, my skin is somewhat rough and bumpy.  Also, I have had to go over certain areas several times to remove hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. It isn&#x27;t like typical electric razors that kind of pull the hair as it shaves, it&#x27;s painless and I love that! It&#x27;s easy to operate and it charges very quickly. If you&#x27;re a lady, you need to get this razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver holds its charge well and has never failed me. Granted it doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as a razor but it sure is nice for a quick cleanup!</li>
            <li> This product is a great shaver.  It holds the charge long and is very easy to use. With the long hair trimmer it easily cuts longer hair that the comb of the product won&#x27;t pick up.</li>
            <li> At last, an electric razor for women that approximates a blade!  A blade will always be closer, but this electric is close enough for me.  The price of blades is exorbitant, and they&#x27;ve become so large that it&#x27;s become difficult shave one&#x27;s underarms.  Also, for those of us who are no longer young (i.e., thin-skinned), this is a gentle and effective alternative.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver a lot.  Haven&#x27;t had any issues with &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; as some reviewers have said.  It does the job quite well, actually.  The only teeny downside is that is comes with a LOT of paperwork in about 90 languages that, after about 5 minutes, I decided to not read and so I tossed it.  After all, it&#x27;s not the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had and what is there to know??  I mean, you turn it on and shave with it, right?  So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Its wonderful!  don&#x27;t know why I have been using those cheap disposable razors all these years!  no worries about cutting yourself with this one.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this item as both a razor for my legs and to trim my bikini line.  This item worked ok as a razor for my legs (even though it wasn&#x27;t a close shave), but the bikini attachment is a joke.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money and just bought a less expensive electric razor and a different bikini trimmer that actually works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a year or two.  I still use it.  still runs strong.  battery still holds a good charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super sensitive skin, so I get bumps from razor shaving in sensitive areas.  I use the pop up trimmer for my bikini area and the long hairs on my upper thighs.  Gentle and quick.  No bumps, yay!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really use it for an all over shave, as it&#x27;s still faster and smoother just to razor shave up to the shorts line on my leg.  But if you keep it well cleaned, the trimmer edge works great.</li>
            <li> This is great.my wife is enjoying the fact that she dosent  get cut</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave very well.  I would not buy this product again</li>
            <li> For the price this is an excellent shaver for legs and underarms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done waxing. It&#x27;s expensive and painful. I&#x27;ve done shaving with a razor. It&#x27;s painful and grows back very fast and leaves me with ingrown hairs. I was looking for something in between - less expensive and less painful with no razor burn. If it&#x27;s something I could do regularly at home I didn&#x27;t really care how fast it grows back. This is the answer. It&#x27;s close enough in most areas - the areas that really matter - and didn&#x27;t hurt at all. No razor burn or ingrown hairs. I can use it every time I shower without a problem. Even if it died in a few months and has to be replaced, it&#x27;s still less expensive than waxing. I recommend this product for anyone looking for a close, inexpensive, painless hair removal option.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several electric shavers and this particular razor works extremely well.  It provides a very close dry shave without causing any razor burn.  I even tried it on my underarms and was very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is easy to clean and is holding up well even to minor abuse.  I dropped this razor from a height of approximately 3 feet to a hard floor surface and it is still working great.</li>
            <li> I have had this Shaver for about a month now, use it every other day.  Works great!  Leaves legs feeling smooth and works great under arms too.  I have tried it in the shower also, probably glides better when wet, but I prefer to use outside of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the shaver never looses power, always ready to go and stays charged during use.  I previously had a Conair razor which I loved but it would not keep its power when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great shaver for the money and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very positive experience with this razor, the first electric women&#x27;s shaver we ever bought. Convenient, simple, not a bit of trouble after four months of regular use.</li>
            <li> I made the decision to transition from shaving with razors to using this shaver. It gets the job done and i&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I like this thing. It works well, the charge lasts. I just don&#x27;t understand how to use the bikini accessory.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased with my purchase of the Panasonic ES2216PC Electric Razor. I developed a nickel allergy and could no longer use a regular razor, because none of them are nickel-free or hypoallergenic. This one caught my eye because it is specifically made nickel-free!! I like a nice close shave and figured I&#x27;d have to give that up by switching to an electric razor. I have found that if I am patient and use this shaver slower than my old regular razor I can still get a very close shave. If I race through the process I do not get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that this electric razor is fully immersible so that I can use it in the shower! I don&#x27;t have to give up my old habits while switching to an electric razor. I have found a wonderful shaving cream by Kiss My Face which I use with this electric razor; it gives my legs a silky feeling while I am shaving. There is a pop up blade for longer hair and a bikini trimmer attachment. This shaver is rechargeable and the charge lasts for a few shaves before needing a recharge. You don&#x27;t have to charge it after every use. I can highly recommend this as a high quality razor, particularly for people with sensitive skin or nickel allergies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000FQ2C8M Kiss My Face Moisture Shave, Fragrance Free, 11 oz]]</li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaver worked great. my sister really loved using it ,easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Works as it should for legs.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used an electric shaver for years and am very pleased with this shaver.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but it does the job - with no nicks!</li>
            <li> Wish it could take full range input (90V-240V) - That would have made it clutter free and easy to use internationally. These small things are so simple, yet not incorporated in design! What a shame..:(</li>
            <li> takes many passes to get a &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; shave with coarse hair. holds a charge well. easy to hold and use. had to change blades after only 1.5 months.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my girlfriend so she would stop using my Panasonic shaver.  After a few uses, she has gone back to using mine.  She claims the pop-up trimmer makes using the trimmer uncomfortable since it&#x27;s at the same level as the other blades compared to my shaver&#x27;s pop-up trimmer which is below the level of the main blades.  It cuts well but unfortunately is poorly designed.  If she didn&#x27;t tell me after the 30 day return period had passed I would have definitely returned it.  Oh well....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once, it doesn&#x27;t get close like a razor on your legs, but it does good enough for the bikini area and you don&#x27;t get razor bumps from it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for Mom&#x27;s day and now it&#x27;s 6 weeks later and she loves it! As far as closeness, speed, and comfort, she says 5 stars on all.&lt;br /&gt;The only flaw we noticed is the charging socket. It&#x27;s touchy getting the razor balanced on the charger to get the charge lite to come on.&lt;br /&gt;And the charge lite is on all the time, not like my other rechargeables. Not what I would expect from an old reliable company like Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;I like using the Bikini trimmer, she lets me do that - works good...</li>
            <li> Used razor 3 times, and the motor burned out. This product is definitely not water proof like it is advertised.</li>
            <li> The charger for this product plugs directly into the wall plug in/outlet. The charger is a little cube that allows for the shaver to sit right on top of the cube when it is plugged into the wall plug in. If the wall plug in has a north south orientation for receiving the plug, the charger will not work properly. The shaver when plugged in for charging needs to be vertical, the north/south orientation only allows for a horizontal position. I had to spend 7more $s to correct the orientation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic should have allowed to this problem and included a fix! If I knew this prior to purchase I would not have bought. We will see how my fix works? If not satisfied the shaver will be returned!!</li>
            <li> This is a good inexpensive wet or dry shaver, it is a perfect gift and is easy to use any where</li>
            <li> My wive loves this razor.  She says it shaves closer than her previous electric razors with no nicks at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a trimmer (rather than a shaver) and it is NOT effective for that purpose. Hair easily gets caught and pulled. Not satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor...can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been going for years without one. No, it isn&#x27;t super close but when you want to be lazy, it&#x27;s PERFECT!!!</li>
            <li> I recently started taking blood thinners and decided to try this in place of a&lt;br /&gt;conventional razor. I love this shaver! Cuts almost as close as a razor and&lt;br /&gt;no more cuts!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used one of these before, so when it same in the mail I read the instructions and went and tried it out that night. I don&#x27;t know if you are supposed to go over the same place 10 times, but it took way too long. Never used it since. :/</li>
            <li> Had high hopes about this electric razor, as I wanted an alternative to regular razors since I get bad razor burn.  I&#x27;ve had other electric razors in the past, and I can hands down say this is the worst one I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Pulls hair when shaving or using the trimming attachment!  Doesn&#x27;t get nearly as close as I&#x27;d like, and I have cut myself more times than I can count.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice razor, but my only concern is that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t really give a close shave. I find myself having to run over the area several times and then still use an alternative razor to get the rest off.  Overall the razor is nice, sensitive to my skin, and works well for the most part.  Also, I  find it better to shave dry then wet.</li>
            <li> I love this charger. I haven&#x27;t experienced an issue yet! I fully charged it once and it still has a charge over four months later. It&#x27;s not as close as a wax job but does a decent job.</li>
            <li> I should have updated my electric razor sooner.  This does a great job for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver 2 or 3 times over the years after having a hard time choosing a women&#x27;s shaver that seemed to work well at a reasonable price.  Each time, the ES2216PC would work ok for a few months, but before long the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 1 or 2 shaves, and in general just seemed to underperform, not leaving my legs very smooth.  I would buy a new one (since the replacement parts were expensive compared to the price of a new shaver, and the battery wasn&#x27;t holding a charge, and there didn&#x27;t seem to be many options) and repeat the frustration.  No more.  I found the solution in my husband&#x27;s drawer - buy a men&#x27;s shaver.  I purchased the Panasonic ES-LT41-K (the same one my hubby has used happily for over a year), and after using it several months, will never buy another pink shaver targeted at women again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down, the men&#x27;s shaver is better.  Although more expensive (yet still reasonably priced, imo) than the women&#x27;s shaver, the ES-LT41-K delivers much better value.  I am still amazed that, unlike the ES2216PC, this thing can be used daily for well over a week before needing a charge.  (And the recharge is blazing fast - no more leaving my shaver charging overnight to barely get one decent shave before the motor is slowing down.)  It delivers a closer shave, and is quite comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, save your money and just buy a men&#x27;s shaver instead.</li>
            <li> As a woman of a certain age, this is great to buzz around my face once or twice a week between facials.  It keeps me neat and tidt.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, and my wife seemed to like it okay for the time it worked, but it&#x27;s difficult to tell sometimes how honest the recipient is being. Anyway, I do know that it wasn&#x27;t long before we started having trouble with it&#x27;s connection to the charger, having to wiggle it some to get it to make proper contact. It eventually failed to charge at all after about a year of very moderate use. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an electric razer i could use on my bikini area that would trim the hair and so i would no longer have to get razer burn. I have very thick hair and it worked fine when i first started using it. After about a month it didn&#x27;t work as well and would die quickly. I have gone back to just regular razers and now its just collecting dust.</li>
            <li> I like the closeness of the shave without getting to close, They are convenient to use and handy as well.</li>
            <li> It looks a bit large and clunky, but is actually very gentle when using it. Works very well and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my wife. It arrived ahead of schedule and my wife says it does a great job shaving her legs and underarms.</li>
            <li> great razor easy to use and reliable holds its charge well gives you a close clean shave every time I love it</li>
            <li> Not a great razor, but not horrible. Bought it to replace another electric that wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore. This one worked well for six months or so before it began slowing down and pulling on hairs instead of actually cutting them. Even when it was working, it did require several passes to remove hair from an area. You can probably do better.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  It really cuts good.  I had tried several models of another brand, and I couldn&#x27;t tell I had used it.  The only thing I am not crazy about is that it doesn&#x27;t have a charging station, if just has a plug for the wall that you put the razor in,  it does not work well at my house based on the way my outlets are setup.</li>
            <li> I bought a similar razor (same brand) a couple of years ago and liked it very much. This one, though priced higher, does not seem to be as good. It does an okay job of shaving my legs if I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to shave in the regular wet, shaving cream fashion, but I can still feel some stubble. After reading all the good reviews, I thought this would be at least as good, if not better, than my other shaver, but it is sadly lacking. Sorry, but I would not buy this item again.</li>
            <li> Although this is not a replacement for shaving altogether for me, it works great in the shower as an in-between shaves, don&#x27;t need to be 100% silky smooth, just don&#x27;t want ppl to be able to see hair, kind of shave. I have courser hair that needs to be shaved every 1-1.5 days to be presentable - using this item dry does not do me much good but using it in the shower is beneficial.</li>
            <li> Update: 1-3-15&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this February 25, 2014.  I have tried to like it, but I can&#x27;t.  The trimmer of course didn&#x27;t work at all.  If I let the leg hairs get too long they yank at the hairs and it takes forever to shave it all.  I will go over and over the same spot many times trying to cut a hair it missed and it still won&#x27;t cut it.  Basically by the time the charge runs out both my legs look half shaved (I don&#x27;t mean one half smooth, just looks like I have less hair over all) and I still have to use a manual razor to finish shaving so I still get cuts in the end.  The metal parts on the edge I guess are meant to lift the hairs up but they just end up scraping my skin.  I had an old man&#x27;s facial electric razor (10 years old at least).  It didn&#x27;t hold a charge long and the blades were original and probably dulled but it did a better job than this one.  Since it has finally kicked the bucket, I will try to find one that is similar.  This razor seems like the maker hates women and likes us to be tortured.  Just get a man&#x27;s electric razor.  If it is good enough for their smooth, curvy, tender faces it is good enough for our legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: (I had just switched from an epilator so anything felt better)  I don&#x27;t use this in the shower, dry only.  If it has been a while and the hairs are long they pull a little but over all it makes my legs look very smooth.  It isn&#x27;t as close as a manual razor but it doesn&#x27;t cut me up or give me ingrown hairs like waxing or epilating.  I did not give it 5 stars because it advertises the trimmer.  I put the attachment on and went over the area again and again and it just didn&#x27;t cut anything.  I just borrow my husbands beard trimmer if I need to do that.  I didn&#x27;t really buy it for that so I am not too upset.</li>
            <li> The shaver was the updated version of what the recipient owner previously......it was 5 years old and just &amp;#34;ran out of gas&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;She liked the old one also and didn&#x27;t want to change brands.  The gift was well received and is being used without any complaints.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and keeps you well groomed! Great for underarms legs and grooming napes!&lt;br /&gt;The best electric razor I ever had!</li>
            <li> I have tried it totally dry and wet with water, gel, foam, and body wash nothing makes it work well. It misses most of the hairs and you have to go over the same spot several times to get a hair to cut. Do not buy...</li>
            <li> Overall, this has been a good purchase for me. I&#x27;ve had my Panasonic shaver for at least two years with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great for underarms, arms, (and bikini)! You can get into all the curves with the floating head and the shave is not so close that you get ingrown hairs or razor-burns. I find it works equally well in and out of the shower, with shaving cream or plain soap. The trimmer attachment is great as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: As others have mentioned, this shaver misses tons of hairs. For a small area, like underarms, this isn&#x27;t a problem since you can make several passes to get them all. BUT, forget legs! Unless you want to spend 10-15 minutes (and the entire battery charge) going back and forth! (Even then, I still have more &amp;#34;prickles&amp;#34; than I can stand) (FYI: I have really coarse hair on my legs so those with softer hair may have a totally different experience.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want something quick, easy, and reliable for small areas and have sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t like razors, then I 100% recommend this! But use something else for your legs.</li>
            <li> I used it twice but found it to be uncomfortable. I guess it&#x27;s back to the search for the ideal ladies&#x27; shaver.</li>
            <li> Good product, I personally don&#x27;t like the pivoting head but others might. Good quality. I like the charger stand (it plugs into an outlet and the razor stands on top). Cuts well and doesn&#x27;t bog down.</li>
            <li> Amazing, is the word I would use to describe this razor. I definitely recommend using this razor wet, however for a quick shave dry works good too. I always used regular razor blades because I thought electric razors weren&#x27;t very effective, this razor proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading reviews. I have never used an electric razor that works like a real blade; amazing. Exfoliating and moisturizing, as other reviewers recommended provides even better results. Lasts a couple days with dark hair. Will be telling all my lady friends to buy one.</li>
            <li> not as good as the one I had before.  Fair price if it was really good. Sellers part was great.</li>
            <li> Not the best shave. But it is fast and it beats all the cuts I get from traditional razors.</li>
            <li> Right Size right everything!!!</li>
            <li> I cannot get a close shave with it.  Using it dry (if I have ti use shaving cream,. I&#x27;ll use a blade).  Keeps a good charge and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> I buy the panasonic ES2207P for my wife a few months ago, and it works perfect, close shave, almost like an ordinary razor, without the irritation, so i decide to try with this other one that have and extra foil and pivot head, i must say that it works as expected, close shave and no irritation, can use it on the tub, on the shower, and dry, i think it&#x27;s better on dry skin, but if you don&#x27;t have much time to shave and have to use it on the shower it&#x27;s works fine</li>
            <li> Works well! If you want touch smooth legs for your man though, get a five blade razor or something. But this works great for last minute beach legs!!!</li>
            <li> This small handy razor give close cuts and no more cuts. It works so well that my granddaugher had to have one too so I bought two of them. Good to have, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth finish. I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting from an electric razor, but I really expected better than this. My mother used to have an electric razor from 20 years ago that worked better...</li>
            <li> I bought this razor back in June, and it was fine. However, after only 4 months (maybe using it twice a week), it is terrible. I run over and over the same area and no hair comes off. I&#x27;ve ordered a new Replacement Shaver Foil and Blade Set, so we&#x27;ll see if that solves the problem. If it does and I have to replace it every 4 months, I&#x27;m going to be upset. Also, I found the set cheaper on 1800 parts dot com with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: I&#x27;ve replaced the foils, which doesn&#x27;t seem to have fixed the problem. There are also no instructions on the web that I can find on how to replace them - we had to take a tiny screw driver and pry out the old ones. The new ones seem to pull on my skin/hair. I think I might just try a men&#x27;s razor. I&#x27;m sad this is the best reviewed women&#x27;s electric razor. It seems like my old one that bit the dust was much better.</li>
            <li> I was rather disappointed with this electric shaver. I found that it does not shave as closely or as evenly as previous electric shavers I&#x27;ve used. I noticed that regardless of the angle I held the shaver at, the left side of the shaver would always work better than the right, making it so that I had to repeat the area multiple times.  Also, the blades seem to go dull very quickly- afte about a month and a half of moderate use! After that time, the shaver kept pulling the hair instead of shaving it, leading to an unpleasant experience and numerous bumps and redspots. The one advantage to this shaver is the wet/dry function which is very useful for using in the shower. Overall, I would say that this is an okay shaver for the price, but if you can afford it, get a slightly more expensive and higher quality shaver that will shave evenly.</li>
            <li> My wife wondered how she ever got along without this. No more bloody ankles or knees. She is quite pleased and plans on getting our daughters their own.</li>
            <li> If your hair is fine and baby like, you have to go over and over the hair repeatedly to get it off. I guess I am going to stick to shaving with a razor which seems to work best. However, my sister tried it on her legs, and she liked it a lot so I gave it to her.</li>
            <li> I have been a prime member for quite a while now and I shop at Amazon a lot but this is the first time I wrote a review. I was disappointed when I got the Shaver yesterday, the box was already open. It looked like it had been cut open at the bottom with a pair of scissors. I did not expect Amazon to send me an open box when it says in the description it&#x27;s new. I dislike the hassle of returning and reordering stuff, thus, I did not bother to return it.</li>
            <li> I bought because it was Panasonic and had good reviews on various websites.&lt;br /&gt;The recipient has said it is very easy to use and does a good, non-irritating job.</li>
            <li> Only used a few times for bikini trimming (wet/dry). Overall, works well and not as painful as other hair removal methods. Keep it charged when not using it so haven&#x27;t experienced performance issues.</li>
            <li> The price was perfect, the quality was more that what I expected, and the color has a nice soft look</li>
            <li> This shaver wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore after three months.  We followed the instructions about charging and it still didn&#x27;t last.  Called Panasonic and they said there was nothing they could do about it.  Girl on the phone was kinda rude as well.  It worked well when it was working...</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife.  After reading many glowing reviews, I was satisfied with going ahead to make the purchase.  Now that it has been a few months, I feel like it is time to review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself seems a bit &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;, since most of the parts are made of plastic, and it isn&#x27;t quite as heavy as the Phillips Norelco Men&#x27;s shaver which I have.  Having mentioned this, the razor does function well as intended!  It will cut (wet or dry), however, it will never compete with a straight razor, as this razor seems to leave a little &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34;.  In a pinch, it does the job, however.  My wife has complained that it&#x27;s tough to get the hair in the arm-pits and around the ankles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I believe it was worth it.  You can take it through security at the airport (which has come in handy multiple times), and you don&#x27;t have to jump in the shower in order to shave when you are running out of time.  I docked one star due to the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; construction.</li>
            <li> Best comfortable razor.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor but, I have very sensitive skin and it took me a few times before I learned where I could use this without irritation. That being said, if I can use it practically anyone can. The bikini trimmer is not all that effective but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using a shaver on anyplace as sensitive as that anyway. So, yes, not perfect but a seriously good razor at a very good price.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES2216C is hands down the best women&#x27;s electric shaver I&#x27;ve had in years.  I was a long time user of the Lady Remington shavers but the last two I bought didn&#x27;t last a year and never gave me the close shave that my old Lady Remington shaver did.  This Panasonic shaves as close as my old Lady Remington did and is far superior to the Lady Remington shavers available today.</li>
            <li> so I tried it against my shaver and my shaver cut closer.  I am the husband and used a mans electric Braun Series 3 340 and have it for years and it cuts close and the ladies shaver I purchased it because it had good ratings. So my razer wins over the split between my wife and daughter.</li>
            <li> I love it, it cuts close and has a good charge, as well as easy to handle (even for a mobility limited person). Nothing cuts as close as a razor, but this is the closest ive ever found. I highly recommend this razor if you prefer power shavers to actual razors.</li>
            <li> Durable, effective: would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the worst shaver that I have ever purchased in my entire life!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t even shave your skin clean.&lt;br /&gt;No matter if you keep shaving over and over, the result is the same.&lt;br /&gt;I am not pleased at all.&lt;br /&gt;Really wish I could get a refund or choose some other item.</li>
            <li> Does not shave closely.  When used on pubic hair, ended up looking like a poor dog hair cut.  Too large.  Old one worked better.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, works great wet or dry. The closest shave from an electric razor I have ever found. I have not used the bikini attachment yet but I&#x27;m sure it works as well as the rest.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition that makes razor shaving difficult.  I have used several electric razors over the years and this one is excellent.  Shave is smooth, fast, recharge lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t nick skin.  For an electric razor, I would highly recommend.  Price I purchased it for was excellent, far less than retail stores.</li>
            <li> I only have used this in dry conditions and for camping. Much easier than a razor and hot water. It doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor, but as I said. It does the job. Sherry:)</li>
            <li> I was expecting a closer shave to be honest.. it takes it down to the worst day. It takes you straight back to the 2 day after shave.</li>
            <li> Razor broke and would not work after about 2 weeks of use.  The &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; switch seemed to be the issue.  Also, razor was so wide (versus the similar razor with only 1 foil) that I could not get a good shave in my underarms or around my knees. Still using my old version of this with just the 1 foil.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Can shave arm pits in less than 5 minutes with or without water.  Great for quick leg shaving</li>
            <li> Is not really worth the money spent. Leaves too much stubble.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I have ever used. It exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my mom. So far she seems to be enjoying it and has no complaints thus far. She likes the wet/dry feature and says it is easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s very slow and does not do a good job. I&#x27;ve gone back to using a razor.</li>
            <li> I have owned and used  this same shaver for years and with no problems. The one I ordered from here had a charger that plugs into and hangs on the electrical outlet. After a couple of uses, there is a little clip in the charger that broke off and would no longer hold or charge the shaver. The only reason I did not return it was because I used the shaving parts on my old one. It has a charger with a cord and sits on a shelf. I have had that one for over 6 years and it still works great. They messed up when they changed or  redesigned the charger. If you find one with a charger that has a cord, I would recommend it highly, but not this one.</li>
            <li> Great razor for the price, but I needed to go over each area on my legs several times to remove all the hair.</li>
            <li> What a complete waste of money. I only bought it to remove the little bits that I can&#x27;t see to get with a regular razor. Apparently that&#x27;s too much to ask of this piece of junk. I can run this &amp;#34;gem&amp;#34; over a single piece of hair over and over in different directions and WOW, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to cut a thing!! Amazing.</li>
            <li> Eazy to use and eazy to clean. Great results!</li>
            <li> I remember electric razors from way back when. They never did the job well.  Due to my herniated disk in my back, I can no longer do the job in the shower and need to sit.  Let alone, needing glasses to the job anymore!  Getting old sucks!  So with the electric razor I can wear my glasses and see what I am shaving.  With that said, I use this razor for my face, underarms and legs.  I hate the peach fuzz on my face, my makeup goes on much better with it gone.  My underarms, works excellent.  And it works excellent on my legs.  Am surprised that the grown back takes almost 2 weeks. So that lets met know it is a close shave. And you can buy new blades on Amazon which just makes the whole process that much easier.  All said, it is a much earned 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a very good job at all.  I switched back to disposable razors.  Still looking for a good electric razor, would not recommend  this one at all.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it</li>
            <li> I did my homework and chose the Panasonic ES2216PC according to the rating given by Consumer Reports.  The end result was never as close as reported and after 30 days of use, it has ceased to remove any hair at all.  I have been careful to follow all instructions and now just want to know how do I return it. Perhaps this particular item is defective and does not represent the quality of the product?</li>
            <li> The shaver is quiet and does okay for a quick shave.  However, it does not shave as closely, as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JanF</li>
            <li> Just received today!  Worked right out of box without charging.  Love it.  This replaced an very old shaver I had.  I&#x27;m using it for the peach fuzz on my face and light hair on my arms.  Tested out on my legs and was impressed!!</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a ladies shaver that works as well as I would like. This one is getting closer, but I&#x27;ll bet if I bought a nice men&#x27;s shaver that it would work better than any ladies shaver on the market. That&#x27;s sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver only works well for me if I use it frequently, never use a razor, and if I tip it at an angle that is recommended against in the directions and press down a bit. My hair is very fine, so I think very often it gets pushed away rather than cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be better for women with normal thickness hair, but mine is super thin and uncooperative.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews both here and elsewhere but sadly it didn&#x27;t really work for me.  It didn&#x27;t shave very close and would nick me during shaving and hurt.  Once I dropped it in the shower and it shattered into a million pieces, I decided to try something else. I think the price is a little high for me to try it again.</li>
            <li> It took a couple of tries to get used to it, but now I love it.  It does not provide as close a shave as a razor, but it is so easy and quick that I don&#x27;t mind using it more frequently than a conventional razor.</li>
            <li> I had this same shaver for so many years that I can&#x27;t remember how long I had it. When it died I was happy to find the exact same one available. The shaver arrived quickly and works perfectly just like its predecessor. I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I use it dry only and on my legs. I am so happy there is no more water, shaving cream involved. Battery life is great. I wish I knew about this device a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;One problem- it gives me rash when I use it on bikini area as razor does.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver. It can be used with or with out water. I use it in between shaving with a manual shaver. It is great because you can do it in any room of the house or camping etc. It travels well. I t shaves pretty close.</li>
            <li> I am new to electric shavers but I am pleased with how this performs.  It does not irritate my skin and does shave closely.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Horrible shave!  Not anywhere near close to skin.  I thought I&#x27;d believe the good reviews but that was a mistake.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife to replace a Norelco. She tried it and loved it. Seems that it is also better made than the Norelco.</li>
            <li> The front blade is a little rough but overall this is a good razor.  Seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> I cannot bend in the shower to shave my legs so I decided to try this. I am very pleased.  I can sit in my recliner and dry shave my legs. It is not as close as a venus razor but I am thrilled that I no longer have to apologize about my hairy legs when I have MRI&#x27;s and other tests!</li>
            <li> I have been a Remington Shaver customer for 20+ years.  In recent years they have redesigned their product and I have not been completely satisfied.  So far, I am completely satisfied with my new Panasonic Shaver.  I gives a close shave for an electric razor.  It does not scratch or scrape your skin or cause irritation.  I feel it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Stays charged for several uses and the pop-up feature is nice. I have fine hair on my legs and it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job. I have to go over my legs many times. I was a little disappointed. Would probably work better on coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I used to have an epilator (with the shaver), and I was tired of the pain... the models which have both shavers and epilator together didn&#x27;t worked out for me and after a month the shaver died on me!!&lt;br /&gt;but this one is a good powerful product and I&#x27;m really satisfied with my purchase .</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it shaves much better than my old shaver (which was not a Panasonic).</li>
            <li> I use this razor for my underarms since I get really bad razor burn and it works great. Have had no razor burn since purchasing this product. Also, great because it&#x27;s so fast for shaving if you&#x27;re in a hurry. It also makes them very smooth. (5 stars here)&lt;br /&gt;Not as great on the legs though. It takes a couple times to go over to get it smooth.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  Have not used wet but dry it does not give a smooth shave. Not much different than shavers I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> The razor is adequate.  It has basically no instructions on how to use it.  The price was reasonable and I guess you get what you pay for in terms of good electric razors.</li>
            <li> After being disappointed with other brands of women&#x27;s electric shavers I&#x27;ve purchased over the years, I found the Panasonic ES2216PC  Close Curves Wet/Dry Shaver finally works the way an electric shaver should work.  It cuts hair smoothly without pulling or nicking and it isn&#x27;t necessary to keep going back and forth several times over the same area in order to cut all the hair.  It works well in or out of the shower.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am lazy so this electric razor really helps to get the job done especially cause I can do it anywhere and don&#x27;t need water or shaving cream.</li>
            <li> OK, I dont know anything about the batteries of this item... I dont know how easy is to use... y dont know how confortable it is. What I know is that my wife bought this, and my life just got a little better... therefore her life just got waaayyy better.  I just get a big smile to think about it... &#x3D;)  Just get it...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and course leg hair, which makes it extremely difficult and painful for me to shave my legs on a regular basis. At a minimum I have to wait 2-weeks between shaving my legs, which is inconvenient and even then I have chicken skin and develop a painful leg rash. To top it off, I live in Las Vegas where it is sunny and nice 9 months out of the year. I have tried many different options including exfoliating creams, scrubs, waxing, and laser hair removal (my leg hair is too light for it to be effective)and decided that I would try an electric razor again, because the last time I tried them years ago they were not effective in hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have the highest hopes for this electric razor, but it was under $30 and couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it. In the shower,I lather my legs with soap and use the electric razor two-three days after I shave with a razor. While it does not make my legs razor smooth, the hair is not as visible. Which, I consider a victory. The best part though and what I am really (really!!) happy with, it that with doing this I do not have any problems with red irritated skin and I am able to shave my legs with a razor every week if I want. Which is HUGE for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just been sticking with my schedule of shaving every other week and using the electric razor for times in-between. My legs look better and I have been enjoying wearing dresses at least once a week for the first time in my life and I am in my late 20&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results may not be acceptable for everyone, but if you too have course hair and sensitive skin (and I can&#x27;t be the only one out there), it may work for you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.23.11 ETA: While I enjoyed this product while it lasted, after less than 10-months it no longer turns on. It worked regularly two days ago. The battery died and I charged it last night and this morning, it would not turn on. Very disappointing. I will be looking for a different brand to replace this one.</li>
            <li> This is a bit of a change for me since the last trimmer I had, which did not have protective foil on it. That one did a great close shave, but sometimes it pinched the delicate parts a bit, so you had to be real careful. Fortunately, I don&#x27;t have that problem with this one, but the foil makes it harder to get a neat close shave. It&#x27;s still possible, just takes longer..... which starts to hurt my back after being hunched over in the shower for a while. It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s wet/dry and I still prefer it to waxing or razor shaves.</li>
            <li> The product worked well for me. I have used it to shave all areas with no problem.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for me....sent it back.  no problems there!</li>
            <li> If I spend more time shaving my legs with a regular razor then maybe this would work. Had to go over the same spot repeatedly until it was almost uncomfortable before it would remove *most* of the stubble. I say most because it never provided a close shave. And armpits? What a joke. It didn&#x27;t remove a single hair there. It&#x27;s like it was trying to will the little hairs out just by shaking itself at them. It becomes even less useful as a wet razor.</li>
            <li> Very nice product easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> After researching several types, I decided on the Panasonic ES2216PC for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;She thinks its awesome and has been using it for several years now.&lt;br /&gt;Very durable and works great.  If you replace the blades yearly, it will last and last and last.</li>
            <li> This item is the same I likes to buy. It is very good product. My customer is happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> This razor is piece of JUNK!!!, I charged it fully and then tried shaving, I ran it until the battery died and I hadn&#x27;t made it half way through shaving, not because the battery died quickly, but because it shaved so poorly, this razor is suitable for a child&#x27;s toy, but definitely NOT for a woman to shave her legs with, I can&#x27;t believe Panasonic was willing to put their name on such a poor product.</li>
            <li> This was my second one. The first lasted 14 months. Like a dummy, I got another. This one only made it 6 months. It won&#x27;t hold a charge. I&#x27;ll  never get another Panasonic.</li>
            <li> not really what  I expected,</li>
            <li> broke on the first use, despite me following package instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer came up and is permanently up now. Very uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Good for a quick dry shave, doesn&#x27;t work well in the shower. And it likes to pull hair unless its only been a couple of days since you last shaved.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Bikini, underarms and/or legs.  I bought this shaver a few months ago and still love it.  I clean it and charge it often and have never had an issue.  Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> not a super close shave but you cant see any hair. you have to go slow on thicker hair so it doesnt pull the hair. i like it cause i hate being stuck in the shower or tub shaving. great for quick fixes/shaves. defiantly cuts down on regular shaves if you have a lot of hair. what i was looking for!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver several months ago, and it was the very best electronic shaver I have ever had (and I&#x27;ve had quite a few, as my skin is very sensitive and I have trouble using a normal razor). However. It abruptly stopped working, with no identifiable cause. The light still comes on when it&#x27;s plugged into the charger, but it won&#x27;t turn on. This is really disappointing, as I thought I&#x27;d found something that was really good!</li>
            <li> ordered this for my daughter. she was very happy with it, used it the first day it arrived and then wanted me to try it she was right it works great and will be a great razor for in between full shaves in the shower</li>
            <li> I am throwing mine out! It tugs and pulls body hair out, one at a time. If I wanted that I&#x27;d go for a waxing, at least with wax it&#x27;s swift, cutting down on the pain. I&#x27;ve followed the guidelines for using this product. Whether I use it dry, or in the shower with a soapy lather, the results are the same. It&#x27;s worse than pulling a bandage off as slowly as possible.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenager and she loved it, wet/dry feature perfect! the bikini trimmer, cant really use it too well.&lt;br /&gt;we bought this because she would get rashes from using a regular shaver, this has been the best thing for her, she is on the hairy side and uses it alot, would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER. SHE SAYS IT WORKS GREAT...NOT AS CLOSE AS A BLADE, BUT GOOD FOR A FAST TOUCH UP IN THE SHOWER,WHEN SHE DOESN&#x27;T HAVE TIME TO SHAVE</li>
            <li> It meets all my needs as I can&#x27;t use a blade shaver on my legs.  Easy to use and clean and works well.&lt;br /&gt;Fits the hand nicely and easy to carry when going away. Love it.  Emma</li>
            <li> lasts for a long time&lt;br /&gt;great value for money</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old shaver, which was 15 years old. It worked great for a while. I was so happy with it. But now that I have been using it for 4 months, it is no longer cutting the hair. I have kept it super clean, but the blades just got dull very very fast. The charge doesn&#x27;t last very long either. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> this thing only lasted a month.</li>
            <li> Had a similar one that lasted years and now ordered this one that preforms just a well.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it will last for as long as the first one.</li>
            <li> It was not satisfied with the product. The blade was blunt. After reading the review on Amazon, I had  high expectations, but this razor is definitely at the bottom of my list of razors. I am returning it for money. I am an avid Amazon customer but by far, this is the worst product I have ever purchased from amazon.</li>
            <li> long hair trimmer does not &amp;#34;pop up&amp;#34; easily and actually popped out on one occasion. doesn&#x27;t feel like a well made product.</li>
            <li> Returned 1st one because it fell apart &amp; I couldn&#x27;t get it bk together so thought that was why it didn&#x27;t cut well. But the replacement one doesn&#x27;t cut either so it&#x27;s a waste of money &amp; time. I am disabled &amp; needed help in this area but this wasn&#x27;t the answer &amp; I couldn&#x27;t return the 2nd time --so stuck w/ a razor that doesn&#x27;t do the job @ all</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and I have been looking for an electric shaver for a while.  This one takes a few times to use it right, but once you get over the learning cure its amazing, It doesnt even snag my hairs at all.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be mored pleased!  Nice close shave and no irritation.  Recommend it to all leg and underarm shavers.  Super,&lt;br /&gt;Super!</li>
            <li> Runs like it has an electric cord, shaves close. I would recommend to anyone on blood thinners because it does not nick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve messed with this for two months and it just hasn&#x27;t worked well. I bought it to save time, water, and to get a better shave. It definitely hasn&#x27;t saved me time and it hasn&#x27;t given me good shave once--there was always hair left on my legs and the bikini trimmer wasn&#x27;t much better. I really wanted it to work out, but after two months I can&#x27;t give it any more chances. It stays charged well, that&#x27;s about the best I can say for it.</li>
            <li> Works well. Not quite as close a shave as a razor, but easier to use.</li>
            <li> Great razor. Very comfortable. The wife loves it because she never get razor burn anymore.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace a remington that died....this shaver feels as though it&#x27;s scratching my legs when I use it.  it does not give a close shave.  when I called panasonic, they said it sounded as if the foils needed to be replaced, but their warranty DID NOT COVER IT, even though I purchased this shaver a few days ago.  they suggested contacting amazon, where I purchased it.  I told them it was THEIR product, and they should do something about it, but they refused.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS SHAVER.....it&#x27;s horrible....and panasonic&#x27;s customer service is deplorable.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington wet/dry trimmer that I loved, until it stopped working out of nowhere. I decided to try to upgrade to something a little larger, that wouldn&#x27;t crap out on me after a few months, and eventually decided on this one after researching and reading reviews. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t say anything good about it. If I use it to try to trim longer hair, it pulls and pinches but doesn&#x27;t actually cut the hair (whether I use the shaving head or the pop-up trimmer head). On shorter hair, I still don&#x27;t feel as if it actually shaves, and it scratches uncomfortably against my skin. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve gotten one good shave out of this thing.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this excellent product. Very versatile and useful for them.[[ASIN:B000G0GW6K Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver with Bikini Attachment, Mauve]]</li>
            <li> I bought this razor after studying other higher-priced razors &amp; decided that this was a good price/performance bargain and also because I had really not heard of a bad Panasonic product. Turns out that my assumption was totally wrong. This one was so lame that it was worse than a mechanical razor. If you had a Venus or Gillette in your hand, you atleast had better control. This one was the same physical effort but without the clean shaving blades to it. All it has is a fancy head and batteries. Both the dry &amp; wet-mode were equally disappointing. So I ended up promptly returning it &amp; getting a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please pass on this one &amp; move on to the next in the list</li>
            <li> So far I have only used it once and I am impressed already. The attachment works and I find helpful. My sensitive areas are fine no cuts or rashes so far..... Close cut dry, and I like how the head moves as well as the foil part too. Only thing I dont like it that it is PINK!</li>
            <li> Really like this shaver.  Not as close as a razor but it does a fine job.  Works well wet and dry.</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric razor before, so I don&#x27;t have any other brands to compare this one to.  However, I am very impressed with how well it works.  I&#x27;m particularly pleased with being able to use it in or out of the shower.  It seems to shave closer in the shower with shaving cream/gel.  It took me a while to get used to using the electric versus a razor, but all in all, I am very happy with this Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> Three months after a horseback riding accident resulting in a broken ankle, I finally got home, leaving hospital and rehab behind.  A bout with blood clots has resulted in having to be on a blood thinner, and shaving as I have always done it is a definite no-no now.  I didn&#x27;t dare to hope that an electric razor could do a good job on a three month growth, but I was desperate to try something.  I read the reviews for this shaver and decided to try it.  Shaved using it and shaving cream and was really pleased at how closely it shaved.  I was really impressed!  And no nicks!</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife for convenience and portability, works great, keeps charge for along time, charges quickly, works as well in shower or dry.. Excellent value for money (and means less chance of her using my razor!).</li>
            <li> This electric shaver/razor does a pretty good job compared to any other form of hair removal, once you come to terms with the fact that you&#x27;ll never get that weird-kicking-the-sheets close shave that you get with your draw-the-blood razorblade. Then again, you won&#x27;t get rivulets of blood running down your legs, either (I&#x27;m 30 and I still haven&#x27;t managed to learn to shave without major blood loss, so this thing is a blessing a medical miracle). You also have to get used to going over the same patch a few times, but you can be more leisurely since you can shave while watching TV (if single and live by oneself). Don&#x27;t like the hideous color (reminds me of a marital aid), and I&#x27;ve no idea what the \\&quot;bikini attachment\\&quot; is supposed to do. Is it a comb? How does it \\&quot;trim\\&quot; hair to a longer length? I&#x27;m no slouch in natural science and it makes no sense to me, either theoretically or in practice. Haven&#x27;t had the scratching problem other ladies have mentioned. It does work better dry than wet. I do wish it didn&#x27;t just discard the removed hair like one of those lawnmowers without the bag attachment, though. Still, I think this is the best out there in its category.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all of the great reviews.  I was highly disappointed.  Not only was it impossible to get anywhere near a close shave, it gave me a rash.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 2 months. It is very convient for major jobs and a quick touch up if I prefer to not use a razor. I am happy with the results. Also the Panasonic has been reviewed favorable by independent groups and that also influened my selection. I like the product enough to recommend it to anyone. The price is right too.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver I am on blood thinner and it is a positive way for me to shave safley</li>
            <li> Okay so I bought this razor after finding out that I am HIGHLY allergic to nickel. I had never used an electric before so I had absolutely no idea what to expect.  I basically bought this type because they carried it where I worked and I got a discount. I was warned electric razors don&#x27;t get as close as a normal razor but I was actually really surprised how close this got for the first few times I shaved. I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and am considering getting a different one. This razor really isn&#x27;t too bad, but I understand what a lot of people are saying. It does spit hair out randomly all over your leg, it&#x27;s not the nicest thing to see but I discovered if you pop up the pop up trimmer when you&#x27;re done with each leg there&#x27;s hair in it that you can take a tissue and clean out. The charger is kind of a pain.  It would be nice to have a cord so I could shave when it&#x27;s plugged in. There isn&#x27;t any kind of indicator that shows battery so it&#x27;s died in the middle of me shaving quite a few times. However I realized if you just listen to it then you can tell when it&#x27;s running low because it starts slowing down.  As for the noise I don&#x27;t really care much. It doesn&#x27;t bother me or the people I live with. I absolutely can not shave my underarms with this razor, I&#x27;ve tried numerous times and it burns and scratches. I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out why it does this. It occasionally scratches my legs but the marks go away pretty quickly and it isn&#x27;t that painful. All in all I think it&#x27;s a pretty nice razor, I don&#x27;t shave often but compared to what I was going through with my allergy, this is WAY better!</li>
            <li> I am not sure why manufacturers can&#x27;t make a high end razor for women.  Skip this and just by a better men&#x27;s electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Love the shave and comfort of this razor.  Convenient to use always ready and fully charged.</li>
            <li> It works but not as good as you would expect it to</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s capable of giving a close shave. Very disappointed and should have returned it. I guess blades are the only option after, but was hoping that in the 20 yrs since I had used an electric razor someone had actually figured out how to get them to work.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  The reason I am giving it 3 stars is due to the fact that it is not very durable. After first use it fell(of course). Upon first fall it broke into three pieces, we had put it back together but it seems you can not use the back blade. After reading the other reviews I thought this would hold up to crazy wear and tear a little better.</li>
            <li> This razor is the best one I have ever used and it is worth is every penny. I have used different ones over the years and I don&#x27;t have very difficult hair to cut but I have hair that sticks to my legs and this razor gets everyone of them.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it under my arms and it gives a nice close shave there too. Pivoting head makes it easy on the curves. I just cant say enough positive things about this razor.</li>
            <li> Wife likes it however, says it does not shave close as a razor and have to go over an area several times to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> This is the worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I went over and over the hair and it did nothing. I literally watched the hair hit the blade and not be cut, and I have very thin, light body hair. The trimming function also didn&#x27;t work. Even after sitting on the charger for days before use- so I know it wasn&#x27;t from lack of charge. Then today, I tried to give it another chance, and I accidentally dropped it 2 ft on to the ground. It broke into many pieces and the blades all came apart and the plastic snapped. Not fixable. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I owned one exactly the same brand and product. It performed the same as my first one; however, the battery does not last as long. It must be old stock.</li>
            <li> did not shave as close as I would have liked</li>
            <li> Beaver never so smooth!  Easy to use.  Great on underarms and legs.  Fast and easy to clean. Recommending to friends.</li>
            <li> Useless. The longer hair feature just captures them and pulls, not cut. On shorter hair, you have to go over multiple times. I expect a brand new shaver to very cleanly cut in one past. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I hate messy shaving.  With this shaver I can dry shave under my arms and legs and get a close shave that lasts.</li>
            <li> Love it. Just like my old one.  The shave is close and makes the leg feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I thought it was going to be just a cheap electric razor that would hardly work. But when I opened it up, I was very wrong. Very nice quality.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased on 6/14/15 and as of 8/10/15 it is completely dead and not working. It was used, placed on the charger (correctly with the charging light on) and the next morning it would not turn on. It was used properly according to the instructions. So now I have spent money on a shaver that worked for less than 2 months, just long enough to not be eligible for return. I have contacted the company for repair, and after a long time on hold and extreme difficulty reaching an actual human, found out that my only option for repair is to mail it back (at my own expense) and they will determine IF it can be fixed under warranty.  When it was working, it did not deliver a close leg shave unless I went very slowly and used it daily.&lt;br /&gt;This produce was purchased by William Hilliker but the review was written by Shannon Hilliker as I am the one who used the product.</li>
            <li> Very good&lt;br /&gt;I  highly recommend this razor&lt;br /&gt;As a cancer surviver it is very important I don&#x27;t get cut</li>
            <li> bulky, not smooth at all, and battery gave out ( returned )</li>
            <li> Hate to say it because the reason I bought it was because it had such good reviews, but I think this product is horrible. Extremely dissapointed at how poorly it works. It doesn&#x27;t give nearly as close of a shave as it says it does, and it barely takes the hair away.</li>
            <li> Some time back, I purchased this razor for myself.  I loved it.  My daughter borrowed mine and declared it the best razor she had ever used.  (She was always cutting herself with a so-called safety razor.)  When her birthday arrived this year, I bought her a Panasonic Shaver of her own.  Now, my razor is always in its own slot when I need it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this razor. I can use this in the shower or use it dry. Either way, it works Great. I&#x27;ll be back for my next one!</li>
            <li> Works Great, nice attachment and leaves skin smooth.  I use a man&#x27;s panasonic very similar that has worked well for some time.</li>
            <li> Had a Remington before and it didn&#x27;t quite do the job.  The Panasonic has a swivel head and is much easier to use especially under the arms. It also does a better job.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry shaver because, well, I am lazy. I hate shaving my legs. In fact it has been quite a few months since I last shaved- I have coarse, think leg hair. Hey, I&#x27;m Italian it comes with the territory. You make awesome baked goods, and yah you have hairy legs. Right out of the package, I turned it on. Yes, the directions state you should charge for 24 hours before using. I couldn&#x27;t wait any longer. I put it on the clipper setting and started shearing, uh, cutting. Then I used the shaving setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews about how it doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave, I agree. But we are talking millimeters, not inches. If I run my hand down my leg, I can feel something, but it isn&#x27;t like a man&#x27;s stubble, or even than noticeable. Another comparison is that I have jet black leg hair- you can&#x27;t see the hair. Now, I am believing that your mileage may vary on how often you will need to shave to keep it unnoticeable, but that&#x27;s going to depend on your genetics. The razor can&#x27;t control that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor isn&#x27;t magic. You aren&#x27;t going to shave and then never have to shave again. It does cut the hair pretty darn close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor shape was comfortable in my hand. The razor head moves left to right, up and down, in addition to forward and backwards. For me, this feature made it virtually impossible for me to nick my skin. Did I mention I have sensitive skin? Well, so far no irritation. I can&#x27;t speak of ingrown hairs because it has only been a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved dry, haven&#x27;t used the wet dry functionality. However the directions do state that &amp;#34; you will notice a difference after a few weeks of wet shaving.&amp;#34; Not sure exactly what they mean about that, but I might as well try it.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor for women.  It shaves closely without biting the sensitive areas and can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product.  It does everything she wants, she loves the wet/dry functionality, and the battery lasts for a long time.  This is a great purchase.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  I&#x27;ve only used a couple of times and seems to do a pretty good job.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a hand razor but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pretty disappointed with this razor. I find this product occasionally pulls the hair, and it takes multiple passes to remove the hair in an area; even then I feel like I still need to shave. I have owned wet/dry shavers in the past that shaved comparably to a regular razor, but this does not. There is no way I can use this and still feel comfortable wearing a skirt or shorts in public.</li>
            <li> As close a shave as any electric shaver and it is easy to use in the bath.  A charge lasts forever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric razor for over ten years.  My first one lasted about 6 years, the second one about two years before I had to replace the screen and head and instead of replacing the head for the second time, I purchased this razor.  Mistake.  Last month it started pulling leg hairs but didn&#x27;t remove them.</li>
            <li> This device is noisy and does not cut close enough.</li>
            <li> got this for my sister who&#x27;s currently in the hospital and not allowed to use razors (blood disease) and it works beautifully.  Please with its hair removal AND its safety features.</li>
            <li> This shaver works GREAT! This is the shave between shower razor shaves. I get a clean shave, of course not like a razor, but still very good for times when it&#x27;s not easy or practical to jump in the shower or stick your legs in the sink or use shave creams or jells.</li>
            <li> I like it I have  hard time picking up my legs</li>
            <li> I have always used Panasonic shavers. They last a long time. This one is great because it pivots which makes shaving easier. Comes with a small simple charger, not one of the big wired ones. Could be a little sharper though. Overall its a good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> I been trying to work with this since I bought it. It will take me a long time to time, and a long time to shave. I thought I had difficult hair. Yesterday I bought another one and everything was much smoother and faster. In less then 5 mins I was done!</li>
            <li> I liked the pivoting head as you shaved.  You are less likely to get a cut from the shaver especially when you shave under your arms.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver. I think it shaves a lot closer than some of the other reviewers said it did.</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase replacement head for a Remington but I thought at this price I would try the Panasonic.  I am so glad I did, it works great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for the wife as the last one plain wore out from use.  She loves the pivoting head and molded case as it fits her hand.  The product charges quickly and lasts for about 5 days of continuous use.</li>
            <li> Bought this product about a month ago. Extremely close shave. Absolutely no nicks or cuts. Smoothest shaver I have ever owned. I was using a conair shaver befor this and it would stop working out of nowhere, I had to buy a new one every year. Well I haven&#x27;t had this panasonic as long, but so far its still 90% better. I love the pivoting head part esp for going over the knees and underarms. I recommend this shaver to beginners and veterans alike. I use this because I get my eyebrows waxed and it&#x27;s so horribly painful, I can&#x27;t imagine getting anythig else waxed. I was so glad when I first used this shaver and I felt no pain or razor burn. It&#x27;s a keeper!!</li>
            <li> If you are thinking an electric razor is going to shave your legs forget it! Does ok on underarms but legs are not even noticeably smoother!</li>
            <li> Since my teenage years, I&#x27;ve tried numerous cordless/electric and straight blade shavers.  The ones that worked the best, of course, were the disposable razors but the use of these leads to in-grown hairs and causes severe itchy re-growth.  I would always be scratching my underarms as the hair grew back.  For the past two years, I&#x27;ve been using another brand of electric shaver that I just hated, but I was too lazy to shop for another one.  I always had to use a disposable razor after using the electric razor, which was time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to finally shop for a new one, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on it.  I am extremely thorough in my quest for a new product--from cleaning products to shavers.  I always do a ton of research and read lots and lots of product reviews.  I was surprised to find this one at such a reasonable price for an electric shaver.  I am amazed at the price becasuse the product works like a dream!  Typically, you would only find such a great and close shave in the more expensive products.  But, this shaver gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric shaver.  It was just as good as using a disposable razor and did not cause any itchy re-growth.  I am extremely pleased with this shaver and look forward to using it over and over again.  I use it on the bikini and underarm area with amazing results.  I definitely recommend buying this if you are in the market for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I really liked this shaver until the battery stopped holding a charge after about 11 weeks.  I looked into buying a new battery but the cost of it didnt make sense.  I am really disappointed in this product.  It is  a shame because the shaver is very good otherwise.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it would be an improvement to the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018A32XS/ref&#x3D;oss_product electric razor that I usually purchase. Unfortunately, the razor completely stopped working within less than a month. While it did work, I found that it did not shave as closely as it would appear to, and my skin was often left chafed.</li>
            <li> I have used other Ladies&#x27; shavers in the past and this, by far, is the best one of all!  After only one use, I did not have to shave again for almost a week. The razor is easy to handle and gives a very smooth shave.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Even tho you won&#x27;t get silky smooth legs, like with a razor, it does a great job and in less time than traditional shaving. I like it a lot, especially when I have those lazy days 😉</li>
            <li> MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED, COMPARED TO THE OTHER ONE, SO FAR I HAVEN&#x27;T HAD TO CHARGE IT, LAST ONE WOULD LAST ONE USE, THIS ONE DOES WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE</li>
            <li> The shaver has definitely come in handy for a quick dry shave but I&#x27;ve been less than impressed with the overall results.</li>
            <li> This razor is not as good as I expected.  I wish my 25-year-old corded \\&quot;R\\&quot; brand razor hadn&#x27;t died.  This one does not shave very close at all.  And it feels rough, like I&#x27;m shaving with sand paper.  I was able to shave 3 times on one charge.  I could never use this if I plan to wear shorts.  A little disappointing.  (I have only used it dry.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty happy with this item. I purchased it to replace my old razor that finally died after many years of use. No complaints so far &amp; it&#x27;s more quiet than most.</li>
            <li> i get really really bad ingrown hairs and razor bumps when i use a regular razor. i decided to buy this for my entire bikini line. it does a really good job. of course it will never be as close as a cut as a regular razor, but it does its job where i need it to be done. im glad i invested in it. just keep it clean and charged! its also convenient because you can use it in the shower. good product. buy it!</li>
            <li> I Love this, no more having to shave legs in the shower, I can do this before and even when just popping out to the shops, no it does not shave as close as a razor but what does?  For those quick times when you need just to tidy up those hairs it serves its purpose, I would definately recommend this product to any &#x27;on the go&#x27; girls.</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver for an electric.  Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade but it does the job very nicely, the best electric shaver I have had.  I purchased this because I was having knee replacement surgery and could not use a blade and I have been very happy with it and plan to take it overseas with me later this year.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor that I&#x27;ve used so far. The flexible head really helps get into the curves, which is important to me as a plus sized lady with a great deal of curves. It can be hard to tackle them with an inflexible razor or even the bladed ones like the Bic Soleil, which are nice and all but don&#x27;t cover nearly as much surface area. Due to the large amount covered I can cut my shaving time in half! And it&#x27;s wet/dry, which makes me happy, too! Hello, pool time!</li>
            <li> So far I have been really pleased with this product.  It takes longer for a dry shave to have the precision and smoothness as a wet shave, but I can use this razor on dry skin and have NO skin irritation.  I have very sensitive skin and tend to easily get ingrown hairs, so this product has been a blessing for me.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> my wife uses it am growing my winter beard and plan to use. have 3 bichons and will use on them once they get use to the sound</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. The only thing I would say, after having it for around 2 years now, is that the battery life is not as stellar as it once was. Maybe I can send it in to have the battery replaced?</li>
            <li> When these work, they are great. The blades frequently do not run smoothly and they will hurt you. Send them back. This company needs to really do some work on quality control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a while now and still like it. You don&#x27;t get as close of a shave as you would with a regular blade, but it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> My daughter begged me at the age of 11 to shave her legs.  I mean BEGGED.  Now that she is 13, she lets her leg hair grow to rival man legs.  We got this for her for Christmas in hopes that she would consider taming those hairy gams.  She seems to use it pretty regularly.  It is not as close of a shave as a regular razor, but it is much better than what she has been rocking as of late.</li>
            <li> Best ever!  I really don&#x27;t like electric shavers but this one is fantastic!  I should have gotten one of these along time ago. Love it!</li>
            <li> My wife loves. I get to clean it.</li>
            <li> This product cannot be rated properly by someone who expects the same kind of close shave that a razor would provide. Electric shavers simply don&#x27;t do that, and cannot be expected to. Then again, they don&#x27;t slice through the skin..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This electric shaver has been worth every penny. I am one of those lazy women who forget about an important meeting at work until I&#x27;m in the shower and running late. I&#x27;m not going to wear a skirt unless I HAVE to, and I&#x27;m certainly not going to shave unless I HAVE to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this shaver has saved the day several times over the past couple months. I really like the fact that I can use it in the shower and it does a better job than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve used. It seems to charge quickly and holds a charge for what seems like several shaving incidents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it lasts for several years, like my little Panasonic hair trimmer that is still going strong after at least ten years, but sadly only takes batteries.</li>
            <li> I received ny Panasonic ladies shaver a week after ordering it. I could not wait to charge it up &amp; try it out. The next day I used it &amp; let my two girlfriends try it also. They loved it &amp; plan to purchase one as well. Thanks for making my life easier. It&#x27;s a great product. By: Deb Jazi</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, i use it to shave my beard also ;) It shaves cleaner, build quality is excellent, battery backup is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wife is very pleased with the shaver.  Works well, stores easily, charge lasts a long time.  Purchased a more expensive one at WalMart and had to return it because it functioned poorly.  Purchase this one which is better quality at a lower price.</li>
            <li> My wife was constantly buying cheap battery operated razers for her and my daughter to use.  I finally had enough, and bought this Panasonic for my daughter.  Now they both use it and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  I just wish they wouldn&#x27;t plug the charger in my office, the pink glow is kind of distracting.</li>
            <li> This shaver does not hold a charge and does not come close to shaving like a razor blade. Granted it&#x27;s the only electric shaver I have ever used, but I was very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> Never purchased an electric razor and boy I never should have. This razor does not do a good job at all. I would use this then have to go back with razor and finish the job. Could never get a smooth feel at all.&lt;br /&gt;The sides scrape your legs and the on/off button is hard to use when your hands are wet.&lt;br /&gt;Sure wish I would have never bought this....will trash this and go back to the good ol razor and shaving cream</li>
            <li> I am a big one on reading reviews and after this shaver received 4 stars I decided to buy one for myself. What a waste of money. All it does is leave your skin red and irritated. I hope you would look for a better shaver given the price of this one.</li>
            <li> Great Razor easy to use and clean, obviously not a smooth shave as a blade, but great as u&#x3D;you can use wet or dry. Although if using wet, make sure your arms/legs are wet and not damp as I found it does drag on the skin a little unless completely dry or wet!</li>
            <li> Good electric shaver, great features. Doesn&#x27;t cut or nick skin and is kind to sensitive skin. Does work well in shower and holds charge for several uses. Shaving head is a little large, but does follow body fairly well. Thankfully it is a straight handle, which is important for someone who is ambidextrous!</li>
            <li> It does the job I wanted it to do</li>
            <li> Failed rather quickly, and while it worked, results were far from the best.</li>
            <li> I echo previous reviews about this not working unless fully charged. To me, even when fully charged only works efficiently for about 2-3 mins. Thoroughly disappointed with this product. Have ordered a men&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver. Works great!</li>
            <li> Disappointing results. Need multiple passes over your legs to get a close shave, and even then, the shave is not particularly close. Not as good as my former Remington shaver.</li>
            <li> It trimming blade catches and pulls hair, and the blades dulled quickly.  Back to looking for a good shaver!</li>
            <li> Still gave me razor bumps</li>
            <li> I finally had to replace my nearly 20 yr. old electric Remington, so off to Walmart I went. Since the Remington had been so reliable with a decently close shave, I went with another one. Big disappointment. Couldn&#x27;t believe how long it took just trying to get all the hair off, which never happened.Obviously, you&#x27;re just not going to get a close razor shave with an electric, but this Panasonic is close enough for me. Holds a charge a pretty long time. Just glad I decided to take a chance on this one. An all-round dependable electric razor. Recommend!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but overall I found it easy to use, not too loud, effective, and travel friendly.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t give the product five stars simply because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a five star product I still think it&#x27;s about as good as you&#x27;ll get when it comes to ladies&#x27; wet dry shavers, which let&#x27;s be honest sit is a very strong &#x27;eh it works okay&#x27; land anyway. with a good charge the razor works well and it will last a decent amount of time. No you will never get that lovely smooth feeling you might get with a safety razor or waxing or whatever but you will get a decent shave quickly and it works very well dry. I use it and enjoy having it around when I just need a quick shave without hoping in the shower it&#x27;s excellent for eliminating visible hairs but does FEEL a tad prickly with my dense dark natural hair.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it very easy on her skin!!</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  I&#x27;ve bought this model 3 times (it seems to last 2-3 years before it no longer holds a charge) and have always been very happy with the quality of shave it delivers.  The results are very smooth (even with thicker hair) and I like the blade options so that you can simply do a close trim or a smooth shave.  I&#x27;ve never had problems with pulled hairs and it doesn&#x27;t cause cuts or scrapes like another brand I had purchased previously.</li>
            <li> This product works well for an electric. I use it in between my regular razor and cream shaves. I travel a lot works out well.</li>
            <li> Works only if you keep your zones &amp;#34;trimmed&amp;#34; at all times.&lt;br /&gt;If the hair grows longer than 2mm the blades get caught and it hurts.&lt;br /&gt;Used wet or with a gel, it&#x27;ll clog up with hair.&lt;br /&gt;Battery time is good, charging time OK and it&#x27;s rather easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It seems to shave OK but it would be nice to have some lights to indicated level of charge and also if it took less time to achieve a charge.</li>
            <li> As titled this electric shaver gets the job done well.  It provides me with the closest shave I&#x27;ve experienced.  Now with that said it isn&#x27;t manual razor slick but it gets pretty close. I&#x27;d recommend the Noxema bikini razors to clean things up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any nicks or cuts  in the years I have used this shaver. The only complaint (nitpick) is the led indicator on the charging base doesn&#x27;t alert you when it has reached a full charge. To be on the safe side I always charge it for 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is very easy as the heads pop on and off. I suggest that you get familiar with the shaver prior to using it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great wet/dry shaver for the price and the replacement blades/foil aren&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> My first shaver in years and it works. It does pull a hair or two, but I can sit and shave my legs without the risk of falling in the tub. I just wanted a reasonably priced shaver which did what I needed it to and this is it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. Like that it&#x27;s multi-functional with bikini clipper. Smoothest shave is with soap and water, but I&#x27;m content with dry shave most weeks. My hair grows fast and is course so I shave every 2-3 days. Charge lasts a week. Regrowth stubble is less course using electric shaver than standard razer for me.</li>
            <li> Does a great job. Love it!</li>
            <li> The best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. Gave my first one to my mom and replaced later with a conair razor, big mistake, I returned to Amazon and bought another one of these.</li>
            <li> I loved this shaver until it died 6 months after I bought it. It just stopped, and then wouldn&#x27;t charge. Make sure you register with Panasonic so the warranty will be valid. But before it died, I loved using it in the shower, worked great everywhere. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This barely cut my hair, in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was tired of almost killing myself trying to shave in the shower.  This Panasonic is not quite as close as a razor in the shower but it is pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> The shaver doesn&#x27;t get a close shave when you use it dry and doesn&#x27;t work at all when you use it wet.</li>
            <li> Not enough of a clean smooth cut. Not sure if they even make shavors that cut close. Just not what I was looking for. But Amazon is amazing,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this both wet and dry. I prefer using it in the shower with shaving cream because I feel like I get a closer shave but it is also more comfortable for me and easier to use. The shave it close enough that you cannot see any hair but you can still feel some stubble. That does not bother me at all though. I do not get any razor bumps like I used to with a regular razor and I can shave my legs in half the time.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver. Has to be the best one I have ever purchased. Would highly recommend it. The charge lasts longer than expected and after a few uses you get a pretty close shave for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly, provides a smooth shave, the trim tool works well.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies actually pulls the hairs as much as cuts. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend wasting your time or money!!</li>
            <li> No use after 2 months.  The blade is spining and not cutting.  Also the blades cannot go back in when you take it out to clean</li>
            <li> Was looking for something to use for quick touchups between blade shaves.  Will probably use this dry most of the time, and while blade shaves will always be smoother, this is perfectly useful for what I wanted.  The only thing I was very unhappy about was the Panasonic sealed plastic packaging.  I hate trying to open them - what&#x27;s wrong with using a cardboard box?  My rating of 4 is because I&#x27;ve only used the shaver a couple of times, so can&#x27;t speak for the length of the charge, or how long the blades stay sharp under normal use.  The design is comfortable and easy to hold at the proper angle.  I&#x27;m very satisfied - and the Amazon processing and shipping speed was super, too.</li>
            <li> Works better than anticipated. Best shave I have had. Received earlier than expected and well packaged</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this type of shaver before, so perhaps my expectations weren&#x27;t warranted, but this shaver does not shave very closely at all, especially in tight areas. I went back to my razor.</li>
            <li> I really do not like this razor. It doesn&#x27;t cut hair very well, so it requires you to go over the same spot several times and even then it&#x27;s not a very close cut. The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a good charge either. I start using it and within 3 minutes it starts to slow it&#x27;s speed down and the motor sounds like it is laboring. You can&#x27;t even apply a little pressure on it because it can&#x27;t handle it!  I am very disappointed, but I had a feeling it wouldn&#x27;t be all that great because of it&#x27;s low price. Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> My lady loves this razor, she is on warfin and cannot use a regular razor&lt;br /&gt;excellant product</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  It gives a smooth shave and no &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; afterwards.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old Remington electric shaver and purchased their newer model first. It was junk. Found the Panasonic and was hesitant to try it based on some of the bad reviews. Glad I took a chance with it. This shaver is sturdy and gives a close even shave. I like how the charger unit plugs directly into an electrical outlet...no cord necessary. I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this razor for about two months. Although it does not give as close of a shave as my good old Venus and shower gel did, I liked that I could use it dry (saved time as I could shave while reading!) and thought that I would end up saving money by not having to buy those expensive Venus cartridges. However, after about two months, I noticed it was shaving less and less efficiently - I would have to go over the same part of my leg literally 5 or 6 times to get a decent shave (both wet and dry)! At this point, it was taking a good ten minutes just to shave about a couple of square inches of skin, so I cast it aside and returned to Venus. It seems like the blades get dull VERY quickly, even though the information included with the razor claimed the blades would last at least a year or more before needing to be replaced. I don&#x27;t think the dulling was an issue with my use or care of the razor, as I didn&#x27;t use it very often to begin with (not more than three times a week at MOST) and I always cleaned it and stored it in a dry place after using it, so I don&#x27;t think rusting was an issue. After all of this I was still too lazy to come on here and write a negative review until today (~6 months after I purchased the razor) - I got it out, charged it, and now the thing doesn&#x27;t even turn on, period, even when plugged into the wall! Currently struggling with Amazon to get a refund on this. Do NOT waste your money or time!</li>
            <li> If you have course hair, this shaver will probably not benefit you.  You have to put pressure in order to get somewhat of a close shave.</li>
            <li> the wife loved her Christmas present.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in November of 2011. Granted that&#x27;s awhile ago. My main problem is, once the battery stops charging, you can&#x27;t replace the battery. I took it apart to see if there was a rechargeable battery inside. If you plan to do the same, don&#x27;t bother. I thought it should last at least a year AND have replaceable batteries. Now it just has to go to the landfill. I gave it 2 stars only because it did work well for a shaver. Not as close as a blade razor but good enough if you&#x27;re not picky about being picky</li>
            <li> Christmas present for wife.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> Works ok but I expected better results</li>
            <li> I was astonished.  I am trying Amazon Prime, and I ordered this AND RECEIVED it the next day!  I was thrilled.  The unit itself is attractive, and I liked it over all, it worked very well.  And then the very first time I used it, the button to lift the pop up trimmer broke.  I was very disappointed.  This is a $30.00 item.  I would have paid a dollar or two more for metal, or at least hard plastic, buttons.</li>
            <li> It worked great in the beginning, but then after a few months it would no longer hold a charge. I left it on he charger all night and it still only worked for about 30 seconds. Company I purchased it from will not let me return it.</li>
            <li> My last couple of shavers for ladies have been Panasonic.  They seem to last longer than other products, and maintenance is easy.  However, I don&#x27;t use it in the shower, so I can&#x27;t comment about using it wet.</li>
            <li> just what I needed too get them unwanted hairs. so if you are looking for a good shaver this would be it.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my old Panasonic; the battery would no longer hold a charge. Not bad for over 15 years! This new razor has wonderful improvements such as a floating head and charge station right at the outlet (it&#x27;s also pink, love it!). It works great. I would definately refer this razor to a friend.</li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic shaver on June 11,2012 and by October 13,2012 it was DEAD! It did an ok job while it lasted,(4 MONTHS). Only used about 8 times. Do not waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with quality - close shave and holds a charge for a long time.  Like the swivel head - does a great job around the knees.</li>
            <li> I wear glasses, ever tried to shave your legs when your half blind? I use this dry and my legs are still smooth and stay that way for a couple days, just like a blade shave. Don&#x27;t go back and forth between blades and an electric shaver, if you decide to go electric,and I would recomend you give it a try, stick with it, a good one like this makes it easy! Shave your legs while watching the news and save time in the morning.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the razor blades I use are so expensive and I literally have to use 2 of them to completely do my legs ankle to groin.  Plus, no matter how careful I am, I ALWAYS get razor burn because I have such sensitve skin.  So I thought this would be a perfect solution.  First of all, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a really close shave, but I ended up having to go over my legs again with a regular razor and honestly, the regular razor irritated me LESS than this, even wet with shave lotion on. This just does not get all the hairs no matter how many times you go over the same spot, and sorry but it irritated my sensitve skin even when wet, and more so dry.  I probably will continue to use it on my inner thighs just because I have a hard time using a regular razor without cutting myself in that area.  And it would be OK for a quick \\&quot;I forgot to shave and I need to go out\\&quot; shave.  But I won&#x27;t be using it much.  And it does work on your face, but honestly, my husbands 3 headed electric razor works better for my face and does not irritate me. When the blades on this get dull, I&#x27;ll be throwing it away instead of buying more blades (which by the way cost as much as the shaver).</li>
            <li> I was previously using a 20 year old electric shaver which started acting up a bit so I decided to get a new one. This new one is worse! It gives a much worse shave. I have had it for a few months now and it just gives a horrible shave. I have to go over and over and over the same area and it doesn&#x27;t look much better in the end. I think the issue is that there is no cord. So after a charge, it works well for about 2 minutes, but then as it looses power it stops shaving closely. I&#x27;m not sure what is so bad about a cord that manufacturers no longer include the option? Corded items like this always work better than cordless, but I couldn&#x27;t even find a corded razor so had to go with this one. I am sure this item will not last 20 years like my old one, as it already doesn&#x27;t hold a charge well enough to shave very close.</li>
            <li> I was pleasently surprised after trying this razor for the first time. It does not shave as close as a regular razor, but shaves about as close as my legs feel at the end of the day. I have not tried the shaver wet yet nor utilized its other sensitive features. If you are tired of shaving in the shower then I&#x27;d recommend this shaver for you.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this and not have to spend time in the shower with a regular razor.  If your hair is the least bit coarse it doesn&#x27;t cut it!!!!!  I had just as much stubble unless I \\&quot;scrubbed\\&quot; my leg red with this shaver.  Total waste of money.  It would take forever to get a decent shave with this useless POS.</li>
            <li> This ladies shaver, the panasonic ES2216PC was purchased for my wife through Amazon.com as she has constantly complained about other razors and their ability to give a close shave without having to spend so much valuable time going over and over the same areas, sometimes having to finish the job with a blade razor. This little razor does it all and cleans up with just a quick rinse under the faucet. She likes it so much she insisted on having a second one to have handy for travel and, worried that something might happened to the first one. She just did not want to chance going one day without it. She believes it to be the finest ladies razor produced and thanks to Amazon.com for their many offerings with the consumer always in mind.&lt;br /&gt;We reside in a very rural area in the mountains, The closest town is very small with limited shopping. The internet is our shopping tool and Amazon.com is our very best neighbor.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about buying this as some of the reviews weren&#x27;t great, but I love it. I find it works best dry, and it doesn&#x27;t give you the perfect up close shave. It does, however, work great on those hard to get spots like the back of my knee, so I find I don&#x27;t miss a spot like I would with a regular razor. I am so glad I decided to buy!!!</li>
            <li> The shaver works OK if you can RECHARGE IT!!!.  The problem is those prongs that push into the recharge unit eventually work there way loose.  When that happens the recharge light won&#x27;t go on eventually it will stop running.  We have tossed out two units.  We won&#x27;t by a third one.  Wall mount charge units are trouble.  Avoid them.</li>
            <li> Great to use...doesn&#x27;t get a really close shave but it will do in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Still learning how to use it but over all I like it. Speed promptly without any issues.</li>
            <li> Do not recommend. . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor.First I have ever used with a pivoting head.Very close shave,especially when used wet.I like the small charger.The charger plugs directly into the outlet,with the razor on it.This makes it much more packable.</li>
            <li> I had given up on electric razors years ago as not being able to shave close enough. Since I live in the South with only 3 months of winter the earlier models were useless. This one however is wonderful.The bikini trimmer is great. It shaves closely and well even allowing me to skip a day. The recharge time is minimal. And I like the charger that allows the razor to recharge on the wall plug not the counter saving limited space. I am pleased and recommend this product for price and performance</li>
            <li> You have to go slow with it. I wish it would shave a lot closer.</li>
            <li> I bought this in May 2011 on sale for $15 and just recently threw it in the trash. I used it about a dozen times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original intention was to have something handy for a quick decent-ish dry shave. I know electric razors don&#x27;t get as close as the real thing, but this Panasonic left me feeling like a wildebeest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I am a wildebeest. Hard to tell these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First few times I used it, it worked o.k. Maybe a 3 star product. Definitely lacking in the longevity department. Made of cheapie plasticky pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life seemed decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely not use the bikini attachment or get this thing anywhere near my crotch.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my skin is so sensitive to everything I needed an alternative.  Doesn&#x27;t shave completely smooth but I no longer have razor burn under my arms and from anyone else&#x27;s perspective, it looks like a clean shave (just doesn&#x27;t feel that way).  I do not use this on my legs, tried once and it took 35 minutes to shave because you have to go over the same spot a few times to remove the hair.  Cleaning the razor is easy and it isn&#x27;t too loud while you are using it.  I will keep using this for my underarms but can&#x27;t let go of my regular Venus razor for my legs.</li>
            <li> It does not work well. I only used it once but it hurt my skin, I doubt its quality and recommend you to take a lesson and not to buy it.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver. I have been using it dry and so far it shaves very well. I feel the shave is close enough. Very quick to use too. I keep mine charged all the time. I bought it after reading the mixed reviews but so far it is an excellent shaver. I would have given it a 5/5 rating but i agree the charger is weird.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to figure out how to use it but once I got used to it I was happy with it.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  It shaves close and love the attachments for other grooming issues.  Cant beat the price on this model.  This is the second panasonic I have purchased.  I totally recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Nice product made for ladies.  Does not irritate skin when shaving.  This works well wet or dry.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this because the reviews stated it was a good shaver.  Recommend shaver.  It does what it describes in the specifications.</li>
            <li> My wife has had two other electric razors and feels this is her best yet.  She loves how it is also immersible.</li>
            <li> My wife likes the unit. It is easy on the skin in sensitive areas. The unit is light and cordless, making it easy to manipulate for underarm and back of legs, etc.,</li>
            <li> this is awesome! already knew a head that this is not close shaved, but ,still, this is awesome. it&#x27;s close enough to not see the armpit black pots from a certain distance. of course if you take a super close look, u will still see it . anyway, its good.</li>
            <li> The shave isnt as great as i would like it to be. overall great product.</li>
            <li> was looking for the expensive model that my wife wanted, but she is happy with this... especially for the 10percent price from the expensive ones... she says a charge lasts forever, only complain, the shave isn&#x27;t super close</li>
            <li> unfortunately, this item never worked properly even though I kept trying. I eventually just threw it away. would not recommend this item to anyone</li>
            <li> Works well for what it is intended for.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, not a bad product.</li>
            <li> Scratches your skin.  Does not shave well.</li>
            <li> I suppose I should have guessed that the shave from this kind of device would be laughable. If you want to have stubble, go ahead with this. It is NOT a close shave. A ridiculous product.</li>
            <li> nice&lt;br /&gt;delivered on time</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric shaver before and find this shaver to be terrific!  I can do a quick touch up on my legs and save a ton of money on razor blades!  It works well on my cheeks, but caused bumps on my throat and chin, so I&#x27;ll stick with a different method for hair there.  Works well on my underarms too.  If you are looking for an electric razor, I highly recommend this one for the price.  I don&#x27;t use it in the shower, but find the pivoting head really helps get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I really like my electric razor.I got it cause I cut my legs when I use the disposable razors.it&#x27;s as close as you can get with an electric razor.status charged a long time.use it anywhere</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and now I use it more than she does. It takes a little practice to get a good shave but there is a learning curve with every electric razor I have owned.</li>
            <li> Too loud - doesn&#x27;t have a close shave, but would do in a pinch..which is what it will also do to your skin.</li>
            <li> I received it as a gift and was very hopeful.  I use it for underarms and also bikini area.  The underarm area is fine, but it pulls the hairs on the bikini area - very painful!  I&#x27;m just not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic shaver to replace an old Remington shaver that was probably due for retirement long ago.  As I could not find another Remington model that seemed to suit me, I decided to try the Panasonic.  The pivoting head feature is a great idea, as it makes shaving much more forgivable and seems to reduce irritation.  I have not experienced any irritation so far and find that shaving with this is rather quick and pain-free.  As other reviewers have noted, this will not give as close a shave as with a razor, but any man who&#x27;s used the two different methods of shaving will tell you the same.  For the closest shave, you would need to use a razor rather an electric shaver.  But overall, I find the Panasonic shaver does a very good job providing a fairly close shave.  The pivoting head and multiple blades seem to have been nicely designed with a woman&#x27;s needs in mind.  I also like the charger that does not require any cords, but plugs right into the outlet.  Considering what the price is for some higher-end drugstore disposable razors, I would say this is a very good buy and will certainly last much longer than a multi-pack of Ladies Gillette&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Have used this shaver dry for 3 weeks and enjoy its close and comfortable shave. Handles well, shaves close, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver in July of 2011.  By the end of August, the pop-up trimmer switch had jammed.  I called the warranty number for Panasonic.  After the \\&quot;automated assistant\\&quot; was unable to understand what I needed, I was referred to a human who also had trouble understanding what I needed.  She told me I would need to ship my entire razor to either New York or California to have it fixed.  I asked if I would have to pay shipping; she did not answer.  She gave me a telephone number to call which was not toll free.  I asked for and received a toll-free number, but when I called it I was referred to the non-toll free number.  The razor cost less than $30; it&#x27;s not worth paid calls and shipping costs and who knows how long a wait to get it fixed.  I&#x27;ll just buy a different razor to replace it, and it won&#x27;t be a Panasonic!</li>
            <li> good enough for shaving legs, under arms and face.Doesn&#x27;t leave legs very smooth but I have coarse hair on my legs. Works great on under arms. Beth</li>
            <li> I chose this shaver after reading reviews of several electric shavers online, and this one had the most positive reviews.  It does not shave as close as a regular razor, but that&#x27;s a given with electric shavers.  With that being said, I still get a fairly close shave.  The bikini attachment is one of the other reasons I chose this shaver, and it works great.  One of the reviews mentioned getting scratched from the plastic casing around the top of the razor.  The instructions state to hold the shaver at a 90 degree angle against the skin.  Holding the shaver at less of an angle puts your skin in contact with the trimmer, which can scratch you if you&#x27;re not paying attention.  Sometimes I may scratch myself slightly around the ankle bone (not majorly) if I&#x27;m not holding the shaver 90 degrees against my skin.  It hasn&#x27;t been much of an issue for me.  I&#x27;m very happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Have had this razor for several weeks and really like it. Close shave, thanks in part to the flexible head. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This ladies shaver was on a list of several that I gave my son as ideas for a birthday present.  This is the product he chose and I am very pleased!  I have used it several times now and it cuts close with no razor burn.  It handles longer hairs with ease too. Let&#x27;s see how I feel in a year or so ;o)</li>
            <li> Spent months trying to replace my Mangroomer charger - but could never find one.  Decided to take a chance on the Panasonic.  Although more expensive it works just as well and is a good replacement product.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This razor is by far the worst electric shaver I have ever bought. It is pretty but looks are deceiving especially in this case. I would rather shave my legs with a butter knife than to ever use this piece of garbage. I was looking at razors to replace my wonderful Remington razor. The new Panasonic simply does not cut, it is flimsy, it makes your legs itchy. There are no redeeming qualities that I can even share. Oh, it is pretty in pink but in this case screw the color. I would take one in puke green as long as it worked as well as my old [[ASIN:B000Q6RHJA Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeable]] did.</li>
            <li> I started researching electric shavers after experiencing daily frustration during my shaving regime.  I grew sick and tired of the daily beating I subjected my legs to while using a blade.  I would have to spend at least a half hour a day after my shower pressing tissue paper up against the nicks that my razor left me with.  Oh and forget the days where I used a brand new razor!! I would be there for an hour!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t going to rush into making as purchase, I wanted to do my research first. After reading countless reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, I concluded that the Panasonic ES2216PC wet/dry shaver was the bugatti of women&#x27;s electric shavers! And boy was I right! This shaver has definitely lived up to it&#x27;s expectations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the wet/dry function.  The fact that I can do a quick touch-up dry shave anytime I want is invaluable.  Shaving is now convenient and easy.  The shaver head is much more mobile than I had imagined it would be.  The head pivots back and forth and the individual blades have something called a \\&quot;floating system\\&quot; which allow them to move independently of one another.  And when you&#x27;re all done, the shaver rests on a convenient charging system which plugs right into the wall, vertically or horizontally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, and the fact that it is impossible to cut yourself on one of these babys is the icing on the cake! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Came on time.  Works very well.  It was a gift to the wife and she enjoys it very much.  It is the best razor that she has had.</li>
            <li> I only use this shaver for the edge of my bikini area- not the whole thing.  I think it would really hurt if you are going for the Brazilian look, because it has yanked a couple of hairs that it shouldn&#x27;t have in the past!  I am happy with the purchase however, because it trims what it needs to trim so that I can wear a swimsuit without... well, you know.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t give me ingrown hairs/bumps like my regular razor.  As other reviews mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t really give a super-smooth shave, but if that isn&#x27;t important to you, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Although I am not a panasonic fan &amp; refuse to purchase their products because of prior problems with their products and their customer service responses , I am giving this 4 stars. I purchased it without realizing it was panasonic &amp; its an ok shaver. I will pay more attention to next time.</li>
            <li> Really great razor! This is a great razor for everyday use. It doesn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as a regular blade razor, but it gets close enough for me! I love the attached bikini trimmer, too. Very good buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I was tired of paying for $20 refill razors. Looks like I&#x27;m going to have to continue to do so. This electric shaver sucks...big time. It doesn&#x27;t grab hair very well and it&#x27;s not even a close shave. It leaves behind a small prickle (which I&#x27;m sure most women don&#x27;t like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money!</li>
            <li> This was to be the third electric razor I had owned.  The previous ones were excellent, I expected the same from this one...boy am I disappointed.  It&#x27;s probably my own fault from buying a Panisonic over the Lady Remington&#x27;s I&#x27;ve previously owned.  The reviews weren&#x27;t bad, the product description was good so I decided to give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor doesn&#x27;t even come close to giving a close shave.  I&#x27;ve used electric razors long enough to know that they will never shave as close as a conventional razor but I have always had nice smooth skin after an electric shave.  Not with this razor.  I&#x27;m seriously thinking of returning it although I don&#x27;t know how Amazon feels about returns of used products.  I will give it another chance but I&#x27;m not holding out much hope.</li>
            <li> Just try it smoothest cut we have ever seen, make any shape you can image.Nice charger,and quick charging unit.Product has nice design for easy handling,even for small ladies hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver about a year.  I thought it was charging efficiently but I was wrong.  The charger is a square that plugs into the wall and the shaver sits on the charging station.  However, mine wasn&#x27;t able to connect properly and when it died I was unable to get it attached to the charger properly.  Now I have to buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She tried it and said it was very good but didn&#x27;t cut as close as she had hoped it would.  She&#x27;s used to using a disposable razor which I&#x27;m sure would cut closer.  This was expected so she was satisfied with it since it would at least avoid being cut from a razor nick.  It is also a little bit noisy during use compared to my Norelco electric shaver I use on my facial hair.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and purchased this knowing that when used DRY your skin must be DRY NOT DAMP.  I use my blow dryer on my skin then use the shaver just to be safe!</li>
            <li> Too early to respond as it&#x27;s only been used a couple of time to date when it worked as expected.</li>
            <li> from the guard, to the adjustable height clippers, all the way to how it swivels and curves with YOUR curves, I&#x27;d reccomend this product to anyone. I&#x27;ve already had to warn my BF to keep it away from his face upon pain of death.</li>
            <li> I did quite a bit of searching around online looking at different shavers before deciding to buy this product. I&#x27;d gotten really tired of buying and then throwing away those little tiny trimmers, since you can&#x27;t ever find replacement blades for then. Plus, refills for this product were easy to come by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was very happy with it. It shaved both legs and bikini areas without any problems, and was very easy to clean. Be aware that it doesn&#x27;t get rid of all the stubble- I used it to cut longer hairs, then I&#x27;d go back with a regular razor to get it completely smooth. As I had only intended to use the product occasionally and as a supplement to my regular razor, that was fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After six months of use, however, I&#x27;m very unsatisfied with it. I just replaced the blades for the first time, thinking I&#x27;d get the same performance as brand new, but that was not the case. What they don&#x27;t tell you on the packaging or in the manual is that the foils and the cutter blades are replaceable, but the trimmer blades are not. This means that when you go to shave longer hairs, the trimmer yanks on them really painfully, and doesn&#x27;t cut them at all. Ouch! I have over forty dollars invested in this product, and now it&#x27;s essentially useless. I wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our daughter to begin learning how to shave.  It wouldn&#x27;t even shave her fine hair.  It was extremely disappointing.  I definitely would not recommend this item.  It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My wife says it&#x27;s very easy to use and does a very good job. The one she had before would cut and scratch her legs.</li>
            <li> Died after only 4 months. Wont hold a charge or turn on.</li>
            <li> Takes long time to shave and does a worst job that a razor.</li>
            <li> This razor does not live up to the task. Took it with me on a long vacation and had to spend too much time trying to put it back together after cleaning it. 2 springs fell out and it took too long to get the shaver back to working order. I cannot get the close shave that I need. I am looking for the replacement.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with how this razor gives a nice close shave wet or dry.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Terrible at holding a charge - good for one use only then has to go back on the plug! Used for bikini zone, it pulls on hair terribly unless hair is soft from a recent shower.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this, had it a loonngg time now and its still purring away.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave. Don&#x27;t use the pop up trimmer.</li>
            <li> Have only used it dry so far, but the cut is smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have health issues that sometime make my hands shake, so using a traditional razor can be a bit challenging.&lt;br /&gt;This gives a nicely close shave and the bikini attachment is nice for trimming as needed. It works very well wet or dry and requires only a fee passes to get all underarm hair.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t too heavy and the vibration isn&#x27;t extreme which is nice for people with arthritis or other issues with hand and arm strength and pain.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. She is very pleased with this product and she would recommend it to any one in need of a good shaving device.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver with Bikini...&lt;br /&gt;Was a gift for my wife.  Used it right away and she loves it.</li>
            <li> My daughter says she loves the quality of this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and razors irritate me, I bought this Panasonic because I had seen several reviews as being very good and the price was very good. However once I used it found that it pulls the hair, it does not cut them and it irritates my skin more then a razor, I had used a Remington shaver for years but it was time to replace and I did not want to spend $90 on it. BIG MISTAKE I SHOULD Have!</li>
            <li> I never used a shaver before, but I wish I would of tried one earlier.  This one works well and is a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> There is nothing unique about this wet shaver... it still hurts yours legs while in use, still does not give as close of a shave as using a cheap-o razor and frankly is far from worth the price.  I would not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife threw this one away.</li>
            <li> Not only does this razor hold a much longer charge than previous ones I have owned, but it also provides a close shave even dry.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, accurate description, quick delivery. A+</li>
            <li> This razor is okay in a pinch, but I do not get a close enough shave and the battery does not hold out that long.</li>
            <li> regarding this product was a gift to my wife, and she used and told me that the leaflets perdiron its edge.</li>
            <li> I was 100% satisfied with the Wet/Dry Shaver.</li>
            <li> read the reviews and bought this shaver for my wife for christmas, she loves it ,works very well for her. i became the hero ... thanks panasonic</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife.. and she loves it.. I cant vouch for the ease of use but the end results are pretty good.. :)</li>
            <li> After reviewing a few different makes and models of electric razors, I chose this one because it claimed super sharp blades and a very close shave. I am NOT disappointed. Even if I have to go back and forth once or twice to get a good close shave (I understand that is normal for electric razors?), I do not suffer razor rash at all. Underarms are as smooth with this razor as with a traditional 3-blade throw-away razor, and this one has a pivoting head that glides across my skin much easier than any traditional razor I&#x27;ve used. The bikini attachment is very useful and the entire head assembly is easy to use, easy to disassemble for cleaning, and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering an electric razor, I can&#x27;t recommend this enough. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but I have had zero problems with the razor itself or the shaving. No pulled hairs, no rash or bumps, and no nicks. Instructions say it&#x27;ll take a couple weeks of steady shaving to get the &amp;#34;best result&amp;#34;, but I am already happy with its performance. The &amp;#34;WET/DRY&amp;#34; claim is also true; I&#x27;ve used it in and out of the shower, even dropped it once onto a tile floor and it did not break. Durable and amazing. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a gift for my wife. She told me she really likes it. It is easy to operate and does a fine job .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!  She had tried a cheaper product that just didn&#x27;t work, so I read lots of reviews on Amazon before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I love this razor for my underarms. It gives a smooth shave and no nicks and irritation. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> While true that this razor does not shave quite as close as a non-electric triple razor might, it still works great dry shaving in a hurry or in the shower splashing on lots of shave lotion.</li>
            <li> I also have an Emjoy epilator - which I LOVE, but I wanted something I could take with me on camping trips. I started growing chin hairs in my 40s, &amp; after years of plucking every day, more &amp; more each year, a girlfriend told me about the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Epilator &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it for 2010. I&#x27;ve gone from plucking 20 -30+ hairs EVERY day to 3-5 hairs every 3 or 4 days. Which is why I bought the Panasonic shaver - for those days I&#x27;m out in the woods camping &amp; there&#x27;s no where to plug in my Emjoy!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had electric shavers before, but this is by far the BEST - it gets VERY close to the skin. The bikini attachment is great too - although  you do have to hold it to keep it on the shaving head - but is does a very close &amp; painless job! The shaving head &#x27;pivots&#x27; - moves easily to the shape of your body as you move it, which helps get those &#x27;corners&#x27;. I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet, but it&#x27;s great to be able to rinse it under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;This rose above my expectations and I definitely  recommend this to any woman!</li>
            <li> Received it right on time and used it right out of the box. Very close shave.  Love the pivoting head.  Don&#x27;t need to press down too hard at all.  Just let it float over your skin.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the second I purchased.  The first one lasted ten years.  I bougth a Remington and it was horrible.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have typically bought one of these as I would&#x27;ve seen it as a waste of money.  I had just had foot surgery and couldn&#x27;t shower nor shave easily. This was perfect for the time!</li>
            <li> My wife used this shaver for  2 months but now it will not recharge.  Now it&#x27;s just trash.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor for my mother in a nursing home and she loves it.  The transaction was fast and easy and would highly recommend to friends,</li>
            <li> dose a good job for the price. Easy cleaning  and flexable heads  are a plus. Was packaged good when shipped.</li>
            <li> Works better than my husband&#x27;s electric; like the trimmer; can use on my face and underarms without pinching; cleans easily and most important--no nicks like with a blade.  Good for those of us getting older and needing a safer way to shave.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t shave like I had hoped. I don&#x27;t feel they leave my legs smooth, but they do the trick in a rush.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I bought from Amazon.  First was for me and than one for my daughter-in-law  who is still telling me how much she loves it.  Good price does an excellent job, and keeps a great charge.  Easy to take for travel no cord small charger.</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised at how much I love using this new shaver...It is the bomb!  I use it for legs, bikini, armpits, and some facial...definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> so easy to use. its not as smooth as a wax but I love it! I&#x27;ve used it on my underarms, legs, and bikini area....loves it!</li>
            <li> This shaver really does the job for me. I love using it!  Plus it is pink as a bonus! With the shaving gel I use, it glides right over my skin and takes my unwanted hair off. I love mixing water with my shaving gel. Without doing that the razor constantly needs cleaning of being clogged up with the gel. Luckily I tried mixing water now I don&#x27;t got to keep re-cleaning it over and over. Plus I had to stop using so much gel...went gel crazy! But with a little bit of gel to cover the area, then slather water over the spot too. This makes a beautiful shave for me!</li>
            <li> worst ever! it hurts.. it cuts uneven..it pulls...it&#x27;s just a total piece of crap...  it probably only works if you&#x27;re bald to begin with! I&#x27;d rather use a disposable razor !</li>
            <li> Have used this item for years and still works great.</li>
            <li> My daughter received this for a christmas gift and it has solved all her shaving issues.  She breaks out normally in the armpit area from regular razors.  She loves this and no longer has the rash and pain.  It works great on her legs too.  I did research the item prior to purchasing an electric razor and this one has definately held up to what was recommended.  I highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> This product does the job but it isn&#x27;t as great as the shaver i was using.  I was using my BF&#x27;s Norelco but he got tired of me forgetting to charge it and made me get my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this one based on reviews and honestly expected a bit better.  The longer hair shaver piece isn&#x27;t as powerful as my old one, but nonetheless it does the job.</li>
            <li> It is a shaver and not a razor so you don&#x27;t get the close shave like you would with a razor.  After shaving you still feel the prickles.  It is really easy when you just need to do a quick job when running out in shorts.</li>
            <li> Its great in or out of the shower/bath. I really like it. really really rreally really really really like it.</li>
            <li> I really hate this razor.  It just pulls hair and doesnt work.  I would not recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver! So far, I have only used it dry but I tried the pop-up bikini trimmer and it is a great thing to have if you want to trim things up in a pinch! Doesn&#x27;t shave &amp;#34;baby smooth&amp;#34; but it does a great job!! I&#x27;m impressed!! I would definitely recommend this shaver!! Great price, fast shipping, quality product!!!</li>
            <li> It really works. Had to buy for my Mom who is on Coumadin. Works really well. Would purchase for myself if i needed to.</li>
            <li> Shaver is awesome; well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Love the way it make my skin feel</li>
            <li> I actually previously bought this item for my daughter, and loved it so much that i had to buy one for myself!</li>
            <li> i  would recommend this shaver to anyone, no nicks as with a razor shaver.  It is lightweight, and it gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> First of all, shipping was quick, and I found this product to be exactly as described.  I was hesitant in purchasing it because of some of the negative reviews I read, but the description and price was all good for me.  It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver, but this thing shaves well in or out of water.  It&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re crunched for time.  The shave is not as close as a razor, but darned near close, and the hair&#x27;s not even visible.  I have also used this on my armpits and bikini area; not one complaint.  I would definitely recommend this shaver to anyone considering it!</li>
            <li> NIce idea on the pop up trimmer; but I think I&#x27;d rather have a larger shaving area than the small head on this.  I have an old and I do mean old Remington (dates back to 1990&#x27;s) and it is still by far my favorite.  This one leaves you feeling a bit dry after shaving.  My old one leaves me nice and smooth.  I also don&#x27;t care for the charger on this one.  It plugs directly into the wall and the shaver sits on top of it so you have to have a wall outlet that you can do this with.  I live in an old house and all my outlets are very close to the floor.</li>
            <li> Was given as a gift to my grand daughter - she loves it</li>
            <li> I love my shaver! It is a must have for every woman! It is so quick and easy to use!!</li>
            <li> I had a Braun for years which worked well until I dropped and broke it.  I thought I&#x27;d try this since reviews were decent.  Being charitable, if you shave every day, maybe this would work.  But it is completely useless on any hair that has ANY growth beyond stubble.  I will order a Braun to replace.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Remington razors for years and became disappointed with the replacement blades and the length of time (1-2 Years) the rechargeable battery lasted.  Was thrilled with this razor for the first 3 months.  Then it stopped cutting the hairs unless I went over the area 6-7 times!  I thought that was pretty soon for time to replace blades etc.  I ordered replacement blades at $24 when the razor itself cost $33!  Replacing the blades did not fix the problem.  Too late to return entire razor to Amazon.com.  Maybe I&#x27;ll contact Panasonic...??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the ES2207P model.  It does not have the pivoting head but SO FAR it&#x27;s better than this model.</li>
            <li> This device hurts on some parts of the body, but it still saves you a little time by getting removing the noticeable hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely does not work as well as expected.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once, it pulls your hair if your not careful.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it for long, but it suits my purposes so far.</li>
            <li> This razor is a very good ladies item. It is smooth cutting with no pulling. Will see how long it last now.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this and uses it in the shower and the bath with no problems and it shaves very good with a geat price</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically because it said &#x27;wet/dry&#x27;.  I have three kids and don&#x27;t have tons of time for myself, so I wanted this for convenience.  Unfortunately, when using it dry, it feels like I just have at least a day&#x27;s growth of stubble left behind on my legs.  I was expecting for it to be just a little better than that, not silky smooth on a dry run, but smoother than what I got.  On a wet run, it&#x27;s smoother, but, again, not silky smooth or as smooth as I expected a wet run would give me.  I do use it to avoid razor burn though, because I get less razor burn from this than a disposable razor.  I guess that should be expected though, since it&#x27;s not such a close shave.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase. The blades are sharp and at first I was worried it would give me a rash especially under my arms, but it didn&#x27;t. However it&#x27;s still not as close of a shave as I was hoping for, and you have to go over the same areas at least twice. But it&#x27;s a good value and does the job well enough for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the way this Panasonic cut so close and left my wifes legs as smooth as you know what. It&#x27;s the first shaver that cut so close and she had no knicks as in the past with other shavers. She is very pleased and so am I because We found the \\&quot;Best of the Best\\&quot;, finally. It&#x27;s new and I hope it continues to give her close shaves because stubble is not good.</li>
            <li> I was upgraded to this model a few years ago, after my old Panasonic shaver died and the company proved unable to repair it. The razor works okay, as far as electric shavers go. Naturally, the shave isn&#x27;t anywhere near as close as with a disposable razor, but that&#x27;s to be expected. As with other electric razors I&#x27;ve tried, I usually have to go over an area several times to get all the hairs, and every time I&#x27;ve used it on my underarms, I&#x27;ve ended up with razor burn. I&#x27;ve never used it in the shower, but in dry conditions it&#x27;s somewhat comfortable and easy to operate and maintain. Not the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried - that distinction goes to my husband&#x27;s Norelco 5603x, much to his chagrin - but not the worst, either. In terms of function, I give it a 3/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, somewhere between this and my old model, Pansonic decided to replace the cord charger with a wall-mounted unit. Perhaps they thought this a sleeker design that takes up less counter space? However, the wall unit makes it difficult to charge the razor in tight spaces. For example, the outlet over my bathroom counter sits right under a windowsill; the lack of vertical space renders it useless for charging the Panasonic 2216. Worse still, over time the charger has ceased working altogether. Because the razor is top-heavy and curves slightly outward, it pulls forward, away from the wall - and off the base of the charger. With normal use, the connection between the razor and charger has loosened to the point that I can no longer force the razor to stand upright on its base. Charging became intermittent and then stopped altogether. I haven&#x27;t been able to charge it in months. I hate to get rid of it, since it isn&#x27;t broken or anything - but unless Panasonic releases a replacement cord charger, it&#x27;s as good as useless.</li>
            <li> I am new to the electric razor thing,but It works just ok in my opinion.I have not used it in the shower yet</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing an electric (battery) razor because they just did not work for me.  I tried this one after reading many reviews and agree it&#x27;s the best. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> For the first few months of use this electric shaver worked fine.  It needed a few passes to really trim the hair on my legs, but I have found that to be the case with all electric shavers I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after a couple months it began to not cut very cleanly, and then began to snag and pull out hairs painfully.  I treated the shaver gently, stored it in a dry place and cleaned it carefully once a month.  I don&#x27;t know if the product just gives out after a short period, if I got a lemon or if there was some user-error on my part, but I am displeased with my purchase and I wouldn&#x27;t buy this model again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another point of note about the product is that the charger plugs directly into the wall, so keep that in mind.  I couldn&#x27;t plug it in the outlet in my bathroom because the outlet is immediately below my medicine cabinet.  It was nice to have it up and out of the way for charging in the outlet that I did plug it into, though.</li>
            <li> I rarely take time to write reviews but I was so impressed with this product that I had to share.  It is by far the best electric razor I have owned.  The pivoting head makes for a more comfortable shave.  A huge plus for me is that it&#x27;s easy to clean.  Just pop the head off, rinse all the parts, let dry, put back together. I believe it&#x27;s unrealistic to expect any electric razor to give you as smooth a shave as a traditional razor but this one comes close.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried maybe a dozen different electric razors and epilators, and this is the only one I&#x27;ve purchased twice.  I use a normal razor for my legs (it&#x27;s a closer shave and isn&#x27;t irritating to the less sensitive skin), but I find that an electric razor works best for my underarms and bikini area.  Most electric razors still pinch in those areas, but this one doesn&#x27;t as long as I keep the skin flat while working.  It still gets closer than I can manage with a normal razor, but doesn&#x27;t cause irritation even when shaving against the grain.  I had the last one for several years (of in-shower use) before the motor started to get a bit weaker and the blades a bit dull, and I think an average of $7-10 a year for a shave this good is extremely reasonable, so I bought another one - no questions asked.  When this one starts to go south, I plan to do the same thing again.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver for the bikini area. It is gentle and does a great job. I would recommend it over a classic razor for the bikini region.</li>
            <li> This is good in a pinch (like, you&#x27;re running late and realize you haven&#x27;t shaved your legs), but don&#x27;t expect a close or long-lasting shave. On the plus side, you won&#x27;t have to worry about any nicks or scrapes like you would with a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> this item is good why can I say something about this item  short and easy. can it it be like ebay</li>
            <li> Fast delivery; Not as happy as I thought it would be. Manual shaving is still closer to the skin. It is handy for last min shaving.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Works great.</li>
            <li> This shaver does not work well at all. I have to go over the same spot multiple times and even the. It doesn&#x27;t completely remove the hair. Also it&#x27;s flimsy. Really disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> works better than I expected. Great bargain</li>
            <li> I didn t like it from the beginning.The noise level is too high like a tractor. Plus it does not get close enough to skin to cut the hair well and if you try to do so it will scratch the skin.Don t buy it.I just finally got Remington WDF4840 Women&#x27;s Smooth and Silky Foil Shaver and I love it.You will get silky smooth legs for the same price</li>
            <li> Not happy. It doesnt give a deep shave</li>
            <li> It is better than the Remington and annie I bought before.</li>
            <li> Great product and good delivery time</li>
            <li> I never thought I will have to write negative review for this product when I used it for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Its just a month I bought this shaver and I already lost one of its inner blades.After using it for the first time, I wanted to clean it and hence was trying to open its outer foil.The foil was so tight that I had to put extra effort to take it off and just then one of the inner blades jumped out and landed inside sink.I couldn&#x27;t retrieve it and so my machine is not usable now until I get one inner blade. I called customer service and they told to place order for new blades. When I come here to order new blades, I see they are no longer available. Now my brand new machine is useless until I get a blade. I don&#x27;t know what to do. Its such a waste.</li>
            <li> I love this razor- the pivoting head is perfect for legs. Also love the bikini attachment- gets the job done without pain!</li>
            <li> I love this electric shaver!  I, seriously, cannot believe that I have gone 33 years without it.  I have been trying to find a way to remove all of the hair \\&quot;down there\\&quot; but couldn&#x27;t find a good option.  Regular razors always caused severe razor burn and waxing was just too expensive to keep up with.  So, I stumbled upon this shaver, purchased it, and crossed my fingers.  I am SO glad that I did!  It is definitely worth the money.  I was very skeptical, but was then shocked at how well it worked.  It completely removed all of the hair and left it very smooth.  I almost feel like I got a Brazilian!  I will be getting this shaver as a gift for my girlfriends.  Just go buy it!</li>
            <li> I have very coarse hair on my legs and have a terrible time shaving, but this razor is wonderful. Very close shave and you don&#x27;t have to keep going over and over your leg to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST one I could find after reviewing many electric shavers. I purchased this for my mother in law who had very swollen legs as a result of cancer. I was able to easily shave her legs without her experiencing any pain. We couldn&#x27;t believe how good of a shave she got from using an electric shaver! The price was amazing too! She was SO happy that she could have SMOOTH legs again without the risks involved when using a regular razor! The little things in life really mean a lot!! RIP MOM!!</li>
            <li> This razor works great. I really liked it.I bought one for myself and two more for gifts. Too bad the charger was poorly designed. The reason for the low rating is how it charges the razor.It will not stay on the charger. I tried every way you could think of to keep it on the charger. Still would not stay connected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the razor two weeks so, time will tell on battery life, etc., but I like the razor.  It does legs and underarms comfortably.  And, I have been using it on that facial \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot; women of a certain age get.  Very comfortable, no irritation!  We&#x27;ll see how long the blades stay sharp but replacements appear to be available.  The switches are stiff at this point and a little diffiuclt to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> This Shaver works great for about a month! Then, it dies and will not turn on. This is the second one that quit in a months time.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the other reviews I&#x27;ve decided to purchase this product. As other mention, the shave is not as close as razor blade. However, it&amp;iexcl;¦s very fast and convenient. I tried it both in the shower and on dry skin, and I like it on dry skin better. It didn&amp;iexcl;¦t seem to glide very much on wet skin, even with some  shaving cream. Overall I&amp;iexcl;¦m satisfied, but probably will by men&amp;iexcl;¦s electric shaver when this one breaks º</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t women get a razor that shaves as good as a man? Don&#x27;t like it at all. The side blade cut my underarms. I will probably not ever use it again.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, get&#x27;s dull after 3 months of every other day use. If you can get it for under $25 you&#x27;re getting a good deal</li>
            <li> I have had this for years. Best shaver . I have dropped it soooo many times and it turns on an works great.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after undergoing radiation treatments so that I could shave under the arm where the nerves were damaged as advised by my doctor. However the product pinched like the dickens and I even tried it on my legs.  It seemed to me that you had to be very specific on the angle you hold it at and when shaving keeping that angle did not work for me. So here it sits in the drawer after two tries and that was with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my wife and she hates it. she says all it does is pull the hair and hurts. i tried it and she is right.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see that it worked just like the advertisement promised.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must for personal care. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> OK for the price, but 10 months after purchase,  I&#x27;m buying a higher quality men&#x27;s shaver..  This shaver works but it&#x27;s a struggle to accomplish much with it.  It kind of reminds me of EZ-bake oven..  It&#x27;s almost a toy mocking the real thing..  Not only that but the charger is a real pain and I can no longer get the damn thing to sit straight on the charger and actually charge.  Next.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this! Handy and waterproof. Much better than the disposable razors. The weight of it can make the plug in come out of the wall easily for the charger, so my suggestion for buyers is to find a plug in where it won&#x27;t get bumped as its is top heavy.</li>
            <li> Due to eczema outbreaks on my legs, I cannot use a regular razor at times.  That is why I purchased this electric shaver.  I must say I am extremely pleased with it.  It shaves closely without damaging my skin.  I find it quicker and easier to shave my legs with this shaver also.  So, though the smoothness of my legs may last for fewer days as compared to a razor shave, it is quick and easy to shave again.  I am very happy with this shaver and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for exactly 5 months now. I&#x27;ve used other trimmers (Remington and something else I can&#x27;t remember) that slid right over my longer hairs, but Panasonic ES2216PC&#x27;s pop-up trimmer snags on nearly every hair and makes trimming painful. It can&#x27;t be from foil dullness since it started happening right out of the box. The trimmer also seems to miss many hairs (and also snags) when I&#x27;m doing my arms and legs. The flexible head is fun to play with, but too wide to be entirely comfortable for my smaller curves when I&#x27;m trying to get a close shave, so consider the head dimensions when purchasing. Overall it&#x27;s a good shaver and does its job, but I&#x27;m going to try my little Remington again; I had originally switched because the Remington&#x27;s charger lead had oxidized.</li>
            <li> You know those times when you just don&#x27;t have time to shave? You&#x27;re getting ready for work, running late, and it&#x27;s summertime and the only thing clean you have to wear is a skirt? But oh no, you haven&#x27;t shaved in a while...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those instances where this electric shaver is perfect! I can shave my legs in just a couple of minutes and get on with the rest of my day! I&#x27;ve had this shaver since last March and it&#x27;s still working great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that this is NOT a close shave like you&#x27;ll get with a regular razor, so don&#x27;t give up your shaving gel and regular razor just yet. When I shave using this electric shaver, there&#x27;s always just a little bit of stubble. (notice I said just a little bit) Kind of reminds me of how it feels the day after I shave when the hair just starts to grow back. But even though you can feel a little stubble, the hair is not easily noticeable. (And I have dark leg hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it for anyone who feels too lazy to go through all of the trouble of properly shaving their legs!</li>
            <li> My wife loves the product. She just leaves plugged in and it is always ready when she needs it. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I saw this product adverstised on the Today Show arround the Christmas holiday. I am usually spectical when purchasing prior to testing a product. I should have stuck with my gut feeling on this one, I am so disappointed that I wasted my money. I was unable to get a smooth shave dry, and it was unconfortable to get shave the whole leg. The shaver is not comfortable to hold, I had to reposition the devise to shaver.  althought it&#x27;s advertised to be used wet or dry, I don&#x27;t want to risk damaging the shaver by submerging in water.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic I have bought over the years. It does not give razor burn and is great on delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box did not cut just grabed hair very pain full. Will never buy this product ever again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter. She says it works better than other, cheaper razors, but occasionally leaves longer hairs on her legs that it does not cut.</li>
            <li> This was going to be a gift.  We couldn&#x27;t find it, sold out everywhere.  Found it on Amazon.  Shipped immediately.  Was a gift for our granddaughter.  She really liked it, our daughter &amp;#34;borrowed it&amp;#34; and loves it too.  Amazon and the product were both excellent</li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone buying this, it&#x27;s great in the shower or dry...works amazing and holds a charge forever!!  LOVE!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt! Easy to use! Just wish I could get a closer save (still feels stubbly, even though I hold my skin taut while shaving). But maybe then it would hurt. I&#x27;m okay with this in the winter months, but in the summer with shorts I use a wet disposable razor.</li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD PRODUCT, YOU WOULD HAVE TO KEEP GOING OVER THE SAME SPOT BEFOR IT TAKES ANY HAIR OFF</li>
            <li> Best women&#x27;s razor I&#x27;ve owned.  Granted, the others were cheap.  We bought an expensive razor &amp; he raved about how much better it was than the others he&#x27;s owned.  So I decided to buy a nice razor for myself.  It was worth it.  My legs almost feel like I shaved with a razor.....almost.</li>
            <li> easy to handle and clean---arthritic hands are a bear!  The head pivots enough to reach back  of knees and thighs</li>
            <li> Wife loves the shaver...good buy</li>
            <li> This works better than your average electric shaver.  There is no electric shaver on the market that will get you as close as a razor will, but it works well for the money.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very comfortable &amp; easy to use &amp; gives a pretty close shave. I like that it can be used wet or dry. I have severe arthritis &amp; fibromyalgia &amp; I actually sat on the couch &amp; watched TV while I shaved.</li>
            <li> I love this Razor, Just wish it would last, Have purchased two and they both died.  They are unavailable everywhere.  Now have to pay for shipping to return it and no guarentee it will be fixed ot what the amount is that it will cost me. Very Dissapointed in this process of replacing the razor that I truly love.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as other electric razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.  It takes a little longer to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife, at her request, and she reports that it more than meets her expectations, and she has no complaints about the product.</li>
            <li> Love it.My second one to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Other still works but some teeth are missing.</li>
            <li> I am a shaving cream and razor kind of gal but due to some health issues I needed to buy a ladies shaver.  Panasonic is a great name in electronics so I decided to buy this model.  It is just OK.  After shaving my legs I still felt stubble.  I shaved them again with the same result.  Not sure how much I will use it in the future but it sure does not beat my old fashion blade and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver!  I saw a lot of complaints about this not shaving very close... duh!  It&#x27;s a freakin&#x27; electric shaver, its not a razor!  I&#x27;ll be honest... I bought this because after a surgery on my back, I was left with very little feeling in the back of my thighs.  I had been a shaving with a common Gillete razor before this incident and after many cuts, I decided I needed to switch.  Think about it, we shave the back of our upper legs by feel, I couldn&#x27;t feel it, so things got dangerous, haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched a lot of shavers before deciding on this one.  I&#x27;m glad I did!  It works like a charm and gives me a pretty close shave, despite it being an electric shaver.  My advice to you though... don&#x27;t do what I did.  I used it in the shower and out and would always rinse out the pieces when I was done, then put it back on the charger.  Over time, it stopped working very well, until it stopped doing anything... not the motor, but the internal blades.  They wouldn&#x27;t cut one single hair and it&#x27;s not like I have crazy hair growth or anything.  My Husband is a knife collector/user and will sit an sharpen his knives while we watch movies and stuff, so I asked him about it.  He asked me if the shaver came with oil to treat it the blades.  No, it doesn&#x27;t.  He was like, if you get metal wet and then let it air dry, it will dull the edge of the blade.  That makes sense.  So, I bought the blade replacement set for it and he let&#x27;s me use his gun oil on the blade when I&#x27;m done and it&#x27;s been amazing ever since... who would have known!  It doesn&#x27;t say anything about oiling the blades in the instruction manual... guess they want to make that money on the replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after you use it... rinse the blades off, like take the part off and rinse it out... dry it with a towel real quick, then put it back together.  Put a dot of oil on each of the outer foils and on the two clippers on each end, then turn it on and run it for like 3 seconds.  That&#x27;s it.  I promise you, your shaver will now last way longer... thank sweet baby Jesus for guys that know about knives and stuff..  I promise you, your shaver will now last way longer... thank sweet baby Jesus for guys that know about knives and stuff.</li>
            <li> Best spent money on an amazing ladies shaver.  Gets a very close shave.  Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver for the money. It is easy to charge and holds its charge well. It shaves well too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter 2 years ago. I purchased it based on the many positive reviews. When I used it recently, it was noisy and not a smooth shave - it pulled at the hair. My daughter said it has been like this since she got it and never liked it.</li>
            <li> Wife &amp; Grand Daughter both love the ease of shave &amp; smooth silky results the Panasonic ES2216PC.  I bought them each a Panasonic.  Grandma&#x27;s was a replacement for her old Remington &amp; Grand Daughters her first shaver.  Both offered high praise for the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver 2 months and a half months ago and it worked great for the first two months.  I was really excited about it because razors give me really bad razor bumps and I thought I had finally found the solution.  It stopped cutting the hairs all together and even when it did, it pulled the hairs and sometimes even cut me.  The blades and outer foil supposedly last a long time so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s time to replace them, I just think it&#x27;s a lousy product!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Excellent transaction!</li>
            <li> I really wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money. I still have stubbles on my legs after using and it&#x27;s horrible for the bikini area. Stick to your razors ladies. Trust me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a close shave at all! I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money if I had it to do over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a while now and at first I was really happy with it.  I had been using an old mens Braun shaver with a cord so this seemed wonderful.  I do have to admit that it did fall off the toilet tank once and the razors popped off but it was fine for a while after that so I don&#x27;t think that is what did it.  I noticed that the popup trimmer stopped working and upon closer inspection I realized that the front trimmer wasn&#x27;t working anymore at all.  If I squeezed the head it would work a little but something just wasn&#x27;t catching properly on the inside.  I figured it still worked OK so I just turned it around and used the back trimmer for longer hairs.  Slowly though, the back trimmer has stopped working as well.  I took it traveling with me and one of the delicate plastic parts on the top of the plug that the handle snaps onto got bent and snapped off.  So now it doesn&#x27;t plug in right unless I balance it just so... I know that some of that is basic wear and tear but it was a delicate design that is easily damaged if you put it in your suitcase.  I&#x27;ve also found that since it&#x27;s heavy it just slides out of some outlets completely.  I&#x27;ve had to tape it to the wall to keep it charging before.  I&#x27;ve only had it about a year and sometimes it won&#x27;t even turn on and it&#x27;s noticeably slower.  I still use it on my knees and armpits because the Remington I bought to replace (wet/dry with the aloe vera strip) cuts me pretty badly in those areas but does an OK job on flat parts of my legs.  If anyone finds a proper electric razor that doesn&#x27;t break or take forever let me know!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little rough sometimes but it gets the job done.  Would definitely buy again.  It is very durable. thx.</li>
            <li> this was a replacement shaver.  I gave a shaver like it to my wife a few years ago and could not find a way to sharpen or replace the head so I bought her a new one.  She likes the new shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors for over 30 years.  This is, by far, the best one I have used.  I have uneven skin under my arms,  and have deep pockets, making traditional blade-razors very difficult to use.  This razor glides over the skin without any pinching, burning or biting.  I have been using it every 1-2 days for over a month now.  I am thrilled with it.  I plan on buying a 2nd one for my 13-year old daughter so she will leave mine alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not shave the bikini area with it, so I cannot make any recommendations on that!</li>
            <li> This is terrible. I used to use an old men&#x27;s Norelco on my legs years ago, and it worked fairly well. This is useless. The bikini attachment is a joke, you can&#x27;t use the thing on your armpits without harming the sensitive skin, and yeah, it gets a fairly decent shave on your legs, but only after spending too much time going the same area over and over again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My story began as an effort to leave behind over priced cartridge razors that keep adding blades and other nonsense. I wanted to stop paying for products that irritated my sensitive skin. This didn&#x27;t really do that since it only worked on my legs... Barely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am making the leap to a safety razor. This terrible razor has left me looking for better things. I am purchasing a Merker safety razor after this review, and, fingers crossed, I won&#x27;t be looking back.</li>
            <li> After 1 year this razor simply doesn&#x27;t cut my fine hair anymore. I can go over my legs multiple times to no avail. I&#x27;ve tried it wet and dry. Won&#x27;t buy another one!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use because I am on blood thinners.  I am really used to manual razors, but this one does well in the shower.  Great that you can get it wet and not have to worry about it.  Would really like a little closer shave, but all in all it does well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it both wet and dry, either way it gave a good close shave. If you use wet be sure to have something on the skin besides just water. I use hair conditioner, you just need a little something to act as a lube to glide easy over skin.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and razor works great! It gives a very close shave with no irritation. Also you can recharge it. My old razor used batteries so it saves money not to have to buy batteries all the time.</li>
            <li> The razor does not give me a close shave on my legs.  I am very disappointed in it.  The special attachment pulls the hair.</li>
            <li> One of the best razors I have ever used.  Very close, fast shave. Keeps a charge for a long time. The moving head makes it easy to use and very efficient.</li>
            <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job.  It pulls hairs out, and pinches the underarm skin. It&#x27;s laying in the drawer in the bathroom cabinet never to come out again.</li>
            <li> I like the shaver, however I have not mastered it yet.  It holds a charge a long time and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves the convenience of using the shaver in or out of the bathtub.  It is worth the price and now I am thinking about getting another one for me.</li>
            <li> I only used it once so far and it gave a clean close shave on my legs and my underarms.</li>
            <li> The shaver works great and keeps its charge for quite a while. Delivery was a little slow.</li>
            <li> Works well for an electric razor. If you are looking for a razor close shave, use a razor. This works great for quick shaves.</li>
            <li> not worth your money, worst shaver i ever used, just no good, after i quite using this i went to a cheap battery operated one, been using it about a year now.</li>
            <li> WHAT MY WIFE TOLD ME WORKS FINE, SHE DOES RECOMMEND IT, BEFORE SHE BUYS THIS ONE , SHE BOUGHT A REMINGTON TITANIUM WHO LAST FOR ONLY COUPLE MONTHS, ANY TOOL OR ELECTRONICS MADE BY PANASONIC USE TO BE THE BEST. I HOPE THIS HELPS.</li>
            <li> This shaver provides a good close shave and is very easy to use . It is light in weight and flexible. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> functions as it should and as advetised&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trueman Bryer</li>
            <li> We did a lot of research when looking for a shaver and this one had a lot of positive reviews. My daughter really likes it!</li>
            <li> My most recent purchase is the second one of these that I have bought.  I use it daily for &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; my pubic area because my boyfriend is not at all fond of too much &amp;#34;grass&amp;#34; down there!  The first one I gave to him and he also uses it on a daily basis to keep his pubic area nice and smooth which is what I prefer.  It does such a great job that you really can use it every-other-day and still stay nice and smooth down there but I prefer to use it every morning after I have shaved my face (with a blade).  I have even received comments from the other guys at my club wanting to know what I do to keep things looking so attractive down there and I have recommended this product to them.  So, the bottom line is...........The Panasonic ES2216PC is not just for the ladies any more!</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic electric razor and loved it. The cord went bad could not get a replacement. I purchased this one, I was comparable. It does not work.</li>
            <li> love this razor.  quick and easy to use.  wish i would have discovered it a long time ago.  haven&#x27;t used it in the shower, only dry use.</li>
            <li> This works very well,,,I just wish the pop up blade in front of head was not there,  not really necessary</li>
            <li> Not impressed, I purchased two of these, I got one for my daughter and  myself. Other reviews were very good. Sorry folks we disagree, it is heavy, bulky and it does not give a close shave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only thirty bucks and it shaves my legs in less than five minutes, close and smooth, completely dry. I can put on a skirt, think, &#x27;hmm, should probably shave&#x27; and do it and be out the door in less time than it usually takes me to find my car keys!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as close or as smooth a shave as wet shaving but with this thing the convenience  is  the key factor. It&#x27;s SO darned quick I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t get one of these in my teens, when I started needing to shave my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer said that this is excellent as a dry shaver OR a wet shaver but not very good if you try to shave damp skin (say, after a shower). That&#x27;s absolutely right. Pick either wet or dry and be impressed, but don&#x27;t try &#x27;damp&#x27; shaving, it doesn&#x27;t do as well.</li>
            <li> The way the shaver is designed to recharge, it sets on a base that plugs directly into the wall.  I never liked the design to begin with but after a little less than 2 years, the spring mechanism that holds it in the base is broken and so it will not charge unless I sit there and hold it in the base......not very practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is ok for what I used it for--touching up when not wanting to use a razor.  It doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor but it is faster so I use it for touch ups...you just don&#x27;t get the smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> Gives a close shave without nicks or scrapes as a dry razor.  My last razor, this same brand and model, needed a new charger and blades which cost more than a new razor.  Also, I love the space saving charger stand.</li>
            <li> Easy to use in shower or out. Very easy to maintain. Perfect for swimsuit trimming, comes with everything you need.</li>
            <li> I tried using this in the shower and got disappointed.  It&#x27;s better if you have to quickly dry shave.  I tried the bikini trim too but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for my lovely wife. Now she can shave her legs in comfort without the risk of a nasty cut. She loves it just as much as I love the no stubble on her legs.</li>
            <li> Good Price and Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> Daughter uses this on a daily basis. She loves it. Easy to have charged up and ready any time. Love the wet or dry technologies.</li>
            <li> Possibly works better for those with less coarse hair. I was disappointed given the price especially considering I got better results with cheaper devices.</li>
            <li> I just got this shaver last week and have used it on and off for touchups. I really don&#x27;t intend to use it as my main shaving tool but it&#x27;s handy. I&#x27;m a bit confused about the charger as it doesn&#x27;t indicate when it&#x27;s fully charged (it stays red) but it seems to hold a charge and so far so good. It works pretty good and gets pretty close. I also like that it pivots so it can get closer.</li>
            <li> Im glad I bought this one. I like it alot more than my old one.&lt;br /&gt;Just perfect! !!!! Thanks alot!</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for a year and the battery is longer keeping a good charge. I expect it will officially die any day now. But worse than that is that it never really gave me a good shave on my legs (and has been progressively worse recently). I wish I knew which kind of electric shaver I had right before this one because that was a much better shaver. I had dropped it and messed up the foils, but in retrospect, should have just replaced them and kept that one. This shaver didn&#x27;t cause nicks or any problems, just was never very good either.</li>
            <li> I used the product three times, once dry, once wet and then dry again. The first dry shave was satisfactory although not as close as the shave achieved with my previous electric razor. The wet shave results were even poorer. The next dry shave, the razor didn&#x27;t appear to be cutting any hair. I carefully cleaned and dried the razor after the previous uses. No parts seem to be worn or broken, yet it simply doesn&#x27;t cut hair any more.&lt;br /&gt;It is past the 30 days that I have to make a return to Amazon, and the cost of shipping it back to the manufacturer seems better spent buying regular razors until I can afford another electric razor. I would not try this brand again.</li>
            <li> Hurts!  Pulls hair.  I had a different electric shaver and it never pulled hair like this.  Avoid!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin but like a close shave so I decided to give this shaver a chance, worst choice ever! Trying to shave with this thing was a very painful experience instead of cutting the hair if feels like its ripping them out one at a time. It was horrible and a huge waste of money!! Ladies stay away from this thing!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Much better than my Remington</li>
            <li> It had been so long since I had an electric shaver, and I am glad I purchased this one.&lt;br /&gt;Holds charge a long time. I have gotten through 3 shaves without being charged for at least a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;Nice charger included.  Shaver is sturdy.  I like the options on shaver for closer shaves, cleaning up bikini lines, longer hair, etc...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x60;s nice to use in the winter months, when one might let herself &#x27;go&#x27; between shavings.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x60;s nice to touch up when one does not feel like taking the time in shower to shave.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x60;s a pretty close shave , in fact.&lt;br /&gt;I never have used the &#x27;wet&#x27; option. That option scares me ahaha&lt;br /&gt;I do not want anything to interfere with the already excellent performance of this shaver while using in dry mode.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot complain about the price. I had compared prices and reviews, and decided this would be the best for me.</li>
            <li> It is designed pretty sturdy. Definitely not a crappy shaver...just was disappointed with the guard on the top. Felt like you couldn&#x27;t get a close enough shave without taking the guard off completely. Shaves well but doesn&#x27;t get the curves of the sensitive areas, if you know what I mean. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> This works well, even when wet. It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as a blade does, but when I need an electric, this is my go to. When I ordered this, my big concern was that the charge would not last long enough. This charge does last me through both legs.</li>
            <li> I am using this only as a DRY Shaver and seems to work fine.  The docking station included to recharge is a bit unstable, but seems to do the job.  I try to only recharge it once a week for a few hours each time.  Hope this one lasts a little longer than the last several I have ordered.  None compares to the Remington Electric Shaver I used repeatedly from 1965 to about 1995!</li>
            <li> Love the shaver.  Of course it&#x27;s not as good as a blade shaver but it comes pretty close.  The battery life is excellent!</li>
            <li> great product, i wish it had a more closer shave but it&#x27;s still really good. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as advertised  wet or dry.  It was returned.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this shaver!  It is the closest electric shaver I have ever owned.  The close shave lasts  as long as razor shaving.  Some reviewer stated she found it noisy.  It is not noisy in my opinion.  I hope they continue to make this shaver forever, as I am sold.</li>
            <li> no pain ... i love it.. i use it on bikini area .. i feel nothing ... gets all the hair out</li>
            <li> I got this to replace the rotary razor I had been using for the last 7 years, which was starting to not hold a charge. So far I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor. It&#x27;s easy to use, charge, and clean. I usually dry shave my legs and am used to not having the closest shave, so the fact that I get a little sandpapery within a day doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the trimming comb, which doesn&#x27;t lift the hairs enough or trim them evenly (maybe the teeth are too short?), but it definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> Had pone just like this and that&#x27;s why I bought it again.  The raised bald is great for bikini area.</li>
            <li> LOVE this shaver!!!  So nice to be able to use it wet or dry!  Great for summer touch ups!  Very easy to use and clean after use.  Charge holds very good, too.</li>
            <li> I should have know it wouldn&#x27;t work very well. Never had an electric razor work worth a hoot and this one just followed suit.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT!&lt;br /&gt;The best on the market</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the same item which finally gave out.  It holds a good charge and does a good job.  I like that I can take it into the shower.</li>
            <li> Does not do close shaving</li>
            <li> Bought as a Christmas gift for my mother. She says it works just great.</li>
            <li> This shaver does not give a close shave like a razor, which I expected, but I have to go over my legs over and over and very slowly.  Beats cutting myself in the shower, however.</li>
            <li> Very good for electric but doesn&#x27;t match a blade.  You can&#x27;t see any hair you can feel it though.  Good product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me you might take the Amazon return policy for granted a bit and sometimes &amp;#34;take a chance.&amp;#34; Note that if this doesn&#x27;t work for you, you&#x27;re eating it&#x27;s cost - no returns.  I bought this and tried it ASAP (after charging) ... I found it abysmal. The shave is not at all close if you&#x27;re used to a regular razor (I&#x27;ve been using Venus line for years) and if you can believe it, I actually cut my ankle with this... how the heck... I have no idea.  If I were to shave every three days with a typical razor I&#x27;d never have hair longer than right after using this.  On top of all that, I also found it was more work/took more time. After this first use, it was clear I would not be satisfied with the product. Of course I then learned that returning it was only a happy fantasy.</li>
            <li> A GOOD RAZOR FOR THE PRICE  FAST SHIP</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. It falls apart real easily and doesn&#x27;t shave very closely. I do like all of the attachments.</li>
            <li> After reading the rave reviews for this shaver I decided to go ahead and buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having been using it for a month now I can officially say that I&#x27;m very disappointed with its performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few shaves were decent. Nowhere as good as a plain razor, but decent. Even after going over the same areas again and again there was some stubble left. Very time consuming but for me it was worth the result (I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use a regular razor). I followed the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations on how to keep it clean after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of weeks this razor just stopped working. No matter how many times I go over the hairs, in what direction, how much pressure I use - it&#x27;s barely getting any hairs off at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t return this one anymore, so I&#x27;ll just have to get rid of it and get a Norelco. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several lady&#x27;s electric razors but this one is the best.  I have used quite a few Remington shavers and they were awful.  They were almost worse then not shaving at all.  This Panasonic is worth the price.  Close, clean, comfortable shave. Charges quickly, easy to clean and comfortable to hold. If there is a better one out there I haven&#x27;t found it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my 10 year old. She was needing to shave. A great alternative to a razor. Very user friendly.</li>
            <li> Then this product is for you. This is my 3rd electric shaver. Like others I had Remingtons before and I want them back. I bought this for my \\&quot;bikini\\&quot; line. I typically go Brazilian style. Worse shaver I have ever had! First hold your skin taunt because this puppy bites and if it gets a ahold of you, there will be blood. A team of trained professionals can&#x27;t get the bleeding to stop and I put the sailors to shame! It takes forever. You have to almost scrap it along your skin, mind you hold your skin taunt, and go over the same area in many directions, many times. My old shaver took me 10 minutes max. I fuss with this one for ususally 20-30 minutes for the same results and a lot more redness. I hate this shaver. If I could return it, I would.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it is the best or the worst... I use it all the time and I get what I expect out of an electric razor. Of course it is no where near as close as a razor and you still have a slight stubble but if you are in a hurry and just dont want to look like a cave woman it works well!!! I DO NOT recommend this for the bikini line!!!! It ripped out the hair and not trimmed it!!!</li>
            <li> On the first day that I used this thing, I couldn&#x27;t get the pop up trimmer to stay in place - it finally broke.  No worries I thought, I don&#x27;t need it.  A few months later....oops....it fell in the shower but did continue to work.  Went to use it again recently and now it is DEAD!  I won&#x27;t buy this one again.  I didn&#x27;t like it since day one.  The one positive thing about it though, is that it did stay charged for a decent period of time.</li>
            <li> I recently needed to replace my electric razor. My old one was from another company and at first I tried to buy exactly the same thing. However, it didn&#x27;t work AT ALL! So I looked online at reviews - should have done that first- and decided to buy the Panasonic Close Curves. I can tell you it is really great and I wish I had bought one the first time before I wasted my money on another company&#x27;s electric razor. It is easy to use and works really well. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work for me at all. It barely shaves any hair. It is completely useless for the \\&quot;bikini\\&quot; area, whether using the attachment or not. With the attachment, it did not get rid of any hair AT ALL. It&#x27;s like just running a comb through your hair. For legs and underarms, it would randomly skip patches of hair. And like another reviewer said, whatever hair it does get, it then spits out back onto your skin. (This happened the very first time I used it, so it wasn&#x27;t because it hadn&#x27;t been cleaned). Even when pressing it down hard onto my skin, it still didn&#x27;t get the hair. I tried wet, dry, with shaving cream, without. Nothing worked. You should also know that the manual claims the battery will last for \\&quot;7 shaves, 3 minutes per shave\\&quot; so that&#x27;s 21 minutes. I would give it 0 stars if I could. Huge waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: It also kept tugging on the hair, which was painful.</li>
            <li> Used the shaver 2 or 3 times and found it better than expected - well worth the price. Best of all the others I have had.</li>
            <li> The most uncomfortable razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  Many posters have mentioned that this is &#x27;only&#x27; if your leg hair is longer than 1/4 inch.  Do you know how short that is?  I&#x27;m not a model, I don&#x27;t shave every day.  If I wanted the sensation of my hairs being yanked out, I&#x27;d have gone for an Epilady.  Don&#x27;t even THINK about using it under the arms.  I&#x27;ll go back to Lady Remington.</li>
            <li> Living in California during a very extreme drought, I have been neglecting to shave my legs as often as I would like to save water. I have an electric shaver, but it isn&#x27;t great at all. I set out in search of a product that worked great, and found this little beauty. I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a week and used this upon opening. I am amazed at how effective it is! The shave is not a &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; shave like a razor blade, but it gets the job done. I have dark thick hair on my legs and I can&#x27;t see anything at all!! This is a must if you want to quickly shave without water. The charger is cordless, you place the shaver on the brick you plug into the wall directly! This will be great for traveling and to minimize tangled cords! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a shaving alternative.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. I Replaced my monthly brazilians with this little tool and although it doesn&#x27;t get quite as smooth as the day after a brazilian, I&#x27;m impressed. No trouble so far.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a close shave without biting and requires only one pass to do so.  So much better than my older shaver.  The flexible head follows the contours easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the primary intention of the bikini area. It is larger than I had expected and doesn&#x27;t work for that area. So I figured that is okay I will use it for my legs. All it does is pull and tug. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works great for a dry close shave.  Almost as good as the husbands shaver.  I like the way the head moves when shaving.  I don&#x27;t care for the way that the charger is set up but that is a minor thing at this time.</li>
            <li> you have to go over and over and over to get any cutting of hairs, especially leg hairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;total waste of money, threw out packing, etc. or I would have returned it</li>
            <li> Not bad, actually. Really does very close shaving. But for me not the one that I wanted. I mean the legs and armpits are ok, but if you want a close shave in bikini area, forget about this shaver. It&#x27;s not for this for sure. But I would give 4 stars because the shaver is ok.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have ever had. Actually it&#x27;s the 2nd one I have owned, the 1st one lasted me 30 years so getting one without a cord was great.  I like that the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Although this doesn&#x27;t give me a closer shave than a manual razor, I love the fact that I can use it in the shower. It is easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> I have had my fair share of electric razors and this one is definitely one of the best!  I don&#x27;t find the Bikini attachment helpful, but other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I hate having to shave all the time so I figured being able to trim my legs would be better. I love this because I have extremely sensitive skin and this is great for that &amp;#34;next day stubble&amp;#34; It is a trimmer though so don&#x27;t expect it to keep your legs and other areas silky smooth. It is great for the winter when you don&#x27;t want to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> Must be good, I gave it as a Christmas gift and it has been used with no complaints.  It must be working as expected or I would know.</li>
            <li> I was sure to read the reviews before purchasing this shaver, and all reviews were in-line with what I was hoping for out of a shaver. This is the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent and wish I would have purchased something like this years ago. After hundreds of waxing sessions &amp; experiences, I hate the time and money spent, but it was worth it. Now, I never have to wax again and that makes my ROI so incredibly worth it. Each waxing session was $120 + tip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves so close to the skin, it feels like I had a fresh waxing. No cuts, nicks, or razor bumps at all &amp; I even shaved dry. It&#x27;s a powerful tool that does the job well.</li>
            <li> I have been using an electric shaver for years, I loved the first one I got. When it would no longer work, I have gone thru a lot of different brands and models of shaver and have never found one that work like the first one, until now, this is a great shaver. If you are looking for a shaver this is the best one out there.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a closer shave with this.  It was also a little louder than I expected.  It works, but misses spots and I have to go over them multiple times. Not really worth the money in my opinion. I&#x27;ll stick to a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. The razor does what I require of it, and at a price that didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had super sensitive skin. Anytime I would shave with a razor I would get ingrown hairs and dry rashes no matter how much I exfoliated or used lotion. With this electric razor I have NONE of those issues anymore! You really can use it wet or dry. (although I would personally recommend wet with gel, it glides better that way) And it really doesn&#x27;t need much maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do end up needing to shave more because the electric razors always leave a teeny-tiny amount of &amp;#34;peach fuzz,&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s what prevents the ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two pivoting heads are very nice for those bumps and folds all bodies have. I&#x27;ve never had it lose a charge on me and I&#x27;ve left it sitting by itself unused for weeks even though the instructions say it should be charged weekly. And the bikini attachment is very useful as it has three length adjustments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without a doubt my all time favorite electric razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was looking for something that could help with razor burn. It does not shave well at all, and I simply can not use it. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This razor started out with a bang but now it hardly cuts and I&#x27;ve been diligent with keeping it clean and charged. I haven&#x27;t used it more than 5 times and it just isn&#x27;t cutting it anymore. Literally. Back to waxing it is!</li>
            <li> There is one thing worse than having a shaver that barely charges up enough power to keep going through one session of shaving - and that&#x27;s having a shaver that snags and PULLS the hair from your body, along with a sliver of flesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, this shaver boasts both of these abilities, and so you can now have the worst of both worlds.  -_-</li>
            <li> Very pleased with it.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought this razor a few years back and I liked it enough to get&lt;br /&gt;another one.  The price is higher than what I spent 5 years ago, but I think Pansonic&lt;br /&gt;has made a  good razor and it was worth the few extra dollars.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are very sharp and the \\&quot;hug your leg\\&quot; feel makes sure you legs are shaved&lt;br /&gt;closely.  Very versatile as you can shave underarms and private area w/o worrying about&lt;br /&gt;razor burn or the razor pulling hairs.  I use it dry and I find that this razor works well.  Holds&lt;br /&gt;charges very well and always get 3-4 shaves before charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5-1-14:&lt;br /&gt;This razor should be consider as a torchure type weapon.  While it worked alright for the couple months&lt;br /&gt;after I purchased it, that isn&#x27;t the case now.  For the past 2 weeks, this razor is pulling out every hair&lt;br /&gt;it touches and if you use it under your arms, you are in for incredible pain.  The battery seems to be the&lt;br /&gt;problem as it won&#x27;t hold a charge for long.  This slows down the moving razor blades and well, you get long drawn&lt;br /&gt;out pain every time a hair comes in contact.  Pure torchure.  I can understand if the razor hasn&#x27;t been charged&lt;br /&gt;in a long time, but this happens every time I take the razor off the charger.  Has plenty of time to charge&lt;br /&gt;because it is on the charger for 8 hours.  It is now busted up in pieces and in a garbage dump site.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR AT ALL.  Unless I need it to torchure myself.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like it because I wasn&#x27;t used to a big electric razor. Now I love it! It leaves my skin so smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife so she would stop using my razor, she hated it still uses my Norelco.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good replacement for my remington - not real happy with this one.  It&#x27;s not really a smoothe shave - somewhat like plucking out hairs instead of a shaving.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a razor and I purchased this one to fill my need. I am pleased with the transaction. The price was right and everything went smoothly!</li>
            <li> My daughter enjoyed this purchase and said it was the best razor that she ever had.  It was nice to hear her happy about a gift that I bought her.</li>
            <li> First of all I have to say...if you CAN use a regular blade razor with shaving cream, soap, or what have you, DO IT!  An electric razor will *NEVER* shave as close as a regular blade razor (nope, no totally silky soft skin), nor will you shave as quickly, so stop looking at electric razors to save time...because you won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wouldn&#x27;t give to be able to use a blade razor.  Unfortunately, my skin is ultra-sensitive and every time I try to shave my legs with a blade razor they itch so much after about 30 minutes that only drawing blood will get me to stop scratching my legs (no matter what moisturizer I use), and I don&#x27;t even want to think about the ingrown hairs that develop after a couple of days.  I&#x27;ve tried everything for \\&quot;after-shave\\&quot; to help...from Tend Skin to exfoliation...and nothing works for me.  So, I&#x27;m stuck using electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s a better electric razor out there for women, I have not found it.  I&#x27;ve tried at least ten different ones and this is, by FAR, the best that I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve found in an electric, doesn&#x27;t pull at all unless I&#x27;m going WAY too fast, has never nicked me once, and really hugs my legs because of the pivoting head.  I&#x27;ve had my Panasonic razor for probably three years, and the rechargeable battery is still kicking.  I still get at least 30 minutes out of it on a charge.  It was at least 45 when I first got it!  OK, so I have to go over some spots twice to get all of the hair...oh well!  I can definitely live with that, and I&#x27;ve had the same problem with every other electric I&#x27;ve used.  To me, this is the best women&#x27;s electric shaver out there.</li>
            <li> Works great, no problems with it. Keeps a charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a nice shave&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use</li>
            <li> I purchased the product for my 93 year old mother and she reports that it is easy for her to use and keep charged up in her bathroom.</li>
            <li> bought it for my wife and she wasn&#x27;t happy with the performance of the product. Used it a couple of times then went back to her old razor.</li>
            <li> This razor is WONDERFUL and stands up to every expectation that I had!!  In 2010 I had open heart surgery to replace the aortic valve in my heart and since then I have been on blood thinners and not recommended to use regular razors.  I have searched and tried many different ones but they didn&#x27;t do what I wanted.  The last razor I had, the foil over the blades literally tore through and that is what led me to buying this razor.  I wanted one that matched my needs and this one sure did!!!  It gives a super close shave on my legs, underarms and bikini area.  I was skeptical at first until I was actually able to try it and I won&#x27;t buy any other one after having this one.  You can also order parts for it should it fail in an area like needing blades or foil head and other parts.  The razor I had before you couldn&#x27;t use it underarms or \\&quot;other\\&quot; area...only legs, and when the foil broke, there was no way to buy the replacement parts so I hunted and found this razor and I&#x27;m so very glad that I did.  It is worth every bit of the money paid for it!!  Funny thing is, this one is actually cheaper than the one I had before and this one does 10x better job than the one I had before!  Thank you Panasonic for this wonderful product and I hope this review helps others see what a wonderful product this is.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in July 2012 and at first it worked ok and I ended up throwing it away last week. It has poor quality and maybe I should have invested more money in a shaver or tried another brand. I won&#x27;t buy this again... I&#x27;ll try another brand and spend a bit more than the $30 I spent on it.</li>
            <li> Love this little shaver and the bikini attachment is an added bonus.  Works great and holds the charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once but so far i&#x27;m very pleased. I have pretty coarse hair and I was still able to get a really close shave. I hate getting ingrown hairs from razors so that&#x27;s what made me try this and I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be getting anymore with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor one year ago.  I used it properly, charged it when needed, then it died on me last week.  With the other reviews I trusted it would last longer than a year.  It worked okay, not as good as a dry razor I use (bikini area), but again I&#x27;m just disappointed that it died.  These things should give you more than a year!</li>
            <li> Wife has had this for several years and it works great.  Have never had to replace blades and it still charges up fine.  Would buy another just like it if hers ever dies.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST razor I have ever owned.  My old one died and I went Panasonic as the other company didn&#x27;t carry the one I was use to.  By far the BEST razor I have ever owned.  The price was great as I purchased a diderent brand and much high and didn&#x27;t even work at all.  It took me 30-40 minutes to shave and this Panasonic I can  do it in less than 10 minutes.  I would definately recommending this razor!!!</li>
            <li> I got this shaver to replace my older Remington, but returned it after only one use.  Compared to the Remington, it is very underpowered and does not give a close shave on my legs.  This isn&#x27;t my first time using an electric shaver, I switched over from blades two years ago, and the hair wasn&#x27;t even very long.  My legs still felt scratchy after many passes of the shaver. The pivoting head is not in any way useful, didn&#x27;t seem to make any positive difference.  Also, as one other reviewer noted, the plastic bits next to the foils are thin and scratched my legs with each pass.  The Remington has thicker plastic there and never scratched me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I liked about this shaver was how well it did on my underarms.  Because is isn&#x27;t as powerful as the Remington, it is gentler on more sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t catch.  However, I already have another smaller shaver for this and didn&#x27;t need a replacement, especially if it should be able to do my legs as well.</li>
            <li> fantastic shaver easy to use &amp; does an amazing job.  I believe this would be a wonderful purchase for anyone who is tired of razor blade cuts .  I&#x27;ll recommend this to all.  Very pleased with my purchase.  Thank You</li>
            <li> my wife love this.thanks</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a new electric razor and not having any success in stores (all they had were the kind that yanks the hair out).  Then I broke my foot and shaving with a blade was just too complicated and messy.  So I read a lot of reviews and selected the Panasonic ES2216PC.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It shaves as well as any 2 blade regular razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  Sure it takes a little longer but its not like I&#x27;m going anywhere.  I like it so well, that I&#x27;m going to get one for my mom.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this razor was magic!  Well, for about a week.  Then the thing would cut off randomly while I was using it, even when fully charged.  After a while it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  I was extremely upset because it was a Christmas gift from my parents and I thought I had broken it.  We returned it with full refund and bought another.  Same thing happened; returned it for a full refund and bought another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, the package had been discarded, so we couldn&#x27;t return it after it began the tantrum.  We took it apart and my dad found that the connectors were slipping, so he put them back.  Everything was absolutely perfect for several months! Then one day it cut out again, and came back just long enough for me to finish some armpit shearing.  Afterwards it never came back on.  My dad took it apart, and this time it was something else in addition to the connectors, and in trying to fix it a tiny, some 4 millimeter plastic piece snapped off.  Apparently it was an important piece that renders the entire razor absolutely useless if gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy another Panasonic.  I loved it when it worked, but it was so much of a hassle (buying three razors in a row with the same exact problem, sheesh!) that I&#x27;m going to try my luck somewhere else.</li>
            <li> This was the worst shaver that I have ever bought. I was very disappointed with the quality of this product as it worked poorly. Not a close shave. I do not recommend the purchase of this product. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The shaver runs smoothly and does not irritate my skin. It has a nice long reach and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> i bought this electric SHAVER IN BED BATH AND BEYOND AND AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS IT DID NOT WORK . WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO NOONE</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for over 15 years. My last one finally died and wouldn&#x27;t charge so I purchased this one. Plain and simple it rips out my hair no matter where I put it or how i use it. I&#x27;ve oiled it, cleaned it, it just won&#x27;t \\&quot;shave\\&quot;. Not a good trait for a \\&quot;shaver\\&quot;. I like the plug/charger that it sits on and will look for this for my next shaver.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I never thought I would let my remington go, but I have.  This panasonic shaves so close that I can go for about a week without shaving and it is conveinent to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a really long time time now. This is an excellent shaver and does a great job. I haven&#x27;t found any other shaver that can do as good. This shaver is as good as any disposable/venus type razors out there. This razor does get all the hair(s) and does a nice close smooth shave. This is a well made quality razor. I am very happy with my purchase of this razor and if anything ever happens to this 1; I would replace it with another 1.</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with this shaver, because it&#x27;s easily cleaned and it works really well. The convenient wall charger is nice to save counter space, and it allows her to have it charged and ready at all times, because my young daughter will use it sometimes also. We&#x27;ve had it for over four months and it&#x27;s still operating exactly as it should. I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about a month and use it weekly.  Performs well.  I use it on dry skin.  Does job just fine.  I wish that it had a carrying case.</li>
            <li> My wife says she loves how the shaver moves over her legs, very comfortable... loves it. Not as close as shave as a new razor though. Loves the convenience and comfort.</li>
            <li> The original idea to purchase came as one of my granddaughters was turning 12 and had expressed great interest in shaving her legs. I had a sharp memory of the many cuts during all my years of shaving. The granddaughter actually invited me into the bathroom to witness and offer ideas for he first shaving. It went well, so well, that I decided to buy one for myself. The shaver is great and I feel free of the dread of shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> just ok..gets the job done..but takes a little while..</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver to just have.  It works when you need it and for the money was a overall good buy.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended it.  I find it pulls hair when used wet or dry. I would not recommend it. (</li>
            <li> This is my first experience and I like it! (except that it is too loud to use if other people are here!)</li>
            <li> Would love for someone to make a women&#x27;s electric shaver that really does give that close, smooth, shave that we all want. This one comes close and I&#x27;ll be using it now and then.</li>
            <li> Can not match Gillette Venus series.</li>
            <li> Wife did not like this from the beginning. She had previously tried my Panasonic men&#x27;s shaver and loved it, so that&#x27;s why I decided to buy her an electric shaver. We ended up returning this model and she took over mine instead.</li>
            <li> would now hold a charge,,,,,, not sure if its the shaver or the electrical cord.&lt;br /&gt;really pissed,,, you cant even send it back......</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this but it was decent at best. I found myself re-shaving the same area with a throw away razor just to get smooth. I also dropped it in the shower and broke the piece that holds the head together making it unusable and also really difficult to replace. If I could I would reconsider purchasing this product. It&#x27;s bulky, loud and as mentioned, ineffective for what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> The trimmers don&#x27;t cut my hair; it takes several, deliberate passes to get everything, and in that process, it actually PULLS OUT some of the hairs. Even worse, the trimmers are on both sides, so if you&#x27;re not careful to keep the shaver totally flat against your skin, it will bite into your skin and draw blood. It doesn&#x27;t even give a decently close shave without pressing down, and even then, it&#x27;s inconsistent and stubbly. I&#x27;m very disappointed considering I bought this because it had such good reviews.</li>
            <li> Not as quick and efficient at cutting as my previous Lady Shave by Phillips but that one lasted so long that I&#x27;m sure they don&#x27;t make the same model anymore. The somewhat flexible head is a nice feature for going over knees and toes. The flip up side burn trimmer is a good feature for my husband.</li>
            <li> not a super close shave, but great for bringing on short trips so you dont have stubble</li>
            <li> Short and to the point...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opinion - It did an OK job of shaving my legs, it always left a bit of stubble but I wasn&#x27;t expecting the same results as an actual blade razor or more costly electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fact - It did not last. Numerous times it was finicky, the switch had to be turned on and off several times before it would start and then eventually, it stopped working altogether. No amount of charging or switching could revive it, it simply died. Time until death... less than 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As cheap as this was I probably would have spent the equivalent in razors so I&#x27;m not terribly bothered. However, I&#x27;m not impressed enough to pursue warranty. Will try again with another brand.</li>
            <li> Having owned several women&#x27;s rechargeable shavers - a couple which didn&#x27;t hold up or perform well, my wife has been highly satisfied with the PANASONIC ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver.  Included accessories and charging adapter make it easy and convenient.  A quality product, at a great price - Amazon once again beat the competition on value.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for a really close shave, it just didn&#x27;t work like I had hoped . Husband pointed it out right away.</li>
            <li> Got this because I&#x27;m pregnant and shaving areas I couldn&#x27;t see just became too difficult. I love it so much, I don&#x27;t know how I lived without one! If I missed an area, or forgot to shave my legs in a few days and want to wear a skirt or shorts, it takes 3 seconds to remedy instead of jumping in the shower. For bikini area, took a little while to get used to, felt like there was a little pulling. But after using it a few times, it&#x27;s fine now because I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The unit is quiet, easy to use and to clean. It is lightweight. Especially like the charger which requires no cords!!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t provide the closest of shaves and you really need a few days growth to have it work. I also don&#x27;t think you save any time using this shaver.  The bikini attachment is a waste...you&#x27;d be better off buying a mans beard and moustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have really loved this razor. It still does not shave as close as a manual razor, but it does very well.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> I admit I bought this based on price. Well you get what you pay for. It works; it&#x27;s easy to clean; it&#x27;s small and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space; however, the shave leaves something to be desired. I&#x27;ve had better shavers from Remmington.</li>
            <li> has a small head like most shavers so it takes a long time to do your legs.  it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair without going over the same area several times.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it can be used in both wet and dry shaving but it&#x27;s not suited well for course hair. For baby hair like on your arms and legs it works great but not for pubic hair like underarms and bikini lines.</li>
            <li> Great for younger ladies who just need to get up and leave for school. No fuss just click and go.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of great reviews and needed a new Razor forever so I really thought this one would be great. Unfortunately for me it let razor burn all up my legs the first time I used it (and the time after that). My mom used it and dint get the rash I did but she wasn&#x27;t happy with the shave-it&#x27;s not as close as I&#x27;d have liked, even from an electric razor. I have thick dark hair that it pulled and skipped over, my mother has fine light hair that it did better with but she wasn&#x27;t enthused. Maybe you just need to have finer hair for it to be of good use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was durable, and worked well in water, I liked how it charged with no wires, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other razor now. No more cuts and it&#x27;s a lot faster than with a traditional razor. I just wish it shaved a tiny bit closer... I do have to shave a day or so more often, but for the tradeoff (no razorburn) it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li> So far it is good. I love that I can just pop it onto the charger in the wall. No long cords. It works well for my purposes.</li>
            <li> The shaver does what it is suppose to do without tearing out hair or scratching your skin.  What more can you want from an electric shaver?</li>
            <li> I used to have a Remington (cord plug in) and loved it, had it for close to 10 years and the end of the plug got a short in it.  I tried to replace it with the same model but couldn&#x27;t find it, so I bought another Remington assuming it would be just as good.  It wasn&#x27;t.  The style of blades was completely different, it took twice as long to shave (if not more) and it wouldn&#x27;t do a good job at all.  So I decided to try this Panasonic.  Love it!  Though I don&#x27;t feel that it shaves as close as a non-electronic blade, I&#x27;m not complaining because I don&#x27;t like to mess with shaving cream, and I don&#x27;t think any electronic shavor will shave as close as a razor.  This shaver does a fantastic job; it&#x27;s a close shave with one time pass so you don&#x27;t have to keep shaving the same spot over and over again. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works well, but feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that the charge doesn&#x27;t last long! Otherwise amazing!</li>
            <li> If only there was a 0 star button.  Awful!  This thing has caused me so much stress, I&#x27;d rather poke needles in my eyes.  The ON button fell off about a month after I got it so I had to push the metal inner workings of it to turn it on from that point on.  It wouldn&#x27;t shave worth a lick.  Not even the fine hairs.  I had to practically smash this thing into my leg and become one with it just to get it to cut and it definitely didn&#x27;t get a close shave.  More often than not, I&#x27;d get outside and find all sorts of hair that was missed.  Don&#x27;t mind the fact I sat with this thing shaving for easily an hour and it takes pretty much 24 hours to fully charge.  This is absolute garbage.  I had much better luck with my husbands Norelco 3 head shaver.  Save your money.  Buy men&#x27;s.  Women&#x27;s shavers are all trash.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Cuts really close. Sometimes I dont feel like shaving my legs in the shower. So this is perfect. I would definately repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver before so I didn&#x27;t know exactly what to expect.  It doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave, which I don&#x27;t like.  I&#x27;d rather not shave every day if I don&#x27;t need to.  On the other hand, it is very easy to clean and is rechargeable, so for that it gets a positive spin.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this, if she is happy, I am happy.</li>
            <li> For someone with super sensitive skin, this shaver is a godsend! I can shave wet or dry without worrying about nasty razor burn. The only potential downside (for some) is that this doesn&#x27;t provide a very close shave. However, this is not a problem for me as I would rather shave more often than deal with irritated skin.</li>
            <li> The pop-up head for bikini does not pop-up. No where close to being a good shaver. The best I can say is, it looks good.</li>
            <li> The trimmer jammed after less than a year of use.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking the shave would be closer. I&#x27;m not impressed. I used it once, and it now sits in my drawer. Maybe one day I&#x27;ll try it again. My cheap disposables work better for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe after all these years I found an electric shaver that shaves as good as a blade! And I used it dry. I am olive complected and have fairly course hair but this shaver handled the job. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My last Panasonic shaver lasted more than 20 years and was awesome. This one is ok. Not such a close shave to the bikini line like I want.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me. Just doesn&#x27;t trim properly. Hardly gets any hair at all. I was really frustrated because I&#x27;d done a bunch of research before purchasing this one and it wasn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer switch is already broken. Just out of the packaging today. Not yet fully charged. I just pushed the switch up and that was that. I tested the shaver on one leg, to see if it was functional, and it was.</li>
            <li> EDITED: After using for several months I broke it by dropping it a few too many times and ran to Walgreens to pick up a replacement, they didn&#x27;t have this model so I got the ES 2207 P and it is WAY BETTER. Way closer shave with still hardly any irritation, the trimmer gets out way way more hair on my thighs and bikini line and never once snagged it painfully like the ES2216PC did. I&#x27;d still say the ES2216PC is a good razor, but I&#x27;m definitely super excited about my replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and so far it is working pretty well. I will say that it misses longer hairs, and with the long hair extension it can pull painfully in some areas. I think in the summer when I am shaving more frequently it may be more effective. I don&#x27;t even understand how the bikini trimmer attachment is supposed to work. I mean I am a fairly intelligent person who read all the directions and literally no hair comes out when I use it. I have never used an electric shaver before and I didn&#x27;t realize how time consuming it is to shave my legs with one. I shone the flashlight on my phone onto my legs and it illuminated all the hairs it had missed and I was able to get better coverage that way, but even so there are a few it just can&#x27;t get. Plus ain&#x27;t nobody got time to be that thorough on a normal day! All that said, I am a redhead with insanely sensitive skin and extremely thick hair prone to ingrown hairs and razor burn, and with using this I have had neither.  Before if I wanted to wear shorts without little red irritation spots I had to do a rain dance, pray, massage my legs with peacock feathers, and hope that my skin was having a happy day. I am STOKED to use this in the summer because though it does not give you as close of a shave as a normal razor it keeps your legs visibly smooth with zero irritation, which is all you need most of the time for wearing shorts and stuff. If I am wearing a bikini I would definitely use my regular razor to get a super close shave though. But overall this is making my skin SO much happier.hough. But overall this is making my skin SO much happier.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with electric shavers so when I decided to buy one to escape the irritating razor burn I was getting, I poured over all the lady shaver reviews. I came out more confused and unsure than when I went in. But I purchased this because it was the only one who had almost all the features I wanted. Rechargable battery, a bikini trim pop up blade, wet/dry, and a &amp;#34;grooming attachment&amp;#34;. The only thing it was missing was a cord in case the battery was dead, and I wanted to shave immediately. However, the shaver companies think we are too stupid to figure out you can&#x27;t bring a cord into the shower and. if we live through the electrocution, they&#x27;ll get sued, so no cord. I&#x27;ll reserve my thoughts on how many people WOULD actually do that and on the sad state of society, and get on with the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have found that the battery life is pretty good. Make sure you charge the shaver for a FULL 24 HOURS before first use. I think that&#x27;s important to get a full charge on the battery. I take my time shaving and so far I got four shaves and still didn&#x27;t need a recharge but I set it on the charger anyway. It has a small charger that plugs into to the wall outlet, with a post on top that fits in the bottom of the charger. The razor is upright, against the wall as it charges. See the picture attached to my review. You can get a regular sized plug in under the charger but anything bulkier probably isn&#x27;t going to work. Obviously if you were to put the charger in the bottom outlet, you&#x27;re going to cover the whole thing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as for the operation of the shaver. I would say I have medium thickness and density hair. I am not a bear, and I&#x27;m not baby fine. It takes a little longer than you&#x27;d think, with more passes, to use an electric shaver over a hand held manual razor. I takes about three passes to get all the hair. I use it dry so far, I have yet to use it wet. However, it has a pretty wide swath, you can go back and forth along your leg pretty fast, and you don&#x27;t have to pay that much attention, so it goes quickly. I did not get scraped up, I didn&#x27;t get any irritation, and I have VERY sensitive skin that reddens very easily. I am satisfied with the closeness and shaving action on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bikini trimmer. This pops up with a slide button on the razor. It is a bit on the dull side. Don&#x27;t be afraid to touch it on your skin pretty hard. If you hover all timid-like, your hair gets yanked, or your skin does. I didn&#x27;t bleed but it hurt. It doesn&#x27;t get all the hair in the area. It missed a lot. I found the bikini line shaver thing is not all that great, but I have another trimmer for that :) It does a good enough job for a quick touch up for this old, married chick. Other ladies with date nights, maybe not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All In all, I am happy enough with the purchase. I felt that. compared to the other same-priced razors. I made the right choice. I don&#x27;t love the razor, but I like it well enough that I will keep it until it dies and try another brand.ng your leg pretty fast, and you don&#x27;t have to pay that much attention, so it goes quickly.

            <li> I like the overall design, mostly the pivoting head, but I think the engine or system is not as powerful as it should be, to get the job done, I have to run it up or down several, several  times and it does not give a close shave, so i have to finish it with another device. I&#x27;ve had this one for 6 months, but not to long ago, I bought another one, the &amp;#34;Cleancut PS335 T-Shape Personal shaver&amp;#34; and I think that is more effective than the panasonic. Oh.. another thing that I didn&#x27;t like about the panasonic is that while I was shaving, I could feel how is pulling the hair out, so that&#x27;s not fun when you have sensitive skin and after that some irritation follows.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent ladies rechargeable shaver for the price. It works very well and has a long lasting charge. Very good item and deal.</li>
            <li> Have had one before but was needing new battery and head so for the price I just bought a new one. I have always used it dry, cause have had many shavers over the years and using it dry is just my style. The pivoting head is super and I also use &amp; like the bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li> this was an impluse purchase, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it! It holds a charge for a long time with regular use. the attachments are very useful, love that the head has some give and moves a bit. Got a trim as wanted and shave as needed. Surprised and very pleased, love it!</li>
            <li> Actually I can&#x27;t really rate this one yet. It is a Christmas gift for my daughter, so I&#x27;ll have to wait to see what she thinks about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife.  All I can say is that she likes it.  Good enough for me.</li>
            <li> excellent product, recommend, good quality.</li>
            <li> I have this trimmer and it just does not to the job well for the bikini area.  It trims in some areas and then in other areas, it leaves the hairs long.  The aesthetics of the trimmer is pretty, but don&#x27;t expect your bikini-lined hairs to be the same length because some will be long while others will be nearly gone.</li>
            <li> My wife seems to like it</li>
            <li> This is a perfect shaver for us girls for any part of the body! I use it all over and even in the shower!</li>
            <li> Bought this razor today from a store (didn&#x27;t want to wait for shipping) and am sooo pleased!! I primarily bought it for the bikini area (which I usually wax) and it&#x27;s great. I have darker skin and usually have problems with ingrown hairs and dark spots. This razor gave me a close smooth shave with no issues. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Nice modifications for feminine body.</li>
            <li> Really like this razor.  It is replacing another Panasonic that I got about 3 or 4 years ago.  Evidently the blades don&#x27;t stay sharp forever, but while they are new, they really work great!  Will get another one.</li>
            <li> Great razor, stays charged for a long time and is comfortable to use -- doesn&#x27;t pinch.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.  It performs better than any other women&#x27;s shaver I&#x27;ve tried before.  Much easier than standing on my head in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s broken already. I won&#x27;t order another.</li>
            <li> I had a old Panasonic electric and this one is so much better. I shaves much closer &amp; has less drag. I love this razor and wish I had purchased it years ago. Be sure to follow the charging directions and do not leave it charging while not in use or it will ruin the battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman who has suffered for years the discomfort of razor bumps (armpits) from shaving with traditional razors.  I have been using the Panasonic for about 2 months now and I have yet to experience one razor bump.  Don&#x27;t know why it took me this long to try electric razors but I decided to give it a try after using my boyfriend&#x27;s with great results.  I did a bit of consumer review searches online and was impressed with the Panasonic&#x27;s review and price.  If you&#x27;re inclined to razor bumps and bruises, I recommend electric razors in general and the Panasonic in particular.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product!  Be advised that it works 100 times better wet!  Don&#x27;t even bother with the dry route, or you won&#x27;t be happy.  Use it in the shower.  Wet your skin well and lather up with lots of soap.  Hold the shaver under the water for a few seconds.  Then when you use it, you&#x27;ll have great results!  Keep it well cleaned/rinsed &amp; charged.  Always use it wet with regular soap, and you&#x27;ll be very happy with it for many years!</li>
            <li> it is easy to use, light weight, however I do prefer the old fashioned &amp;#34;plug type shavers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Better than any other electric I have used. (The screen mesh of my last electric razor with screen mesh broke and created gashes in my leg that actually scarred! It was a different brand with only 2 heads.) I now make a practice of inspecting the mesh before every use (safety precaution).</li>
            <li> This did not work so I had to return it. It pulled a lot and did not cut close enough. It hurt and left too many hairs.</li>
            <li> The pivoting head can be annoying.  At times it feels like it is not doing a good job although it does shave well.  I had a previous panasonic and when I lost the rechargeable battery I decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to this model.</li>
            <li> This razor is great for a last minute shave. The only issue I have is, it is painful to use on your underarms.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, close shave on bikini area but would like closer on legs. Love using it in shower and bath.</li>
            <li> Since my back surgery I have not been able to use a real razor to shave my legs, as it is too painful to bend over in the shower. My mom has this electric razor and I used it a few weeks ago while I was visiting her. I sat on a chair on her deck, and put my legs up on another chair. Very easy to use and no back pain when I finished. This is hands down the BEST electric shaver! It does not run out of juice before you are finished shaving your legs, in fact it can be used several time before the charge is low. I love it and plan to order another one for my 16 year old daughter. You cannot go wrong purchasing this especially at this awesome price!</li>
            <li> This razor works great!  It gives a very close shave and you never have to replace any batteries.  You just keep it plugged in.</li>
            <li> Very useful, cut every thing. And work very well but i prefer use it dry than wet. I recomend it</li>
            <li> All items were received on time and as advertised.  Some were gifts but the ones used, by me, worked as expeted.</li>
            <li> Thank you, item is as described!</li>
            <li> I really really love this shaver.</li>
            <li> Just got off the phone with Panasonic.  First, the issues with these shavers are so common they give you the list of problems to choose from before you even speak to a person.  Second, in order to get a fix/replacement, they want me to pay to mail this thing back to them.  They refuse to help me otherwise.  For something like this, that&#x27;s ridiculous because it&#x27;s not worth the postage.  I might as well buy a new one and toss this thing in the trash, where it belongs.  Any company that forces you to spend more money (on a low cost item such as this) to send their crap back to them before they&#x27;ll fix/replace it isn&#x27;t standing by their product, isn&#x27;t providing good customer service and isn&#x27;t worth my time and money, nor yours.  I&#x27;d not even give them 1 star if that was an option.  Also...the automated system for Panasonic made me repeat the model number 4 times and gave me the run around worse than any human being ever could before it would put me through to a person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:Thanks to Amazon I&#x27;m not getting ripped off after all.  Thank you Amazon for taking care of this even though Panasonic wouldn&#x27;t. Appreciate all your help.</li>
            <li> The adapter stopped working within a year and Panasonic refused to stand by their two year warranty to replace it. They wanted $35 for a new adapter, the same price as this stupid thing new. Not worth the cost when it broke so easily and they refused to fix it.</li>
            <li> Worked well for two years then fell apart despite good care. The blade came off on one side and it could no longer be used safely.  We will not purchase another one and will stay away from this brand unless we get a constructive response from the manufacturer.  We intend to call the manufacturer and will give and update with their response.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while now and I just figured out how to get the best shave. I was going up and down my legs in long lines (like a straight razor but going down too) and it was doing a poor job, even shaving twice. Recently I figured out if you make short up and down strokes and go around and around the leg in a spiral, the shave is much closer and there are few missed hairs. Made a HUGE difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Very long lasting battery. I can shave three or four times with this before it gets low and it holds its power between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Difficult to charge if you have sideways outlets in your house. It rests vertically on top of a small square box that plugs directly into the wall. This won&#x27;t work in my bathroom as the outlets are horizontal so I have to charge elsewhere.</li>
            <li> it works perfect. U can use it anytime anywhere....</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove leg hair.  Would not buy again.  I just kept using it hoping that it would work better, but it never did.  Now I am outside of the return time.  Not the seller&#x27;s fault, just a bad product.</li>
            <li> Nice design, good quality, fairly quiet, fast and easy to use, but... it just doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as even the most basic disposable razor. It leaves a noticeable stubble. I mostly use it as a bikini trimmer and it&#x27;s great for that, but as a shaver it&#x27;s not ideal.</li>
            <li> GreaT Product especially if one is on a blood thinning product and can&#x27;t use a blade! Can be used in shower as well!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cost a lot, that&#x27;s true. But the plastic slider pieces are so poorly made that I can&#x27;t get them to move half of the time.  One of them is the on/off switch, and the other releases blades.  Not complaining about the shave, when it works it works as well as any electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and could not find in local stores. I have a slight tremor in my hands and am prone to cutting myself with a regular shaver. I would recommend this to anyone who has a safety issue when shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for years now and had quite a few. There are not that many good electric razors out there for women but this is one of them! It&#x27;s really quiet (for a ladies electric razor, my husbands norelco is virtually silent and this is not but is really quiet compared to my Remington), and it has a close shave and with the pivot head it contours all the angles on my legs. I&#x27;ve had a lot of Remington&#x27;s but have had some trouble with the last ones (battery not lasting, needing to replace the blades more often etc) so I decided to go with this Panasonic and I love it! The charging base is weird but not a problem. If you have a Remington and are looking for a better replacement this s it!</li>
            <li> First, as wet/dry shaver goes for us ladies, this one is pretty great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros for this product:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to handle, in or out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;- Keeps a charge for more than two uses.&lt;br /&gt;- Accessories are easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;- Its pretty quiet, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerns:&lt;br /&gt;- It is awkward to charge. You basically have to charge it upright but the unit itself is so heavy, it can easily fall out of the socket.&lt;br /&gt;- It takes a lot of patience to get a good close shave. Take it slow and you&#x27;ll be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great.  It does a very close shave and the battery lasts for at least 4 full leg shaves.  It is easy to clean and very versatile because you can use it in or out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I had one just like this for years but didnt have the swivel top.  It works ok, but, I felt the older model worked better</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this but my wife does. She tells me it pulls a bit and doesn&#x27;t really give her a close shave on her legs. I hoped for more at the time because my Panasonic shaver is extremely good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer give reviews right away because I have found that with time the products either change or my opinion does but I&#x27;ll try to catch up this year.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I want,  but it&#x27;s better than all the razor blade cuts.  Haven&#x27;t tried any other brand.</li>
            <li> Have used this shaver for quite a while now - cleans easy, holds a charge and shaves really well without pinching or causing redness.</li>
            <li> The reviews looked great but I wasn&#x27;t pleased and sent mine back (and I never return anything).  Maybe I got a defective one but mine would not hold a charge at all and was dirty inside.  I don&#x27;t know if it was graphite inside the blades or I was shipped a previously used one but sadly I cannot recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver a lot. It gives a nice close shave, as close as you can get without a razor. The battery life seems good. It&#x27;s easy to operate and to clean. The handy recharging device that plugs into the outlet is great. It allows you to keep the shaver easily within reach and ready to go. I would recommomend this product.</li>
            <li> ok for a quick shave. Does not get close at all. Product is fine if you want to take the excessive length off.</li>
            <li> Good basic razor.  the shave could be closer but that could be said of most all razors.  I would recommend</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the item is defective, I just think I prefer a razor.  I read a lot of reviews before I bought it and was impressed it seemed to give a close shave.  I do not find this at all.  After I get done using it, I have stubble and feel I need to shave again.  I have it stored away and went back to disposables.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington that did great but battery died less than a year. I have a lot of panasonic other stuff and very happy so tried this but it feels and hurts when it cuts. WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this razor dry (out of the shower).  It&#x27;s easy to clean and holds a charge well (over a week when only using it briefly each day).  I found this razor works well for shaving under-arms, but I do not like using it for my legs or bikini-zone.  On my under-arms I haven&#x27;t had any issues with nicks or razor-burn, and it works well.  On my legs and bikini-area, I can&#x27;t seem to get a close shave and I have gotten razor-burn and nicks, probably from pushing too hard from trying to get a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous electric razor was a wet/dry Remington that I really liked and used for 3+ years, but I bought this one to replace it since it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore and the blades were getting dull.  I think I may keep this Panasonic razor for my under-arms, but buy another Remington for everything else.</li>
            <li> Shaves fine.  Better dry. without razor burn.  Haven&#x27;t used an electric razor for many years. Decided to try was very pleased</li>
            <li> This was a very inexpensive razor but it did the job well....until I forget to put the Indian adapter on it and it died during my five months in Jaipur.  I will replace it when I get home.</li>
            <li> It does not shave well , it doesnt shave deep enough i have to use a razor after</li>
            <li> Over years, it&#x27;s been impossible finding a decent women&#x27;s shaver. I had been using my husband&#x27;s old brutal \\&quot;on its last legs\\&quot; shaver, but that machine chewed up my underarms on the lightest setting, even when pressing ever so slightly (almost not at all), to the degree that for 24 hours afterwards my underarms burned where it was agony to move my upper torso. So when that \\&quot;malevolent\\&quot; shaver died (good riddance), I tooled around Amazon looking for a replacement that had two characteristics: (1) designed for women; and (2) \\&quot;benevolent.\\&quot; I narrowed it down to this unit, and figured I&#x27;d try it. The price was reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me qualify: I have fair hair and fair skin. I do NOT need a shaver designed for someone with dark, thick hair. I need a light-duty shaver, one that does the job delicately on underarms and legs. I certainly don&#x27;t need anything resembling a depilatory/epilator--I am aghast that women knowingly seek out any such machine that pulls hair out by the roots, which is inhumane and torture. I am pleased with this Panasonic shaver not only because it works well, but because it is gentle. I call it a \\&quot;lovingkindness\\&quot; shaver--exactly what I was looking for. [Why did I wait so long?]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. I give it five (*****) and recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------&lt;br /&gt;3 March 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love it.</li>
            <li> Close shave and it is the quietest electric shaver I have ever had.  I highly recommend it and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Product is OK but not made as well as my old Panasonic model that this replaced. Unfortunately my old one died but lasted quite a long time and was made sturdy. This new model seems flimsy and not made as well, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a different brand of electric razors for years, but felt like changing things up. I don&#x27;t love this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;- Like the trimmer and guard. Actually useful unlike the Remington model.&lt;br /&gt;- Swivel head seems like a good feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as great:&lt;br /&gt;- Shave is not nearly as close as the other electric razors I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;- This razor seems to nick my skin more frequently for dry shaves (haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life is meh. Must be fully charged to do most of both legs (I&#x27;m average height, skinny).&lt;br /&gt;- Hate the style of the charger. Maybe I&#x27;m just used to having a long cord-style charger. It just sticks straight up off of the block. I only have one good power outlet in my bathroom, and this interferes with plugging in my blowdryer.&lt;br /&gt;- Although the trimmer works, I still use a separate, dedicated trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;- Why does it have to be pink?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this razor is decent. I won&#x27;t purchase another one if it breaks. Actually, after typing this all out I&#x27;m considering buying a different model.</li>
            <li> I had this shaver for about 4 months before it bit the dust. It was strictly for my use and I would use it twice a week. One day it just didn&#x27;t work anymore. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying this product out and I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about the purchase yet. the item did come in quick.</li>
            <li> i gave it a 5 star because it works great, beeter than others tried. the price was good . i always read other peoples reviews before buying and it has worked out great.</li>
            <li> Was just what I needed, do to illness can no longer use disposable razor on my skin so hubby bought me this and it is GREAT.Yes it works in the shower just like it said takes a great charge and charge last at least 2 shaves for me</li>
            <li> Great item! Very happy!</li>
            <li> It is good as a hedgetrimmer, but not the best tool for putting green manicuring.  The bulky size makes it tough to get in the tight spaces needed for the smooth shave.  Good for a quick leg touch up on the go but never going to be as close as a razor.  Also useful if it has been a while as a brushclearing tool before more delicate methods are required.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loved it.. point blank, came on time, looks good, and i need six more words so&lt;br /&gt;thanks alot</li>
            <li> It seemed to work ok the first time out of the package. I have very light hair on my legs and not coarse. I thought an electric would be fine, because I have severe arthritis and can not bend over in the shower to use a razor.&lt;br /&gt;After the first shave the blades were already dull. I continued to use it , but now I can&#x27;t use it all, totally won&#x27;t cut.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe 5 shaves in all.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I received the shaver.  It turned out to be a type that I had always wanted but I didn&#x27;t know they made for women or haven&#x27;t made until recently.  It&#x27;s awesome and works swiftly and easily and hair doesn&#x27;t grow back very fast at all.  It has double heads and some springs or something that helps follow your curves and shave really close.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the small size of the recharger and that a box or bag did not come with it to store the shaver and the brush, trimmer attachment to leave longer hair and the charger.  And you have to make sure the cap is always on the shaver when you aren&#x27;t using it because it has foil shaver heads like a mans shaver.  The directions say it&#x27;s very delicate.</li>
            <li> About 90% of what I purchase is done online. I always try to see the positives in the products I purchase to give the best reviews possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this product flat out sucks!&lt;br /&gt;Not much else needs to be said. Based on the reviews and the positive track record I&#x27;ve had with Panasonic products, I went for it. If you&#x27;re looking for a razor, buy a cheap $7 disposable and be done with it. I even went as far as shaving one leg with the disposable razor and the other with this razor. I ended up needing to use the disposable to take over for this razor. Save your money. It&#x27;s not worth it!</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was hoping for. It does work alright but I am looking for a different one. I purchased this one going off the reviews and as always, nothing is ever the same for everyone, so I am on the search for a different one,</li>
            <li> I would recomend this shaver because it really seems to get close to the body.  It is great for underarms, it seems to move around curves easily.  It holds a charge well which is important.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife who is very picky about her razor (pretty bold on my part).  She claims is an excellent razor, with only one change she could recommend - a cord rather than a receptacle for charging.  She would prefer to have it charge on the counter top rather than attached to a wall socket.</li>
            <li> My wife is on her third one of these shavers (the others simply wore out). She loves them, try one!</li>
            <li> Love this razor. I like the size and the fact that you can use it in wet or dry places. I have used it in both in and out the shower and it works fine in places. It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do and I would recommend.</li>
            <li> After 6 months of use, one of the blades messed up causing the outer foil to tear.  imagine my surprise of calling panasonic and being told the blades  on this razor are considered accessories and not covered by  warranty.  is that  not what a razor is - blades?  never buy panasonic again.</li>
            <li> The shaving is nothing close to the skin and I had to shave almost every other day. My skin didn&#x27;t feel smooth after shaving comparing with the regular razor shaving. Not being enough, I got two big pimples in one of my legs that required antibiotic treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I called Panasonic to try to return the product and the customer service was just horrible!&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> is very usefull and very higienic... panasonic is a great tread mark... was arrive very quickly... i only say is that i love it</li>
            <li> Title says it all.  Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb whose teeth were black as night (filler).</li>
            <li> I love using this one in the shower. My first one lasted about 4 hours. This one was a replacement.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok. the first one i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I like it, however, I have to constantly charge it.</li>
            <li> One of the best electric razors I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This razor does not give a close shave. It&#x27;s no good for bikini areas.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t do a lose shave like described. over priced for the performance of the product. still felt stubble after about 20 minutes of trying to get a smooth shave on my legs.</li>
            <li> This razor shaves pretty close leaving very little stubble. It is convenient as you do not have to use in the shower!</li>
            <li> I have been sick and my back is not letting me bend in the shower.  This is just perfect for me to use in bed.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, the trimmer is almost pointless. I still have to use my husbands trimmers because they work better</li>
            <li> great product  great price and fast delivery. would recommend this product. the first electric shaver that i have ever purchased that really did a good job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. The trimmer doesn&#x27;t do a good job at all. I can trim better with a pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> I think there is an expiration date this product, it broke after one year of use. So now I am looking for something better.</li>
            <li> I previously had the less expensive model from Panasonic and it works a lot better. When this does shave, it doesn&#x27;t get very close and it doesn&#x27;t work very well in the shower. I am pretty sure I&#x27;m going back to the shaver that&#x27;s half the price and works twice as well!</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; great price.  Was going to fix my old one, but it was more expensive than buying a new one.  Sad to say.</li>
            <li> Have used one of these for several years and love it.  Bought another one as a back-up in case my current one stops working or they discontinue making them.  Usually turns out that when I find something I like they decide to discontinue making it so have learned to stock up on some items.  Have only used this dry and not in the shower, so cannot speak to how well it works when wet.  To prolong it&#x27;s life make sure you clean the hair out after each use.</li>
            <li> Never have used and electric shaver before. Its easy to use,  shaves close enough, and stays charged as stated.Have used it wet and dry</li>
            <li> Great love it,works really well. I had ordered this from a catalog which cost a lot more.It was backed ordered i canceled it, I  found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> Wife likes it and uses it all of the time.</li>
            <li> Lots of reviews say bad things about this item&#x27;s battery... and maybe it&#x27;s chance whether or not you get a unit with a poor battery. Unfortunately, I got unlucky--after about 6 months the shaver would barely hold a charge for a few hours (and yes, I generally take good care of my electronics, not leaving them plugged in all the time, and only charging them fully--overnight or for several hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s pretty useless at this point. As a shaver, it works OK, within the limits of how electric shavers tend to. It doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as a normal razor, but also doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin as much; it works all right dry but better wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Panasonic and they offered to repair or replace my shaver, but I&#x27;d have to cover shipping. Given the dubious product quality I&#x27;d already experienced, I didn&#x27;t spring for their offer (throw more money down the drain?), and they wouldn&#x27;t do anything else for me. So poor marks for customer service, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know of any shining examples of other shavers that work well and offer good customer service in this price range... but I&#x27;d recommend looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as advertised. and is not easy to store when not in use.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> This razor received a high rating on consumer reports but I found it to be very ineffective.  Really, it is like a battery operated toy razor!  I had to keep going over and over the hairs on my legs, trying to get them off.  Very frustrating!!  Even after doing this many times, it did not give a close shave.  I finally had to return it.</li>
            <li> After my old electric shaver gave out, I looked around for a new one for a month or so.  After picking this one, I can say that my old one was much better. This one does not seem to cut as well and the &amp;#34;wet option&amp;#34; is not really option. Plus for the money I was expecting much better.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other razors and this is by far the best one! Specifically for a bikini line. I have recommending it to others.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t last very long... Kinda cheap.</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job. Nothing spectacular, just an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers exclusively for more than 15 yrs. Many of my shavers have lasted 3-4 yrs and usually the battery is what fails.  This shaver worked well for about 2 months, within 5-6 months, even with regular manufacturer suggested cleaning techniques, it would no longer shave any length of stubble.  The battery was still working though...?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my third one! I love the charger that just plugs into the outlet.  Very convenient.  Does a great job either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Does not work well at all.  I cannot even tell I have shaved my legs with this razor.</li>
            <li> Bought for daughter as present.  She had never used a electric shaver before an is very pleased with this product.  Shave as good in shower as dry...maybe better.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i was having trouble shaving my pussy, and i thought an electric razor would help.&lt;br /&gt;WELL I WAS WRONG!!!&lt;br /&gt;it took forever to shave i would go over the same spot over and over and it would not shave the hair.&lt;br /&gt;i thought it was supposed to be safe, but NOOOOO i cut myself all over&lt;br /&gt;I AM VERY ANGRY!&lt;br /&gt;i kept it for a while sitting in my bathroom. i was going to sell it but i wouldnt want to ruin someone else&#x27;s pussy!&lt;br /&gt;it sat there for a while. every time i looked at it i felt bad about myself. until one day i finally threw it away!&lt;br /&gt;good ridance!</li>
            <li> This electric razor is a replacement for my wife&#x27;s use. Based upon my Panasonic electric razor shaving experience, I convinced her to try a Panasonic when her electric razor failed. After several months&#x27; use she is a Panasonic convert because of the smoothness, rash free long running time time!</li>
            <li> I purchased this recently to use as a bikini/pubic trimmer. I tried it both wet and dry and also used on my legs. Although it didn&#x27;t pull my hair or leave razor burn, it did leave behind stubble. I couldn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as I would have liked. If you are more concerned with just trimming your hair to a short stubble - then this works great and I love that you can wash it to clean it. But, if you are looking for a smooth bikini shave, this product does not deliver.</li>
            <li> Purchased two..one for me and one for my daughter.  I never knew something like this existed.  It is amazing...works in the shower or bath.  Love my daughter for introducing it to me.  Price was reasonable, and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I like the shaver. It does not do as good a job as a razor but works just fine. Is easy to clean and holds the charge for quite some time. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> great product easy to use very functional&lt;br /&gt;and does the job from day one on&lt;br /&gt;tried others that did not</li>
            <li> It is not really all that sharp feel like my old electric razor. I would not buy another one like this</li>
            <li> This was recommended from a Pinterest post.  Avoid.  Avoid.  Avoid.  Read other reviews.  Doesn&#x27;t actually &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34;.  Isn&#x27;t that what a shaver should do?</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  I had a Remington in between and was not satisfied with the results.  I when back to the Panasonic and am very satisfied</li>
            <li> Not so impressive. Tried few times not shaving clear so back to old way again</li>
            <li> I like the product for a quick shave of my legs. I find that it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a regular razor.</li>
            <li> This razor does a great job. I use it when I&#x27;m on the run for quick touch ups. I also use it for underarm hair because it&#x27;s much gentler on my skin than a traditional razor.  I follow another reviewer&#x27;s advice and only use it if my skin is completely dry or completely wet (ie the shower).&lt;br /&gt;Only down side is the trimmer guard that comes with it. It is too large for bikini area trimming. Other than the head, I don&#x27;t know where on a woman&#x27;s body the hair is long enough for the guard to be useful....&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gentle and easy to use. I started my tween shaving with this first to ease into the whole process. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have ever had. Holds the charge for a long time. Does a great job of shaving.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver!!! highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used an electric razor for many years, and have struggled to find a decent one. Bummed again. I wrote down the date I got this one - July 2014 - and after 5 months, it will barely hold a charge to complete shaving both legs. It never stayed charged as instructed - one use drained much of the battery, and it lives in the charging stand. I will contact Panasonic, but I&#x27;m probably stuck with it. This is probably my fourth women&#x27;s razor in the past four years. Guess I&#x27;ll take other&#x27;s advice and buy a men&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Defective after using it 5-6 times: blade hurts, depainting...</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really comment on this right now as this is a Christmas gift for my 90 year old mother</li>
            <li> Have had this for two years. Usually used a few times per week on my lady areas. Charge lasted good at first but stopped holding a charge after a year or so. Liked that it has pop up trimmer that works pretty well. Gets you relatively smooth. Recently purchased men&#x27;s Remington F5-5800 for 29.99 on amazon. I like it sooo much better that I ever liked this one. Gets me smoother and has charge indicator and can also be used while plugged in.</li>
            <li> Works cleanly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter when she was 10 and ready to start shaving.  It is the perfect razor for her and her sister.  I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I have terrible scarring on my legs resulting from cuts and ingrown hairs from shaving with all different sorts of razors for the past four years. The inside of my calves look as if they got attacked by mosquitos and the bites never healed. No matter which direction or how carefully I shaved, I would get ugly ingrown hair scars. I have avoided wearing shorts or skirts in orderto avoid the inevitible stares I would get. I lost a lot of self esteem. I just used my new razor out of the shower and it worked so well! Not one cut or anything. I want to cry I&#x27;m so happy! This could be the end to my leg scars!!</li>
            <li> Its my first time using an electric shaver. I got a lot of positive comments about this product and so far it works great on my body. I like it that I can use it right after shower. The only thing is it just makes my hair grow easily and faster than normal..</li>
            <li> Really good for an electric razor! Of course it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor, but when your in a pinch and don&#x27;t have time to shave, this does the trick.</li>
            <li> I initially liked it better than I do now. It does a good job, but doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> it stopped working within 2 months</li>
            <li> Rated number one in consumer reports for a wet/dry shaver of this price. It does a great job. Worth the investment. I bought one for my 29 year old daughter, too. When she came to visit from out of town she forgot her electric razor so I let her borrow mine. She loved it.</li>
            <li> I would say it is just ok.  I like a smooth shave and it works ok in some areas but I wanted it for my bikini area.  It does not work that well there.  For trimming and leaving hair it is good.  I&#x27;m keeping it and as far as electric shavers go I guess it is on par.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver! Every woman needs a reliable good shaver and this one fits the bill. Very close shave for an electric razer &amp; great battery life.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  This is the 3 one of this brand and model over the last 20 years.</li>
            <li> MY wife likes this shaver very much</li>
            <li> A huge disappointment and waste of money!</li>
            <li> This shave seems to perform very well, as advertised. I like the pink color, too. Easy to recharge as needed.</li>
            <li> Thought my mom&#x27;s electric Remington razor that you have to plug in was outdated so I decided to get the Panasonic.  Not only does it not provide the same close shave that a disposable razor would give, but I find myself having to shave the same area multiple times in order for it to actually remove the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed.  There must be better products out there.</li>
            <li> I have back problems that make it difficult for me to use a regular razor in the shower. I wanted to try an electric razor I could use while comfortably seated.  This shaver has exceeded all my expectations!  It doesn&#x27;t pull the skin and gave me a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> No problems or issues. Good buy and reasonable shipping time. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> We bought this to replace my Wife&#x27;s old Shaver (same model - lasted 11 years).Hopefully, this will last as long.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy any female electric razors, they don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> My wife bought hers three years ago and it is still going strong and she says it does a nice job. Not like ablade but acceptable.  So in this throw away world I guess that rates at least 4 stars</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted and it&#x27;s a very good deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Works wonderful for a smooth shave!!</li>
            <li> I am African American and have coarse hair. It did not work for me. It only partially worked on my arms.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  I use it for dry shaving and it does a great job.  The only drawback is that the stubble falls out of the razor to the floor and you have to clean it up -- I wish it would all go into a chamber you could then empty instead.  Other than that it works great.  I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for over 6 months and it&#x27;s still working like it did when I first got it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Amazon and it was defective. I called Panasonic to fix the issue and it has been over a month and I have not heard anything from them. I called them and they gave me the run around. I wish I had just returned it to Amazon instead. Don&#x27;t deal with Panasonic customer service  - they are terrible!!!</li>
            <li> I had a Remington for a year and it stopped cutting the hair, all together.  So, I tried this one because there have been so many sold and it was worth it!  I love it! Hopefully I will still love it a year from now!  Its just about as close to razor shave as you&#x27;re gonna get and it doesn&#x27;t knick me.</li>
            <li> Love it, this is exactly what I wanted. It gives a close shave  next to a razor ..you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would allow me to use it on regular basis with no irritation afterwards and I found it!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it for women with thick hair/ for those who have problem with ingrown hair. It&#x27;s worth the money!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love my Panasonic shaver.  My other shavers were electric so I had to be close to an outlet in order to use.  This one has a re-chargeable battery so it can be used anywhere.  The charge also last a long time.  I have not used it in the shower so I can not commit about how it performs wet.</li>
            <li> I like that its cordless.  Does a good job.  Haven&#x27;t tried wet shave yet, but dry shave works fine for me.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t bought a new shaver in quite some time and am very pleased with this product. I bought it last year and it has performed well throughout.  Great value for the cost.</li>
            <li> Love the shaver.  Not sure what the bikini attachment is useful for since it barely works and always jams with the slighted amount of hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this razor! For years I&#x27;ve been doing the old fashioned razor and shaving cream routine in the shower. The day my panasonic razor came in the mail, that all changed. There are so many positive points of this product.&lt;br /&gt;1. The amount of time I save from not having to do the old routine is amazing.  (Because it is quick to use and can be used dry).&lt;br /&gt;2. The amount of energy I&#x27;ve saved (water energy from not having to be in the shower, and my own energy by not having to lather up).&lt;br /&gt;3. It has eliminated the unsightly and painful razor bumps I used to get all over my legs, and leaves my skin so smooth. (My boyfriend loves my smooth legs, and I can let him touch them now without recoiling away in pain).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this every single day since I&#x27;ve received it, and it has not disappointed me yet!</li>
