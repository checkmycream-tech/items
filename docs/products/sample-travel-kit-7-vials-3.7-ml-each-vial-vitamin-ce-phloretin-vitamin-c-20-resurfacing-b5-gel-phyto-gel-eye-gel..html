            <li>The product is good and was delivered quick!</li>
            <li>but right now, I&#x27;m loving these three!  </li>
            <li>My skin was noticeable softer and more moisturized after these treatments.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I have purchased the bigger products, just this is perfect for on the go.</li>
            <li>My skin is glowing and it looks healthy once again!&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>I bought skinceuticals years ago and love that line.  </li>

            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>and we both love them.  </li>
            <li>I really love how they work for me.  </li>
            <li>My favorite serums are Vitamin C&amp;E serum, Resurfacing serum, and Phyto + Botanical Gel for Hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They all worked and felt ok, but no fireworks.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you have a variety</li>
            <li>I was able to figure out what worked and what didn&#x27;t work on my skin</li>
            <li>Very fun!</li>
            <li>So, if you are seeking to find a product that does just what it says, helps diminish fine lines (remember I have only been using this for a week)gives a glow that stays all day, skin feels absolutely wonderful and amazes you every time you look in the mirror,</li>
            <li>I am a very convinced, loyal, happy customer</li>
            <li>the best news, is that they are extremely affordable.</li>
            <li>All texture fine.</li>
            <li>It helped me tremendously on how to use each product!</li>
            <li>the clarity of my skin is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I had such a great experience with the way my skin</li>
            <li>The seven sample vials are a great way to try all 7 and choosing my favorites before investing in a larger quantity.</li>
            <li>These products work fast and I have noticed an amazing difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the compliments I&#x27;m receiving on my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li>My skin is so hydrated and smooth, and today, when I put on my makeup, I smiled at how much difference one week of use has made.  </li>
            <li>The Extra Firming Eye Serum is Amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this lil sample kit, great way to try a lot of different products without spending too much money.  </li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy this product as much as I do:)</li>
            <li>Price point is important because as much as I love taking care of my skin, I have to live within a budget.  </li>
            <li>me who travel constantly what better way to be able to use this kit&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and smooth since using it and look forward more improvements with continued used.</li>
            <li>They absorb into the skin quickly and is not greasy whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>Allows customers to try the products and probably love them and want more but also reduces the financial loss of the large size returns.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve tried the Hydra B5 Gel, the Phloretin CF serum, and the Firming Eye Gel and love all three.  </li>
            <li>CSS was also kind enough to send printed out information regarding each product they included in the sample.</li>
            <li>so concentrated that you can tell right away</li>
            <li>I began to see results right away from using Cosmetic Skin Solutions serums.  </li>
            <li>They sent me samples right away.  </li>
            <li>The CE Feurlic and Phyto+ smell like pure alcohol!</li>
            <li>Eye serum, vitamin C,I will buy in future big bottle ( I have a lots of great products now and wait until I finished).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy they had the sample set, it definitely has me motivated to purchase the entire regimen from them vs. skinceuticals</li>
            <li>Also what I deeply appreciated was that they also included two samples (day cream and retinol creme) at their own will without extra cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was particularly interested in the vitamin C serum</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve consistently used almost all of this line ever since.  </li>
            <li>I noticed difference in first week.  </li>
            <li>This is a product that I will alternate with the original to save money--although I think nothing can really replace the C&amp;E Ferulic in the original brand.</li>
            <li>What a smart move to offer this.  </li>
            <li>I really like the effect these have.</li>
            <li>They are very soothing and takes the redness away.</li>
            <li>I am a very picky with my cosmetic.</li>
            <li>Very convenient for travel.</li>
            <li>They cleared my skin and made it so much smoother and even-toned.  </li>
            <li>and then I purchase the larger product available.</li>
            <li>I bought the &amp;#34;one of each serum&amp;#34; package and was able to test specific serums to see if I am sensitive to any.</li>
            <li>So many products have caused a rash and/or acne breakouts, so I&#x27;m careful in trying new products that address my skin</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t buy the full size of any of them personally.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying the full size products.</li>
            <li>In my pursuit to find a good vitamin C serum that was made fresh and not too expensive, I was lucky enough to come across the CSS site.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s been a noticeable brightening and hydrating feeling of my skin over the last week and lately it looks great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving Cosmetic Skin Solutions so far after one and a half week of use!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>So nice to be able to find all that I need for my skin at one company instead of the time consuming, expensive process of buying from several brands.  </li>
            <li>It was fun to try all the different things</li>
            <li>All of the serums are represented approximate to results - its good stuff.</li>
            <li>Think I have found my new skin care range.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend these three products and, if they are any indication of the quality of the other samples in the set, it would seem that the other products will be just as good.</li>
            <li>Paid the highest prices you could imagine, only to be so very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use no harsh chemicals at all.</li>
            <li>I have combination and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The samples come with a brief description of the contents of each vial which I find very helpful.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>This product line is no where near the quality.</li>
            <li>No breakout for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I am on the second samples and I just love how it makes my skin feel and my wrinkles are less apparent.</li>
            <li>I have purchased a few of the full size serums after trying the samples.  </li>
            <li>I am a loyal Skin Ceutical Customer and purchased this product to take the small vials on vacation......</li>
            <li>I am very chemically sensitive and do not have any trouble with these products.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients in this product were similar and the packaging was the same as far as how to use.  </li>

            <li> It was fun to try all the different things</li>
            <li> All of the serums are represented approximate to results - its good stuff.</li>
            <li> Think I have found my new skin care range.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend these three products and, if they are any indication of the quality of the other samples in the set, it would seem that the other products will be just as good.</li>
            <li> Paid the highest prices you could imagine, only to be so very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use no harsh chemicals at all.</li>
            <li> I have combination and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The samples come with a brief description of the contents of each vial which I find very helpful.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> This product line is no where near the quality.</li>
            <li> No breakout for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I am on the second samples and I just love how it makes my skin feel and my wrinkles are less apparent.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few of the full size serums after trying the samples.  </li>
            <li> I am a loyal Skin Ceutical Customer and purchased this product to take the small vials on vacation......</li>
            <li> I am very chemically sensitive and do not have any trouble with these products.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product were similar and the packaging was the same as far as how to use.  </li>
            <li> The quality is very similar, and the results are as expected.</li>
            <li> After using Skin Ceuticals for many years I wanted to try a less expensive alternative.  </li>
            <li> and these samples go a long way!</li>
            <li> I have searched for products like these for a very long time to no avail.</li>
            <li> The tiny vials go a long way, just a few drops are all you need.</li>
            <li> No complaints here except the odd but minor issue of some tiny dark particles in the bottom of the Hydra B5 Gel vial.  </li>
            <li> I just wish they were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s been very difficult to find products that address all my needs including discoloration from sun damage as well as fine lines.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this brand.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> decided to try 2 of these kits to try their other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the other samples</li>
            <li> There is a lot of known eye serum out there for a less of cost.</li>
            <li> Use as a little drops</li>
            <li> This sampler contains a resurfacing serum which I started with and for about a week, the dead skin was being sloughed off.  </li>
            <li> no better hydrating ingredient for the skin) .</li>
            <li> Not sure what those may be, but they don&#x27;t seem to affect the performance of the product at all.  </li>
            <li> I have also received a lot of  compliments lately.  </li>
            <li> Skinceuticals seems to be the same thing but very expensive.</li>
            <li> leaving anything behind because of all the travel restrictions!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so thankful to my friend for sharing this beauty secret.  </li>
            <li> I desperately looked for something less expensive than the Skinceuticals that i was intending to purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because the brand seemed to be a knockoff of skinceuticals (they are expensive!).</li>
            <li> Smells terrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had these forever! I feel like the firming eye gel worked the best but it&#x27;s one of those things you&#x27;ll have to keep using it if you want to keep the results. A nice way to try an array of products.</li>
            <li> I really like the effect these have. My skin was noticeable softer and more moisturized after these treatments. I use them after micro-needling and they are soothing as well.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week now, but let me tell you I will now until forever!!! I hope it never is discontinued! I have searched for products like these for a very long time to no avail. Paid the highest prices you could imagine, only to be so very dissappointed. Well, if you were or still are like me, \\&quot;Search No More!!\\&quot; I am in awe by this product! Great job Cosmetic Skin Solutions!!!:) They have got it perfect and the best news, is that they are extremely affordable. Skinceuticals seems to be the same thing but very expensive. So, if you are seeking to find a product that does just what it says, helps diminish fine lines (remember I have only been using this for a week)gives a glow that stays all day, skin feels absolutely wonderful and amazes you every time you look in the mirror, well for me this is it!!! I have purchased the bigger products, just this is perfect for on the go. Hope you enjoy this product as much as I do:)</li>
            <li> I use these after the derma roller treatment. They are wonderful. They are very soothing and takes the redness away. A must if you use the derma roller!</li>
            <li> Thank you for making quality products in Travel Sizes.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it give one a chance to try all the products but for someone&lt;br /&gt;like me who travel constantly what better way to be able to use this kit&lt;br /&gt;without leaving anything behind because of all the travel restrictions!&lt;br /&gt; I have tried each of the sample sizes and the quality of the products&lt;br /&gt;are impressive with no harmful chemicals and no parabens!!! All the gels&lt;br /&gt;have  an  incredible rich consistency that you can tell  the product&lt;br /&gt;is not diluted and carries a great deal of hyaluronic acid  (to me there&lt;br /&gt;is no better hydrating ingredient for the skin) . Also all the serums&lt;br /&gt;are so concentrated that you can tell right away how effective they&lt;br /&gt;really are. My skin is glowing and it looks healthy once again!&lt;br /&gt;Once again thank you for making such quality products, it definitely shows&lt;br /&gt;on the skin!</li>
            <li> After using Skin Ceuticals for many years I wanted to try a less expensive alternative.  The ingredients in this product were similar and the packaging was the same as far as how to use.  After using the product for over a month, I think the results were good. This is a product that I will alternate with the original to save money--although I think nothing can really replace the C&amp;E Ferulic in the original brand.</li>
            <li> I bought skinceuticals years ago and love that line.  I find this line (cosmetic skin solutions) very effective as well.  the clarity of my skin is fantastic.  and these samples go a long way!</li>
            <li> Finally!  Quality skin care that doesn&#x27;t break the bank!  Started with the Retinol and just ordered the sample box.  What a smart move to offer this.  Allows customers to try the products and probably love them and want more but also reduces the financial loss of the large size returns.  Another plus is one stop shopping. So nice to be able to find all that I need for my skin at one company instead of the time consuming, expensive process of buying from several brands.  Love this company!  Price point is important because as much as I love taking care of my skin, I have to live within a budget.  Please keep these great products affordable.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> All serums are wonderful. It is sample. All texture fine. I am a very picky with my cosmetic. I prefer to use no harsh chemicals at all. No parrabens, metyl,,,,you named . I love them all. Eye serum, vitamin C,I will buy in future big bottle ( I have a lots of great products now and wait until I finished). Very convenient for travel. Use as a little drops</li>
            <li> I have combination and sensitive skin so it&#x27;s been very difficult to find products that address all my needs including discoloration from sun damage as well as fine lines. So many products have caused a rash and/or acne breakouts, so I&#x27;m careful in trying new products that address my skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good. This sample pack is a perfect way to find which serum and gel works with your skin needs. I love the CE ferulic &amp; 20% vit C serums, eye firming serum and the phyto gel! These products help to heal a rash I got from a product I used just before. My skin is so soft and smooth since using it and look forward more improvements with continued used. The tiny vials go a long way, just a few drops are all you need. Customer service is great too! So happy to have found these products!</li>
            <li> I had bought 2 of the regular sizes of these products. I had such a great experience with the way my skin felt.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try 2 of these kits to try their other products. I am so glad I did. I used one kit in a month.It is dispensed by droppers so you don&#x27;t need a lot of product. I tried them all. I use them every day. I am on the second samples and I just love how it makes my skin feel and my wrinkles are less apparent. I am very pleased with the products and will continue to use them. I have had people tell me I look so much younger. Well worth it and you can&#x27;t beat the price for the results.</li>
            <li> I started off using these sample serums just to try them out after hearing some great reviews on Amazon and Youtube.  I was particularly interested in the vitamin C serum but I actually ended up liking all of them.  I bought a set for myself and another for my mother and we both love them.  They&#x27;re especially convenient being travel size so I can maintain my skincare regimen when I go on trips overseas.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling ...and you can carry on bag at airport double points for that!!! I love these products by this line I feel and look great....thanx cosmetic skin solutions for making a great products :-)</li>
            <li> Really nice set of samples - great way to try the product line before diving into the full size.  A little goes a long way with this brand.</li>
            <li> I thought this was an alternative for Skinceuticals.  But, I don&#x27;t think it come close.  The eye firming gel is Ok.</li>
            <li> The seven sample vials are a great way to try all 7 and choosing my favorites before investing in a larger quantity. I like the Phyto Botanical Gel the best for my needs. The samples come with a brief description of the contents of each vial which I find very helpful. All of the serums are represented approximate to results - its good stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this lil sample kit, great way to try a lot of different products without spending too much money.  The product is good and was delivered quick! I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> In my pursuit to find a good vitamin C serum that was made fresh and not too expensive, I was lucky enough to come across the CSS site. We have nothing like this in Australia so I was very happy to learn they ship to Oz. I decided to give the sample box a try to start. I could tell they were quality products just from the care in their presentation. After using them....wow. My skin is smoother, tighter and has a glow. Think I have found my new skin care range. Great products and great price!</li>
            <li> Last October, I was visiting with a friend in Cabo San Lucas.  When we were leaving CSL, she insisted that I take her samples of Cosmetic Skin Solutions.  I was hesitant, but she insisted.  I went home and tried them.  I began to see results right away from using Cosmetic Skin Solutions serums.  They cleared my skin and made it so much smoother and even-toned.  I have also received a lot of  compliments lately.  I feel like I could be a spokes model for Cosmetic Skin Solutions.  I am so thankful to my friend for sharing this beauty secret.  I really love how they work for me.  My favorite serums are Vitamin C&amp;E serum, Resurfacing serum, and Phyto + Botanical Gel for Hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a product link:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Serum-Sample-Vials-Phloretin-Resurfacing/dp/B001AIUVKU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_7?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1359062532&amp;sr&#x3D;8-7&amp;keywords&#x3D;cosmetic+skin+solutions</li>
            <li> All I can say is I ordered this sample set about 2 1/2 years ago and I&#x27;ve consistently used almost all of this line ever since.  This is a great line and this is the best way to go if you are hesitant about trying full sizes before knowing if it is for you.  I am very chemically sensitive and do not have any trouble with these products.  Hallelujah!!</li>
            <li> Maybe these were rancid. My skin got a rash.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because the brand seemed to be a knockoff of skinceuticals (they are expensive!). I was happy with the products but not amazed by any means. They all worked and felt ok, but no fireworks. It was fun to try all the different things but I wouldn&#x27;t buy the full size of any of them personally. For reference I have oily, and acneic skin. I mostly wanted to try the resurfacing gel because the skinceuticals one was too expensive. This one did not make a difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you have a variety and you can decide the best serum that works for your skin. Very fun! I love them all! I just wish they were a little bigger. I would order this again!</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Skin Ceutical Customer and purchased this product to take the small vials on vacation......I love the resurfacing serum and the 20 percent Vitamin C! The Extra Firming Eye Serum is Amazing!</li>
            <li> I have noticed and improve in the skin tone.  These samples allow me to test the product.  I will be ordering some of the serums soon (C+E serum, Phyto Botanical Gel and Firming Eye Gel).  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I found these products on Amazon.  I had ordered it after getting recommendations for Skinceuticals.  These products are amazing!!  My skin is now glowing.  My favorites are C&amp;E vitamin serum, resurfacing serum, phyto gel, and firming eye gel.  These products work fast and I have noticed an amazing difference in my skin.  I have purchased a few of the full size serums after trying the samples.  I had contacted the company in regards to trying their moisturizer.  They sent me samples right away.  The moisturize feels great on my skin.  I will be ordering that too.  I am a customer for life!!</li>
            <li> i love this set! I desperately looked for something less expensive than the Skinceuticals that i was intending to purchase. The quality is very similar, and the results are as expected. I will definitely be buying the full size products. I&#x27;m so happy they had the sample set, it definitely has me motivated to purchase the entire regimen from them vs. skinceuticals</li>
            <li> The 7 Serum Sample Vials is a great product and have recommended as a gift for a friend or love one.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the compliments I&#x27;m receiving on my skin.  This sampler contains a resurfacing serum which I started with and for about a week, the dead skin was being sloughed off.  In conjunction with that, in the morning I used the firming eye gel and protected my skin with the Vitamin C+E serum; and at night before bed, I applied the Hydra B5 gel and the firming eye gel again.  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the other samples but right now, I&#x27;m loving these three!  They absorb into the skin quickly and is not greasy whatsoever.  My skin is so hydrated and smooth, and today, when I put on my makeup, I smiled at how much difference one week of use has made.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect kit for brighter and healthier skin. We are using it together with my husband. He needs Hydration-B5 gel and eye gel-firming. I use the rest products for hyperpegmented skin  to brighten and protect it.</li>
            <li> These products are just what every face needs whether you want to prevent aging or reduce aging. Great mixture of products to try.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried the Hydra B5 Gel, the Phloretin CF serum, and the Firming Eye Gel and love all three.  There&#x27;s been a noticeable brightening and hydrating feeling of my skin over the last week and lately it looks great.  No complaints here except the odd but minor issue of some tiny dark particles in the bottom of the Hydra B5 Gel vial.  Not sure what those may be, but they don&#x27;t seem to affect the performance of the product at all.  Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend these three products and, if they are any indication of the quality of the other samples in the set, it would seem that the other products will be just as good.</li>
            <li> This is a great product package offer of samples! I bought the &amp;#34;one of each serum&amp;#34; package and was able to test specific serums to see if I am sensitive to any. I was able to figure out what worked and what didn&#x27;t work on my skin and then I purchase the larger product available. I&#x27;m loving Cosmetic Skin Solutions so far after one and a half week of use! Their products are effective and I am a loyal happy customer now!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIDE NOTE: CSS was also kind enough to send printed out information regarding each product they included in the sample. It helped me tremendously on how to use each product! The booklet includes ingredients and tips and skin regime suggestions. Also what I deeply appreciated was that they also included two samples (day cream and retinol creme) at their own will without extra cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CSS truly cares about the customer and it shows through their quality products! I am a very convinced, loyal, happy customer</li>
            <li> I am a Dermatology nurse who has been using Skinceutical products for 2 years. This product line is no where near the quality. I&#x27;ve never even heard of this company. The CE Feurlic and Phyto+ smell like pure alcohol! WHAT A RIPP OFF!!!!! I will only buy from skinceuticals.com from now on! You get what you pay for!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Wanted to try the different vials to determine if I wanted to buy the actual SkinCeuticals products.  I have the actual SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic, and the vial in the package does not smell the same, nor does it have the same effect on my skin.  I WILL NOT order this ever again.</li>
            <li> It was very effective but a bit pricey.  There is a lot of known eye serum out there for a less of cost.</li>
            <li> Product misrepresented as Skinsceuticals. Don&#x27;t be fooled. Smells terrible and I would never put it on my face.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  I noticed difference in first week.  No breakout for sensitive skin.  Great ingredients in products.</li>
