            <li>I love this medication.</li>
            <li>No burns, and the radiated skin looks and feels moistured and healthy.</li>
            <li>This cream was suggested as a facial cream and one dermatologist raved about it, not so good!  </li>
            <li>Results have been renewed moisture and reduction of fine lines.  </li>
            <li>A great product for your medical needs.</li>

            <li>, etc- heals fast and no scars</li>
            <li>it really sooths and restores your skins.  </li>
            <li>Of course, there are many other uses.  </li>
            <li>: Typically prescribed for wounds (surface and deep), all types of burns (thermal, chemical, radiological) and skin graft donor sites (places where layers of healthy skin have been removed to repair damage elsewhere).  </li>
            <li>Too early to tell if it does a lot</li>
            <li>this is non greasy and absorbs completely</li>
            <li>When dispensed by a pharmacy, the warnings printout you normally receive is blank!  </li>
            <li>By the third day, the tiny little scabbing that covered the last of the open skin washed off revealing nicely healed skin beneath.</li>
            <li>Had a bit of a problem because all of the instructions were in languages other than English, but the company stepped right up and took care of the problem immediately.</li>
            <li>At least it is available here.</li>
            <li>I completely forgot to stock up last time</li>
            <li>After just two days of applying this cream, all the scabs, scales and loose skin washed off easily leaving behind clear (but reddened) skin.</li>
            <li>This is a healing cream - white turns clear when dry.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> my daughter has acne very bad and this seems to be helping.  she also has dry skin and it said this a moisturizer and she likes it.  So I have to say I am glad that I saw this on the amazon website.</li>
            <li> Honestly best deal for the size of the container, thank you. I would purchase another one if I needed to.</li>
            <li> This cream is a real miracle. I have been using it for over 25 years. The only issue is that I just ran out of it and got a sunburn. I don&#x27;t know anything better than this but the price puts me off !!!&lt;br /&gt;It only costs 13 euros in France !!!! I completely forgot to stock up last time I went back... Now I have to pay this outrageous price. At least it is available here.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! It Works for my face, even as a moisturizer under my foundation! I use it daily and for scrapes and scratches.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase again there is no difference from the prescription. I will recommend that everyone get one and keep in your medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> PRICE: I just found this on amazon... I never thought to look.  I&#x27;ve been paying $97 for 90 gram tubes, over $1/gram.  This giant tube costs less than 24cents/gram!  I just ordered a lot more!! I&#x27;ve barely been able to afford those $100 tubes, and have had to use the product so sparingly.  I&#x27;m so happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT:  There is NO other product available that comes close to Biafine. No generic is available, either.  When dispensed by a pharmacy, the warnings printout you normally receive is blank!  This is the only product without warnings (etc.) my pharmacists have ever seen.  Biafine can be applied to an open wound without the painful sting you would feel from just a drop of water. Pure petroleum jelly (PJ) is also painless.. The BIG difference between the two is that Biafine is water-soluble and blends in with the wound, whereas PJ acts as a moisture barrier and will cause the wound to start draining.  There are only a few skin creams that don&#x27;t contain some PJ, and all of them that I have tried contain some ingredient that causes that extremely painful stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USES: Typically prescribed for wounds (surface and deep), all types of burns (thermal, chemical, radiological) and skin graft donor sites (places where layers of healthy skin have been removed to repair damage elsewhere).  Of course, there are many other uses.  When applied to dry, dead skin, it softens (emulsifies) the area and allows the dead material to be removed without trauma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biafine is a very safe product, however it is always advisable to consult your doctor before use. (Keep it out of your eyes... Not for treating infections... Areas softened by Biafine may become tender and vulnerable.. Etc.)</li>
            <li> Nothing great about this product. It&#x27;s labeled as a burn cream. Stick to neosporin. Not worth the money spent on it. This cream was suggested as a facial cream and one dermatologist raved about it, not so good!  I&#x27;ll stick to my regime of dove soap and cydaphil cream.</li>
            <li> Helped heal scars from radiation with continued application. Highly recommend for use with cracked skin or difficult to heal scars.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband who had radiation for cancer and had some burns &amp; scars.  Too early to tell if it does a lot but he said it seems better.</li>
            <li> The product itself was perfect--excellent condition, safety-sealed, great bargain. Item was shipped promptly by the seller, but Fed Ex did NOT deliver on the second day as guaranteed by my Prime account.  I tracked the package, and the report kept saying that it was on the truck for delivery but it arrived almost 2 days late.  This was medicine that I needed immediately, so the delay was frustrating and physically uncomfortable for me. That&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault though.  Otherwise, great transaction.</li>
            <li> My face was red, inflamed and itchy for 3 months from over exfoliation. I tried Aquaphor, Aveno, CeraVe, emu oil and honey mask (left on all night) and nothing helped. I read about Biafine in a beauty forum and decided to give it a try.  After 3 days the redness was gone and within a week the inflammation and itchiness disappeared. I had laproscopic surgery ten months ago and one of my wounds was still red before applying this cream (ran nail across it shortly after surgery) and after applying Biafine the mark is closer to my skin tone. I am confident it will be invisble! I wish I had discover this miracle cream after surgery!  I continue to use it nightly on my face and chest area and do not plan on going without!</li>
            <li> I love this medication. Very good for healing wounds and after reading other reviews I have began using it on dry skin and chapped lips. Works great!!</li>
            <li> Great Product , in a value added size. We use it on scrapes, cuts and abrasions. A great product for your medical needs.</li>
            <li> I found this cream while searching cancer websites for a cream to heal skin burned by radiation treatments for cancer. My husband has throat cancer and underwent seven weeks of radiation treatments. Not only was the inside of his throat extremely painful so was the outside. His skin was burned from the chin to just below the clavicles. The surface was like that of the moon&#x27;s. He was covered with thick scabs, scales and flakes of skin. After just two days of applying this cream, all the scabs, scales and loose skin washed off easily leaving behind clear (but reddened) skin. The pain was all but gone. By the third day, the tiny little scabbing that covered the last of the open skin washed off revealing nicely healed skin beneath. The seller shipped so fast that it was in my hands in 24 hours. I would have paid five or ten times the asking price if necessary after seeing just how unbelievably wonderful this cream is. It did a miraculous job healing the skin and rehydrating it so that my husband had no pain by day 3.</li>
            <li> This is a healing cream - white turns clear when dry. I used it for a burn that would not heal. Then..... I used it for everything.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by a friend.  Product produced in France.  Results have been renewed moisture and reduction of fine lines.  I will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> I have had the prescription form of this and I can not tell any difference. works well. great stuff to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> Had a bit of a problem because all of the instructions were in languages other than English, but the company stepped right up and took care of the problem immediately. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate recommending this company to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased the emulsion for my mother (87), who was under radiation therapy. It helped her perfectly. No burns, and the radiated skin looks and feels moistured and healthy. I strongly recomend it!</li>
            <li> I ordered Biafine and was shipped phytophanere. I have chemical burns and do not understand why I did not get what I purchased. I will have to contact my bank and refute the charge.</li>
            <li> I used this after chemical peel as advised by my physician. It was very soothing to my skin and decreased the redness after the chemical peel.</li>
            <li> I gave this to a friend after he severely burned his hand in a kitchen accident. 3 days later he was as good as new. I have also seen in work on non-healing wounds even those caused by circulatory problems.</li>
            <li> My husband recently underwent 33 radiation treatments for throat cancer--they radiated his entire neck starting just above the jawline (face) and going just below the collarbone--all the way around.  His neck was one giant weeping, red, painful sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Biafine is the only thing that gave him relief.  He went from a 10 on the pain scale down to a 3 within minutes of putting the Biafine on.  And it helped dry up the weeping &amp;#34;pus&amp;#34; and keep the tissue moist at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper on Amazon and no prescription needed either--like at a US pharmacy.</li>
            <li> this cream accelerates the healing process so I use it on my face after a peel, or scrub, or laser treatment, In fact, I bring this to my dermatologists office and after a laser facial I use this instead of the stuff they want to use.  I also use it on cuts to help heal- when I absent-mindedly pull at my cuticles, or cut my hands gardening, etc- heals fast and no scars</li>
            <li> first time using/needing this product for radiation theropy.  smelled very good and my husband&#x27;s skin shows no sign of damage.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a relative to cope with the side effects of&lt;br /&gt;radiation treatment. She says the product helps a lot providing&lt;br /&gt;serious relief</li>
            <li> my friend recommended this product for sun burn.  this cream is great.  it really sooths and restores your skins.  this is non greasy and absorbs completely</li>
