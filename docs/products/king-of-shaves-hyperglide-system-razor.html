            <li>yes, but it is the best razor ever.</li>
            <li>told everyone I know it is THE best razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best razor I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>For shaving legs closely and not nicking them, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Perfect shave --</li>
            <li>Yeah, you miss the best shave ever once, but after that the cheapo blades are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overview:</li>
            <li>I cannot get that with even the best feather blades otherwise.  </li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>Takes a while getting used to it, but the results are great.</li>
            <li>I will not use this razor every day, but rather save it for days when I want to be sure I look my best.</li>
            <li>It was lovely!  </li>
            <li>smooth great shave.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I liked the look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does lubricate on its own.</li>
            <li>Scale of 1 - 10 with 1 being butter knife shaving and 10 being a straight razor shave from the best barber in the world, I would put this somewhere around a 1.5.  </li>
            <li>To maintain that best shave feeling, a new cartridge was required.</li>
            <li>By far, the best razor EVER!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good,  but not as smooth of a shave as you think after you get dressed.......</li>
            <li>After I finished shaving I didn&#x27;t feel like I received as close of a shave as some of the more popular model razors.</li>
            <li>Even though it did glide nicely, I had to make so many passes my face</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure I was not getting duped.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>A utility knife does a better job.  </li>
            <li>the multi-blade razors on the market will give you a better (closer) shave than the Hyperglide Systems Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, in my experience, the best possible shave is achieved in a sauna.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go and trade in your favorite razor for this one quite yet people.</li>
            <li>WHAT RAZOR YOU USE, YOU GET MORE USES AND</li>
            <li>I should have known better.</li>
            <li>As to the number of blades, do 5 butter knives shave better than 1 butter knife?</li>
            <li>The problem is that the blades are so close/fine (or something) that the razor clogs so easily that it is just not practical to use for more than one or two</li>
            <li>However if you are an on the go type person or need a quick comfortable shave, I think this could be a nice tool to have in your bag.</li>
            <li>only perfect on first shave but have used for two weeks and still shaving smooth although not any better than a fusion blade at this point.</li>
            <li>Even before it did, it does not give a smooth shave at all</li>
            <li>shaves I&#x27;ve ever had, and the self lubricating cartridge works as promised without the need of shaving cream of gels irritation free</li>
            <li>I was smooth and unbloodied.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I primary use a razor to keep my neck and cheeks clean.</li>
            <li>Original review:    </li>
            <li>Tried the Hyperglide razor for the first time this afternoon, and it gave me the smoothest, most bloodless shave I&#x27;ve had in my 49 years of life.  </li>
            <li>Since I have a full beard</li>
            <li>To start out it was definitely one of the top most comfortable</li>
            <li>When used with shaving oil I would give it 5 stars &amp; it equals a good old fashion straight edge shave from a barber!</li>
            <li>I have had to edit my original, 5-star review of this product (the original review is below) because, although this razor does indeed provide a near-bloodless, very smooth, fast shave, the blades and lubricant operate at top efficiency for only one, maybe two shaves.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to use, fast, and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li>the lubricant blade is amazing, shaving gel is no longer necessary.</li>
            <li>It is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Received this today and used it right away.</li>
            <li>Just didnt feel right or work the way i wanted a razor to.</li>
            <li>I personally feel like this product is a bit overhyped, but nonetheless, it is a pretty nice razor.</li>
            <li>Thou art a fine razor, but far too pricey for me.    </li>
            <li>swivel head is great to get hard to get to places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this multi-blade system just has it all over the big name US brands and the price is so much better.</li>
            <li>I showered first.</li>
            <li>you want a super clean shave with this razor you do need to be aware of &amp;#34;the grain&amp;#34; of your growth in the different parts of your face and go against and not with the grain.</li>
            <li>It feels exactly like a new name brand razor with a fresh lubricating strip without the shaving cream/gel in my opinion, except this seems like it shaves closer.</li>
            <li>The King is fabulous at cutting in precise clean lines that are nearly as good as a professional men&#x27;s barber with a straight edge</li>
            <li>Really like the feel of this razor</li>
            <li>They couldn&#x27;t give this away free enough.</li>
            <li>WHEN YOU FIND A PRODUCT THAT WORKS MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED</li>
            <li>A MUCH SMOOTHER SHAVE WITH THE GIRLS CREAMS.  </li>
            <li>is very irritated.  </li>
            <li>And it was *fast.</li>
            <li>but once you are comfortable finding your grip, the razor just flat out gets it done.</li>
            <li>The temperature in a steam room is &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; about 110 degrees, and you can&#x27;t comfortably stay in a steam room as long as you can stay in a sauna.  </li>
            <li>AND THE SAME HOLDS TRUE WITH WITH THIS SHAVER.  </li>
            <li>The razor glided smoothly over my face, but left short stubble that I could feel by rubbing my hand against the grain.  </li>
            <li>PURCHASED MY FIRST ONE AT THE LOCAL STORE...</li>
            <li>Note that I am NOT a heavy bearded guy...</li>
            <li>Ok, so I am a sucker for trying a budget shaving blade.</li>
            <li>The moisture (100% humidity) conveys heat to your body faster than the dry, hot air in a sauna.</li>
            <li>(yes, I hung it using the hanger so it would dry fast) and had to look twice because I thought I had picked up my weed whacker on accident.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the double, triple and quadruple blade razors, this surpasses them all and is such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>so if you are having trouble this could be a good option to at least consider.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, save your money and get a single blade disposable (dollar store 10 pack) and you could do not worse.  </li>
            <li>Given the cost of replacement blades, then, you&#x27;re essentially paying nearly $3.50 every time you shave.    </li>
            <li>Barely a nick, and</li>
            <li>The first shave on a new blade feels like a very dull blade.  </li>

            <li> The first shave on a new blade feels like a very dull blade.  </li>
            <li> However, it feels dull and hurts right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ask me how long the blades last.  </li>
            <li> Unlike my double edge I need less preparation of the skin prior to shaving and far less risk of nicking myself.</li>
            <li> Got dull quicker than I expected and did not seem to be all that close a shave in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;Schick 5 blade was a closer shave.</li>
            <li> So expensive to only go full after 3 shaves.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews have said, expensive per use, but it&#x27;s true that I&#x27;ve not had such a close shave in quite a while.</li>
            <li> The shave was not very close -- also, it&#x27;s a ONE USE blade.  </li>
            <li> If you look at this product price when compared to similar offers from the Big Two in addition to its outperforming them IMHO, you can&#x27;y go wrong.</li>
            <li> but dulls so</li>
            <li> Your face is naturally wet and your whiskers have popped out a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Replacements are pretty expensive for a one use blade.  </li>
            <li> I have never been more disappointed in a razor.</li>
            <li> AFTER READING SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWS...</li>
            <li> Poor the first time, Poor the second time.  </li>
            <li> Only con is that I can just make that extra stroke with a less expensive razor and achieve the same results with just plain water.</li>
            <li> Temperatures in a sauna typically exceeds 160 degrees.  </li>
            <li> The replacement cartridges are so expensive it would be cost prohibitive to use a new one each shave.  </li>
            <li> AND THEN IT IS NOT AVAILABLE...</li>
            <li> I do not have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> Since going grey, my whiskers have become extremely tough, and this razor has zero problem.</li>
            <li> If it was at least average, I would not complain.</li>
            <li> It is truly a disappointing razor -- especially for the price.</li>
            <li> King of Shaves, Should be called, &amp;#34;DUNCE OF PIMPLES&amp;#34; It sucks.  </li>
            <li> a marketing persons term for &amp;#34;IT SUCKS, BUT</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> At that point, the blades need changed, and the replacement blades are ridiculously expensive (retail price roughly $20).</li>
            <li> THe blade bends and flexes to the wrong angle so that whiskers are cut about as close as with an average electric razor.  </li>
            <li> , HOWEVER the weird blade angle design takes getting used to and the built in 1 blade &amp;#34;edging&amp;#34; razor for sideburns and hard to reach areas is practically useless as it seemed like a dull blade that didn&#x27;t trim well at all.</li>
            <li> Small cutting blade.</li>
            <li> It was expensive</li>
            <li> It was just so expensive</li>
            <li> mistake?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is useless.  </li>
            <li> But, it is worse than name-brand disposables!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I had given up thinking that shaving would ever be anything but a bloody, painful, prolonged mess.  </li>
            <li> awkward to hold.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> The worst attempt at shaving I&#x27;ve had in 50 years!</li>
            <li> Worst shave ever.  </li>
            <li> It is horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> OK, this is better than a one blade disposable, but it is the worst designed multiblade ever made.  THe blade bends and flexes to the wrong angle so that whiskers are cut about as close as with an average electric razor.  Spend the money on the Gillette Fusion Proglide.  It is well worth it.</li>
            <li> By far, the best razor EVER! And yes, I am a woman. I bought it because I liked the look. It was expensive yes, but it is the best razor ever. I found it at my local Target but I can&#x27;t find it again! I was so sad!&lt;br /&gt;I told everyone I know it is THE best razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;It does lubricate on its own. I didn&#x27;t even need shaving lotion.&lt;br /&gt;The swivel head is great to get hard to get to places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This product is great. I am no longer using Mach 3. It allows you to apply pressure without making cuts. Youtube this and see how it works. It is very different than Mach 3 so if you are having trouble this could be a good option to at least consider.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,  but not as smooth of a shave as you think after you get dressed.......</li>
            <li> The shave was not very close -- also, it&#x27;s a ONE USE blade.  Replacements are pretty expensive for a one use blade.  :(  So sad, wanted to love it.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Really like the feel of this razor</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever used! It exceed my expectations. When used with shaving oil I would give it 5 stars &amp; it equals a good old fashion straight edge shave from a barber!</li>
            <li> It did not meet my hopes or expectations. Got dull quicker than I expected and did not seem to be all that close a shave in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;Schick 5 blade was a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I really have not experienced what the more negative reviews reflect. I think this multi-blade system just has it all over the big name US brands and the price is so much better. The blades position in the handle does take a bit of getting used to but once you are comfortable finding your grip, the razor just flat out gets it done. Since I have a full beard I primary use a razor to keep my neck and cheeks clean. The King is fabulous at cutting in precise clean lines that are nearly as good as a professional men&#x27;s barber with a straight edge could do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a super clean shave with this razor you do need to be aware of &amp;#34;the grain&amp;#34; of your growth in the different parts of your face and go against and not with the grain. Unlike my double edge I need less preparation of the skin prior to shaving and far less risk of nicking myself. If you look at this product price when compared to similar offers from the Big Two in addition to its outperforming them IMHO, you can&#x27;y go wrong.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this product. It feels exactly like a new name brand razor with a fresh lubricating strip without the shaving cream/gel in my opinion, except this seems like it shaves closer. Only con is that I can just make that extra stroke with a less expensive razor and achieve the same results with just plain water. I personally feel like this product is a bit overhyped, but nonetheless, it is a pretty nice razor. Will update if I notice anything else.</li>
            <li> For shaving legs closely and not nicking them, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve tried the double, triple and quadruple blade razors, this surpasses them all and is such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I looked at this for close to twenty minutes in the store before buying it.  It was just so expensive I wanted to make sure I was not getting duped.  Well, I got it home and tried it.  It was lovely!  Perfect shave -- no gel needed.  Then I used it a second time (yes, I hung it using the hanger so it would dry fast) and had to look twice because I thought I had picked up my weed whacker on accident.  Well, I did not.  To maintain that best shave feeling, a new cartridge was required. The replacement cartridges are so expensive it would be cost prohibitive to use a new one each shave.  Note that I am NOT a heavy bearded guy...seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Best shave ever -- once.&lt;br /&gt;Bendy head design -- brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Best shave ever -- once.&lt;br /&gt;EXPENSIVE!!&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer blade works okay but dulls so fast.&lt;br /&gt;For the second shave on, you DO need gel.  The problem is that the blades are so close/fine (or something) that the razor clogs so easily that it is just not practical to use for more than one or two times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, save your money and get a single blade disposable (dollar store 10 pack) and you could do not worse.  Yeah, you miss the best shave ever once, but after that the cheapo blades are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overview: Scale of 1 - 10 with 1 being butter knife shaving and 10 being a straight razor shave from the best barber in the world, I would put this somewhere around a 1.5.  It is truly a disappointing razor -- especially for the price.</li>
            <li> My Husband ordered both the razor and the blades. He loves it.</li>
            <li> The worst attempt at shaving I&#x27;ve had in 50 years!</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, fast, and gives a close shave. I have been using it with water alone.</li>
            <li> Can you do zero stars?  They couldn&#x27;t give this away free enough.</li>
            <li> smooth great shave. only perfect on first shave but have used for two weeks and still shaving smooth although not any better than a fusion blade at this point.</li>
            <li> Poor the first time, Poor the second time.  Worst shave ever.  I cannot believe others like this product.  A utility knife does a better job.  ASK ME HOW I KNOW!  I tried it!. King of Shaves, Should be called, &amp;#34;DUNCE OF PIMPLES&amp;#34; It sucks.  It is horrible.  It does not perform as promised.  Do not buy this.  Don&#x27;t ask me how long the blades last.  The first shave on a new blade feels like a very dull blade.  &amp;#34;Hyperglide&amp;#34;?  is a marketing persons term for &amp;#34;IT SUCKS, BUT IT LOOKS COOL&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at Target.  Are Amazon&#x27;s different?  It looks the same.</li>
            <li> I have never been more disappointed in a razor. So expensive to only go full after 3 shaves. Even before it did, it does not give a smooth shave at all</li>
            <li> I tested the King of Shaves Hyperglide Razor this morning. The razor glided smoothly over my face, but left short stubble that I could feel by rubbing my hand against the grain.  I shaved again with my Dorco Pace 6 blade and could feel an immediate improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any of the multi-blade razors on the market will give you a better (closer) shave than the Hyperglide Systems Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, in my experience, the best possible shave is achieved in a sauna.  Temperatures in a sauna typically exceeds 160 degrees.  When you begin to sweat in about 5-10 minutes, start shaving.  Your face is naturally wet and your whiskers have popped out a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving in a steam room comes in second.  The temperature in a steam room is &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; about 110 degrees, and you can&#x27;t comfortably stay in a steam room as long as you can stay in a sauna.  The moisture (100% humidity) conveys heat to your body faster than the dry, hot air in a sauna.</li>
            <li> To start out it was definitely one of the top most comfortable shaves I&#x27;ve ever had, and the self lubricating cartridge works as promised without the need of shaving cream of gels irritation free, HOWEVER the weird blade angle design takes getting used to and the built in 1 blade &amp;#34;edging&amp;#34; razor for sideburns and hard to reach areas is practically useless as it seemed like a dull blade that didn&#x27;t trim well at all. After I finished shaving I didn&#x27;t feel like I received as close of a shave as some of the more popular model razors. I wouldn&#x27;t go and trade in your favorite razor for this one quite yet people. However if you are an on the go type person or need a quick comfortable shave, I think this could be a nice tool to have in your bag.</li>
            <li> the lubricant blade is amazing, shaving gel is no longer necessary.</li>
            <li> PURCHASED MY FIRST ONE AT THE LOCAL STORE... THEN COULD NOT FIND THE ITEM... ANYWHERE... WHEN YOU FIND A PRODUCT THAT WORKS MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED AND THEN IT IS NOT AVAILABLE... YOU PANIC... FOUND THE ITEM (SPARE) AND REPLACEMENT BLADES... I GOT A SUPPLY TO LAST FOR YEARS... AFTER READING SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWS... THIS MAY HELP YOU... YEARS AGO I RAN OUT OF SHAVING CREAM AND USED MY WIFE&#x27;S &amp;#34;WOMEN&#x27;S SHAVING CREAM&amp;#34; ... I DON&#x27;T CARE WHAT RAZOR YOU USE, YOU GET MORE USES AND A MUCH SMOOTHER SHAVE WITH THE GIRLS CREAMS.  AND THE SAME HOLDS TRUE WITH WITH THIS SHAVER.  IT LASTS AND LASTS.  AND BY THE WAY, SHE BUYS THE STUFF AT THE DOLLAR STORES.</li>
            <li> Takes a while getting used to it, but the results are great. No irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Received this today and used it right away. Big disappointment. I do not have a heavy beard. I am retired and do not shave daily.  Today is Thursday. I last shaved on Tuesday. I showered first. Then I applied shave oil (maybe a mistake?).  Even though it did glide nicely, I had to make so many passes my face is very irritated.  Did not use lather or shaving cream (another mistake?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is useless.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I am a sucker for trying a budget shaving blade. I should have known better. But, it is worse than name-brand disposables! If it was at least average, I would not complain. However, it feels dull and hurts right out of the box. As to the number of blades, do 5 butter knives shave better than 1 butter knife? You get my point.</li>
            <li> I have had to edit my original, 5-star review of this product (the original review is below) because, although this razor does indeed provide a near-bloodless, very smooth, fast shave, the blades and lubricant operate at top efficiency for only one, maybe two shaves.  At that point, the blades need changed, and the replacement blades are ridiculously expensive (retail price roughly $20). Given the cost of replacement blades, then, you&#x27;re essentially paying nearly $3.50 every time you shave.    Fare thee well, King of Shaves Hyperglide Razor.  Thou art a fine razor, but far too pricey for me.    ******************************************************  Original review:    Tried the Hyperglide razor for the first time this afternoon, and it gave me the smoothest, most bloodless shave I&#x27;ve had in my 49 years of life.  And it was *fast.*  Ten minutes, and I was smooth and unbloodied.  I will be buying replacement blade cartridges as soon as I&#x27;m done posting this.  Seriously, I had given up thinking that shaving would ever be anything but a bloody, painful, prolonged mess.  And then along came the King of Shaves Hyperglide Razor.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews have said, expensive per use, but it&#x27;s true that I&#x27;ve not had such a close shave in quite a while. Since going grey, my whiskers have become extremely tough, and this razor has zero problem. Barely a nick, and I cannot get that with even the best feather blades otherwise.  I will not use this razor every day, but rather save it for days when I want to be sure I look my best.</li>
            <li> awkward to hold. different angle to shave. Just didnt feel right or work the way i wanted a razor to. Small cutting blade. needed to pull multiple times to shave over two day growing hair period and i dont have a hairy face.</li>
