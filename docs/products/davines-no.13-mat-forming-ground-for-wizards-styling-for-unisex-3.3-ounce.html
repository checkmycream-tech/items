            <li> A little expensive but well worth it!</li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I just blow dry my hair for a few minutes then rub a really small amount of was into my fingers and spread it through my hair.</li>
            <li> This one makes my hair a bit too stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I can either slick it down or make it stand up, it works for traditional styling and also a crazy messy look.</li>
            <li> It is a thick paste and a little bit goes a looooong way.</li>
            <li> I have thick, hard to style hair and this product does the trick.  </li>
            <li> at least 3-4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Thick in quantity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> your fingers through your hair in random directions for about 15 seconds, then place your hair the way you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I have never ever imagine paying $30 for hair product, but it works so damn well.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The pixie cut might have been a terrifying experience had it not been for Davines 13.</li>

            <li> I took the plunge and, after 26 years, cut all my hair off. The pixie cut might have been a terrifying experience had it not been for Davines 13. This stuff is awesome. It is a thick paste and a little bit goes a looooong way. This tin will last you forever. Be sure to put it in your hand and rub your palms to warm it up and make it easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing, too!</li>
            <li> I think this is by far the best hair product I have ever purchased! I just cut all my hair off and didn&#x27;t know how to style it. This wax is so easy! I just blow dry my hair for a few minutes then rub a really small amount of was into my fingers and spread it through my hair. I can either slick it down or make it stand up, it works for traditional styling and also a crazy messy look. It&#x27;s so great I don&#x27;t even use hairspray and it survives my hotflashes, which is a miracle in itself. I just run my fingers through my hair to re-fluff durring the day and it perks right back up, this stuff is awesome!!</li>
            <li> The delivery was 10 days before it was expected. The product is also very good, perfect for mye hair. I will recommend this product without doubt. Just try it you will love it &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> A little expensive but well worth it! Way cheaper though than at a salon. Good stuff</li>
            <li> My Hair prep is very simple!&lt;br /&gt;Blow dry to the way I want a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Taking your index finger, using the nail side!&lt;br /&gt;Scoop out a bit and place it in the palm of your hands.&lt;br /&gt;Rub your hands together, till you can&#x27;t see much of it and that your hands are heated up!&lt;br /&gt;Run your fingers through your hair in random directions for about 15 seconds, then place your hair the way you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will last throughout the day, it holds extremely well in winter!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave an awfully dry feeling, It has kind of a shine, but not too much!&lt;br /&gt;Just another perfect product for those European hair styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Hanz de Fuko products, By Vilain Gold digger, gatzby, and tigi.&lt;br /&gt;This gives out of the best holds out of those products!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and really love it! It gives life and energy to my fine, limp hair like I&#x27;ve never known before. Please  reconsider and do not discontinue it.</li>
            <li> A great product to create and define your hairstyle. Very easy to apply. It leaves a natural, flexible hold and matte finish.</li>
            <li> I have thick, hard to style hair and this product does the trick.  It even allows you to put a comb through your hair after applying.  Smells good too!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s good product depends upon your hair type and style expectations.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is super straight, thin hair strands and I have a lot of it. Thick in quantity.&lt;br /&gt;My preferred style is tossed, but touchable. This does it. And it smells good- so say others. But it&#x27;s not a strong smell. I&#x27;m scentsitive to that. And my face doesn&#x27;t break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will remain on my shelf for certain days and certain moods.</li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way. Get the molded/spiked look as if a professional styled your hair. You too can look great every day!</li>
            <li> I have used many of Davines products and they are all unique and outstanding and this product is no exception. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I came home from my Mom&#x27;s house after trying this and had to order it for myself.  I love the scent of the product and it did wonders for my hair and my son&#x27;s hair.  I have 15 spiking gels in my house and none of them will hold my sons short hair in place, this product does the job without leaving a glossy-icky-sticky-crunchy look!  I am also tyring to grow and my bangs that are so untamed and won&#x27;t fit into any clip, this totally helps them to lay down flat.  I can&#x27;t rave enough about this product.  My mom paid $38 in salon for this, glad to see it came down on price at amazon retailers.</li>
            <li> The order was shipped in a reasonable amount of time but the container had a nice dent on the bottom.</li>
            <li> This is the best product that I have ever used. A little goes a long way. Extra hold for hair.</li>
            <li> Gives you good hold throughout the day without any wet look.  Only takes a little to work with shorter hair and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Davines No. 2 hair product to this one.  This one makes my hair a bit too stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li> This wax is easy to use and goes just where I want it to.  My hair stays looking and feeling clean and gives it more texture.</li>
            <li> This is a really great hair product that I was turned onto about 2 years ago, and I cannot use anything else. It is lightweight, with good hold, and does not leave a gross residue. I have thinner hair, and it adds volume and weight.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done leaving my hair perfect. I am thrilled with the results and would recommend to everyone! Buy it!</li>
            <li> A friend who is a hairstylist convinced me to get this. I was skeptical because I have never ever imagine paying $30 for hair product, but it works so damn well. Also, I have been using it about a month and there is still tons left. I suspect it could last someone who is more conservative with it 5 months plus, at least. Using it everyday, like I do, I imagine it will last at least 3-4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it says \\&quot;for wizards.\\&quot; Pretty cool.</li>
