            <li>I still have some flaking below my eyes at the end of the day which isn&#x27;t ideal, but this mascara is well-rated by the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s cosmetics database.</li>
            <li>I loved it!  </li>
            <li>No eye irritation and it stays on beautifully, too.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve already converted two of my girl friends and they are just as happy as I am with this product.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>this just may work better than their brush lol )</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>This mascara is really amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Happy lashes whatever cake you choose, though this really IS the best.  </li>
            <li>- I have to because some of my lashes just have a mind of their own.</li>
            <li>Got for gift for a friend she liked it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m particularly thrilled that it dissolves with water.  </li>
            <li>I liked that the mascara did not make my eyes burn.  </li>
            <li>it is my best find so far !!!</li>
            <li>No clumps, no flaking, no eye irritation, and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best price I&#x27;ve found anywhere.</li>
            <li>So easy to wash off too!</li>
            <li>Love the scent of it, too.</li>
            <li>So I had to purchase a fan brush (another $8) in order to use the mascara.  </li>
            <li>Only wish it hadn&#x27;t taken me 40 years to discover this wonderful cosmetic.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this mascara though has got to be the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes all irritated and blood-shot.  </li>
            <li>used it many years ago and am so glad I rediscovered it.</li>
            <li>Not Maybelline like in the good old days, but Longcils is just as good.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Then I put one more coat on and I&#x27;m out the door.</li>
            <li>(I deliberately put on more than needed to test it.)</li>
            <li>and they make more money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a cake mascara for many years now.  </li>
            <li>I like the cake mascara because it doesn&#x27;t clump the way most mascara&#x27;s do</li>
            <li>Old-school mascara is scarce, and most venues charge a premium.</li>
            <li>I love using cake mascara.</li>
            <li>Make sure to rinse your brush after use or you&#x27;ll get a clumpy application.</li>
            <li>Seemed better than the stiffer brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.  </li>
            <li>More like the brushes that used to come with this type of cosmetic.</li>
            <li>but it really is better than most brush ones.</li>
            <li>This is my alltime favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Even better, it&#x27;s easy to remove, but it doesn&#x27;t smear during the day, even if you rub your eye.</li>
            <li>For a person as sensitive to cosmetics as me, it is a great solution.</li>
            <li>The mascara goes on easily with the brush in the compact.</li>
            <li>Learning curve was easy.  </li>
            <li>It washes easily with water without burning.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect black.</li>
            <li>but this is the best formula as it&#x27;s creamier than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried, and I use it to tight line my eyes</li>
            <li>that makes my lashes clump together, so a little dryer seems to work best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow, so glad I found this amazing product.  </li>
            <li>I then toss the spoolie cause they are so cheap, or</li>
            <li>Finally found a cake mascara that is great....</li>
            <li>remove mine with lots of warm water and gentle fingers.</li>
            <li>Instructions were simple and it looked great on my lashes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but in my opinion it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was drawn to this mascara because of how unique it is, but once I started using it</li>
            <li>the cake itself has lasted, how long it lasts on my lashes and how happy I am with the product and look.</li>
            <li>I used cake mascara years ago, after a trip to the original Sephora in Paris.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are unique on this brush to begin with</li>
            <li>The results are worth it!</li>
            <li>The clean side of the spoolie can be used to shape the lashes.</li>
            <li>sometimes I rinse it clean and reuse.  </li>
            <li>- doesn&#x27;t flake, doesn&#x27;t smear, easy to use and much much better than the new gloppy stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of cake mascara and this is a good product for people who just want to darken and define the eyelashes they&#x27;ve already got, without fibers, glops and smudges.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>Everything the description said is true.</li>
            <li>; but then came the products that are on the market today, all of them thickening, lengthening, volumizing -- and, as I discovered when I bought this Longcils Boncza, far superior to cake mascara, which, at best, whisks a thin coat of color over one&#x27;s lashes.  </li>
            <li>Plus I can add more and make my lashes much thicker.</li>
            <li>Most times, I line my eyes first, and the cake is just the right consistency for my eye lashes.  </li>
            <li>Double duty (eye liner and mascara), zero irritation, great staying power, and crazy good natural beautiful lashes:)  </li>
            <li>The ones that used to come with the older products were more refined.  </li>
            <li>I long for Maybelline&#x27;s cake mascara again and surprisingly came across this.  </li>
            <li>It really is clump and flake free.  </li>
            <li>Worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like it, but it had a distinct &amp;#34;old-lady&amp;#34; scent to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered other cake mascaras and they&#x27;re really good too,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with the Longcils Boncza, I&#x27;ve no problem with the brush, it is long wear and doesn&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li>love this stuff, I wear contacts, and FINALLY I have a Mascara that doesn&#x27;t CLUMP, FLAKE, SMUDGE..</li>
            <li>It wears pretty well.  </li>
            <li>First time my eyes do not burn when wearing mascara</li>
            <li>It does take some getting used to with the applicator brush, but now I can totally skip eyeliner and my lashes have never looked better.</li>
            <li>Putting more coats on won&#x27;t make them longer or thicker like traditional mascara</li>
            <li>and neither did I at first.</li>
            <li>When I get a more regular wand, I think I&#x27;ll like it a lot.</li>
            <li>This is my first time to try cake mascara.  </li>
            <li>Most commercial mascaras are way too goopy.</li>
            <li>Moisturize First.</li>
            <li>and I actually use this more often than the included brush.</li>
            <li>Cake mascara is more versatile than wand mascara; YOU have control , use a little for a very natural look, or more coats for added thickness.  </li>
            <li>but, I feel the brush is really too big to be able to apply it without getting it onto your eyelids.  </li>
            <li>If you have fairly long, thick lashes, and just need to make them darker, this is the perfect stuff.</li>
            <li>Do NOT use the brush that comes with it, INSTAED buy a mascara Wand, or simply take one from an OLD tube of Mascara and clean it till the water runs clear, then shake most of the water out and put it into the cake Mascara, apply as much as needed...</li>
            <li>Okay, this will sound strange, but rather than using  an old mascara wand to apply the cake, I discovered that an &amp;#34;abcOralCare sensitive medium &amp;#34;TOOTHBRUSH  works very well.</li>
            <li>It takes longer to apply, but it looks so much nicer than tube masacara.</li>
            <li>learned how to make this work just as well and as fast as a tube mascara from a video on YouTube.  </li>
            <li>is makes my eyes really stand out.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t show up much and doesn&#x27;t do much to my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I make sure not to get it too wet as I find</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOOOOVE this mascara.  </li>
            <li>No problems washing off when ready to remove.</li>
            <li>Too much creme on the lids or below, creates that smeared look.</li>
            <li>( I had used too much water on the brush and my lashes were &amp;#34;stringy sparse&amp;#34;  and  for some reason I grabbed my tooth brush to comb it out and said to myself</li>
            <li>I threw the whole thing in the trash</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d reccomend using a clear mascara first though or getting an eyelash comb to separate the lashes.</li>
            <li>and they clearly weren&#x27;t interested.</li>
            <li>I also no longer have irritated red eyes which I now realize was from using tube mascara, full of chemicals and bacteria.  </li>
            <li>I also really like that it lasts much longer than typical mascara since the water dries out after each use instead of becoming a bacteria breeding ground.  </li>
            <li>Rep was very rude to me and when I told her that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to give 5 stars as a result all she said was &amp;#34;you&#x27;re free to do so.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>This gives just enough definition and seems to last all day under most circumstances.  </li>
            <li>Have used several and find they can work ok, especially the eyebrow brush.  </li>
            <li>Classic.</li>
            <li>i use a Q tip dipped in rose petal powder or plain old cornstarch to &amp;#34;dry up&amp;#34; the eye area before applying the mascara.</li>
            <li>I quit using mascara because I had to replace one every three months, no matter what the cost--low or high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend...  </li>
            <li>The mascara is heavily perfumed with many added ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The yellow allows me to see when I have the right amount.  </li>
            <li>I will admit it takes a little practice, but well worth the effort !!  </li>
            <li>The black is very rich but my lashes look natural with no clumps.  </li>
            <li>I wash mine gently after several uses but over time it should be replaced which means a whole new kit.</li>
            <li>It lasts all 14 hours I have it on and comes off easily with face cleanser without leaving black marks underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Be careful to look in a good magnifying mirror to then gently remove all the tiny black dots that fall on your face.</li>
            <li>It felt very light and natural on my lashes while giving a deep black color and buildable thickening.</li>
            <li>What I like about it is that my lashes look so natural after applying this mascara; it doesn&#x27;t clump like wand mascaras do.</li>
            <li>This is the first mascara in a long time that doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is easier to use for more delicate application.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well it wore over time.</li>
            <li>Tis is the type of mascara I started out with as a young girl.  </li>
            <li>Builds up well if you want extra full and long lashes.</li>
            <li>Then I tried it again and have got used to it and find it makes my lashes lovely and thick.</li>
            <li>I first got this in Brun because I have such light hair and lashes and extremely sensitive eyes, then tried the black, and will try the blue.</li>
            <li>The long handle  allows you to really get the lashes in the corner without fear of a corneal transplant.</li>
            <li>I briefly tried one of the little eyeshadow sponges and that might be an option for light application.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rich, dark black that is really flattering.  </li>
            <li>I use one drop of sterile eye moisture drops and then take a clean yellow spoolie (disposable mascara wand)  and make a little paste.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to go all natural with my facial care and cosmetics which is how I found this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I had heard about cake mascara but never really gave it much thought.</li>
            <li>Also, it makes my lashes clump worse than most mascaras.  </li>
            <li>So much more natural and defined without looking fake.</li>
            <li>I decided to return it as any major department store&#x27;s cosmetic counter will take makeup back.  </li>
            <li>I used to have really dry, sensitive eyes caused in part by my tube of chemical-filled mascara.</li>
            <li>(they&#x27;re very inexpensive), add a little water to the cake</li>
            <li>Too much water verses too little water etc.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> ; but then came the products that are on the market today, all of them thickening, lengthening, volumizing -- and, as I discovered when I bought this Longcils Boncza, far superior to cake mascara, which, at best, whisks a thin coat of color over one&#x27;s lashes.  </li>
            <li> Plus I can add more and make my lashes much thicker.</li>
            <li> Most times, I line my eyes first, and the cake is just the right consistency for my eye lashes.  </li>
            <li> Double duty (eye liner and mascara), zero irritation, great staying power, and crazy good natural beautiful lashes:)  </li>
            <li> The ones that used to come with the older products were more refined.  </li>
            <li> I long for Maybelline&#x27;s cake mascara again and surprisingly came across this.  </li>
            <li> It really is clump and flake free.  </li>
            <li> Worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it, but it had a distinct &amp;#34;old-lady&amp;#34; scent to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered other cake mascaras and they&#x27;re really good too,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with the Longcils Boncza, I&#x27;ve no problem with the brush, it is long wear and doesn&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li> love this stuff, I wear contacts, and FINALLY I have a Mascara that doesn&#x27;t CLUMP, FLAKE, SMUDGE..</li>
            <li> It wears pretty well.  </li>
            <li> First time my eyes do not burn when wearing mascara</li>
            <li> It does take some getting used to with the applicator brush, but now I can totally skip eyeliner and my lashes have never looked better.</li>
            <li> Putting more coats on won&#x27;t make them longer or thicker like traditional mascara</li>
            <li> and neither did I at first.</li>
            <li> When I get a more regular wand, I think I&#x27;ll like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to try cake mascara.  </li>
            <li> Most commercial mascaras are way too goopy.</li>
            <li> Moisturize First.</li>
            <li> and I actually use this more often than the included brush.</li>
            <li> Cake mascara is more versatile than wand mascara; YOU have control , use a little for a very natural look, or more coats for added thickness.  </li>
            <li> but, I feel the brush is really too big to be able to apply it without getting it onto your eyelids.  </li>
            <li> If you have fairly long, thick lashes, and just need to make them darker, this is the perfect stuff.</li>
            <li> Do NOT use the brush that comes with it, INSTAED buy a mascara Wand, or simply take one from an OLD tube of Mascara and clean it till the water runs clear, then shake most of the water out and put it into the cake Mascara, apply as much as needed...</li>
            <li> Okay, this will sound strange, but rather than using  an old mascara wand to apply the cake, I discovered that an &amp;#34;abcOralCare sensitive medium &amp;#34;TOOTHBRUSH  works very well.</li>
            <li> It takes longer to apply, but it looks so much nicer than tube masacara.</li>
            <li> learned how to make this work just as well and as fast as a tube mascara from a video on YouTube.  </li>
            <li> is makes my eyes really stand out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t show up much and doesn&#x27;t do much to my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I make sure not to get it too wet as I find</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOOOOVE this mascara.  </li>
            <li> No problems washing off when ready to remove.</li>
            <li> Too much creme on the lids or below, creates that smeared look.</li>
            <li> ( I had used too much water on the brush and my lashes were &amp;#34;stringy sparse&amp;#34;  and  for some reason I grabbed my tooth brush to comb it out and said to myself</li>
            <li> I threw the whole thing in the trash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d reccomend using a clear mascara first though or getting an eyelash comb to separate the lashes.</li>
            <li> and they clearly weren&#x27;t interested.</li>
            <li> I also no longer have irritated red eyes which I now realize was from using tube mascara, full of chemicals and bacteria.  </li>
            <li> I also really like that it lasts much longer than typical mascara since the water dries out after each use instead of becoming a bacteria breeding ground.  </li>
            <li> Rep was very rude to me and when I told her that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to give 5 stars as a result all she said was &amp;#34;you&#x27;re free to do so.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> This gives just enough definition and seems to last all day under most circumstances.  </li>
            <li> Have used several and find they can work ok, especially the eyebrow brush.  </li>
            <li> Classic.</li>
            <li> i use a Q tip dipped in rose petal powder or plain old cornstarch to &amp;#34;dry up&amp;#34; the eye area before applying the mascara.</li>
            <li> I quit using mascara because I had to replace one every three months, no matter what the cost--low or high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend...  </li>
            <li> The mascara is heavily perfumed with many added ingredients.  </li>
            <li> The yellow allows me to see when I have the right amount.  </li>
            <li> I will admit it takes a little practice, but well worth the effort !!  </li>
            <li> The black is very rich but my lashes look natural with no clumps.  </li>
            <li> I wash mine gently after several uses but over time it should be replaced which means a whole new kit.</li>
            <li> It lasts all 14 hours I have it on and comes off easily with face cleanser without leaving black marks underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> Be careful to look in a good magnifying mirror to then gently remove all the tiny black dots that fall on your face.</li>
            <li> It felt very light and natural on my lashes while giving a deep black color and buildable thickening.</li>
            <li> What I like about it is that my lashes look so natural after applying this mascara; it doesn&#x27;t clump like wand mascaras do.</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara in a long time that doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is easier to use for more delicate application.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well it wore over time.</li>
            <li> Tis is the type of mascara I started out with as a young girl.  </li>
            <li> Builds up well if you want extra full and long lashes.</li>
            <li> Then I tried it again and have got used to it and find it makes my lashes lovely and thick.</li>
            <li> I first got this in Brun because I have such light hair and lashes and extremely sensitive eyes, then tried the black, and will try the blue.</li>
            <li> The long handle  allows you to really get the lashes in the corner without fear of a corneal transplant.</li>
            <li> I briefly tried one of the little eyeshadow sponges and that might be an option for light application.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rich, dark black that is really flattering.  </li>
            <li> I use one drop of sterile eye moisture drops and then take a clean yellow spoolie (disposable mascara wand)  and make a little paste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to go all natural with my facial care and cosmetics which is how I found this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I had heard about cake mascara but never really gave it much thought.</li>
            <li> Also, it makes my lashes clump worse than most mascaras.  </li>
            <li> So much more natural and defined without looking fake.</li>
            <li> I decided to return it as any major department store&#x27;s cosmetic counter will take makeup back.  </li>
            <li> I used to have really dry, sensitive eyes caused in part by my tube of chemical-filled mascara.</li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re very inexpensive), add a little water to the cake</li>
            <li> Too much water verses too little water etc.</li>
            <li> This one will last until the cake runs out and that will be a long time.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered it from the MAC professional store and it&#x27;s of little use to me.  </li>
            <li> The effect (at least for me) is really nice thick separated DARK lashes .</li>
            <li> Does not burn eyes and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I recently went in Big Lots and found a pack of  assorted small cosmetic brushes, eyebrow brush and comb and some short bristled items.  </li>
            <li> I put one coat on, let it dry</li>
            <li> But it has a very strong strange odor that made me feel sick.  </li>
            <li> It did not take me very long to get used to putting it on and it takes me less time to apply than traditional mascara takes me.</li>
            <li> it looks so natural and the black is so black</li>
            <li> You need to wet the surface just enough for it to become a little liquid, but not watery.  </li>
            <li> Just wet the brush and run it across the mascara cake, then apply it to your lashes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work for any of these named products, I just feel my money was well spent on quality cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Also blends false lashes with real ones for those with thing eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER EVER buy the other Mascara again...</li>
            <li> Every other mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still be trying other tube mascaras.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for a brush the size of the old Maybelline cake mascara but was disappointed to see how large this brush is.  </li>
            <li> and I never have the black mark underneath my eyebrows that I seem to get with every other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not at all water or smudgeproof.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money</li>
            <li> Only negative, unless I&#x27;m mistaken, they don&#x27;t sell replacement brushes that comes with it separately.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to apply and although it isn&#x27;t waterproof it lasts longer on me than the waterproof expensive stuff.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight medium perfume smell that I don&#x27;t love but don&#x27;t hate</li>
            <li> I like that you can make it as thick or thin as you like by how much water you add to it...</li>
            <li> It comes off with less effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then a few rubs on the cake.</li>
            <li> I ordered the mascara as I wear contacts and so far unable to locate any that don&#x27;t affect my contacts.  </li>
            <li> I found small black dots all over.  </li>
            <li> The brush is huge and impossible to get a thin coat of mascara on.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed with What She Buys and I&#x27;ll be looking for another source for this product in future.</li>
            <li> Most tube mascaras irritate my eyes terribly because of the additives.</li>
            <li> and I love that it comes off without those horrible removers.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this one is ok with the contacts but so difficult to get the mascara to a liquid form to even use.</li>
            <li> The included brush is somewhat clumsy to use, so practice, practice.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the wand types that are thick and get thicker and gum up</li>
            <li> Then I apply a thin coat or keep applying to build up a thick coat, whichever I want.  </li>
            <li> Cake mascara has NONE of the fillers and filaments common in tube mascara today,  so NO EYE IRRITATION!</li>
            <li> I dip the brush in a little cold water and shake off the excess.</li>
            <li> Dramatic.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just too thick and awkward.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately b/c</li>
            <li> Too expensive to discard, so it&#x27;ll sit&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> Faintly moisten the brush.</li>
            <li> you follow my steps, you will NOT be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in them.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate to wear mascara</li>
            <li> The brush in this one IS awful to work with.  </li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible!  </li>

            <li> If you have fairly long, thick lashes, and just need to make them darker, this is the perfect stuff. Zero clumps. Goes on smoothly and easily. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not at all water or smudgeproof. Love the scent of it, too. Smells just like my mom&#x27;s makeup case in the 1960s. Yum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of cake mascara and this is a good product for people who just want to darken and define the eyelashes they&#x27;ve already got, without fibers, glops and smudges.  My low rating is not for the mascara itself, but the source.  Someone at What She Buys had removed the applicator brush from the box at some point, so my purchase arrived with no way to use it.  So I had to purchase a fan brush (another $8) in order to use the mascara.  Not impressed with What She Buys and I&#x27;ll be looking for another source for this product in future.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful, no clumping and lasts forever. You can layer it if you want (if you like volume). I&#x27;d reccomend using a clear mascara first though or getting an eyelash comb to separate the lashes. It takes longer to apply, but it looks so much nicer than tube masacara. Even better, it&#x27;s easy to remove, but it doesn&#x27;t smear during the day, even if you rub your eye.</li>
            <li> Wow, so glad I found this amazing product.  I use one drop of sterile eye moisture drops and then take a clean yellow spoolie (disposable mascara wand)  and make a little paste.  The yellow allows me to see when I have the right amount.  Then I apply a thin coat or keep applying to build up a thick coat, whichever I want.  The clean side of the spoolie can be used to shape the lashes. I then toss the spoolie cause they are so cheap, or sometimes I rinse it clean and reuse.  I have had no problems with flaking or smudging.  The black is very rich but my lashes look natural with no clumps.  I also no longer have irritated red eyes which I now realize was from using tube mascara, full of chemicals and bacteria.  Only wish it hadn&#x27;t taken me 40 years to discover this wonderful cosmetic.</li>
            <li> Bought this from another web site, but wanted to include a review here as well..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff, I wear contacts, and FINALLY I have a Mascara that doesn&#x27;t CLUMP, FLAKE, SMUDGE.. Do NOT use the brush that comes with it, INSTAED buy a mascara Wand, or simply take one from an OLD tube of Mascara and clean it till the water runs clear, then shake most of the water out and put it into the cake Mascara, apply as much as needed... I will NEVER EVER buy the other Mascara again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow my steps, you will NOT be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not practical at all.  You have to add water to apply.</li>
            <li> Bought this a while back and I absolutely love it!  I like that you can make it as thick or thin as you like by how much water you add to it...I feel it gives you some options depending on the look you&#x27;re going for.  I also really like that it lasts much longer than typical mascara since the water dries out after each use instead of becoming a bacteria breeding ground.  My favorite thing about this mascara though has got to be the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes all irritated and blood-shot.  Every other mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT) has made my eyes look like I pulled an all-nighter within 20 minutes of application...this mascara doesn&#x27;t do that.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but in my opinion it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I first got this in Brun because I have such light hair and lashes and extremely sensitive eyes, then tried the black, and will try the blue. Most tube mascaras irritate my eyes terribly because of the additives. The brush in this one IS awful to work with.  I&#x27;ve ordered other cake mascaras and they&#x27;re really good too, but this is the best formula as it&#x27;s creamier than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried, and I use it to tight line my eyes so it&#x27;s double duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned how to make this work just as well and as fast as a tube mascara from a video on YouTube.  You take a regular disposable mascara brush (they&#x27;re very inexpensive), add a little water to the cake (I spritz it from a bottle, and then wipe off my mirror), and rub the brush back and forth in the cake until it&#x27;s fully and evenly coated.  I then wipe it on a tissue or paper towel to take any excess off, and apply just like regular tube mascara.  Most times, I line my eyes first, and the cake is just the right consistency for my eye lashes.  I tried for years with the brush that came with this and it&#x27;s just too thick and awkward.  If it hadn&#x27;t been for the YouTube video...I&#x27;d still be trying other tube mascaras.  I&#x27;ve also tried the MAC mascara fan brush with it, and it just doesn&#x27;t work.  I actually ordered it from the MAC professional store and it&#x27;s of little use to me.  The best way to go is with the cheapo disposable mascara wands.  And unlike the YouTube video, I just use water...no fixative, and it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy lashes whatever cake you choose, though this really IS the best.  Double duty (eye liner and mascara), zero irritation, great staying power, and crazy good natural beautiful lashes:)  Oh, and it lasts and lasts too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to go all natural with my facial care and cosmetics which is how I found this mascara.  The trick is learning how to apply it--it will always take longer than a wand.  You need to wet the surface just enough for it to become a little liquid, but not watery.  The upside is the color.  It&#x27;s a rich, dark black that is really flattering.  It wears pretty well.  I still have some flaking below my eyes at the end of the day which isn&#x27;t ideal, but this mascara is well-rated by the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s cosmetics database.</li>
            <li> It does not smear, can be applied in several coats, and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;I used it many years ago and am so glad I rediscovered it.</li>
            <li> I hate to wear mascara but it is flattering so one day I remembered the days of my youth when we had cake mascara and I thought, maybe they still make that? Yes they do! Not Maybelline like in the good old days, but Longcils is just as good. I love it - doesn&#x27;t flake, doesn&#x27;t smear, easy to use and much much better than the new gloppy stuff.</li>
            <li> I tried everything with this mascara, but it did not cover well and every time I blinked I found small black dots all over.  Terrible.</li>
            <li> First time my eyes do not burn when wearing mascara it is my best find so far !!! Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I used to have really dry, sensitive eyes caused in part by my tube of chemical-filled mascara. When I wear this mascara my eyes feel great and don&#x27;t tear up all the time. It does take some getting used to with the applicator brush, but now I can totally skip eyeliner and my lashes have never looked better. So much more natural and defined without looking fake. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. So easy to wash off too! Have already recommended to several friends.</li>
            <li> I was drawn to this mascara because of how unique it is, but once I started using it I was hooked. It goes on so smoothly, never cakes and you just can&#x27;t put too much on. It never flakes, smudges, irritates or burns my eyes and I never have the black mark underneath my eyebrows that I seem to get with every other mascara I&#x27;ve used. It lasts all 14 hours I have it on and comes off easily with face cleanser without leaving black marks underneath my eyes. I bought a bag of mascara applicators for under 5 dollars and I use those in lieu of the brush - but the brush makes the lashes look even fuller. It did not take me very long to get used to putting it on and it takes me less time to apply than traditional mascara takes me. Putting more coats on won&#x27;t make them longer or thicker like traditional mascara and I think that is why I like it...it looks so natural and the black is so black is makes my eyes really stand out. I put one coat on, let it dry and then separate my lashes with a lash separator - I have to because some of my lashes just have a mind of their own. Then I put one more coat on and I&#x27;m out the door. They look so good. The price doesn&#x27;t bother me because it has already paid for itself in the length of time the cake itself has lasted, how long it lasts on my lashes and how happy I am with the product and look. Like anything else, it may not be for everyone, but then nothing is. I&#x27;ve already converted two of my girl friends and they are just as happy as I am with this product.</li>
            <li> Horrible!  Definitely not worth the money</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and I finally decided to ditch the mascara tubes.  I long for Maybelline&#x27;s cake mascara again and surprisingly came across this.  Based on the reviews I decided to try it.  It looks great on.  No doubt about it.  But it has a very strong strange odor that made me feel sick.  Unfortunately b/c it&#x27;s pricey I decided to return it as any major department store&#x27;s cosmetic counter will take makeup back.  Not Amazon.  I&#x27;m really disappointed in them.  If odors bother you as well as ingredients, this is not the mascara for you.</li>
            <li> Everything the description said is true. The mascara goes on easily with the brush in the compact. Just wet the brush and run it across the mascara cake, then apply it to your lashes. No clumps, even after 3 applications. (I deliberately put on more than needed to test it.) No eye irritation and it stays on beautifully, too. I quit using mascara because I had to replace one every three months, no matter what the cost--low or high. This one will last until the cake runs out and that will be a long time.</li>
            <li> Got for gift for a friend she liked it.</li>
            <li> Finally found a cake mascara that is great....I can&#x27;t stand the wand types that are thick and get thicker and gum up so you have to replace them so often!  No wonder companies came up with the wand mascara, you have to buy them all of the time and they make more money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t show up much and doesn&#x27;t do much to my eyelashes.  I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cake mascara for many years now.  I used to use the Maybeline in a red box.  I&#x27;m thrilled with the Longcils Boncza, I&#x27;ve no problem with the brush, it is long wear and doesn&#x27;t smudge and I&#x27;m particularly thrilled that it dissolves with water.  There is no rubbing to remove it.</li>
            <li> I used cake mascara years ago, after a trip to the original Sephora in Paris.  I loved it!  Bought every one I could get my hands&lt;br /&gt;on; but then came the products that are on the market today, all of them thickening, lengthening, volumizing -- and, as I discovered when I bought this Longcils Boncza, far superior to cake mascara, which, at best, whisks a thin coat of color over one&#x27;s lashes.  Even two or three coats doesn&#x27;t produce the effect of wand mascara.  Too expensive to discard, so it&#x27;ll sit&lt;br /&gt;in my makeup drawer forever!</li>
            <li> I like the cake mascara because it doesn&#x27;t clump the way most mascara&#x27;s do but, I feel the brush is really too big to be able to apply it without getting it onto your eyelids.  I was hoping for a brush the size of the old Maybelline cake mascara but was disappointed to see how large this brush is.  I would suggest a smaller brush in the future.</li>
            <li> This has been my mascara of choice for about two years now. I have read that some people don&#x27;t like the brush that comes with it and neither did I at first. Then I tried it again and have got used to it and find it makes my lashes lovely and thick. I dip the brush in a little cold water and shake off the excess. Then a few rubs on the cake. I make sure not to get it too wet as I find that makes my lashes clump together, so a little dryer seems to work best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remove mine with lots of warm water and gentle fingers. This is the only mascara that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes sore and itchy and I love that it comes off without those horrible removers. Lasts me about 6 months.</li>
            <li> This is the type of mascara my mother used when I was a child. What I like about it is that my lashes look so natural after applying this mascara; it doesn&#x27;t clump like wand mascaras do. It goes on like silk. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOOOOVE this mascara.  It goes on beautifully and wears all day perfectly.  It really is clump and flake free.  Learning curve was easy.  I will never use tube mascara again... this is finally the mascara I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara in a long time that doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my eyes. It washes easily with water without burning. Once applied, stays on the eyelashes all day.&lt;br /&gt;The bonus also is that it is three products in one. In addition to eyelashes, it also can be used as and eyeliner and on eyebrows. For a person as sensitive to cosmetics as me, it is a great solution.</li>
            <li> Called re: instructions for return as they didn&#x27;t answer me on line via Amazon.  Rep was very rude to me and when I told her that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to give 5 stars as a result all she said was &amp;#34;you&#x27;re free to do so.&amp;#34;  So I did attempt to work with them and they clearly weren&#x27;t interested.</li>
            <li> Old-school mascara is scarce, and most venues charge a premium. This is by far the best price I&#x27;ve found anywhere.</li>
            <li> I love using cake mascara. Now I will wear mascara .. finally. Stays on all day and then some. need to was off with soap and water. There is a slight medium perfume smell that I don&#x27;t love but don&#x27;t hate but it lasts only a short while after application. Make sure to rinse your brush after use or you&#x27;ll get a clumpy application.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the brush at all. When I get a more regular wand, I think I&#x27;ll like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to try cake mascara.  Instructions were simple and it looked great on my lashes.  Non-irritating too.</li>
            <li> This works well with practice.  Most commercial mascaras are way too goopy. Trying to \\&quot;scrub\\&quot;or remove them at night can damage lashes.  This gives just enough definition and seems to last all day under most circumstances.  It comes off with less effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; However this brush is too industrial.  The ones that used to come with the older products were more refined.  I briefly tried one of the little eyeshadow sponges and that might be an option for light application.  Seemed better than the stiffer brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.  I recently went in Big Lots and found a pack of  assorted small cosmetic brushes, eyebrow brush and comb and some short bristled items.  Have used several and find they can work ok, especially the eyebrow brush.  It is similar to the brush which comes with this only a bit smaller and finer.  It is easier to use for more delicate application.  More like the brushes that used to come with this type of cosmetic.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations.  I liked that the mascara did not make my eyes burn.  No problems washing off when ready to remove.</li>
            <li> I had heard about cake mascara but never really gave it much thought. I came across it on Amazon and started to read all the pros and cons and was smitten!! &amp;#34;old lady make-up&amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t think so! This is  Awesome stuff.  I will admit it takes a little practice, but well worth the effort !!  The included brush is somewhat clumsy to use, so practice, practice. If i may pass this along. Moisturize First. Let your creme set. Too much creme on the lids or below, creates that smeared look. i use a Q tip dipped in rose petal powder or plain old cornstarch to &amp;#34;dry up&amp;#34; the eye area before applying the mascara.You do not want a layer of powder visible. Just the faintest amount that clings to the Q tip will suffice.(Tap off the excess) Okay, this will sound strange, but rather than using  an old mascara wand to apply the cake, I discovered that an &amp;#34;abcOralCare sensitive medium &amp;#34;TOOTHBRUSH  works very well. ( I had used too much water on the brush and my lashes were &amp;#34;stringy sparse&amp;#34;  and  for some reason I grabbed my tooth brush to comb it out and said to myself hmmm... this just may work better than their brush lol )The bristles are unique on this brush to begin with and I actually use this more often than the included brush. The long handle  allows you to really get the lashes in the corner without fear of a corneal transplant. Faintly moisten the brush. The effect (at least for me) is really nice thick separated DARK lashes . Dramatic. Worth the effort. Finish off with Fran Wilson Cake eyeliner and you are set to go Girls. Don&#x27;t work for any of these named products, I just feel my money was well spent on quality cosmetics. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The mascara is heavily perfumed with many added ingredients.  I threw the whole thing in the trash</li>
            <li> The brush is huge and impossible to get a thin coat of mascara on.  Also, it makes my lashes clump worse than most mascaras.  Save your money and go with Clinique or Maybelline.</li>
            <li> This mascara is really amazing. No clumps, no flaking, no eye irritation, and very easy to apply. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it wore over time. This is not a &#x27;waterproof&#x27; mascara, but it resisted tearing without smudging or creeping. It felt very light and natural on my lashes while giving a deep black color and buildable thickening.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this and the trick is to finally get the hang of how to use it. Too much water verses too little water etc. I  don&#x27;t  use it all the time but it really is better than most brush ones. Still can clump but sell a fan like brush to break up any clumps. Be careful to look in a good magnifying mirror to then gently remove all the tiny black dots that fall on your face. This can be done with a tiny bit of moisturizer on a pointed Q tip, which also sells on Amazon.Then you&#x27;re good to go. Also blends false lashes with real ones for those with thing eyelashes. Only negative, unless I&#x27;m mistaken, they don&#x27;t sell replacement brushes that comes with it separately.I wash mine gently after several uses but over time it should be replaced which means a whole new kit. Haven&#x27;t checked online for something similar yet. Still needs to be same size though.</li>
            <li> I ordered the mascara as I wear contacts and so far unable to locate any that don&#x27;t affect my contacts.  I was disappointed that this one is ok with the contacts but so difficult to get the mascara to a liquid form to even use.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it, but it had a distinct &amp;#34;old-lady&amp;#34; scent to it.</li>
            <li> This is my alltime favorite mascara. I have been using this for over 15 years and I love it. Does not burn eyes and lasts a long time. Builds up well if you want extra full and long lashes. Classic.</li>
            <li> Tis is the type of mascara I started out with as a young girl.  It is much easier to apply and although it isn&#x27;t waterproof it lasts longer on me than the waterproof expensive stuff.  Plus I can add more and make my lashes much thicker.</li>
            <li> Watch this in the refrigeration unit someone may think i is an edible item...  Great item.. Highly recommend...  Priced well too.</li>
            <li> Cake mascara has NONE of the fillers and filaments common in tube mascara today,  so NO EYE IRRITATION! Cake mascara is more versatile than wand mascara; YOU have control , use a little for a very natural look, or more coats for added thickness.  This is the perfect black. Application is a different skill than wand mascara, so be patient. The results are worth it!</li>
