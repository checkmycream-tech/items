            <li>and I figured I wouldn&#x27;t be too upset if a cheap iron got fried in their circuits</li>
            <li>It does not get very hot, so if you like it hot with steam then this is not your product, but it is good for kids hair since it dont get very hot.</li>

            <li>I received the Moonriver Beauty 1 inch Ceramic Flat Iron at a discounted price for a honest review.</li>
            <li>The temperature was hot enough to work with my fine straight hair and make it seem much fuller, so I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Gets hot too.</li>
            <li>and I love how it is smaller in size than others.  </li>
            <li>First I&#x27;d like to say that this is very convenient for travel!</li>
            <li>It was recommended that a ceramic flat iron would work even better</li>
            <li>Would be a nice gift for a teen or young girl experiencing how to do her hair.</li>
            <li>I have very thick unmanageable frizzy hair and using this with a heat protection hair product worked great.</li>
            <li>There was no burning smell and my hair came out straight</li>
            <li>It works in Ireland, heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I actually like this straightener better than my old one.</li>
            <li>...turns out this thing works better than my more expensive iron.</li>
            <li>and I can go over my hair two times and its straight enough for me.</li>
            <li>This hair straightener is great, it doesn&#x27;t burn or get crazy hot like the  other one.</li>
            <li>It heats up surprisingly fast and gives me soft, straight hair in one stroke (rather than having to run over the hair multiple times like my other iron) and eliminates frizz completely.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It comes with a bag so you can put in while still hot,perfect size to travelling or if you are just like me and just use it once in a while. My hair is short and this comes very handy to make it look awesome in a short amount of time. Nice packaging and easy to use. Can&#x27;t beat that price!</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality for the discounted price I got it for. Comes with a cute and handy carrying case to take along with you. Warms up fast and works fine on my hair. Doesn&#x27;t seem to pull it at all and I can go over my hair two times and its straight enough for me.</li>
            <li> Love this straightener! Excellent price &amp; good quality. Will have to keep this one for myself.</li>
            <li> Love this straightener. Exactly what I wanted. Gets hot too. I actually like this straightener better than my old one. Its my new favorite straightener! Its the perfect size for what i wanted too</li>
            <li> Worked better than a $300. one I tried, which was quite a surprise. Expensive isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
            <li> I got this at a great price in exchange for an honest review. I already have a flat iron but the price  got it for was too good to pass up. and even if anyone bought it for $15 I say its worth it. the feel or material of the iron is better than my $20 one I have.&lt;br /&gt;it comes with a case and I love it. I like the moon and stars on it. I was concerned because there is no temp control and I usually put it on medium because I have thick hair but not course. There was no burning smell and my hair came out straight so im happy. I give it 4 stars because the plates on my iron were not lined perfectly i think because the bar/ handles/ or whatever its called seemed loose or maybe that is just the way it was made. so if yours is like this know its not only your iron and maybe let them know.</li>
            <li> Awful piece of crap doesn&#x27;t heat worth crap wouldn&#x27;t even straighten my hair at all</li>
            <li> It works in Ireland, heats up fast.  All I needed was a plug adaptor and automatically switched voltage from US to Ireland.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I received the great Moonriver Beauty 1 inch Flat Iron Hair product in the mail.  I have been searching for a good flat iron for months. When I opened the package it was it a very nice cover for placing in when not needed.  I like the shape and looks of this iron.  It heated up very nicely and I love how it is smaller in size than others.  It is easy to place your hair in iron and works perfectly for my hair.  I would recommend this product to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and as expected, i do not like that their so no knob to turn up the heat so their is only one heat. It does not get very hot, so if you like it hot with steam then this is not your product, but it is good for kids hair since it dont get very hot.</li>
            <li> I received the Moonriver Beauty 1 inch Ceramic Flat Iron at a discounted price for a honest review. I have been using the same hair straightener for  a while and it was always burning my hair and wasn&#x27;t doing that great of a job. This hair straightener is great, it doesn&#x27;t burn or get crazy hot like the  other one. I have very thick unmanageable frizzy hair and using this with a heat protection hair product worked great.It&#x27;s light and easy to handle! It even comes with a travel back and it&#x27;s great that I can put it right in the bag after use and not have to worry about my young children grabbing it off the bathroom sink. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Good but could be hotter I wouldn&#x27;t recommend t for thick corse hair!</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. First I&#x27;d like to say that this is very convenient for travel! I am not comparing it to my $100 Chi straightener because there&#x27;s a huge difference in quality and price.. But, this serves it&#x27;s purpose well and works great on my side bangs! Would be a nice gift for a teen or young girl experiencing how to do her hair. (Takes about 4 minutes to heat up to it&#x27;s highest temp)</li>
            <li> I bought this as a travel iron because I&#x27;m going out of the country and I figured I wouldn&#x27;t be too upset if a cheap iron got fried in their circuits...turns out this thing works better than my more expensive iron. It heats up surprisingly fast and gives me soft, straight hair in one stroke (rather than having to run over the hair multiple times like my other iron) and eliminates frizz completely. It&#x27;s also super lightweight and the travel pouch it comes with is great. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Did not work for my hair.</li>
            <li> Product says it&#x27;s dual voltage but nowhere on the instructions or the iron itself is there a visible switch.  Also, it&#x27;s quite heavy, so I&#x27;m not going to take it on my trip!  I gave it away (not worth the expense and trouble of returning).</li>
            <li> I have always used a curling iron for creating body for my hair. It was recommended that a ceramic flat iron would work even better so I gave this a try. The temperature was hot enough to work with my fine straight hair and make it seem much fuller, so I&#x27;m quite pleased. Since I travel a lot on business, the handy case made it easy to take along on my last trip, too.</li>
            <li> Works good. Happy with the results when I do my hair. Cant beat the price! I just purchased a second one to give my sister for her birthday!</li>
