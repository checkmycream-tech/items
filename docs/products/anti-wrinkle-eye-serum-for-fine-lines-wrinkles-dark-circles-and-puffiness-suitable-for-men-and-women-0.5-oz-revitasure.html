            <li>For the first three days it was great</li>

            <li>The bottle is a nice pump bottle that makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that their products are made in the USA, that is a very important factor to me, and the fact that this company is against animal testing.</li>

            <li>Love this product for eye wrinkles.</li>
            <li>; in general.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have had many problems with sensitivity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m fairly sure it&#x27;s not for lips,</li>
            <li>Rose hips contain a huge amount of vitamin C</li>

            <li>It actually works so well that my best girl friend has ordered herself some also.</li>
            <li>Made my eyes more puffy in the morningðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li>love the product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing I love about this product is I can read and pronounce all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>that makes my ego feel better about myself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received the Eye Serum for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is gold looking serum perfect for the skin very similar to argan oil</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>They are the perfect prescription for younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>I love that these products have no scent.</li>
            <li>then it would be a lot better.</li>
            <li>so sure it expired.</li>
            <li>I still have 4 more weeks to see 30% more improvement</li>
            <li>I love it and plan on ordering more of it</li>
            <li>I love the immediate firming results I feel that I receive  when I use this serum.</li>
            <li>I truly love this vitamin C eye serum, and can not imagine living without it now.</li>
            <li>So far I am happy in the results that I am seeing from my usage of this product.</li>
            <li>I love this serum, it smells awesome  and feels super smooth in the skin and leave my skin super soft and bright&lt;</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and instantly feels amazing!</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and instantly feels amazing!</li>
            <li>I have used many face serums, but this is the 1st eye serum that I can recall using and excited to try.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Each of my opinions stated about this product, whether the item was self-purchased or provided to me for my review, are honest and completely those of my own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very healthy for your skin and it makes it look so refreshed and silky new!!</li>
            <li>I love rose hips, brings back fond memories of hiking in the Rocky Mountains picking rose hips and making tea and jam.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already seeing my fine lines fading.</li>
            <li>No redness while it minimized lines and fine wrinkles around the eye area.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone that needs help with puffiness and fine lines.</li>
            <li>after using the anti wrinkle cream for 3 days I could see that my fine lines around my eyes lessened.  </li>
            <li>And light</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>B00PYMVPEY Advanced Anti Wrinkle Cream 1 oz With Matrixyl 3000, Shea Butter, Coffee Seed Extract - Advanced Anti Aging Cream For Men &amp; Women -</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve ditched foundation for a light BB cream.  </li>
            <li>Using it for 2 weeks, I feel great, probably still look the same</li>
            <li>This product is very good light weight to put for under eyes and not weight down your skin.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>First let me say, I love that it did not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy.  </li>
            <li>She tried many of these products but this is the first one she loves.</li>
            <li>I never have to top it up from using first thing in morning, and then after cleansing at nighttime.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You just smooth it over your skin, it quickly soaks in like nothing, and you put your moisturizer on over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im sure I would be pleased with this natural product...</li>
            <li>This is important to me because many I&#x27;ve used before pump too much or revolves around all over the place.</li>
            <li>but I do think someone with more sensitive skin could use this product safely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not much for anti-wrinkle, beauty treatment, spend-all-your-money-pretending-to-be-younger products, so I was leery of trying this when I got it at a great discount in exchange for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, &amp;#34;black don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural and are a  wonderful facial product for those of us who are conscientious of safe, all natural, free from chemicals.</li>
            <li>And at such a good price in comparison to others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The Vitamin C Complex has a wonderful pump.</li>
            <li>and it feels cool on my skin, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave any tacky or greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found this Anti Wrinkle eye serum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It got here quickly.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a great item.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C complex anti wrinkle serum for fine lines is so nice,it doesn&#x27;t take much to make your skin feel good!!!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite thing in my beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li>My skin around the eyes feels great and less baggy to me</li>
            <li>I was  unsure at first about this product ,but it lived up to its claims!</li>
            <li>Can not say enough about how amazing this is....</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>The Anti Wrinkle Eye Serum by ReVitaSure is very shear and goes on smooth</li>

            <li>with the ingredients, I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t get better results.</li>
            <li>fresh looking with a side of silkiness...</li>
            <li>Makes a noticeable difference, certainly worth getting.</li>
            <li>,it&#x27;s really worth the price</li>
            <li>It make it easier for me to get the right amount that I need.</li>
            <li>This one pumps the right amount</li>
            <li>and my makeup not settling in my fine lines as normal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to find a skincare that as natural as possible, my skin feels fantastic, so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking at feeling beautiful without a heavy weighted product applied.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking at feeling beautiful without a heavy weighted product applied.</li>
            <li>I will tell you that this is by far the best thing I have used for my dark circles and puffiness by far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue to use it because I&#x27;m really glad to have found a product that actually has made a difference in my skin brightness and texture</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I regularly use Vitamin C serum and love what it does to my skin.</li>
            <li>OK over 60...if I were younger</li>
            <li>I have had so many people tell me that I look 7 to 10 years younger</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a sense of my skin looking younger, but it just feels better</li>
            <li>First, I want to talk about the packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my wrinkles are diminished and my face is more supple and younger feeling.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for a few days, but am so far impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve seen much impact on the wrinkles and fine lines just yet, but it certainly makes my skin feel nice and soft</li>
            <li>I liked the way it soaked into my dry skin and made it feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Thanks you</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>Gently pat under eye and around the eye area.</li>
            <li>I really like how it&#x27;s not a pump.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>This serum is very nourishing...</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really notice any difference at all.  </li>
            <li>My skin takes to t his product really well, its soaks it up so fast after I put it on.</li>
            <li>and i gladly told them about ReVitaSure, and a couple other of their products that I have used.</li>
            <li>The eye serum has a very easy to use pump dispenser, which prevents any waste.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the whole ReVitaSure product line.</li>
            <li>It also appears to be softening and hopefully fading the many acne dark spots and keloid-esque marks from my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have seen a difference I don&#x27;t have the wrinkles or dark circles under my eyes any more.</li>
            <li>The same is true for the pump on the Neo Hydrate Gold Serum.</li>
            <li>Love this product it has taken away all the wrinkles i had under my eyes in less than 1 month.</li>
            <li>The joys of getting older.</li>
            <li>All the concealer goes into those wrinkles and make me look way older than my age.</li>
            <li>The main ingredients are&lt;br /&gt; 1.</li>
            <li>Now that I am getting older</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy it again, because it&#x27;s recommended by several professionals</li>
            <li>It only takes a couple of drops and it goes a long way,so it will last a good while!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Eye Serum has done amazing things to the look and texture of the delicate eye area of my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am able to apply my eye cream after without it feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>People have said that my eyes looked brighter too, a couple of them asked me if I was using something new</li>
            <li>After using the first time at night, the swelling under my eyes was not as noticeable the next morning.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Bought the ReVitaSure products recently as looking to find a pure product, as natural as possible, but also very moisturizing for my skin.</li>
            <li>So far, I like this...</li>
            <li>It did work on eyelids, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>I do not mind growing old.  </li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s no waste.</li>
            <li>The biggest complaint I have though is that it&#x27;s more on the watery side</li>
            <li>Used the entire bottle and did not see much difference.</li>
            <li>and then I give a vigorous shake to the bottle and squeeze a drop of the serum onto my wrist and apply directly to my problem areas, under my eyes with my fingertips.</li>
            <li>It makes the area that I applied to more firm and younger looking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Skeptic that I am, I&#x27;m both excited and flabbergasted at how well this little bottle of stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to apply small amounts.</li>
            <li>I hate to see wrinkles under my eyes which get more prominent after I do makeup.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes for the long term use of this product.  </li>
            <li>The Neo Hydrate Gold Serum, The Vitamin C Complex and the advanced Anti Wrinkle Cream.</li>
            <li>She feels her skin is more firm too after few applies.</li>
            <li>As of right now I&#x27;m starting to see a little difference in how my face looks.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed with the overall results and found that I needed more products to maintain any significant value.</li>
            <li>The fine lines around your eyes make you look tired and sleepy.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have used many face serums, but this is the 1st eye serum that I can recall using and excited to try.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Each of my opinions stated about this product, whether the item was self-purchased or provided to me for my review, are honest and completely those of my own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very healthy for your skin and it makes it look so refreshed and silky new!!</li>
            <li> I love rose hips, brings back fond memories of hiking in the Rocky Mountains picking rose hips and making tea and jam.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already seeing my fine lines fading.</li>
            <li> No redness while it minimized lines and fine wrinkles around the eye area.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that needs help with puffiness and fine lines.</li>
            <li> after using the anti wrinkle cream for 3 days I could see that my fine lines around my eyes lessened.  </li>
            <li> And light</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> B00PYMVPEY Advanced Anti Wrinkle Cream 1 oz With Matrixyl 3000, Shea Butter, Coffee Seed Extract - Advanced Anti Aging Cream For Men &amp; Women -</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve ditched foundation for a light BB cream.  </li>
            <li> Using it for 2 weeks, I feel great, probably still look the same</li>
            <li> This product is very good light weight to put for under eyes and not weight down your skin.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> First let me say, I love that it did not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy.  </li>
            <li> She tried many of these products but this is the first one she loves.</li>
            <li> I never have to top it up from using first thing in morning, and then after cleansing at nighttime.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You just smooth it over your skin, it quickly soaks in like nothing, and you put your moisturizer on over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im sure I would be pleased with this natural product...</li>
            <li> This is important to me because many I&#x27;ve used before pump too much or revolves around all over the place.</li>
            <li> but I do think someone with more sensitive skin could use this product safely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much for anti-wrinkle, beauty treatment, spend-all-your-money-pretending-to-be-younger products, so I was leery of trying this when I got it at a great discount in exchange for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, &amp;#34;black don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural and are a  wonderful facial product for those of us who are conscientious of safe, all natural, free from chemicals.</li>
            <li> And at such a good price in comparison to others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> The Vitamin C Complex has a wonderful pump.</li>
            <li> and it feels cool on my skin, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave any tacky or greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Luckily I found this Anti Wrinkle eye serum.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It got here quickly.</li>

            <li> I use this on my laugh lines and they look like they are fading.</li>
            <li> with the ingredients, I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t get better results.</li>
            <li> fresh looking with a side of silkiness...</li>
            <li> Makes a noticeable difference, certainly worth getting.</li>

            <li> It make it easier for me to get the right amount that I need.</li>
            <li> This one pumps the right amount</li>
            <li> and my makeup not settling in my fine lines as normal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to find a skincare that as natural as possible, my skin feels fantastic, so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking at feeling beautiful without a heavy weighted product applied.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking at feeling beautiful without a heavy weighted product applied.</li>
            <li> I will tell you that this is by far the best thing I have used for my dark circles and puffiness by far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue to use it because I&#x27;m really glad to have found a product that actually has made a difference in my skin brightness and texture</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I regularly use Vitamin C serum and love what it does to my skin.</li>
            <li> OK over 60...if I were younger</li>
            <li> I have had so many people tell me that I look 7 to 10 years younger</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a sense of my skin looking younger, but it just feels better</li>
            <li> First, I want to talk about the packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my wrinkles are diminished and my face is more supple and younger feeling.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days, but am so far impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve seen much impact on the wrinkles and fine lines just yet, but it certainly makes my skin feel nice and soft</li>
            <li> I liked the way it soaked into my dry skin and made it feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Thanks you</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> Gently pat under eye and around the eye area.</li>
            <li> I really like how it&#x27;s not a pump.</li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> This serum is very nourishing...</li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice any difference at all.  </li>
            <li> My skin takes to t his product really well, its soaks it up so fast after I put it on.</li>
            <li> and i gladly told them about ReVitaSure, and a couple other of their products that I have used.</li>
            <li> The eye serum has a very easy to use pump dispenser, which prevents any waste.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the whole ReVitaSure product line.</li>
            <li> It also appears to be softening and hopefully fading the many acne dark spots and keloid-esque marks from my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have seen a difference I don&#x27;t have the wrinkles or dark circles under my eyes any more.</li>
            <li> The same is true for the pump on the Neo Hydrate Gold Serum.</li>
            <li> Love this product it has taken away all the wrinkles i had under my eyes in less than 1 month.</li>
            <li> The joys of getting older.</li>
            <li> All the concealer goes into those wrinkles and make me look way older than my age.</li>
            <li> The main ingredients are&lt;br /&gt; 1.</li>
            <li> Now that I am getting older</li>
            <li> I will most likely buy it again, because it&#x27;s recommended by several professionals</li>
            <li> It only takes a couple of drops and it goes a long way,so it will last a good while!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Eye Serum has done amazing things to the look and texture of the delicate eye area of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am able to apply my eye cream after without it feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin</li>
            <li> People have said that my eyes looked brighter too, a couple of them asked me if I was using something new</li>
            <li> After using the first time at night, the swelling under my eyes was not as noticeable the next morning.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Bought the ReVitaSure products recently as looking to find a pure product, as natural as possible, but also very moisturizing for my skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I like this...</li>
            <li> It did work on eyelids, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> I do not mind growing old.  </li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no waste.</li>
            <li> The biggest complaint I have though is that it&#x27;s more on the watery side</li>
            <li> Used the entire bottle and did not see much difference.</li>
            <li> and then I give a vigorous shake to the bottle and squeeze a drop of the serum onto my wrist and apply directly to my problem areas, under my eyes with my fingertips.</li>
            <li> It makes the area that I applied to more firm and younger looking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Skeptic that I am, I&#x27;m both excited and flabbergasted at how well this little bottle of stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to apply small amounts.</li>
            <li> I hate to see wrinkles under my eyes which get more prominent after I do makeup.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes for the long term use of this product.  </li>
            <li> The Neo Hydrate Gold Serum, The Vitamin C Complex and the advanced Anti Wrinkle Cream.</li>
            <li> She feels her skin is more firm too after few applies.</li>
            <li> As of right now I&#x27;m starting to see a little difference in how my face looks.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the overall results and found that I needed more products to maintain any significant value.</li>
            <li> The fine lines around your eyes make you look tired and sleepy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised to report that this weightless serum gave me no sensitivity, and actually seems to be lightening the dark circles I&#x27;ve had around my eyes my entire life!</li>
            <li> You just apply it under your eyes, it&#x27;s more thick then usual</li>
            <li> This eye serum does absorb into my skin fairy quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue feelings behind like being oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> It feels so nice on, and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell to it either.</li>
            <li> so it it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> but I definitely order it again and would try their other products.  </li>
            <li> Every morning after washing my face and neck, I blot it dry</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know what the long term results will be in regard to dark circles, but I will edit this review in a month or so with updates!</li>
            <li> It only takes a very small amount so the 1.6 ounce bottle will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I did get results, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be oily or greasy, but isn&#x27;t not at all.  </li>
            <li> dark eye circles, scarring, spots, and even flaky dry</li>
            <li> apply a very small amount and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount for each eye.</li>
            <li> but then I notice that I actually want it hard</li>
            <li> Helps reduce dark circles and pu#iness around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> over time the eye serum helps restore connective tissue and helps reduce inflammation and dark circles around the eyes.  </li>

            <li> She use this for few weeks</li>
            <li> It melts in to my skin so easily as no residue.</li>
            <li> In the past few months I&#x27;ve noticed that the circles under my eyes have been getting darker and there are now some crow&#x27;s feet at the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> pump is a little hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s in my head</li>
            <li> so I have a hard time controlling the product.</li>
            <li> but since I got to my late 40&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve had added dryness there, and lines were developing.  </li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, not sticky, and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I dab it under my eyes once in the morning and once at night before going to bed and my eyes are looking less tired, softer ,and brighter!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am really happy with this product! There are so many out there to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;I apply a very small amount and it will last a long time. I massage it around my face before I go to sleep and it feels cool on my skin, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave any tacky or greasy residue. I&#x27;m already seeing my fine lines fading.I&#x27;m going to continue to use it because I&#x27;m really glad to have found a product that actually has made a difference in my skin brightness and texture</li>
            <li> Can not say enough about how amazing this is.... I love it... makes my face feel so much better and is perfect under my daily moisturizers.  It is not oily or greasy.... Great smooth texture to the serum.... I see my crows feet leaving... WHOO HOOO</li>
            <li> I was  unsure at first about this product ,but it lived up to its claims! I dab it under my eyes once in the morning and once at night before going to bed and my eyes are looking less tired, softer ,and brighter! This is a staple in every womens beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Love this product it has taken away all the wrinkles i had under my eyes in less than 1 month. I will keep on buying im amazed with the results. Thanks you</li>
            <li> I really love this product. Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Once I seen that this serum contained rosehips I was just about sold. My oldest daughter has some skin problems and rosehip oil worked wonders on her skin. I was given the opportunity to try this item out at a reduced price if I agreed to write an unbiased and honest review. I agreed. In the past few months I&#x27;ve noticed that the circles under my eyes have been getting darker and there are now some crow&#x27;s feet at the corners of my eyes. The joys of getting older. So I was looking for a product just like this. So far I am happy in the results that I am seeing from my usage of this product. The circles seem lighter and the lines around my eyes are less pronounced. My skin around the eyes feels great and less baggy to me I can definitely say that my skin feels firmer there. People have said that my eyes looked brighter too, a couple of them asked me if I was using something new and i gladly told them about ReVitaSure, and a couple other of their products that I have used. I love the fact that their products are made in the USA, that is a very important factor to me, and the fact that this company is against animal testing. I&#x27;d buy this again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective eye serum I have ever tried. I&#x27;ve been comparing the differences between moisturizers &amp; serums, while both work well, I like the eye serum best. It is a water based formula (not oil) and contains the most potent dose of anti-aging ingredients like Vitamin C and Rosehips which allows me to see better, faster results. I love this serum!</li>
            <li> Love this product for eye wrinkles. I hate to see wrinkles under my eyes which get more prominent after I do makeup. All the concealer goes into those wrinkles and make me look way older than my age. I was desperately looking for something which can help me to reduce these wrinkles. Luckily I found this Anti Wrinkle eye serum. I use it under my eyes before going to bed and within 2-3 weeks I have noticed big difference. This is such an amazing product. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The eye serum is great, the good thing is you don&#x27;t have to press it all the way, pressing it half way gives a generous amount. You just apply it under your eyes, it&#x27;s more thick then usual so it it goes a long way.  I like how it feels on my skin, this is a great product good for any women looking for an eye serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much for anti-wrinkle, beauty treatment, spend-all-your-money-pretending-to-be-younger products, so I was leery of trying this when I got it at a great discount in exchange for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, &amp;#34;black don&#x27;t crack,&amp;#34; in general.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have had many problems with sensitivity. dark eye circles, scarring, spots, and even flaky dry areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised to report that this weightless serum gave me no sensitivity, and actually seems to be lightening the dark circles I&#x27;ve had around my eyes my entire life!

This stuff seems to have put a stop to all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skeptic that I am, I&#x27;m both excited and flabbergasted at how well this little bottle of stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The pump is great for the exact amount you need to dispense. I have used many face serums, but this is the 1st eye serum that I can recall using and excited to try. I know that Vit C is a fantastic Antioxidant and helps with skin lightening and having this specially for my under eye area is great. It is a gel like consistency without being sticky. It melts in to my skin so easily as no residue. I am able to apply my eye cream after without it feeling heavy. As I pause to take a look at my under eye area, I see it smoother and my makeup not settling in my fine lines as normal. I have only been using this for a few days, but am so far impressed. I can&#x27;t wait to see what the future holds.</li>
            <li> Smells like oranges. Awesome. And light</li>
            <li> I regularly use Vitamin C serum and love what it does to my skin. It leaves the skin bright and even tone. This eye serum doesn&#x27;t contain parabens or any other harsh chemicals. Very nice consistency and easy to apply. You don&#x27;t need much. I apply it in the morning after cleansing my face. Gently pat under eye and around the eye area. Gives a refreshed and rested look to the eyes.</li>
            <li> I feel the texture around my eyes improved a little bit. It makes the area that I applied to more firm and younger looking. I really like how it&#x27;s not a pump. It make it easier for me to get the right amount that I need.</li>
            <li> This serum works well for me. It goes on nicely, not sticky, and absorbs well. My makeup applies nicely over.  This serum helps my lesson the depth of my lines and smooths my skin, improves the texture which tends to look a bit crepe like.  Helps alleviate puffiness. I have high hopes for the long term use of this product.  I love rose hips, brings back fond memories of hiking in the Rocky Mountains picking rose hips and making tea and jam.  Rose hips contain a huge amount of vitamin C so I feel I can&#x27;t go wrong with this ingredient. fast shipping</li>
            <li> I use this on my laugh lines and they look like they are fading.</li>
            <li> This serum is very nourishing...it applies nicely around the eye area. The smell is very fresh and clean. There is a noticeable difference in the texture of my skin after application... I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know what the long term results will be in regard to dark circles, but I will edit this review in a month or so with updates! So far, I like this...</li>
            <li> This came through damaged, I saved what I could of the product.. the packaging... was not good.. that why the top broke off this bottle.. I use what as left of the product and its too soon to tell if it works...</li>
            <li> I love this serum!. The serum feels like silk when you put it on and it makes my skin feel like silk. My makeup goes on flawlessly and lasts much longer all day. No need for touch-ups! I will continue to use this product.  I feel it&#x27;s a much better product for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend this product to a friend</li>
            <li> Love this eye serum.  After using the first time at night, the swelling under my eyes was not as noticeable the next morning. I was really pleased to see that happen. It only takes a small amount for each eye. The serum contains vitamin c, rosehips, hyaluronic acid and many additional ingredients that are listed on the bottle and the packaging bottle.  The bottle is a nice pump bottle that makes it easy to apply. There is also a caution section listed with the product information.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love this product! Very easy to apply and instantly feels amazing! I highly recommend this product to anyone looking at feeling beautiful without a heavy weighted product applied. Thank You!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She said she need to find some serum to help reduce her wrinkle eyes. She use this for few weeks and she said she starts feel &amp; see the result. She feels her skin is more firm too after few applies.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible time with dark circles and under eye puffiness. I guess that comes with stress regardless of what age you are. So when the chance arrived for me to buy this and test it out and give my honest unbiased opinion, I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;It got here quickly. It was wrapped and packaged very nicely. I just couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try the next morning. So after my shower I began putting it to the test. First let me say, I love that it did not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy.  It went on smoothly. I will tell you that this is by far the best thing I have used for my dark circles and puffiness by far. It actually works so well that my best girl friend has ordered herself some also. I definitely would recommend this Eye Serum for whatever your need for it may be.</li>
            <li> I would have given it a five star rating but, it oxidized after 4 days.  For the first three days it was great and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I like this! I can see a smoother appearance under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Works well. Didnt feel any irritation.  No redness while it minimized lines and fine wrinkles around the eye area. Easy to apply small amounts.</li>
            <li> This product is superior to the others I have tried! It feels so nice on, and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell to it either. After 2 weeks, I see a difference, not only in the way my skin looks, but the way it feels too. Definitely recommend, i will be reordering it when it runs out!</li>
            <li> Made my eyes more puffy in the morningðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li> with the ingredients, I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t get better results. I did get results, just not what I expected. It did work on eyelids, which surprised me. And did help the lip lines. I was disappointed with the overall results and found that I needed more products to maintain any significant value. However i am over 50...OK over 60...if I were younger Im sure I would be pleased with this natural product...</li>
            <li> I do not mind growing old.  I just do not like the wrinkles and sagging skin you get.  The fine lines around your eyes make you look tired and sleepy.  I was given the opportunity to try this serum and give my honest unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the product features.&lt;br /&gt;  1. Help reduce existing wrinkles and prevents future ones.&lt;br /&gt;  2.  Helps reduce dark circles and pu#iness around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I love about this product is I can read and pronounce all the ingredients. The main ingredients are&lt;br /&gt; 1. Vitamin C Complex&lt;br /&gt;  2. Rose hip oil&lt;br /&gt;  3. Hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a couple of weeks. I can tell that the puffiness has gone down a lot.  The lines are starting to go away.  They are not gone but I can tell a difference.  It only takes a very small amount so the 1.6 ounce bottle will last a very long time.  I would recommend this product to anyone that needs help with puffiness and fine lines.</li>
            <li> This is one great awesome product. I don&#x27;t know what I ever done without it.  I use this twice a day. I wash my face in the morning and put it on and then after my bath at night I put it on again. I have seen a difference I don&#x27;t have the wrinkles or dark circles under my eyes any more. I have had so many people tell me that I look 7 to 10 years younger that makes my ego feel better about myself. I can see a difference in myself also I feel younger myself just by seeing the difference. Thanks for making such a great item.</li>
            <li> This was a b-day gift for my mom. She loves it. She tried many of these products but this is the first one she loves. Great buy!</li>
            <li> after using the anti wrinkle cream for 3 days I could see that my fine lines around my eyes lessened.  I know this is the serum I&#x27;ve been looking for, in no time I know my eyes will look like I&#x27;ve had plastic surgery on them.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C for the eyes, who  knew?  I&#x27;ve been using this at night not just under the eyes, but I&#x27;ve been extending it out to where the fines lines and wrinkles are starting to show and I&#x27;ve been putting it on my eyelids as well.  I&#x27;m really starting to notice a difference in those annoying crow&#x27;s feet.  I expected it to be oily or greasy, but isn&#x27;t not at all.  The Anti Wrinkle Eye Serum by ReVitaSure is very shear and goes on smooth, it&#x27;s almost like my skin was thirsty for it.  I like that over time the eye serum helps restore connective tissue and helps reduce inflammation and dark circles around the eyes.  The eye serum has a very easy to use pump dispenser, which prevents any waste.  A great eye serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received the Eye Serum for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I love this serum, it smells awesome  and feels super smooth in the skin and leave my skin super soft and bright&lt;br /&gt;It is gold looking serum perfect for the skin very similar to argan oil and it leaves my skin feeling awesome&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best serums I have tried, I love it</li>
            <li> ReVitaSure anti wrinkle eyes serum leaves your eyes fresh looking with a side of silkiness... These eyes have been around a while n well this serum Takes the dark out of these circles..</li>
            <li> Bought the ReVitaSure products recently as looking to find a pure product, as natural as possible, but also very moisturizing for my skin. I have been using the ReVitaSure products almost two weeks and I love it.  All three product work really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anti Wrinkle Eye Serum  has Vitamin C, Rosehip, Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00PYNWUME Anti Wrinkle Eye Serum - ReVitaSure]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advanced Anti Wrinkle Cream has With Matrixyl 3000, Shea Butter, Coffee Seed Extract&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00PYMVPEY Advanced Anti Wrinkle Cream 1 oz With Matrixyl 3000, Shea Butter, Coffee Seed Extract - Advanced Anti Aging Cream For Men &amp; Women - ReVitaSure]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ReVitaSure Neo Hydrate Gold has Neodermyl, 24 Gold Dust, Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00PYOD2PW Hyaluronic Acid Serum - ReVitaSure]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s great to find a skincare that as natural as possible, my skin feels fantastic, so soft and supple. I never have to top it up from using first thing in morning, and then after cleansing at nighttime.  I liked the way it soaked into my dry skin and made it feel soft and hydrated. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve seen much impact on the wrinkles and fine lines just yet, but it certainly makes my skin feel nice and soft and I don&#x27;t feel the need to cover it with foundation. It&#x27;s not a sense of my skin looking younger, but it just feels better and I&#x27;ve ditched foundation for a light BB cream.  And at such a good price in comparison to others I have tried.  Love it!  Well done! I received these products at a discount in exchange for my review, but all opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 wonderful products from ReVitaSure. The Neo Hydrate Gold Serum, The Vitamin C Complex and the advanced Anti Wrinkle Cream. They are the perfect prescription for younger looking skin. First, I want to talk about the packaging. The Vitamin C Complex has a wonderful pump. This is important to me because many I&#x27;ve used before pump too much or revolves around all over the place. This one pumps the right amount so there&#x27;s no waste. The same is true for the pump on the Neo Hydrate Gold Serum. The Anti Wrinkle cream comes in a beautiful crystal jar that is pretty to look at on the counter. I love that these products have no scent. I&#x27;ve noticed that my wrinkles are diminished and my face is more supple and younger feeling. I have combination skin and have issues with products that are too greasy. This is not. I have areas where I was starting to get age spots but these products are stopping them in their tracks. I highly recommend the whole ReVitaSure product line.</li>
            <li> Nice texture.  I used to sell cosmetic and I understand what type of texture that you want to put under your eyes.  This product is very good light weight to put for under eyes and not weight down your skin.  A little tips if you use concealer, it is a good idea to mix this lightly with concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump is a little hard but then I notice that I actually want it hard so it won&#x27;t dispense too much of it and get wasted.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice any difference at all.  Have used it since the day I got it.  No noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> My skin takes to t his product really well, its soaks it up so fast after I put it on. This is my new favorite thing in my beauty arsenal. Now that I am getting older I have had problems with dark circles and this product has been combating that problem for me. Makes a noticeable difference, certainly worth getting.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love this product! Very easy to apply and instantly feels amazing! I highly recommend this product to anyone looking at feeling beautiful without a heavy weighted product applied. Thank You!</li>
            <li> Really nice serum.  Using it for 2 weeks, I feel great, probably still look the same but I definitely order it again and would try their other products.  Good value. Good ingredients.</li>
            <li> This eye serum does absorb into my skin fairy quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue feelings behind like being oily or greasy. The biggest complaint I have though is that it&#x27;s more on the watery side so I have a hard time controlling the product. It sort of just runs off my fingertip when I go to use it. It it were a thicker formula then it would be a lot better. I don&#x27;t notice any scents and there is also no irritation to my skin. I have normal skin but I do think someone with more sensitive skin could use this product safely.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Smells great. Easy to apply. Recommended continuous usage of product.</li>
            <li> Used the entire bottle and did not see much difference.</li>
            <li> came with no expiration date, we try it nothing happen so sure it expired.</li>
            <li> As of right now I&#x27;m starting to see a little difference in how my face looks. The hollowness under my eyes and wrinkles seem less noticeable to me. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s in my head but I believe it&#x27;s doing something.</li>
            <li> I received this at little or no cost to review it and this is what I have learned. The Vitamin C complex anti wrinkle serum for fine lines is so nice,it doesn&#x27;t take much to make your skin feel good!!! I have used this on my face and It has helped the dark circles under my eyes,I never thought anything would help with them since I have tried multiple products and nothing has taken away the darkness or the puffiness under my eyes. I still have 4 more weeks to see 30% more improvement and I&#x27;m already seeing great results,I can&#x27;t wait to see in four weeks!!! It&#x27;s very healthy for your skin and it makes it look so refreshed and silky new!! I love it and plan on ordering more of it run this bottle runs out,it&#x27;s really worth the price and this seller is the one to purchase from. It only takes a couple of drops and it goes a long way,so it will last a good while!!&lt;br /&gt;This has Vitamin C,Rosehips and Hyaluronic acid in it. You can also put make up on after you use it,which is also a great plus!! perfect for women and can also be used by men:)</li>
            <li> I have been using the product twice a day since purchased; I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s truly making a difference, since I&#x27;m using in combination with another pricey eye cream.  I will most likely buy it again, because it&#x27;s recommended by several professionals</li>
            <li> Wow! I love this amazing product! This Vitamin  C  Eye Serum has done amazing things to the look and texture of the delicate eye area of my eyes. This product has fefi made a difference in how I have felt about the look and feel of my skin. The tiny wrinkles around my eyes and around my mouth have virtually disappeared! After using this product, I can definitely see and feel the difference one application makes in the morning! I will  continue to use this product around my eyes, to look and feel my best.  Every morning after washing my face and neck, I blot it dry and then I give a vigorous shake to the bottle and squeeze a drop of the serum onto my wrist and apply directly to my problem areas, under my eyes with my fingertips. I love the immediate firming results I feel that I receive  when I use this serum. The ingredients are all natural and are a  wonderful facial product for those of us who are conscientious of safe, all natural, free from chemicals. I truly love this vitamin C eye serum, and can not imagine living without it now. I will definitely be reordering this Vitamin C  serum, for future years to come. I received this item at a discount for reviewing purposes. Each of my opinions stated about this product, whether the item was self-purchased or provided to me for my review, are honest and completely those of my own.</li>
