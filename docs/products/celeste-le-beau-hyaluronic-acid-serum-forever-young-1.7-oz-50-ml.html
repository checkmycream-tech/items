            <li>I tried this product and loved the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>some time now with good results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you&#x27;re a beauty products purist, you need to take a good look at the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>product was supplied by Celeste LeBeau for a fair and impartial review.)</li>
            <li>While some of it is probably advertising hype, there appears to be some good information</li>
            <li>Good cream, worked well.</li>
            <li>serum contains aloe, witch hazel, Vitamins E, C, A, and D3, all of which are good for your skin.</li>
            <li>It feels good, anyway.</li>

            <li>It has a good amount of ingredients I can&#x27;t even pronounce</li>
            <li>I use a foundation, mineral powder and a bronzer, so there&#x27;s a good layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great product love it.  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is known for it&#x27;s effects on skin, and, to the best of my knowledge, this particular brand of hyaluronic acid serum is the best available.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very nice, light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Well, it sure is sticky!  </li>
            <li>I really love this product!</li>
            <li>it stands, I LOVE this!  </li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m a guy and this works great!  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t recommend it more!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product that reduces fine lines and provides a boost to skin.</li>
            <li>I received a sample for an honest review and my honest opinion is that I love it!  </li>
            <li>really is an amazing anti-aging serum.</li>
            <li>Just another cream - do not believe the amazing effects on your skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product provided to me for testing and for a unbias and honest review.</li>
            <li>The opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>This is not the kind of acid that peels or exfoliates.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many wrinkle cures and women are still diligently smearing collagen on the faces as it if does some good.</li>
            <li>love it, and I&#x27;m delighted to recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a nice product to use.  </li>
            <li>my honest opinion</li>
            <li>It does seem to add moisture on its own, just not a wallop of it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>My opinion is my own &amp; not influenced by the manufacturer or distributor.</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning under make-up and at night to keep my skin nice and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It gives your face a nice glow and healthier look.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>This is a very effective serum, the price is right and it feels good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very effective serum, the price is right and it feels good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price and quick shipping 😊</li>
            <li>Forever Young by Celeste Le Beau is a wonderful beauty serum based on hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and looks good all day.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and looks good all day.</li>
            <li>am not the kind of person who has an elaborate beauty regime.</li>
            <li>This product gives very good results, feels and smells pleasant, makes the skin look smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Taking care of and protecting your skin is one of the most important factors in good skin care.</li>
            <li>Most sound fairly innocuous:  water, hyaluronic acid (of course), aloe, witch hazel, Vitamins E, C, A, and D3, and lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have a very light fragrance but not bothersome at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it does not glide on easily, because it is so sticky, and it does not provide a nice coating underneath my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells very lightly of lavender, which I love.</li>
            <li>but you have to be able to see &amp; breathe.  </li>
            <li>I have had many compliments like:</li>
            <li>Okay, so I thought I would give it a chance anyway:  </li>
            <li>In fact my skin is drier and feels more irritated than it has felt in years.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to apply it to my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>love the way this makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>love the way this makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>This product has lots of ingredients, most of which I have not heard about and ended up going to GOOGLE.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You won&#x27;t find a better moisturizer and &#x27;rejuvenating skin cream&#x27; for the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You won&#x27;t find a better moisturizer and &#x27;rejuvenating skin cream&#x27; for the money.</li>
            <li>At my age, I can&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
            <li>i will be needing more..</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>will buy more.</li>
            <li>I love using it after a shower.</li>
            <li>Using this product will remove the need for a surgical face-lift for most women.</li>
            <li>After I apply it, I feel like I need to add another layer of moisturizer on top.  </li>
            <li>more when this bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and my skin craves it now.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It comes in a very attractive turquoise and white package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are six more ingredients: phenoxyethanol, C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, MSM, potassium sorbate, sodium hydroxide, and L-arginine.  </li>
            <li>As for safely, I found no indications that it is not safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Potassium sorbate is a preservative to prolong shelf life, is considered safe and non-toxic but can be a skin irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate is a form of Vitamin C that has been modified to be fat soluble so that it can penetrate the skin better.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some lotions or creams, the gel dries without an oily or greasy residue, giving your skin a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look and</li>
            <li>Buy it, use it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>sure I&#x27;ll be getting this</li>
            <li>I love the pump it hasn&#x27;t clogged like most products tend to do.  </li>
            <li>In love &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not trying to have the best looking skin ever, I am just looking for something to DEEPLY moisturize my face and make it feel smoother.  </li>
            <li>, I believe this does make my skin look better and feel</li>
            <li>(most days, not all) and most of the time, after use, I see a difference.</li>
            <li>you try this product, be sure to give it some time before giving up.  </li>
            <li>though is that it does make you sunburn easier and faster, so be sure to apply sunscreen if you are going to be outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
            <li>I just love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product - safe, easy to apply, and relatively inexpensive for what you get!</li>

            <li>No miracles, but my skin looks good, it&#x27;s not dry, there&#x27;s no flaking, and after I use it, my skin looks good.  </li>
            <li>It is attractive enough for the dressing table, but I like to keep it in the refrigerator for a refreshing effect after a warm shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;You aren&#x27;t going to get miracles, but you can see a softening of wrinkles and that&#x27;s ;pretty good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited!</li>
            <li>It really soaks into your skin and leaves no residue and has a pleasant</li>
            <li>As we get older, among the many treats we encounter, is a slowdown in the amount of good stuff our body manufactures.  </li>
            <li>I find the serum absorbs rather quickly, but not so quickly that I can&#x27;t get a good even coat before drying.  </li>
            <li>When I spread it on my skin it feels very cool</li>
            <li>This is a great solution for today&#x27;s mature woman.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and yet it felt tighter and more smooth.</li>
            <li>If you see Forever Young below $10, it would be a great time to give it a try.it</li>
            <li>The bottle is of a good size, 1.7 oz, and for the price it is very affordable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves you feeling as if you really have done something good for your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>serum has a nice clean fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger, and it absorbs/dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Well, maybe not anything; but if it was easy to do, I&#x27;d do it.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is easy.</li>
            <li>Makeup glides on easily without being greasy or</li>
            <li>This product greatly diminishes my fine lines and helps my dry areas while making my skin feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li>what fine lines i did have...</li>
            <li>Within minutes the skin dramatically shows a reduction of fine line wrinkles and a brighter, firmer, and healthier face that will surprise and delight users.</li>
            <li>Pore size is reduced, and fine lines are smoothed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid Serums also prevent fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>but it creates a cushion to help plump out the look of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Under my chin is tighter and my neck is less lined (OMG the joy of aging!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product pretty regularly for about 6 months, and while it doesn&#x27;t perform miracles, the serum does an excellent job of moisturizing, and tightening up the skin, leaving it feeling refreshed and softer.  </li>
            <li>Besides it working so quickly!</li>
            <li>quick search turned up some interesting information on hyaluronic acid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that this product is relatively fragrance free, great for use on days when I&#x27;m around friends that can&#x27;t stand strong smells.  </li>

            <li>The pump helps you to use just the perfect amount, which is a small amount!</li>

            <li>What all of this technical talk means is that the ingredients most beneficial to repairing aging skin and preventing the aging process are as concentrated in this easy to apply serum as any product available.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is great at soaking up and hanging onto moisture (it&#x27;s even a component of the contact lens rewetting drops I use, for much the same reason).  </li>

            <li>and it dries on the skin quickly without leaving a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I have not been pleased by any specific serums for a while, and I am very particular, I would not be recommending this so strongly if I didn&#x27;t love</li>
            <li>You need to make your own, the same way you did when you were young and your own collagen was rubbery and supply and stringy</li>
            <li>/&gt;The applicator bottle is nicely designed, and provides good control of how much product is dispensed, which minimizes waste.  </li>
            <li>the fact that the ingredients hang onto so much water within their chemical structures provides relatively quick correction when it comes to fine lines and helps deal with the effects of winter</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely purchase more when i am done with this bottle!</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo1DJHCU2K9K66P]]Forever young is translucent gelatinous serum which has has very light herbal scent.</li>
            <li>I greatly appreciate that the manufacturer provided such a nice full-size product to try, as compare to the typically miniscule samples that the department store counters hand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in laugh lines the first day I used this!</li>
            <li>but my skin is tighter, smoother and feels fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li>That alone makes it worth using.&lt;br</li>
            <li>*Disclaimer: I did receive a complimentary sample of this product to review.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Fairly simple, but effective.  </li>
            <li>L-arginine is a naturally occurring amino acid and seems safe.  </li>
            <li>I like it as well as a primer for makeup on those rare days when I use makeup.</li>
            <li>any rate, definitely worth a try</li>
            <li>any rate, definitely worth a try</li>
            <li>It is the most potent moisturizer because it holds up to 1,000 times its weight in water that results in retaining moisture for longer than any other product out there.</li>
            <li>I like this because It helped right away with the flaky skin in my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>The wind chill right now</li>
            <li>With each pump it will give you the right amount of serum.</li>
            <li>It works well, one pump gives you the right dose for one use.</li>
            <li>I have been using it on the right side of my face and my right hand.</li>
            <li>On the right side of my face</li>
            <li>In her own words, &amp;#34; The first day I used it, I could feel my face tighten up around my eyes and my entire face.</li>
            <li>A bit of background: &#x60;Hyaluronic Acid plays an important role in the normal epidermis.</li>
            <li>all though i do not have a lot of wrinkles very fine lines for a woman in her mid 50&#x27;s this</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and was concerned it would be to strong</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non drying and reduces fine lines and makes your skin feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>just a little dab and your good to go.</li>
            <li>My skin was much smoother after the first application!</li>
            <li>You can also stop them from getting worse, which is very good.</li>
            <li>If this works on my tough old skin, I can&#x27;t imagine why it won&#x27;t be great for others with much more tender skin.</li>
            <li>Finally I have a product which is just right for my older, thinning, fair and sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first night I tried it, I could feel a cooling, tingling sensation on my face.</li>
            <li>The next morning I could feel more smoothness in my face</li>
            <li>It is real sticky!  </li>
            <li>Just be aware that this is NOT undiluted hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>After a week of daily use, the difference is stunning.  </li>
            <li>My only surprise is that it doesn&#x27;t cost a LOT more than it does.  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is a constituent of most facial cosmetic creams, lotions and potions.</li>
            <li>It does tighten my facial skin and does give it a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>Not quite sure what to say at this point without sounding like a commercial</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I bought this on sale the first bottle was discounted for $15</li>
            <li>In the first place, there are 15 of them and that&#x27;s something that might warrant a heads-up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The most noticeable effect for me is that my skin texture is smoother overall.</li>
            <li>Even just after the first use, I thought I noticed the difference in the appearance of this aging skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many ingredients in this product &amp; some seem to be not entirely necessary.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks consistently twice a day</li>
            <li>It just looks so smooth, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I will say that whether its psychological or not, I do feel like my skin looks better after having used this product.  </li>
            <li>It balanced my skin to exactly where I like it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed after consistent use</li>
            <li>Since I still occasionally break out, I love that its lightweight and moisturizes without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>At my age, I can&#x27;t ask for much more.one pump gives you the right dose for one use.</li>
            <li>Goes on clean and clear.</li>
            <li>No promise was made or implied for a positive review.</li>
            <li>So I will continue to use it because I think it&#x27;s having a positive effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, I didn&#x27;t use it for a long period of time</li>
            <li>It took several pumps to prime the pump before first use but once it was primed it began working smoothly and consistently.</li>
            <li>At first I feared it would be sticky, but within minutes the gel was gone and my skin felt much MUCH smoother.  </li>
            <li>I liked the feel of the lightweight gel and was astonished that a small amount went very far and was absorbed into my skin extremely quickly.  </li>
            <li>LeBeau Forever Young serum is a very nice addition to my daily facial routine.</li>
            <li>After a week, I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For extremely dry skin, this Celeste Le Beau serum should be used in conjunction with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It does have pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum at the Highest Concentration (1.5%).</li>
            <li>Smart thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smart thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried a large number of skin treatments, while none of them are miracles that restore the youthful skin</li>
            <li>The nice looking container has an easy to use pump that spills just the right amount of silky liquid, a small amount that is enough to cover the face surface.</li>
            <li>and I have to say, not only did I strongly dislike the texture and smell of this product, it also did absolutely nothing for my skin that I could notice.</li>
            <li>It absorbs readily into the skin unlike lower quality serums that dry almost like a mask on top of the face.</li>
            <li>It has not removed my deep wrinkles, but has smoothed out the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I do feel a little tightening of my skin right away, but I notice more of an effect in the morning -- fine lines are definitely reduced.  </li>
            <li>It is slightly sticky the first minute or so and has a very light fragrance that also disappears within minutes.</li>
            <li>so much-</li>
            <li>IT REALLY</li>
            <li>thanks</li>

            <li>Not just for women, everyone who wants smoother, glowing skin can benefit from this acid.  </li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to be sent a full-size of this product for testing, in exchange for a review on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product, but</li>
            <li>I have found this Luxury Hyaluronic acid serum&#x27;s to be very effective.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I bought this serum for my mother and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to feel and look younger.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really feel that this product helps reduce wrinkles and smooths my skin.</li>
            <li>I start by gently exfoliating as I wash, then I apply the serum, then a moisturizer.</li>

            <li>I have noticed that when I tan, my skin tends to age, and this really helps prevent that aging that tanning does to your skin.  </li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>When I was asked to try the [[ASIN:B00GUTLC0C Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Celeste Le Beau]], I was overly willing because there are so many beauty products out there that I have tried that have let me down, I was hopeful this product would work out well.  </li>
            <li>Forever Young hyaluronic acid serum from Celeste Le Beau smells clean and natural, with a fragrance primarily of aloe vera and witch hazel with a hint of lavender essential oil.  </li>
            <li>Which serum you ultimately choose is going to depend on the particular benefits of that serum, so first let me summarize what I think are the unique aspects of this particular product.  </li>
            <li>So I have tried many products over the years (including peels, masks and other types of serums) etc.</li>
            <li>Naturally, I first applied this in a small area first to make sure I wasn&#x27;t allergic.</li>
            <li>This Celeste LeBeau product is comparable or perhaps even better than the Cosmedica serum as far as refining pores, temporarily smoothing out wrinkles and, just in general, making your skin look soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in fact, I noticed a little problem in the eye area, so now I&#x27;m more vigilante about applying eye cream first and not getting to close to that area.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a non greasy formula that does not clog pores or cause break-outs (which I am prone to) and it&#x27;s a great size where a little product goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I apply it to a clean face and only use it at night.  </li>
            <li>Before receiving the sample I warned that I write honest reviews be they positive or negative.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the product goes a long way, as one 1.7 ounce bottle, lasted me over six months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my tried and true Regenerist by Olay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pump a small amount into your hand and smooth it on your clean face.  </li>
            <li>It is not sticky at all and a little bit covers my whole face and neck :)</li>
            <li>One pump of the serum was able to cover over half my face.</li>
            <li>It is considered to be safe at 1% or less concentration levels.  </li>
            <li>this product has made my skin more even with less wrinkles and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works well on crow&#x27;s feet smile lines and on the upper lip for smokers.</li>
            <li>I can most definitely see and feel a difference by morning, when my skin is definitely smoother and plumper.</li>
            <li>I waited to submit a review until I felt like I could give realistic input.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At age 49 - those are very desirable effects! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am picky about skin products and this has definitely gone into my</li>
            <li>Overall my face just looks better after using this product and I plan to continue to use it on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many others, much more expensive that didn&#x27;t work as well as this.  </li>
            <li>It can be linked to skin, eye and respiratory irritation and hormone disruption at high levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In high concentrations it can produce irritation of skin and eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming this ECB classification refers to high levels of concentration, not the level in Forever</li>
            <li>This is a high quality, luxury product without the \\&quot;luxury price tag\\&quot; .</li>
            <li>For what this costs, I feel it should be a little more moisturizing (</li>
            <li>I use my Hyaluronic Acid Serum on a clean dry face.</li>
            <li>I just apply it on clean, dry skin in the mornings.</li>
            <li>It is considered safe as long as benzene present as a constituent is at 0.5% limit.  </li>
            <li>but my skin is firm and smooth!</li>
            <li>After several weeks of consistent use, I can say in my experience this product has been very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am now using the special Puff tissues with lotion because the insides of my nostrils are so dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li>I like the product and use it under my daily acne lotion, but the pump doesn&#x27;t always work right</li>
            <li>In a week there is a noticeable difference between the right and left.</li>
            <li>I love this Forever Young hyaluronic serum it gives my skin a tight lift that&#x27;s why I keep on ordering it</li>
            <li>I have dry patches of skin above my eyebrows and they began looking better after several days on consistent use.</li>

            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new serum, and this one is, as stated, a  \\&quot;premium moisturizing serum\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I get compliments on my skin fairy often (mostly due to a healthy diet and a positive attitude), yet I was beginning to notice my skin was looking a bit porous and dry.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to look younger without much effort at all.  </li>
            <li>Le Beau&#x27;s report, \\&quot;Secrets to Glowing Skin\\&quot; is very informative and explains that hyaluronic acid is a vital, natural component of the skin.</li>

            <li>/&gt;For those with sensitive skin or allergies, the ingredients listed on the packaging are as follows:</li>
            <li>If you are 20 years old, you should start using it now.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I tried some on my hands &amp; saw a change take place while I was watching.</li>

            <li>I had to google them to figure out why they were included since neither the bottle of Forever Young, the box it came in, or the company website clarified it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Celeste Le Beau&#x27;s Forever Young hyaluronic acid serum is a gel type product that is supposed to help preserve your skin, and reduce the signs of aging.  </li>

            <li>So far I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles, but of course I don&#x27;t like the ones I see.</li>
            <li>a delight that it is not too harsh for sensitive skin like mine.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to feel its benefits instantly.</li>
            <li>&gt;✔ Avoid direct contact with eyes&lt;</li>
            <li>Forever Young falls into that category.</li>
            <li>and I see a modest improvement in the problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One pump of the dispenser is all it takes for complete coverage of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One pump of the dispenser is all it takes for complete coverage of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t hesitate to try Forever Young because it felt greaseless on my fingertips.</li>
            <li>I had no trouble with any reaction or redness.</li>
            <li>Mostly natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It provides an excellent base for your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I noticed that not only did my pores look smaller and healthier but my fine lines around my eyes were not nearly as noticeable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky, slick and glides on easily.</li>
            <li>far as placing it on my entire face, I&#x27;ve found it does tighten a bit (under the eyes particularly), but I can feel it on my face for about 20 minutes before that sense goes away.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;within 10 minutes of a no mess application, my face looked&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maintaining the extracellular space and providing an open, as well as hydrated, structure for the passage of nutrients are the main functions of HA in epidermis.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I WOULD consider purchasing this (due to the effect it has on the inner layers of skin); however, the price would need to be significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>However, there are perhaps too many ingredients here, some of them duplicating the use of others (e.g., phenoxyethanol and potassium sorbate both functioning as preservatives), and others are perhaps in such small quantities per application that their benefits to your skin might be</li>
            <li>It did exactly what is was supposed to; tightened up the wrinkles and left me with younger feeling and looking skin.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and leaves your skin firmed but not too tight.  </li>
            <li>Nothing but filler, botox or invasive procedures are going to get rid of the real grooves, but if you go to work early enough and are diligent, you can have skin that looks years younger than it should.</li>
            <li>My dry skin has really healed quite a bit and it helps after shaving.</li>
            <li>main problem, IMO, would be for users with sensitive skin, since several of the above ingredients can be skin irritants.  </li>
            <li>It dried quickly and immediately I can feel my skin tightening.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I know the word \\&quot;acid\\&quot; is a word which can seem disturbing, but this product is mindfully made of a natural acid your own body produces.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that a little bit goes a long way so this bottle will last for awhile.</li>
            <li>and my face is very soft and actually glows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It serves as an integral part of the extracellular matrix of basal keratinocytes, which are major constituents of the epidermis; its free-radical scavenging function and its role in keratinocyte proliferation and migration.</li>
            <li>first off its extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first hyaluronic acid serum I have tried so I cannot compare it to other brands.</li>
            <li>With just one use, those little laugh lines lessened.  </li>
            <li>some help dry skin and slight smoothing of light wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product on the back of my hands &amp; was surprised to see the change in appearance...almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>I found the scent barely noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharid found naturally in the human body.</li>
            <li>My skin is a combination, but I spread the gel all over, paying particular attention to the dry areas.  </li>
            <li>I expected this product to be much the same as others but have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I use it not only on the more sensitive areas of the face but also on my elbows and other delicate spots and it is completely non-irritating even on the driest skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One thing that I like about the serum is that it has a slight warming sensation when applied which makes you feel like it&#x27;s really doing something!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scientifically, I&#x27;m not exactly sure what Forever Young may be doing, but I firmly believe that my skin feels better, and seems healthier.  </li>
            <li>It not only helps cushion and lubricate joints, but is also a major component of skin tissue.</li>
            <li>HA is a substance that occurs naturally in the human body and has several medical applications including cataract surgery and as an injectable temporary wrinkle filler.</li>
            <li>and there is no difference than the first few days.</li>
            <li>And there hasn&#x27;t been much improvement to the slight bags below my eyes.  </li>
            <li>skin is VERY sensitive; I have to be careful to test a product.  </li>

            <li> I tried this product and loved the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> some time now with good results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you&#x27;re a beauty products purist, you need to take a good look at the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> product was supplied by Celeste LeBeau for a fair and impartial review.)</li>
            <li> While some of it is probably advertising hype, there appears to be some good information</li>
            <li> Good cream, worked well.</li>
            <li> serum contains aloe, witch hazel, Vitamins E, C, A, and D3, all of which are good for your skin.</li>
            <li> It feels good, anyway.</li>
            <li> If those are benefits you are looking for, then this is a good serum to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has a good amount of ingredients I can&#x27;t even pronounce</li>
            <li> I use a foundation, mineral powder and a bronzer, so there&#x27;s a good layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great product love it.  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is known for it&#x27;s effects on skin, and, to the best of my knowledge, this particular brand of hyaluronic acid serum is the best available.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very nice, light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Well, it sure is sticky!  </li>
            <li> I really love this product!</li>
            <li> it stands, I LOVE this!  </li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a guy and this works great!  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t recommend it more!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product that reduces fine lines and provides a boost to skin.</li>
            <li> I received a sample for an honest review and my honest opinion is that I love it!  </li>
            <li> really is an amazing anti-aging serum.</li>
            <li> Just another cream - do not believe the amazing effects on your skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product provided to me for testing and for a unbias and honest review.</li>
            <li> The opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This is not the kind of acid that peels or exfoliates.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many wrinkle cures and women are still diligently smearing collagen on the faces as it if does some good.</li>
            <li> love it, and I&#x27;m delighted to recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a nice product to use.  </li>
            <li> my honest opinion</li>
            <li> It does seem to add moisture on its own, just not a wallop of it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> My opinion is my own &amp; not influenced by the manufacturer or distributor.</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning under make-up and at night to keep my skin nice and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It gives your face a nice glow and healthier look.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> This is a very effective serum, the price is right and it feels good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very effective serum, the price is right and it feels good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Forever Young by Celeste Le Beau is a wonderful beauty serum based on hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and looks good all day.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and looks good all day.</li>
            <li> am not the kind of person who has an elaborate beauty regime.</li>
            <li> This product gives very good results, feels and smells pleasant, makes the skin look smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Taking care of and protecting your skin is one of the most important factors in good skin care.</li>
            <li> Most sound fairly innocuous:  water, hyaluronic acid (of course), aloe, witch hazel, Vitamins E, C, A, and D3, and lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a very light fragrance but not bothersome at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it does not glide on easily, because it is so sticky, and it does not provide a nice coating underneath my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells very lightly of lavender, which I love.</li>
            <li> but you have to be able to see &amp; breathe.  </li>
            <li> I have had many compliments like:</li>
            <li> Okay, so I thought I would give it a chance anyway:  </li>
            <li> In fact my skin is drier and feels more irritated than it has felt in years.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to apply it to my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> love the way this makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> love the way this makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> This product has lots of ingredients, most of which I have not heard about and ended up going to GOOGLE.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You won&#x27;t find a better moisturizer and &#x27;rejuvenating skin cream&#x27; for the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You won&#x27;t find a better moisturizer and &#x27;rejuvenating skin cream&#x27; for the money.</li>
            <li> At my age, I can&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
            <li> i will be needing more..</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> will buy more.</li>
            <li> I love using it after a shower.</li>
            <li> Using this product will remove the need for a surgical face-lift for most women.</li>
            <li> After I apply it, I feel like I need to add another layer of moisturizer on top.  </li>
            <li> more when this bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and my skin craves it now.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It comes in a very attractive turquoise and white package.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are six more ingredients: phenoxyethanol, C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, MSM, potassium sorbate, sodium hydroxide, and L-arginine.  </li>
            <li> As for safely, I found no indications that it is not safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Potassium sorbate is a preservative to prolong shelf life, is considered safe and non-toxic but can be a skin irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate is a form of Vitamin C that has been modified to be fat soluble so that it can penetrate the skin better.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some lotions or creams, the gel dries without an oily or greasy residue, giving your skin a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look and</li>
            <li> Buy it, use it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> sure I&#x27;ll be getting this</li>
            <li> I love the pump it hasn&#x27;t clogged like most products tend to do.  </li>
            <li> In love &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love the way it leaves my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not trying to have the best looking skin ever, I am just looking for something to DEEPLY moisturize my face and make it feel smoother.  </li>
            <li> , I believe this does make my skin look better and feel</li>
            <li> (most days, not all) and most of the time, after use, I see a difference.</li>
            <li> you try this product, be sure to give it some time before giving up.  </li>
            <li> though is that it does make you sunburn easier and faster, so be sure to apply sunscreen if you are going to be outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent product - safe, easy to apply, and relatively inexpensive for what you get!</li>

            <li> No miracles, but my skin looks good, it&#x27;s not dry, there&#x27;s no flaking, and after I use it, my skin looks good.  </li>
            <li> It is attractive enough for the dressing table, but I like to keep it in the refrigerator for a refreshing effect after a warm shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;You aren&#x27;t going to get miracles, but you can see a softening of wrinkles and that&#x27;s ;pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited!</li>
            <li> It really soaks into your skin and leaves no residue and has a pleasant</li>
            <li> As we get older, among the many treats we encounter, is a slowdown in the amount of good stuff our body manufactures.  </li>
            <li> I find the serum absorbs rather quickly, but not so quickly that I can&#x27;t get a good even coat before drying.  </li>
            <li> When I spread it on my skin it feels very cool</li>
            <li> This is a great solution for today&#x27;s mature woman.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and yet it felt tighter and more smooth.</li>
            <li> If you see Forever Young below $10, it would be a great time to give it a try.it</li>
            <li> The bottle is of a good size, 1.7 oz, and for the price it is very affordable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves you feeling as if you really have done something good for your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> serum has a nice clean fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger, and it absorbs/dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Well, maybe not anything; but if it was easy to do, I&#x27;d do it.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is easy.</li>
            <li> Makeup glides on easily without being greasy or</li>
            <li> This product greatly diminishes my fine lines and helps my dry areas while making my skin feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li> what fine lines i did have...</li>
            <li> Within minutes the skin dramatically shows a reduction of fine line wrinkles and a brighter, firmer, and healthier face that will surprise and delight users.</li>
            <li> Pore size is reduced, and fine lines are smoothed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serums also prevent fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> but it creates a cushion to help plump out the look of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Under my chin is tighter and my neck is less lined (OMG the joy of aging!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product pretty regularly for about 6 months, and while it doesn&#x27;t perform miracles, the serum does an excellent job of moisturizing, and tightening up the skin, leaving it feeling refreshed and softer.  </li>
            <li> Besides it working so quickly!</li>
            <li> quick search turned up some interesting information on hyaluronic acid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that this product is relatively fragrance free, great for use on days when I&#x27;m around friends that can&#x27;t stand strong smells.  </li>

            <li> So far, it hasn&#x27;t been proven that HA is effective in reducing wrinkles when applied topically, but it is a very effective humectant (meaning it attracts and holds moisture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or you can spend the same amount on this entry from Forever Young and get some excellent skin care.  </li>

            <li> are usually full of ingredients</li>
            <li> The pump helps you to use just the perfect amount, which is a small amount!</li>

            <li> What all of this technical talk means is that the ingredients most beneficial to repairing aging skin and preventing the aging process are as concentrated in this easy to apply serum as any product available.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is great at soaking up and hanging onto moisture (it&#x27;s even a component of the contact lens rewetting drops I use, for much the same reason).  </li>

            <li> /&gt;The applicator bottle is nicely designed, and provides good control of how much product is dispensed, which minimizes waste.  </li>
            <li> the fact that the ingredients hang onto so much water within their chemical structures provides relatively quick correction when it comes to fine lines and helps deal with the effects of winter</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely purchase more when i am done with this bottle!</li>

            <li> but my skin is tighter, smoother and feels fresh and moisturized.</li>

            <li> *Disclaimer: I did receive a complimentary sample of this product to review.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Fairly simple, but effective.  </li>
            <li> L-arginine is a naturally occurring amino acid and seems safe.  </li>
            <li> I like it as well as a primer for makeup on those rare days when I use makeup.</li>
            <li> any rate, definitely worth a try</li>
            <li> any rate, definitely worth a try</li>
            <li> It is the most potent moisturizer because it holds up to 1,000 times its weight in water that results in retaining moisture for longer than any other product out there.</li>
            <li> I like this because It helped right away with the flaky skin in my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> The wind chill right now</li>
            <li> With each pump it will give you the right amount of serum.</li>
            <li> It works well, one pump gives you the right dose for one use.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on the right side of my face and my right hand.</li>
            <li> On the right side of my face</li>
            <li> In her own words, &amp;#34; The first day I used it, I could feel my face tighten up around my eyes and my entire face.</li>
            <li> A bit of background: &#x60;Hyaluronic Acid plays an important role in the normal epidermis.</li>
            <li> all though i do not have a lot of wrinkles very fine lines for a woman in her mid 50&#x27;s this</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was concerned it would be to strong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non drying and reduces fine lines and makes your skin feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> just a little dab and your good to go.</li>
            <li> My skin was much smoother after the first application!</li>
            <li> You can also stop them from getting worse, which is very good.</li>
            <li> If this works on my tough old skin, I can&#x27;t imagine why it won&#x27;t be great for others with much more tender skin.</li>
            <li> Finally I have a product which is just right for my older, thinning, fair and sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first night I tried it, I could feel a cooling, tingling sensation on my face.</li>
            <li> The next morning I could feel more smoothness in my face</li>
            <li> It is real sticky!  </li>
            <li> Just be aware that this is NOT undiluted hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> After a week of daily use, the difference is stunning.  </li>
            <li> My only surprise is that it doesn&#x27;t cost a LOT more than it does.  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is a constituent of most facial cosmetic creams, lotions and potions.</li>
            <li> It does tighten my facial skin and does give it a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li> Not quite sure what to say at this point without sounding like a commercial</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale the first bottle was discounted for $15</li>
            <li> In the first place, there are 15 of them and that&#x27;s something that might warrant a heads-up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The most noticeable effect for me is that my skin texture is smoother overall.</li>
            <li> Even just after the first use, I thought I noticed the difference in the appearance of this aging skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many ingredients in this product &amp; some seem to be not entirely necessary.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks consistently twice a day</li>
            <li> It just looks so smooth, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I will say that whether its psychological or not, I do feel like my skin looks better after having used this product.  </li>
            <li> It balanced my skin to exactly where I like it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed after consistent use</li>
            <li> Since I still occasionally break out, I love that its lightweight and moisturizes without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> At my age, I can&#x27;t ask for much more.one pump gives you the right dose for one use.</li>
            <li> Goes on clean and clear.</li>
            <li> No promise was made or implied for a positive review.</li>
            <li> So I will continue to use it because I think it&#x27;s having a positive effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, I didn&#x27;t use it for a long period of time</li>
            <li> It took several pumps to prime the pump before first use but once it was primed it began working smoothly and consistently.</li>
            <li> At first I feared it would be sticky, but within minutes the gel was gone and my skin felt much MUCH smoother.  </li>
            <li> I liked the feel of the lightweight gel and was astonished that a small amount went very far and was absorbed into my skin extremely quickly.  </li>
            <li> LeBeau Forever Young serum is a very nice addition to my daily facial routine.</li>
            <li> After a week, I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For extremely dry skin, this Celeste Le Beau serum should be used in conjunction with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It does have pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum at the Highest Concentration (1.5%).</li>
            <li> Smart thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smart thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried a large number of skin treatments, while none of them are miracles that restore the youthful skin</li>
            <li> The nice looking container has an easy to use pump that spills just the right amount of silky liquid, a small amount that is enough to cover the face surface.</li>
            <li> and I have to say, not only did I strongly dislike the texture and smell of this product, it also did absolutely nothing for my skin that I could notice.</li>
            <li> It absorbs readily into the skin unlike lower quality serums that dry almost like a mask on top of the face.</li>
            <li> It has not removed my deep wrinkles, but has smoothed out the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I do feel a little tightening of my skin right away, but I notice more of an effect in the morning -- fine lines are definitely reduced.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly sticky the first minute or so and has a very light fragrance that also disappears within minutes.</li>
            <li> so much-</li>
            <li> IT REALLY</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t care much for lotions and creams,(other than sunscreen) but have found over the years that I have some sun damage.</li>
            <li> Not just for women, everyone who wants smoother, glowing skin can benefit from this acid.  </li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to be sent a full-size of this product for testing, in exchange for a review on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product, but</li>
            <li> I have found this Luxury Hyaluronic acid serum&#x27;s to be very effective.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I bought this serum for my mother and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to feel and look younger.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really feel that this product helps reduce wrinkles and smooths my skin.</li>
            <li> I start by gently exfoliating as I wash, then I apply the serum, then a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This suits my fast paced life while leaving me feeling pampered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It restores tone and makes my skin on my neck and face very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have noticed that when I tan, my skin tends to age, and this really helps prevent that aging that tanning does to your skin.  </li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> When I was asked to try the [[ASIN:B00GUTLC0C Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Celeste Le Beau]], I was overly willing because there are so many beauty products out there that I have tried that have let me down, I was hopeful this product would work out well.  </li>
            <li> Forever Young hyaluronic acid serum from Celeste Le Beau smells clean and natural, with a fragrance primarily of aloe vera and witch hazel with a hint of lavender essential oil.  </li>
            <li> Which serum you ultimately choose is going to depend on the particular benefits of that serum, so first let me summarize what I think are the unique aspects of this particular product.  </li>
            <li> So I have tried many products over the years (including peels, masks and other types of serums) etc.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I first applied this in a small area first to make sure I wasn&#x27;t allergic.</li>
            <li> This Celeste LeBeau product is comparable or perhaps even better than the Cosmedica serum as far as refining pores, temporarily smoothing out wrinkles and, just in general, making your skin look soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in fact, I noticed a little problem in the eye area, so now I&#x27;m more vigilante about applying eye cream first and not getting to close to that area.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a non greasy formula that does not clog pores or cause break-outs (which I am prone to) and it&#x27;s a great size where a little product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I apply it to a clean face and only use it at night.  </li>
            <li> Before receiving the sample I warned that I write honest reviews be they positive or negative.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the product goes a long way, as one 1.7 ounce bottle, lasted me over six months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my tried and true Regenerist by Olay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pump a small amount into your hand and smooth it on your clean face.  </li>
            <li> It is not sticky at all and a little bit covers my whole face and neck :)</li>
            <li> One pump of the serum was able to cover over half my face.</li>
            <li> It is considered to be safe at 1% or less concentration levels.  </li>
            <li> this product has made my skin more even with less wrinkles and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works well on crow&#x27;s feet smile lines and on the upper lip for smokers.</li>
            <li> I can most definitely see and feel a difference by morning, when my skin is definitely smoother and plumper.</li>
            <li> I waited to submit a review until I felt like I could give realistic input.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At age 49 - those are very desirable effects! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am picky about skin products and this has definitely gone into my</li>
            <li> Overall my face just looks better after using this product and I plan to continue to use it on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many others, much more expensive that didn&#x27;t work as well as this.  </li>
            <li> It can be linked to skin, eye and respiratory irritation and hormone disruption at high levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In high concentrations it can produce irritation of skin and eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming this ECB classification refers to high levels of concentration, not the level in Forever</li>
            <li> This is a high quality, luxury product without the \\&quot;luxury price tag\\&quot; .</li>
            <li> For what this costs, I feel it should be a little more moisturizing (</li>
            <li> I use my Hyaluronic Acid Serum on a clean dry face.</li>
            <li> I just apply it on clean, dry skin in the mornings.</li>
            <li> It is considered safe as long as benzene present as a constituent is at 0.5% limit.  </li>
            <li> but my skin is firm and smooth!</li>
            <li> After several weeks of consistent use, I can say in my experience this product has been very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am now using the special Puff tissues with lotion because the insides of my nostrils are so dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li> I like the product and use it under my daily acne lotion, but the pump doesn&#x27;t always work right</li>
            <li> In a week there is a noticeable difference between the right and left.</li>
            <li> I love this Forever Young hyaluronic serum it gives my skin a tight lift that&#x27;s why I keep on ordering it</li>
            <li> I have dry patches of skin above my eyebrows and they began looking better after several days on consistent use.</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new serum, and this one is, as stated, a  \\&quot;premium moisturizing serum\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I get compliments on my skin fairy often (mostly due to a healthy diet and a positive attitude), yet I was beginning to notice my skin was looking a bit porous and dry.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to look younger without much effort at all.  </li>
            <li> Le Beau&#x27;s report, \\&quot;Secrets to Glowing Skin\\&quot; is very informative and explains that hyaluronic acid is a vital, natural component of the skin.</li>
            <li> have used HA products on my skin in the past and I love the way they feel.</li>
            <li> i have almost used up the first bottle i hope it stays at the $29.95 price when i start on my second bottle</li>
            <li> Some like the ROC products totally irritated my sensitive skin, some are ok and just a few really show benefits.</li>

            <li> My usual routine is to cleanse at night and moisturize, and then a gentle cleanse in the morning and a light moisturizer under my make up.</li>

            <li> Since I started following the directions (go figure), the results are positive.</li>

            <li> /&gt;For those with sensitive skin or allergies, the ingredients listed on the packaging are as follows:</li>
            <li> If you are 20 years old, you should start using it now.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I tried some on my hands &amp; saw a change take place while I was watching.</li>
            <li> One thing that one me over was the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin, so I always approach products like this with caution.</li>

            <li> I had to google them to figure out why they were included since neither the bottle of Forever Young, the box it came in, or the company website clarified it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Celeste Le Beau&#x27;s Forever Young hyaluronic acid serum is a gel type product that is supposed to help preserve your skin, and reduce the signs of aging.  </li>
            <li> far, Forever Young has no effect on moles or age spots.  </li>

            <li> In the time I have been using it, I have seen Forever Young range from $40 to $8 per bottle.  </li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles, but of course I don&#x27;t like the ones I see.</li>
            <li> a delight that it is not too harsh for sensitive skin like mine.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to feel its benefits instantly.</li>
            <li> &gt;✔ Avoid direct contact with eyes&lt;</li>
            <li> Forever Young falls into that category.</li>
            <li> and I see a modest improvement in the problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One pump of the dispenser is all it takes for complete coverage of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One pump of the dispenser is all it takes for complete coverage of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hesitate to try Forever Young because it felt greaseless on my fingertips.</li>
            <li> I had no trouble with any reaction or redness.</li>
            <li> Mostly natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It provides an excellent base for your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I noticed that not only did my pores look smaller and healthier but my fine lines around my eyes were not nearly as noticeable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky, slick and glides on easily.</li>
            <li> far as placing it on my entire face, I&#x27;ve found it does tighten a bit (under the eyes particularly), but I can feel it on my face for about 20 minutes before that sense goes away.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;within 10 minutes of a no mess application, my face looked&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maintaining the extracellular space and providing an open, as well as hydrated, structure for the passage of nutrients are the main functions of HA in epidermis.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I WOULD consider purchasing this (due to the effect it has on the inner layers of skin); however, the price would need to be significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> However, there are perhaps too many ingredients here, some of them duplicating the use of others (e.g., phenoxyethanol and potassium sorbate both functioning as preservatives), and others are perhaps in such small quantities per application that their benefits to your skin might be</li>
            <li> It did exactly what is was supposed to; tightened up the wrinkles and left me with younger feeling and looking skin.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and leaves your skin firmed but not too tight.  </li>
            <li> Nothing but filler, botox or invasive procedures are going to get rid of the real grooves, but if you go to work early enough and are diligent, you can have skin that looks years younger than it should.</li>
            <li> My dry skin has really healed quite a bit and it helps after shaving.</li>
            <li> main problem, IMO, would be for users with sensitive skin, since several of the above ingredients can be skin irritants.  </li>
            <li> It dried quickly and immediately I can feel my skin tightening.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I know the word \\&quot;acid\\&quot; is a word which can seem disturbing, but this product is mindfully made of a natural acid your own body produces.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that a little bit goes a long way so this bottle will last for awhile.</li>
            <li> and my face is very soft and actually glows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It serves as an integral part of the extracellular matrix of basal keratinocytes, which are major constituents of the epidermis; its free-radical scavenging function and its role in keratinocyte proliferation and migration.</li>
            <li> first off its extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first hyaluronic acid serum I have tried so I cannot compare it to other brands.</li>
            <li> With just one use, those little laugh lines lessened.  </li>
            <li> some help dry skin and slight smoothing of light wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product on the back of my hands &amp; was surprised to see the change in appearance...almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> I found the scent barely noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharid found naturally in the human body.</li>
            <li> My skin is a combination, but I spread the gel all over, paying particular attention to the dry areas.  </li>
            <li> I expected this product to be much the same as others but have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I use it not only on the more sensitive areas of the face but also on my elbows and other delicate spots and it is completely non-irritating even on the driest skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing that I like about the serum is that it has a slight warming sensation when applied which makes you feel like it&#x27;s really doing something!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scientifically, I&#x27;m not exactly sure what Forever Young may be doing, but I firmly believe that my skin feels better, and seems healthier.  </li>
            <li> It not only helps cushion and lubricate joints, but is also a major component of skin tissue.</li>
            <li> HA is a substance that occurs naturally in the human body and has several medical applications including cataract surgery and as an injectable temporary wrinkle filler.</li>
            <li> and there is no difference than the first few days.</li>
            <li> And there hasn&#x27;t been much improvement to the slight bags below my eyes.  </li>
            <li> skin is VERY sensitive; I have to be careful to test a product.  </li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly and seems to make things look a little smoother and less puffy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, isolate that active hyaluronic acid in a serum that is 100% pure and see what a difference this product has over other creams etc that only include the HA.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of any positive results I might achieve because I have lived much of my life outside and my facial skin shows it.  </li>
            <li> And I can definitely see clear, glowing skin and a slight plumping of my wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At night I follow the same ritual, I cleanse my face thoroughly, apply the hyaluronic acid serum, allow to dry and then apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> At night I follow the same ritual, I cleanse my face thoroughly, apply the hyaluronic acid serum, allow to dry and then apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I notice that my skin flushes slightly when I first apply it, but the effect fades in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Which also means that this 1.7 ounce bottle will last a long time!!</li>
            <li> HA also has crucial functions in the reepithelization process due to several of its properties.</li>
            <li> It took less than a minute for the serum to dry completely</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really judge the wrinkle reducing claims of this because those things are so hard to judge.  </li>
            <li> Since I was in my early twenties, I have had very rough sandpaper type of skin and very dry skin!</li>
            <li> so can not comment on the long term yet.</li>
            <li> The bottle is 4.25\\&quot; long and the cap is 1.75\\&quot; long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ingredient list is a bit too long.</li>
            <li> (I may now try a few other brands, but the benchmark it set high after using this one.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend this to all and especially to those who have dry and rough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try several different serums lately, and I actually like all of them for different reasons.  </li>
            <li> and my face was dry to the touch.</li>
            <li> Because it is gel based, it makes your skin feel dry even though its supposed to be a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer, I can get dry spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to hyaluronic acid since I have used [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I have tried several facial products that promise younger looking skin, and although some may provide minor benefits, they usually just are not worth it in the long run.  </li>
            <li> Normally, my cheeks get dry and flaky, but they haven&#x27;t lately.  </li>
            <li> serum also has some vitamin C and vitamin E, so it will have a little antioxidant activity, though these are a little later in the ingredients list and so present in smaller amounts.  </li>
            <li> generally apply two pumps of the serum around my face, a few days a week.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft while making my face look tighter so my small wrinkles are minimized.  </li>
            <li> Although my neck is still not great, the turkey skin look has diminished, and I think my chest skin looks much smoother!</li>
            <li> The serum itself is clear and absorbs into your skin almost instantly with absolutely no greasy feel left behind.</li>
            <li> I Was a bit skeptical at first because I have tried a bunch of creams and even Nutraceuticals from Dr. Perricone which were double the cost of this product...  </li>
            <li> After it dries, you will notice a slight tightening of your skin, which gives the appearance of younger, firmer skin.</li>
            <li> I like that the pump gives just a small drop at a time, since I only need a couple of drops for my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> My pores look smaller and my face looks and feels less greasy.  </li>
            <li> I had a friend with very dry skin use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited about my neck and chest area too, which were crepey and pretty awful.</li>
            <li> And BTW, apply a little to the backs of your hands for an instantly younger look.</li>
            <li> I might just be destined to grow old, but at least I&#x27;m fighting it all the way.</li>
            <li> did some web searching before giving this a try and found that while this hyaluronic acid is beneficial for some things, there is absolutely no proof it works on the face.</li>
            <li> I use this serum in the evenings after I cleanse my face, then facial moisturizer after the serum has dried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have seen it fluctuate widely, let&#x27;s talk about cost.  </li>
            <li> Not what was expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month and it has done wonders for my dry skin and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that after applying it to my face, it leaves somewhat of a dry and plasticky texture to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I used this Hyaluronic Acid Serum for less than 1 week before my face reacted negatively (redness &amp; sensitive).  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve applied it and not finished with a moisturizer, my face feels slightly tight and dry.</li>
            <li> Maybe--in combination with all the other ingredients in the bottle--it might help prevent the skin from &amp;#34;looking&amp;#34; its age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope.  </li>
            <li> Well, maybe it is not the fountain of youth, but it comes as close to that as any other product of this type on the market.</li>
            <li> This has a cool sensation when putting it on and it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy or dirty.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think he knows that it is due to this....</li>
            <li> Directions, ingredients, warnings and other information are imprinted on the package.</li>
            <li> The pump gives a small droplet of serum and is enough to cover your face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not read the directions so at first I didn&#x27;t moisten my face before putting the serum on.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers that this serum works well.  </li>
            <li> I usually use two pumps to cover my face and neck so this bottle will last</li>
            <li> A few rough brown spots and some very dry skin.</li>
            <li> My dry patches on my nose have virtually disappeared, the little wrinkles around my eyes definitely are less pronounced and the little bumps that i had under my eyes are virtually gone!</li>
            <li> You can spend $40 at the supermarket for some mass-produced night serum with traces of the active ingredients.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient - hyaluronic acid - works as a humectant, an antioxidant, and it stimulates the production of collagen.</li>
            <li> I have wrinkles, yes, but less than other woman my age.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  After a week, I decided to put this aside until after I&#x27;m done with my theatrical work, because wearing makeup seems to be hard on my eyes, and this product increased the problem of wrinkles in the eye area, even though I don&#x27;t use it anywhere around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I do plan to go back to this, but again, I&#x27;m concerned about the effect on the delicate eye tissue.  </li>
            <li> But all I need to know is that all these ingredients work together to help slow down my skin&#x27;s aging process, while improving my skin&#x27;s appearance at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Replenishing the skin with hyaluronic acid slows down the aging process.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if the ingredient list were to be pared down, the skin sensitivity issue would go away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> using it, it can dry a little stiff</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dry, apply makeup as usual.</li>
            <li> It has a watery/gel-like feel to it and a slight smell of alcohol.</li>
            <li> It has a translucent milky color and is slightly viscous.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve aged, now in my mid 60&#x27;s, the skin on my hands has taken on a thin, wrinkly appearance.</li>
            <li> It was less moisturizing feeling</li>
            <li> my forehead is less lined, and the lines around my mouth are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The product is slightly sticky on my face and applying fingers for about 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and wrinkles + pores are less pronounced.</li>
            <li> I also used the serum to treat under the eyes and I see a slight improvement in puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you have very dry skin, then I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;ll like this product.  </li>
            <li> bottle has a pump dispenser and a lid that fits tightly</li>
            <li> The little critters are born with skin that is loaded with the stuff.  </li>
            <li> It plumps out the skin, and does, in fact, help reduce the appearance of wrinkles a little.</li>
            <li> but I feel that it delivers so little.</li>
            <li> so I apply a little moisturizer over</li>
            <li> Does not feel like it firms like other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> It does leave my skin feeling tight after a it dries (a few seconds)</li>
            <li> Within just a few minutes my face has a rosy glow.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked for me, just wasted money!&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I gave it a go for a few weeks to see what the hoopla was about.  </li>
            <li> If it can do that with just one application can you imagine if I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever broken open an aloe vera leaf to apply the liquid to a burn, you know how this serum feels.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid is the stuff that makes baby skin so fat and fluffy.</li>
            <li> everyday he says your face is Glowing</li>
            <li> sixty three and have been struggling with my skin for a few months after a weight loss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it  for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> this absorbs easily- no oily residue.  </li>
            <li> No it is not the same as a cosmetic procedure with radio frequency, laser of CO2, but it is much less expensive and even if you are having periodic skin resurfacing, in between treatments with this HA serum will heighten the effects of your procedure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive moisturizers, Aloe Vera and even stopped shaving for several days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my husband has been telling me your face is glowing again he has been telling me this for the past month...</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no magic to this hyaluronic acid serum, it does what it promises.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no magic to this hyaluronic acid serum, it does what it promises.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a wonderful serum-I have tons of facial creams,etc. in my closet.  I like this because It helped right away with the flaky skin in my eyebrows.  Yes in my eyebrows-dandruff? who knows.  It&#x27;s a thing only I notice but it has me checking my eyebrows all of the time.  The wind chill right now is like 30 degrees below zero &amp; I wrap up good when I go out but you have to be able to see &amp; breathe.  And why I should be concerned about my eyebrows when There are wrinkles just calling my name! Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> great product love it.  just a little dab and your good to go.</li>
            <li> This serum feels great, makes your skin left soft with a healthy glow. I ordered one for my mom after liking mine so much- she enjoys it as well. Great price and quick shipping 😊</li>
            <li> I like the product and use it under my daily acne lotion, but the pump doesn&#x27;t always work right</li>
            <li> I use my Hyaluronic Acid Serum on a clean dry face. The serum has an airless pump that always gives me just the correct amount of serum. A small amount goes a long way. Within just a few minutes my face has a rosy glow. This serum doesn’t sting. There is no discomfort at all. That’s because there is no alcohol or SLS’s. Nothing that will clog my pores or cause any irritation. My face just looks BRIGHT!!!&lt;br /&gt;This really is an amazing anti-aging serum. I noticed a difference in laugh lines the first day I used this! The pump helps you to use just the perfect amount, which is a small amount! Which also means that this 1.7 ounce bottle will last a long time!! Also a bonus for me is that the airless pump extends the life of the serum. SWEET!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this 100 stars if I could!!</li>
            <li> Since I was in my early twenties, I have had very rough sandpaper type of skin and very dry skin! So I have tried many products over the years (including peels, masks and other types of serums) etc. Nothing worked for me, just wasted money!&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried this product. The first night I tried it, I could feel a cooling, tingling sensation on my face. The next morning I could feel more smoothness in my face and it did not feel like sandpaper anymore!&lt;br /&gt;So now I use it twice a day, morning and evening and my face is very soft and actually glows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***And I have had many compliments like: You look different today, I like it. Or You look great today!&lt;br /&gt;This product has been the best I have ever used and I am so excited to say goodbye to Ms Sandpaper and hello to Ms Baby Soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this to all and especially to those who have dry and rough skin.&lt;br /&gt;In three words: IT REALLY WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided to me for testing and for a unbias and honest review.</li>
            <li> Woks within seconds. Goes on clean and clear. My skin feels amazing! And I would never go through a morning without it!</li>
            <li> I love this Forever Young hyaluronic serum it gives my skin a tight lift that&#x27;s why I keep on ordering it thanks</li>
            <li> I Was a bit skeptical at first because I have tried a bunch of creams and even Nutraceuticals from Dr. Perricone which were double the cost of this product...  but after using this HA Serum I could tell within a week the skin on my face had changed drastically. I noticed that not only did my pores look smaller and healthier but my fine lines around my eyes were not nearly as noticeable. Besides it working so quickly! I appreciate finding a &amp;#34;CLEAN&amp;#34; product with all natural organic herbs that on there own I have read are very beneficial topically.  No Messy or Greasy Residue you can put it on and instantly go about your business. I would highly recommend this product !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I gave it a go for a few weeks to see what the hoopla was about.  I still don&#x27;t understand the hoopla....  I&#x27;m going back to my tried and true Regenerist by Olay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some web searching before giving this a try and found that while this hyaluronic acid is beneficial for some things, there is absolutely no proof it works on the face. On one website I read it has been touted as somewhat of a &amp;#34;fountain of youth.&amp;#34;  Okay, so I thought I would give it a chance anyway:  Maybe--in combination with all the other ingredients in the bottle--it might help prevent the skin from &amp;#34;looking&amp;#34; its age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope.  In fact my skin is drier and feels more irritated than it has felt in years.  I am now using the special Puff tissues with lotion because the insides of my nostrils are so dry and irritated.  (No, I did not apply this stuff inside my nose!  What did I do?  Breath it in?  Spread it from the rest of my face?  And I live in humid south Texas!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are two things I read--right on this product page--that give me pause:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The product page claims &amp;#34;Undiluted&amp;#34;....  Really?  How does one claim &amp;#34;undiluted&amp;#34; when the number one and biggest ingredient in this stuff is deionized (purified) water?  And only 1.5% of what&#x27;s in the bottle is actually hyaluronic acid?&lt;br /&gt;--It also claims it is not sticky.  Well, it sure is sticky!  It is real sticky!  It is so sticky that one regulated squirt from the bottle will not spread over my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I could give this product a one- or two-star rating, but who is to say it is just my skin type.  It might work perfectly for you.  Just be aware that this is NOT undiluted hyaluronic acid.  It is 1.5% hyaluronic acid.  And it does not glide on easily, because it is so sticky, and it does not provide a nice coating underneath my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Celeste Le Beau.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week now and I have to say that I can notice a difference. My dry patches on my nose have virtually disappeared, the little wrinkles around my eyes definitely are less pronounced and the little bumps that i had under my eyes are virtually gone! It is not sticky at all and a little bit covers my whole face and neck :) It does have a very light fragrance but not bothersome at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase more when i am done with this bottle!</li>
            <li> This is the best anti-aging serum I&#x27;ve ever used.  With just one use, those little laugh lines lessened.  After a week of daily use, the difference is stunning.  It&#x27;s nicely packaged, and easy to deal with - a clear, non-greasy gel that absorbs very quickly.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to look younger without much effort at all.  My only surprise is that it doesn&#x27;t cost a LOT more than it does.  Try it!</li>
            <li> Well, maybe it is not the fountain of youth, but it comes as close to that as any other product of this type on the market. Hyaluronic acid is a constituent of most facial cosmetic creams, lotions and potions. A bit of background: &#x60;Hyaluronic Acid plays an important role in the normal epidermis. HA also has crucial functions in the reepithelization process due to several of its properties. It serves as an integral part of the extracellular matrix of basal keratinocytes, which are major constituents of the epidermis; its free-radical scavenging function and its role in keratinocyte proliferation and migration. In normal skin, HA is found in relative high concentrations in the basal layer of the epidermis where proliferating keratinocytes are found. CD44 is collocated with HA in the basal layer of epidermis where additionally it has been shown to be preferentially expressed on plasma membrane facing the HA-rich matrix pouches. Maintaining the extracellular space and providing an open, as well as hydrated, structure for the passage of nutrients are the main functions of HA in epidermis. HA content increases at the presence of retinoic acid (vitamin A). The proposed effects of retinoic acid against skin photo-damage and aging may be correlated, at least in part, with an increase of skin HA content, giving rise to increase of tissue hydration.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, isolate that active hyaluronic acid in a serum that is 100% pure and see what a difference this product has over other creams etc that only include the HA. The serum contains organic herbs and vitamins  - Aloe Vera, MSM, Vitamin E, Vitamin D, Vitamin A, Vitamin C and Lavender Oil - all of which enhance the presence of HA. What all of this technical talk means is that the ingredients most beneficial to repairing aging skin and preventing the aging process are as concentrated in this easy to apply serum as any product available. It really works well on crow&#x27;s feet smile lines and on the upper lip for smokers. No it is not the same as a cosmetic procedure with radio frequency, laser of CO2, but it is much less expensive and even if you are having periodic skin resurfacing, in between treatments with this HA serum will heighten the effects of your procedure. This is an excellent product - safe, easy to apply, and relatively inexpensive for what you get!

            <li> I was a bit skeptical of any positive results I might achieve because I have lived much of my life outside and my facial skin shows it.  I have been applying this after I shower for a week now, and the product does as advertised.  It does tighten my facial skin and does give it a more youthful appearance.  If this works on my tough old skin, I can&#x27;t imagine why it won&#x27;t be great for others with much more tender skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle has a hassle-free airless pump that extends the life of the serum. With each pump it will give you the right amount of serum. The serum is clear. It has a watery/gel-like feel to it and a slight smell of alcohol. A little goes a long way. One pump of the serum was able to cover over half my face. 2 pumps and I was able to apply it to my face and neck. It is not oily at all. When I applied the serum to my face and neck it felt like water. It dried quickly and immediately I can feel my skin tightening. That is not a joke. I could FEEL my skin tightening. It took less than a minute for the serum to dry completely and my face was dry to the touch. My skin felt smoother and tighter. It is the most potent moisturizer because it holds up to 1,000 times its weight in water that results in retaining moisture for longer than any other product out there. Not quite sure what to say at this point without sounding like a commercial but this serum gives you immediate results. No kidding. Okay so it doesn’t make my skin flawless with one application but my skin is tighter, smoother and feels fresh and moisturized. I can’t really say that about the current moisturizer I use. For the price it is selling at now I should stock up! If it can do that with just one application can you imagine if I use it everyday. I may actually begin to like my face again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I was provided this product free of charge in return for my review. The opinions are my own. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This has a cool sensation when putting it on and it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy or dirty. Feels great after a wash and a day out in the sun.</li>
            <li> Forever Young hyaluronic acid serum from Celeste Le Beau smells clean and natural, with a fragrance primarily of aloe vera and witch hazel with a hint of lavender essential oil.  It has a translucent milky color and is slightly viscous.  When massaged into the skin, it leaves it feeling silky and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula contains several different ingredients that plump and moisturize the skin and improve the appearance of fine wrinkles when used regularly over time.  It should be applied after bathing or washing the face for best effect.  I use it not only on the more sensitive areas of the face but also on my elbows and other delicate spots and it is completely non-irritating even on the driest skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The generous 1.7 oz. bottle has a pump dispenser and a lid that fits tightly so it won’t come off when travelling.  It is attractive enough for the dressing table, but I like to keep it in the refrigerator for a refreshing effect after a warm shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided by Celeste Le Beau for testing and evaluation.</li>
            <li> Forever Young by Celeste Le Beau is a wonderful beauty serum based on hyaluronic acid. HA is a substance that occurs naturally in the human body and has several medical applications including cataract surgery and as an injectable temporary wrinkle filler. So far, it hasn&#x27;t been proven that HA is effective in reducing wrinkles when applied topically, but it is a very effective humectant (meaning it attracts and holds moisture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a very attractive, air pump bottle which dispenses a small amount of the serum at a time. (I find that two pumps cover my face and neck perfectly.) The serum itself is clear and absorbs into your skin almost instantly with absolutely no greasy feel left behind. This bottle contains 2 oz. of serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with sensitive skin or allergies, the ingredients listed on the packaging are as follows: Deionized Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aloe Barbadensis Juice, Phenoxyethanol, Witch Hazel Extract, Acrylates/C 10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, MSM, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Lavender Oil, L-Arginine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholecalciferol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used HA products on my skin in the past and I love the way they feel. If you&#x27;ve ever broken open an aloe vera leaf to apply the liquid to a burn, you know how this serum feels. It&#x27;s silky, slick and glides on easily. (There IS aloe in this serum.) It smells very lightly of lavender, which I love. After it dries, you will notice a slight tightening of your skin, which gives the appearance of younger, firmer skin. It provides an excellent base for your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, clean your face and then splash with cool water and pat with towel til face is just barely dry, then smooth on two pumps of Forever Young and work it into the skin. Once it&#x27;s dry, apply makeup as usual. This serum will help your face retain moisture all day and keep your skin looking plumper and hydrated. And BTW, apply a little to the backs of your hands for an instantly younger look. It smooths and plumps even the thin skin on your hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way this makes my skin feel and I will keep using it because the price is within my budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was provided a sample of this product by the manufacturer for review. No promise was made or implied for a positive review.to the backs of your hands for an instantly younger look.

            <li> This product has lots of ingredients, most of which I have not heard about and ended up going to GOOGLE. It does have pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum at the Highest Concentration (1.5%). It is slightly sticky the first minute or so and has a very light fragrance that also disappears within minutes. That I am grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care much for lotions and creams,(other than sunscreen) but have found over the years that I have some sun damage. A few rough brown spots and some very dry skin. I&#x27;m not so concerned about aging, but there is one spot on my side cheek that gets scraped badly every time I shave, so I always have a reddish discoloration. I&#x27;ve tried expensive moisturizers, Aloe Vera and even stopped shaving for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this product for only three days, I have noticed immense relief. The bumpiness seems to have dissipated somewhat and my skin seems to be healing. I have been placing it on in the morning and at night. That alone makes it worth using.&lt;br /&gt;As far as placing it on my entire face, I&#x27;ve found it does tighten a bit (under the eyes particularly), but I can feel it on my face for about 20 minutes before that sense goes away. I&#x27;ll update this in about two weeks to see if this lasts or improves the condition. Product supplied for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (two weeks later): I found that the &#x27;tightening&#x27; is about the same and there is no difference than the first few days. My dry skin has really healed quite a bit and it helps after shaving.</li>
            <li> You can spend $40 at the supermarket for some mass-produced night serum with traces of the active ingredients. Or you can spend the same amount on this entry from Forever Young and get some excellent skin care.  You can see from the label the ratio of ingredients and this one seems to formulate correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get confused by the word &#x27;acid.&#x27;  This is not the kind of acid that peels or exfoliates. It&#x27;s much more gentle. Hyaluronic Acid is the stuff that makes baby skin so fat and fluffy. The little critters are born with skin that is loaded with the stuff.  As we get older, among the many treats we encounter, is a slowdown in the amount of good stuff our body manufactures.  Hence, wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many wrinkle cures and women are still diligently smearing collagen on the faces as it if does some good. It doesn&#x27;t. Collagen is the stuff that bonds your skin to your body. You can&#x27;t put on some poor cows ground up collagen and expect any benefits. You need to make your own, the same way you did when you were young and your own collagen was rubbery and supply and stringy so your skin had life and didn&#x27;t form those ugly little quilts.  Hyaluronic Acid helps a tiny bit.  It plumps out the skin, and does, in fact, help reduce the appearance of wrinkles a little. Nothing but filler, botox or invasive procedures are going to get rid of the real grooves, but if you go to work early enough and are diligent, you can have skin that looks years younger than it should. (It also helps to have good genes, so next time you pick out parents, check their faces carefully.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You aren&#x27;t going to get miracles, but you can see a softening of wrinkles and that&#x27;s ;pretty good. You can also stop them from getting worse, which is very good. Hyaluronic Acid is good for all skin types. If you are 20 years old, you should start using it now. Don&#x27;t wait for damage to show up and fight a battle of attrition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump also deserves mention. It works well, one pump gives you the right dose for one use. You don&#x27;t have to dip your hands into the product and smear in a bunch of bacteria. Smart thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t find a better moisturizer and &#x27;rejuvenating skin cream&#x27; for the money. Five stars.  I was give the product for evaluation by the manufacturer. The product arrived on February 14th and I have used it every day since them and my review is based on two months use. No miracles, but my skin looks good, it&#x27;s not dry, there&#x27;s no flaking, and after I use it, my skin looks good.  At my age, I can&#x27;t ask for much more.one pump gives you the right dose for one use. You don&#x27;t have to dip your hands into the product and smear in a bunch of bacteria.

            <li> Great product. You can feel it worki n</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month and it has done wonders for my dry skin and dark circles.  The scent is deliciously fresh and not too strong.  I love using it after a shower. It dries quickly and leaves your skin firmed but not too tight.  I&#x27;ve been using about 2 pumps per day and have noticed the dark circles around my eyes significantly decreasing as the days go by.&lt;br /&gt;Loving this product.  A must try!</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a premium moisturizing face liquid that makes the face glow and reduces signs of aging. The nice looking container has an easy to use pump that spills just the right amount of silky liquid, a small amount that is enough to cover the face surface. Within minutes the skin dramatically shows a reduction of fine line wrinkles and a brighter, firmer, and healthier face that will surprise and delight users. This is a great solution for today&#x27;s mature woman. Using this product will remove the need for a surgical face-lift for most women.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is known for it&#x27;s effects on skin, and, to the best of my knowledge, this particular brand of hyaluronic acid serum is the best available.  Pump a small amount into your hand and smooth it on your clean face.  If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ll see significant improvement in the quality of your skin in a couple of weeks.  Pore size is reduced, and fine lines are smoothed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, and I&#x27;m delighted to recommend it to others.  Not just for women, everyone who wants smoother, glowing skin can benefit from this acid.  Give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five Stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B00GUTLC0C #1 Luxury Hyaluronic Acid Serum - 100% Pure, Undiluted &amp; No Fillers - Ultimate Skin Rejuvenator &amp; Moisturizer HA Serum - Best Anti Wrinkle Serum with Vitamin C]] for a couple weeks now and have seen an improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance. I was surprised when I tried some on my hands &amp; saw a change take place while I was watching. As I&#x27;ve aged, now in my mid 60&#x27;s, the skin on my hands has taken on a thin, wrinkly appearance. I decided to try this product on the back of my hands &amp; was surprised to see the change in appearance...almost immediately.  A lot of the wrinkles disappeared. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, my hands are still wrinkly...but about 50% less so than before. I&#x27;m also using this on my neck &amp; decolletage. This product has improved my skin&#x27;s appearance wherever I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick search turned up some interesting information on hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;~ It increases hydration&lt;br /&gt;~ Improves elasticity&lt;br /&gt;~ Reverses free radical damage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celeste Le Beau&#x27;s report, \\&quot;Secrets to Glowing Skin\\&quot; is very informative and explains that hyaluronic acid is a vital, natural component of the skin. It is produced by the fibroblast skin cells which produce collagen; collagen is what gives the skin the firmness and health. Replenishing the skin with hyaluronic acid slows down the aging process.  This serum also contains Vitamin E, Vitamin D, Vitamin A and Vitamin C, MSM along with Lavender oil, and Aloe Vera. The merits of these ingredients are discussed in the report. But all I need to know is that all these ingredients work together to help slow down my skin&#x27;s aging process, while improving my skin&#x27;s appearance at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though you&#x27;re using Forever Young hyaluronic acid serum, it&#x27;s important to keep up a good skin care regime. I use this serum in the evenings after I cleanse my face, then facial moisturizer after the serum has dried. In the mornings I use moisturizer. Once a month or so I exfoliate my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review sample providedmy face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review sample provided</li>
            <li> *Disclaimer: I did receive a complimentary sample of this product to review.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so sorry but I just hated it. I used it several times, at different times during the day and after shower or before bed and everything in between and I have to say, not only did I strongly dislike the texture and smell of this product, it also did absolutely nothing for my skin that I could notice. Sure, I didn&#x27;t use it for a long period of time but I had to discard it because it just wasn&#x27;t working for me. I wanted to leave my honest review because this product promises so much but I feel that it delivers so little.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to be sent a full-size of this product for testing, in exchange for a review on Amazon.  I greatly appreciate that the manufacturer provided such a nice full-size product to try, as compare to the typically miniscule samples that the department store counters hand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a nice product to use.  I apply it to a clean face and only use it at night.  I can most definitely see and feel a difference by morning, when my skin is definitely smoother and plumper. My only complaint is that after applying it to my face, it leaves somewhat of a dry and plasticky texture to the skin.  It definitely adds moisture to the inner layers of the skin, but I wish it equally moisturized the outer layer as well.  After I apply it, I feel like I need to add another layer of moisturizer on top.  For what this costs, I feel it should be a little more moisturizing (overall).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD consider purchasing this (due to the effect it has on the inner layers of skin); however, the price would need to be significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and loved the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product, but&lt;br /&gt;within 10 minutes of a no mess application, my face looked&lt;br /&gt;and felt firmer and was smooth to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to see immediate results in the reduction of lines&lt;br /&gt;on my face, and thus the 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has made a believer out of me and I will be&lt;br /&gt;purchasing more when this bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my honest opinion, you can&#x27;t go wrong in buying this product.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! I am on a constant search for anti-aging skin remedies. Some like the ROC products totally irritated my sensitive skin, some are ok and just a few really show benefits. This has become an integral part of my skin care regime. I get compliments on my skin fairy often (mostly due to a healthy diet and a positive attitude), yet I was beginning to notice my skin was looking a bit porous and dry. I tried this and could see and feel immediate results. It was less moisturizing feeling and yet it felt tighter and more smooth. I absolutely love it and my skin craves it now. I use an additional light moisturizer on top with a very delicate layer for best results. One thing that one me over was the natural ingredients. Definitely worth a try. You&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Just another cream - do not believe the amazing effects on your skin. Good nutrition, proper sleep, weekly exercise, olive oil,  and no stress do much more for you. The rest is advertisement of cosmetic companies. Save your money.</li>
            <li> this absorbs easily- no oily residue.  have noticed a difference in the way my face feels when I use it.</li>
            <li> This anti-wrinkle serum contains a mix of ingredients shown to improve skin quality: hyaluronic acid (lubricant with possible plumping properties); witch hazel (an astringent to tighten skin), retinyl palmitate (an anti-oxidant), and aloe (to soothe irritated skin). It absorbs readily into the skin unlike lower quality serums that dry almost like a mask on top of the face. While nothing short of plastic surgery can eliminate larger wrinkles, a serum such as this can help improve facial appearance, even when used under a foundation. I could see the effect after only application, although, of course, it&#x27;s only a temporary improvement. After a week, I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For extremely dry skin, this Celeste Le Beau serum should be used in conjunction with a moisturizer. It does seem to add moisture on its own, just not a wallop of it. I use three drops in total to cover my face and neck. You don&#x27;t need a lot since it spreads well. I found the scent barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, so I always approach products like this with caution. In this case, I had no averse reactions. No irritation or redness. Naturally, I first applied this in a small area first to make sure I wasn&#x27;t allergic. While I can&#x27;t say this will be the case with you, those with sensitive skin have a fighting chance with this serum. Note: I received a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharid found naturally in the human body. It not only helps cushion and lubricate joints, but is also a major component of skin tissue. The skin holds almost fifty percent of your body&#x27;s hyaluronic acid in the skin. It is also found in joints connective tissues and eye fluids. Hyaluronic Acid Serums not only plump and moisturizing skin, they also help heal and comfort skin. Hyaluronic Acid Serums also prevent fine lines and wrinkles.  Hyaluronic Acid has anti-irritant, anti inflammatory and hydrating properties.It not only helps skin retain moisture but it creates a cushion to help plump out the look of fine lines and wrinkles. Hyaluronic acid is viscous and gooey but absorbs into the skin without any residue, making it a popupar ingredient in serums, creams and make up products\\&quot;. Dermatology Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using hyaluronic acid serum for 3-4 years. I am a woman of indeterminate age, and I have smooth skin. I have wrinkles, yes, but less than other woman my age. My skin care regime is cleansing skin, applying hyaluronic acid serum, then moisturizer. Fairly simple, but effective.  Taking care of and protecting your skin is one of the most important factors in good skin care. I have found this Luxury Hyaluronic acid serum&#x27;s to be very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Luxury Hyaluronic Acid Serum arrived well packaged. It comes in a very attractive turquoise and white package. Directions, ingredients, warnings and other information are imprinted on the package. The bottle is of a good size, 1.7 oz, and for the price it is very affordable. The bottle is attractive with a silver cover. The pump gives a small droplet of serum and is enough to cover your face. The scent is very nice, light and pleasant. There is a tightening feeling which is probably do to the witch hazel in the product. Allow the serum to dry, and your skin feels very smooth with a nice glow. I use moisturizer, but you don&#x27;t need to, the serum will add moisture and smoothness to your face. I apply the serum drops to my hands after applying to my face, smoothes my hand also. This serum remains all day under my make-up , and there is a glow to my cheeks and forehead. My skin feels smooth and looks good all day. At night I follow the same ritual, I cleanse my face thoroughly, apply the hyaluronic acid serum, allow to dry and then apply moisturizer. My skin feels and looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no magic to this hyaluronic acid serum, it does what it promises. Helps to supply missing moisture, gives smooth skin and a glow.

            <li> Everything the 5- and 4-star reviews say about skin improvement has been true for me also.  I&#x27;m not new to hyaluronic acid since I have used [[ASIN:B0090UJFYI Best-Selling Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin-- 100% Pure-Highest Quality, Anti-Aging Serum-- Intense Hydration + Moisture, Non-greasy, Paraben-free-Best Hyaluronic Acid for Your Face (Pro Formula)]]for some time now with good results.  This Celeste LeBeau product is comparable or perhaps even better than the Cosmedica serum as far as refining pores, temporarily smoothing out wrinkles and, just in general, making your skin look soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re a beauty products purist, you need to take a good look at the ingredients.  In the first place, there are 15 of them and that&#x27;s something that might warrant a heads-up.  Most sound fairly innocuous:  water, hyaluronic acid (of course), aloe, witch hazel, Vitamins E, C, A, and D3, and lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are six more ingredients: phenoxyethanol, C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, MSM, potassium sorbate, sodium hydroxide, and L-arginine.  I had to google them to figure out why they were included since neither the bottle of Forever Young, the box it came in, or the company website clarified it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Phenoxyethanol.  It&#x27;s an aromatic ether alcohol which serves as a preservative to prolong shelf life.  It is considered to be safe at 1% or less concentration levels.  It can be linked to skin, eye and respiratory irritation and hormone disruption at high levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Acrylate/C10-30 acryl acrylate crosspolymer serves as a thickener.  It is considered safe as long as benzene present as a constituent is at 0.5% limit.  This acrylate is linked to contact dermatitis, skin irritation, asthma and rhinitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) MSM is methylsulfonylmethane and is used topically for scar tissue, stretch marks and wrinkles.  As for safely, I found no indications that it is not safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Potassium sorbate is a preservative to prolong shelf life, is considered safe and non-toxic but can be a skin irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Sodium hydroxide is also known as \\&quot;caustic soda\\&quot; or \\&quot;lye\\&quot;.  In high concentrations it can produce irritation of skin and eyes.  It is a common ingredient in soaps and bath products.  I believe it is used here as a pH adjuster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) L-arginine is a naturally occurring amino acid and seems safe.  It&#x27;s used topically to enhance wound strength and collagen deposits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vitamins in this serum are present in these formulations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Retinyl palmitate is Vitamin A and palmitic acid. It&#x27;s probably for skin renewal and skin elasticity and isn&#x27;t considered toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Tocopheryl acetate is acetic acid plus Vitamin E.  It functions as an antioxidant and isn&#x27;t considered toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate is a form of Vitamin C that has been modified to be fat soluble so that it can penetrate the skin better.  It&#x27;s also considered safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Cholecalciferol is Vitamin D3.  This is used as an anti-oxidant and is an ingredient for treating rapid cell growth in psoriatic skin.  It&#x27;s used in cosmetics as a skin conditioner and moisturizer.  It is classifed as toxic by the European Chemicals Bureau (ECB) if inhaled or comes in contact with the skin.  I&#x27;m assuming this ECB classification refers to high levels of concentration, not the level in Forever Young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  This product gives very good results, feels and smells pleasant, makes the skin look smooth and soft.  However, there are perhaps too many ingredients here, some of them duplicating the use of others (e.g., phenoxyethanol and potassium sorbate both functioning as preservatives), and others are perhaps in such small quantities per application that their benefits to your skin might be minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem, IMO, would be for users with sensitive skin, since several of the above ingredients can be skin irritants.  If what you&#x27;re looking for isjust a hyaluronic acid serum, try one of the HA serums with only 3 ingredients:  water, hyaluronic acid and a preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This product was supplied by Celeste LeBeau for a fair and impartial review.)just a hyaluronic acid serum, try one of the HA serums with only 3 ingredients:  water, hyaluronic acid and a preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This product was supplied by Celeste LeBeau for a fair and impartial review.)</li>
            <li> I bought this serum for my mother and she absolutely loves it. In her own words, &amp;#34; The first day I used it, I could feel my face tighten up around my eyes and my entire face. It did exactly what is was supposed to; tightened up the wrinkles and left me with younger feeling and looking skin. I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to feel and look younger.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been offered some beauty products lately and this is by far my favorite. I have been using it on the right side of my face and my right hand. In a week there is a noticeable difference between the right and left. On the right side of my face my forehead is less lined, and the lines around my mouth are less noticeable. Under my chin is tighter and my neck is less lined (OMG the joy of aging!) My hand is softer and looks about 10 years younger compared side by side to my left hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no burning or breakout or rash with this product. I have sensitive skin and was concerned it would be to strong but I have not had any problems. The product is slightly sticky on my face and applying fingers for about 15 seconds. Then it absorbs and no more sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is a winner. I need to start using it on the left side and catch up though! Sample provided</li>
            <li> Celeste Le Beau&#x27;s Forever Young hyaluronic acid serum is a gel type product that is supposed to help preserve your skin, and reduce the signs of aging.  I&#x27;ve been using the product pretty regularly for about 6 months, and while it doesn&#x27;t perform miracles, the serum does an excellent job of moisturizing, and tightening up the skin, leaving it feeling refreshed and softer.  Unlike some lotions or creams, the gel dries without an oily or greasy residue, giving your skin a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, Forever Young has no effect on moles or age spots.  And there hasn&#x27;t been much improvement to the slight bags below my eyes.  I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet, so I can&#x27;t speak to the serum&#x27;s effect on them.  There&#x27;s ample information about Forever Young on the Amazon product page.  While some of it is probably advertising hype, there appears to be some good information there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator bottle is nicely designed, and provides good control of how much product is dispensed, which minimizes waste.  Fortunately, the product goes a long way, as one 1.7 ounce bottle, lasted me over six months.  A medium sized glob is enough to cover the whole face, and I also apply the gel to my neck and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have seen it fluctuate widely, let&#x27;s talk about cost.  In the time I have been using it, I have seen Forever Young range from $40 to $8 per bottle.  Given these price swings, if you are thinking about buying this product, it probably makes sense to price watch it, put it on your wish list, or in the \\&quot;Saved for later\\&quot; section in your shopping cart.  Hopefully, you can get it at a bargain price for under $10.  At that price level, it&#x27;s way below the competition, and makes a terrific gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scientifically, I&#x27;m not exactly sure what Forever Young may be doing, but I firmly believe that my skin feels better, and seems healthier.  I intend to keep using it, so I stocked up when the price dropped.  If you see Forever Young below $10, it would be a great time to give it a try.it would be a great time to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Good cream, worked well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and am thrilled with it. I waited to submit a review until I felt like I could give realistic input.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it morning and night except for the occasional slip at night. It does leave my skin feeling tight after a it dries (a few seconds) but I dislike that feel so I apply a little moisturizer over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most noticeable effect for me is that my skin texture is smoother overall. I apply it to my face and neck and I can tell a huge difference. My skin is softer and wrinkles + pores are less pronounced. At age 49 - those are very desirable effects! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am picky about skin products and this has definitely gone into my must have list. Buy it, use it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> After only a week&#x27;s use, the pore problems I&#x27;ve suffered with seem to be disappearing.  Even just after the first use, I thought I noticed the difference in the appearance of this aging skin.  It&#x27;s a sticky substance and because of that I only use it at night. It feels like it instantly tightens my skin - in fact, I noticed a little problem in the eye area, so now I&#x27;m more vigilante about applying eye cream first and not getting to close to that area.  That seems to have helped with this problem.  I don&#x27;t know yet if it will have an effect on my dark spots, so I may add more to this review when the bottle is near empty, but I&#x27;m pretty darned sure I&#x27;ll be getting this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After a week, I decided to put this aside until after I&#x27;m done with my theatrical work, because wearing makeup seems to be hard on my eyes, and this product increased the problem of wrinkles in the eye area, even though I don&#x27;t use it anywhere around the eyes.  Maybe I should?  But I found another product guaranteed to lighten the pigmentation after one week, so am using that instead.  I do plan to go back to this, but again, I&#x27;m concerned about the effect on the delicate eye tissue.  I wish they could make a companion eye creme.</li>
            <li> I used this Hyaluronic Acid Serum for less than 1 week before my face reacted negatively (redness &amp; sensitive).  While the product seemed to produce some results within that short period, I would not use it again given my skin sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many ingredients in this product &amp; some seem to be not entirely necessary.  Perhaps if the ingredient list were to be pared down, the skin sensitivity issue would go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: this Hyaluronic Acid Serum product was given to me to review.  My opinion is my own &amp; not influenced by the manufacturer or distributor.</li>
            <li> I really feel that this product helps reduce wrinkles and smooths my skin. Unfortunately, I did not read the directions so at first I didn&#x27;t moisten my face before putting the serum on. Since I started following the directions (go figure), the results are positive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51, and have ever-drier skin on my face. So far I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles, but of course I don&#x27;t like the ones I see. I&#x27;ve used several different serums in the last year or two, and this is one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celeste LeBeau Forever Young serum is a very nice addition to my daily facial routine. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks, and I&#x27;m happy with what I see. I start by gently exfoliating as I wash, then I apply the serum, then a moisturizer. I do this morning and night. Since I don&#x27;t wear makeup, this only takes about 5 minutes twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum contains aloe, witch hazel, Vitamins E, C, A, and D3, all of which are good for your skin. The active ingredient - hyaluronic acid - works as a humectant, an antioxidant, and it stimulates the production of collagen. All of this means that it helps regenerate your skin cells and protect it from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum has a nice clean fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger, and it absorbs/dries quickly. I like that the pump gives just a small drop at a time, since I only need a couple of drops for my entire face and neck. I notice that my skin flushes slightly when I first apply it, but the effect fades in a few minutes. And I can definitely see clear, glowing skin and a slight plumping of my wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I haven&#x27;t given this product 5 stars is that it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough for me. When I&#x27;ve applied it and not finished with a moisturizer, my face feels slightly tight and dry. Your experience may differ, especially if you have younger, oilier skin. I give it 4.5 stars.</li>
            <li> Celeste Le Beau&#x27;s \\&quot;Forever Young\\&quot; Hyaluronic Acid Serum is my new favorite serum! Finally I have a product which is just right for my older, thinning, fair and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new serum, and this one is, as stated, a  \\&quot;premium moisturizing serum\\&quot;.  Your skin will feel wonderfully smooth after you apply this.&lt;br /&gt;What a delight that it is not too harsh for sensitive skin like mine.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to feel its benefits instantly. My skin was much smoother after the first application! I have been using this twice a day since I received it: morning and night, after cleansing my face.&lt;br /&gt;I am not the kind of person who has an elaborate beauty regime. This suits my fast paced life while leaving me feeling pampered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my neck and my decollete as well as my face. However you should avoid the eye area with this serum. There is an eye serum specifically targeting that area made by this company which I look forward to trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it stands, I LOVE this!  I like it as well as a primer for makeup on those rare days when I use makeup. It leaves your skin prepped and incredibly soft, but not slick or greasy at all,&lt;br /&gt;It leaves you feeling as if you really have done something good for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;As I have not been pleased by any specific serums for a while, and I am very particular, I would not be recommending this so strongly if I didn&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;I know the word \\&quot;acid\\&quot; is a word which can seem disturbing, but this product is mindfully made of a natural acid your own body produces. As well, according to the box, Hyaluronic Acid Serum \\&quot;holds up to 1000 times its weight in water\\&quot;. This is why the appearance of your skin and the feel of your skin is altered so dramatically and so rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased and impressed with Celeste Le Beau&#x27;s \\&quot;Forever Young\\&quot; Hyaluronic Acid Serum. This is a high quality, luxury product without the \\&quot;luxury price tag\\&quot; . How great!</li>
            <li> Like every woman who ever lived before me, I would do anything to look younger. Well, maybe not anything; but if it was easy to do, I&#x27;d do it. Hyaluronic acid is easy. I just apply it on clean, dry skin in the mornings. I like the taut sensation when it dries. I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks now and I can&#x27;t say any wrinkles have disappeared. I might just be destined to grow old, but at least I&#x27;m fighting it all the way. That taut sensation? I imagine my skin not sagging. It feels good, anyway. A great way to start the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by Celeste Le Beau.</li>
            <li> first off its extremely moisturizing. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks consistently twice a day and I see improvement in my skin already.  It just looks so smooth, soft and moisturized. My husband even noticed that I look &amp;#34;different.&amp;#34; He asked was that the serum? Interestingly enough, I would like to say so.  I love the fact that a little bit goes a long way so this bottle will last for awhile. I love the pump it hasn&#x27;t clogged like most products tend to do.  It comes out and goes on smooth. In love &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I love the way it leaves my skin.  I have recently started using it so can not comment on the long term yet.</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid serum is a great way to refresh skin and keep it hydrated. It&#x27;s non drying and reduces fine lines and makes your skin feel soft and moisturized. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks and notice it brightens my complexion and makes my skin feel really hydrated and nice. It restores tone and makes my skin on my neck and face very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a non greasy formula that does not clog pores or cause break-outs (which I am prone to) and it&#x27;s a great size where a little product goes a long way. I use it in the morning under make-up and at night to keep my skin nice and hydrated. It really soaks into your skin and leaves no residue and has a pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product that reduces fine lines and provides a boost to skin. It gives your face a nice glow and healthier look. Product for evaluation and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with my results! I had no idea what to expect but my skin is firm and smooth! I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1DJHCU2K9K66P]]Forever young is translucent gelatinous serum which has has very light herbal scent. I have been using it for 2 weeks to see the effects before writing this review. When I spread it on my skin it feels very cool and I will my skin tighten as it dries. It does not feel oily. It took several pumps to prime the pump before first use but once it was primed it began working smoothly and consistently. I have dry patches of skin above my eyebrows and they began looking better after several days on consistent use. I also used the serum to treat under the eyes and I see a slight improvement in puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instruction for use:&lt;br /&gt;✔ Apply to skin after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;✔ Let absorb moisturising effect.&lt;br /&gt;✔ Avoid direct contact with eyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle contains 2 oz. The bottle is 4.25\\&quot; long and the cap is 1.75\\&quot; long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Deionized Water&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Hyaluronate&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Barbadensis Juice&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethanol&lt;br /&gt;Witch Hazel Extract&lt;br /&gt;Acrylates/C 10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer&lt;br /&gt;MSM, Potassium Sorbate&lt;br /&gt;Tocopheryl Acetate&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Hydroxide&lt;br /&gt;Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate&lt;br /&gt;Lavender Oil&lt;br /&gt;L-Arginine&lt;br /&gt;Retinyl Palmitate&lt;br /&gt;Cholecalciferol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle for testing, evaluation and review. Before receiving the sample I warned that I write honest reviews be they positive or negative. I have tried a large number of skin treatments, while none of them are miracles that restore the youthful skin some help dry skin and slight smoothing of light wrinkles. Forever Young falls into that category. It is not a miracle cure but my skin reacted well to the serum (no outbreaks) and I see a modest improvement in the problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try several different serums lately, and I actually like all of them for different reasons.  Which serum you ultimately choose is going to depend on the particular benefits of that serum, so first let me summarize what I think are the unique aspects of this particular product.  If those are benefits you are looking for, then this is a good serum to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this at night, after cleansing and toning but before a moisturizer.  I do feel a little tightening of my skin right away, but I notice more of an effect in the morning -- fine lines are definitely reduced.  So this stuff has staying power, which is wonderful.  I also think it&#x27;s very good for moisturizing.  It&#x27;s been cold and windy here the past few weeks (or at least, as cold and windy as Georgia gets).  Normally, my cheeks get dry and flaky, but they haven&#x27;t lately.  This serum has been the only difference in my skin care routine.  So it definitely has some moisturizing effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attribute the moisturizing effects to two ingredients -- aloe and hyaluronic acid.  Hyaluronic acid is great at soaking up and hanging onto moisture (it&#x27;s even a component of the contact lens rewetting drops I use, for much the same reason).  Please note that much of the hyaluronic acid used by industry is a byproduct of poultry processing, although hyaluronic acid can, in some cases, be expressed in bacteria.  I am not sure which source the hyaluronic acid comes from in this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum also has some vitamin C and vitamin E, so it will have a little antioxidant activity, though these are a little later in the ingredients list and so present in smaller amounts.  In my mind, the biggest benefit of this product is the moisturizing -- the fact that the ingredients hang onto so much water within their chemical structures provides relatively quick correction when it comes to fine lines and helps deal with the effects of winter (I spend quite a lot of time outside walking my dog, regardless of the weather, and sometimes my skin takes a beating as a result).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a clear gel that basically has the consistency of aloe.  It&#x27;s not runny at all and it dries on the skin quickly without leaving a greasy feeling.  It also hasn&#x27;t aggravated my sensitive skin at all, and it doesn&#x27;t contain any artificial colors or fragrances.  One pump of the dispenser is all it takes for complete coverage of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, definitely worth a try if the benefits I&#x27;ve discussed above are important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: product provided by the manufacturer at no charge.my dog, regardless of the weather, and sometimes my skin takes a beating as a result).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a clear gel that basically has the consistency of aloe.

            <li> I agree with the other reviewers that this serum works well.  It does make my skin feel very nice and soft and it has a slight pleasant odor.  I can&#x27;t really judge the wrinkle reducing claims of this because those things are so hard to judge.  I will say that whether its psychological or not, I do feel like my skin looks better after having used this product.  So I will continue to use it because I think it&#x27;s having a positive effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 two caveats though:  1) I had a friend with very dry skin use it and she didn&#x27;t like it.  Because it is gel based, it makes your skin feel dry even though its supposed to be a moisturizer.  For a person like me with oily skin, it&#x27;s perfect.  It balanced my skin to exactly where I like it.  But if you have very dry skin, then I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;ll like this product.  2) The ingredient list is a bit too long. It has a good amount of ingredients I can&#x27;t even pronounce and I usually stay away from those ingredients.  I wish they had gone lighter or foregone the preservatives, etc.  But then again, it is a cosmetic and cosmetics are usually full of ingredients you can&#x27;t pronounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the product and I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review.</li>
            <li> *Four week update: My husband noticed my skin! I think the change is very obvious. Biggest change is my neck, pores and around my mouth. Fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sixty three and have been struggling with my skin for a few months after a weight loss. My usual routine is to cleanse at night and moisturize, and then a gentle cleanse in the morning and a light moisturizer under my make up. I use a foundation, mineral powder and a bronzer, so there&#x27;s a good layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is VERY sensitive; I have to be careful to test a product.  I&#x27;m allergic to  anything by Olay and Cindy Crawford&#x27;s Ageless beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I didn&#x27;t hesitate to try Forever Young because it felt greaseless on my fingertips. Immediately after applying, my skin felt smoother. The texture of my skin has improved; pores seem smaller and the worst wrinkles around my mouth are smoothed out a bit. This is after one week. I&#x27;m very excited about my neck and chest area too, which were crepey and pretty awful. Although my neck is still not great, the turkey skin look has diminished, and I think my chest skin looks much smoother! I&#x27;m so excited! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a guy and this works great!  I&#x27;m not trying to have the best looking skin ever, I am just looking for something to DEEPLY moisturize my face and make it feel smoother.  This does a fantastic job and I can&#x27;t recommend it more!  I have noticed that when I tan, my skin tends to age, and this really helps prevent that aging that tanning does to your skin.  One thing that I like about the serum is that it has a slight warming sensation when applied which makes you feel like it&#x27;s really doing something!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skeptic. Really. But I have to say whether I wanted to just believe or I actually have seen a difference, I believe this does make my skin look better and feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using it, it can dry a little stiff but then I put some moisturizer on and that goes away. If I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer, I can get dry spots. I had no trouble with any reaction or redness. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a scent or any side-effects that I have experienced. It soaks in quickly and seems to make things look a little smoother and less puffy. I&#x27;ve been using it  for a few weeks now (most days, not all) and most of the time, after use, I see a difference. I usually use two pumps to cover my face and neck so this bottle will last quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for testing.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of Hyaluronic Acid Serum when I was asked to test this product. My skin is a combination, but I spread the gel all over, paying particular attention to the dry areas.  I liked the feel of the lightweight gel and was astonished that a small amount went very far and was absorbed into my skin extremely quickly.  At first I feared it would be sticky, but within minutes the gel was gone and my skin felt much MUCH smoother.  I was amazed.  I’ve read that some others thought it was sticky, but they may have used too much or not waited the few minutes needed for it to be absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the serum daily for over two weeks now and plan to make it part of my daily regimen.  It has not removed my deep wrinkles, but has smoothed out the fine lines around my eyes.  The outer box states: “Hyaluronic Acid Serum is one of the most powerful moisturizers.  It holds up to 1000 times its weight in water that will help to smooth your fine lines before your very eyes.”  That appears to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One precaution, I have not found anything that can actually reverse the aging process.  This product greatly diminishes my fine lines and helps my dry areas while making my skin feel very smooth.  Makeup glides on easily without being greasy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first hyaluronic acid serum I have tried so I cannot compare it to other brands. I received a sample for an honest review and my honest opinion is that I love it!  (I may now try a few other brands, but the benchmark it set high after using this one.)</li>
            <li> When I was asked to try the [[ASIN:B00GUTLC0C Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Celeste Le Beau]], I was overly willing because there are so many beauty products out there that I have tried that have let me down, I was hopeful this product would work out well.  After several weeks of consistent use, I can say in my experience this product has been very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally apply two pumps of the serum around my face, a few days a week.  I find the serum absorbs rather quickly, but not so quickly that I can&#x27;t get a good even coat before drying.  I like that this product is relatively fragrance free, great for use on days when I&#x27;m around friends that can&#x27;t stand strong smells.  I&#x27;ve noticed after consistent use this product has made my skin more even with less wrinkles and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you try this product, be sure to give it some time before giving up.  I started noticing better results after my first week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Sample Provided For Review]</li>
            <li> My skin feels tighter and firmer after using for several weeks. Would recommend this product again!&lt;br /&gt;Bought as add on product and was very impressed. Mostly natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have tried several facial products that promise younger looking skin, and although some may provide minor benefits, they usually just are not worth it in the long run.  I expected this product to be much the same as others but have been pleasantly surprised.  Since I still occasionally break out, I love that its lightweight and moisturizes without feeling greasy.  It has not caused any acne.  After putting it on, my skin has a pleasant tingling sensation and it brings a healthy-looking flush to my face.  After a couple of weeks of using it, I have noticed my skin looks healthier and my face looks younger.  It leaves my skin soft while making my face look tighter so my small wrinkles are minimized.  My pores look smaller and my face looks and feels less greasy.  Overall my face just looks better after using this product and I plan to continue to use it on a daily basis.  One thing to know about this product though is that it does make you sunburn easier and faster, so be sure to apply sunscreen if you are going to be outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Not what was expected.  Does not feel like it firms like other products I&#x27;ve used in the past. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  I have tried many others, much more expensive that didn&#x27;t work as well as this.  Try it !</li>
            <li> Item as described...fast delivery!</li>
