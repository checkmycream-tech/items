            <li> Excellent product.  Received in just a few days.</li>
            <li> we ordered &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; shampoo and we rec&#x27;d &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;and they are not the same, ask my wife.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s her hair.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, but it&#x27;s very drying.</li>
            <li> Always purchased this product at the local CVS - very upset have to buy it on line and pay the overpriced charge.  Love the shampoo and conditioner however can no longer afford.</li>
            <li> So glad to find my favorite volumizing shampoo and conditioner. I spend 8 months in Florida, and my hair collapses within this volumizing &amp;#34;combo&amp;#34;. So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo, but the lid was loose and it soaked through the Amazon delivery box. What a mess!</li>
            <li> I would recomended this product to anyone needing extra body and bounce to their hair.&lt;br /&gt;Having thin hair is always a trail trying to find the right product to enhamce volume to my hair, but not any more.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 2 years and it is the best thing I have fund for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> This smells good and does add volume. The whole family likes to use it. One of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> Amazing, as always. I am using purple, blue and orange shampoo and conditioners and am very happy. Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Cristophe for such a great products!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for volume. Does the job and is no longer sold at CVS or at least as far as I know after looking.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works well on fine hair. It did take an extra week to receive it in the mail but so far it&#x27;s a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a number of years. It is a great shampoo for volumizing and really love the smell.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers. This product used to be awesome. Something has been changed or modified or removed, because now it is just another shampoo. So disappointing now. Nice smell and lather, but if you are looking for a volumizing shampoo look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and a bit thinning. I have used this shampoo for years. This is the only shampoo that does not weight down my hair and does not leave build up. Cvs no longer carries it. I found that amazon does. Now amazon has some issue with this product. Now I fear Christophe will discontinue this shampoo. This is a great shampoo! Smells great too!  Believe me I have tried several shampoos before I found Christophe volumizing shampoo. My hair can get weighted down so easy but not with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Don&#x27;t understand why it isn&#x27;t sold in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo my favorite ! 5 stars</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo everyday, it is great.  CVS use to carry it and now they do not...I was very disappointed until I went on amazon.com and found I could order it.</li>
            <li> great product...smells good...helps my colored hair</li>
            <li> Great shampoo!  Appears will be discontinued, hopefully not true.</li>

            <li> One of my favorite shampoos.  I have been unable to find it where I currently reside.  Used it in Richmond Virginia when I lived there.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with this product. Did not like the texture or the results.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo that really gives volume to hair is Christophe.</li>
