            <li>So the cans arrived just fine, but without tops, so there&#x27;s no way to pack one for travel, but I guess that&#x27;s OK.</li>

            <li>I use it to do smooth curls.  </li>
            <li>Protects your hair and makes it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>This product makes my wavy colored hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Especially perfect when I wear my hair up or haven&#x27;t washed it for a few days.</li>
            <li>Was fed up so went onto my amazon and found it for 4 dollars cheaper and free shipping.</li>
            <li>I use this product as a detangler and to smooth out my hair.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have experienced  is the spray gets clogged up</li>
            <li>Smooth, shiny, silky......  </li>
            <li>This product makes hair shiny and smooth--</li>
            <li>Makes your hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to use it lightly</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended it for shine and it&#x27;s fantastic in that regard.</li>
            <li>Works great for flat ironing, but you can use it with any style.</li>
            <li>Great product, offers great heat protection without making hair greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>It would have been more thrilling to rip twenty dollars up.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many sealers/smoothing products and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I was introduced to Straight Sexy Hair Smooth and Seal by my stylist.</li>
            <li>Bought it for about $10 shipped; received it fast, and love that I found a source for a full-size version of this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much I buy the travel size to keep in my carry-on.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t use too much or spray too close to your hair or it will make it greasy.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping:)</li>
            <li>Works like a dream come true.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the simple fact that my hair is fairly curly.</li>
            <li>i have pretty fine hair and flyaways are this season trend.</li>
            <li>I still get mildly frizzy hair and the spray makes me cough.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift for my niece at Christmas to use with the PYT flat iron - she is happy and says it works very well.</li>
            <li>This spray is great to settle my frizzy hair down.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and made my hair shiny but at a cost....left my fresh clean hair feeling a little greasy.</li>
            <li>So long story longer, I bought this magic stuff, it is now perched on my counter like a trophy that I will NOT share, no matter how cute my daughters are.</li>
            <li>I love it and recomend it if u have long sexy hair</li>
            <li>Keeps away the frizzies -- really!!</li>
            <li>and I get this amazing soft straight hair.</li>
            <li>the stylist that I had was using a few products in my hair and while he did great work, my hair is just frizzy.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for having this product available.</li>
            <li>This product gives such great shine to my hair and makes it feel really soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, but it is effective, so you don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li>It was worth the $20....</li>
            <li>love this hairspray, not greasy and leaves my hair soft and not frizzy</li>
            <li>The pleasant surprise to me is that it seems to have a slight hold to it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and delivered right on schedule</li>
            <li>After about 4-5hours my straight hair was curling (i had been using the kertain 7 day smooth and that was keeping my hair straight for 3-4days).</li>
            <li>Make your hair look smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>Hard to find but a great product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and definitely recommend it</li>
            <li>thankfully SSHS&amp;S keeps my locks straight and in line!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years when I hot iron.</li>
            <li>even though there is more left in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays straight for days!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve needed it my whole life!</li>
            <li>I have other hair de-frizz products that are liquid serums or lotion/cremes, and those are great for some days when you need a bit more heavy duty de-frizzing.  </li>
            <li>My sister in law fell in love with it when we were in Europe and her flat iron broke.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this product comes in handy</li>
            <li>Love this spray when I use my flat iron</li>
            <li>I have really course Asian hair, and allows me to &amp;#34;manage&amp;#34; and seal my hair, as I have many layers.</li>
            <li>Love it only thing that helps keep my hair straight and silky</li>
            <li>From my own experience, the price I paid for the results was not worth it.</li>
            <li>But I certainly DO NOT think this is an awesome product, sorry sexy straight, but my hair was anything</li>
            <li>Makes your hair super shiny and soft and controls frizz.  </li>
            <li>I certainly won&#x27;t buy it again once this can is gone.</li>
            <li>I have fine, somewhat coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>really helps when I flat-iron my hair.</li>
            <li>I was amazed how shiny and straight my hair looked.</li>
            <li>I dont know how to use a blow dryer and really have no sense of how to style hair.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li>I hope that they too can have the shiny stick straight hair of their dreams...</li>
            <li>its leaves your hair very silky.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li>I have hair that is neither straight nor curly, just wavy and fuzzy.</li>
            <li>This product really helps my hair look both straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>This does the trick, keeps my hair straight and adds shine.  </li>
            <li>Straight, non-frizzy hair without a lot of fuss.</li>
            <li>The product make my hair look very oily.</li>
            <li>I really like the product</li>
            <li>thank u so much</li>
            <li>I also use the smooth and protect for my flat iron product.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years, and the formula has not changed like so many other hair care products.</li>
            <li>If you straighten your hair and live in high humidity area this product is a must!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It keeps your hair straight and frizz free without feeling greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li>I live in a sub-tropical humid climate that contributes to the frizz.</li>
            <li>, naturally curly/wavy hair and my hair is so soft and straight with this product.</li>
            <li>If I could find one great product to control a lot of the frizz without weighing it down or making it look like an oil slick</li>
            <li>I first purchased on sale at a local salon that does &amp;#34;walk in&amp;#34; cuts for kids and have been buying it ever since.  </li>
            <li>First found it at a local salon who straightened my hair.</li>
            <li>I have frizzy, curly hair and this product makes my hair so soft, shiny, and manageable!</li>
            <li>Her hair became flat as a board and very, very shiny.  </li>
            <li>It helps smooth your hair and have less frizzy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love it and since it is a salon product that is rather hard to find in stores, I will continue to look for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love this product and hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>But this is one of the few in a spray version, so you get a fantastic light, airy spritz that covers just where you need, never too heavy.</li>
            <li>Not heavy and leaves my hair shiny.  </li>
            <li>She spayed this prior to blow drying and when straight ironing my hair.</li>
            <li>It is abused, but well it refuses to stop waving, frizzing and curling with wild abandon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it did not have the wow factor that I was expecting after reading some of the reviews.</li>
            <li>introduced to me by a friend, as I have chemically treated hair, this boosts shine and makes hair soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I might be wrong but it almost feels like it&#x27;s good for you hair.</li>
            <li>It didnt leave it super straight, however, it didnt get as frizzy as usually does.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works to tame the frizz and give me pretty bouncy curls all day.</li>
            <li>Certainly not big, not thick and not &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First--I have fairly straight hair, but if I don&#x27;t dry it, it has a lot of wave and some curl.</li>
            <li>Smooths your hair right down and can be used every day.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will just save my money and buy a simple $5 bottle of something that does the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>As a bonus it makes brushing tangles out of wet hair much easier.</li>
            <li>The top was broken off</li>
            <li>Though it is protecting my hair, it doesn&#x27;t really enhance the look of my hair or make my hair last longer than any other product would.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not worth the price, I&#x27;ve gotten the same result from regular/cheaper hair spray (at a much cheaper price).</li>
            <li>It was a pure waste of money, though.</li>
            <li>So he used this on my hair told me to watch, slightly went over my hair with the flat iron again, and BAM just like that I had stick straight hair.</li>

            <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> simply the best!</li>
            <li> So the cans arrived just fine, but without tops, so there&#x27;s no way to pack one for travel, but I guess that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Well, Straight Sexy Hair does the job for a better value!</li>
            <li> This product works fine</li>
            <li> This product is super fabulous!</li>
            <li> iT&#x27;S LIGHT, NOT STICKY, BUT CONTROLS HAIR.</li>
            <li> Great hair product for extra shine.</li>
            <li> I use it to do smooth curls.  </li>
            <li> Protects your hair and makes it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> This product makes my wavy colored hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Especially perfect when I wear my hair up or haven&#x27;t washed it for a few days.</li>
            <li> Was fed up so went onto my amazon and found it for 4 dollars cheaper and free shipping.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a detangler and to smooth out my hair.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have experienced  is the spray gets clogged up</li>
            <li> Smooth, shiny, silky......  </li>
            <li> This product makes hair shiny and smooth--</li>
            <li> Makes your hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use it lightly</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended it for shine and it&#x27;s fantastic in that regard.</li>
            <li> Works great for flat ironing, but you can use it with any style.</li>
            <li> Great product, offers great heat protection without making hair greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> It would have been more thrilling to rip twenty dollars up.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many sealers/smoothing products and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to Straight Sexy Hair Smooth and Seal by my stylist.</li>
            <li> Bought it for about $10 shipped; received it fast, and love that I found a source for a full-size version of this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product so much I buy the travel size to keep in my carry-on.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t use too much or spray too close to your hair or it will make it greasy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping:)</li>
            <li> Works like a dream come true.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the simple fact that my hair is fairly curly.</li>
            <li> i have pretty fine hair and flyaways are this season trend.</li>
            <li> I still get mildly frizzy hair and the spray makes me cough.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my niece at Christmas to use with the PYT flat iron - she is happy and says it works very well.</li>
            <li> This spray is great to settle my frizzy hair down.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and made my hair shiny but at a cost....left my fresh clean hair feeling a little greasy.</li>
            <li> So long story longer, I bought this magic stuff, it is now perched on my counter like a trophy that I will NOT share, no matter how cute my daughters are.</li>
            <li> I love it and recomend it if u have long sexy hair</li>
            <li> Keeps away the frizzies -- really!!</li>
            <li> and I get this amazing soft straight hair.</li>
            <li> the stylist that I had was using a few products in my hair and while he did great work, my hair is just frizzy.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for having this product available.</li>
            <li> This product gives such great shine to my hair and makes it feel really soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy, but it is effective, so you don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li> It was worth the $20....</li>
            <li> love this hairspray, not greasy and leaves my hair soft and not frizzy</li>
            <li> The pleasant surprise to me is that it seems to have a slight hold to it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and delivered right on schedule</li>
            <li> After about 4-5hours my straight hair was curling (i had been using the kertain 7 day smooth and that was keeping my hair straight for 3-4days).</li>
            <li> Make your hair look smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> Hard to find but a great product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> thankfully SSHS&amp;S keeps my locks straight and in line!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years when I hot iron.</li>
            <li> even though there is more left in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays straight for days!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve needed it my whole life!</li>
            <li> I have other hair de-frizz products that are liquid serums or lotion/cremes, and those are great for some days when you need a bit more heavy duty de-frizzing.  </li>
            <li> My sister in law fell in love with it when we were in Europe and her flat iron broke.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this product comes in handy</li>
            <li> Love this spray when I use my flat iron</li>
            <li> I have really course Asian hair, and allows me to &amp;#34;manage&amp;#34; and seal my hair, as I have many layers.</li>
            <li> Love it only thing that helps keep my hair straight and silky</li>
            <li> From my own experience, the price I paid for the results was not worth it.</li>
            <li> But I certainly DO NOT think this is an awesome product, sorry sexy straight, but my hair was anything</li>
            <li> Makes your hair super shiny and soft and controls frizz.  </li>
            <li> I certainly won&#x27;t buy it again once this can is gone.</li>
            <li> I have fine, somewhat coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> really helps when I flat-iron my hair.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how shiny and straight my hair looked.</li>
            <li> I dont know how to use a blow dryer and really have no sense of how to style hair.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li> I hope that they too can have the shiny stick straight hair of their dreams...</li>
            <li> its leaves your hair very silky.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> I have hair that is neither straight nor curly, just wavy and fuzzy.</li>
            <li> This product really helps my hair look both straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> This does the trick, keeps my hair straight and adds shine.  </li>
            <li> Straight, non-frizzy hair without a lot of fuss.</li>
            <li> The product make my hair look very oily.</li>
            <li> I really like the product</li>
            <li> thank u so much</li>
            <li> I also use the smooth and protect for my flat iron product.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and the formula has not changed like so many other hair care products.</li>
            <li> If you straighten your hair and live in high humidity area this product is a must!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It keeps your hair straight and frizz free without feeling greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> I live in a sub-tropical humid climate that contributes to the frizz.</li>
            <li> , naturally curly/wavy hair and my hair is so soft and straight with this product.</li>
            <li> If I could find one great product to control a lot of the frizz without weighing it down or making it look like an oil slick</li>
            <li> I first purchased on sale at a local salon that does &amp;#34;walk in&amp;#34; cuts for kids and have been buying it ever since.  </li>
            <li> First found it at a local salon who straightened my hair.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, curly hair and this product makes my hair so soft, shiny, and manageable!</li>
            <li> Her hair became flat as a board and very, very shiny.  </li>
            <li> It helps smooth your hair and have less frizzy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love it and since it is a salon product that is rather hard to find in stores, I will continue to look for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this product and hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> But this is one of the few in a spray version, so you get a fantastic light, airy spritz that covers just where you need, never too heavy.</li>
            <li> Not heavy and leaves my hair shiny.  </li>
            <li> She spayed this prior to blow drying and when straight ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> It is abused, but well it refuses to stop waving, frizzing and curling with wild abandon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it did not have the wow factor that I was expecting after reading some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> introduced to me by a friend, as I have chemically treated hair, this boosts shine and makes hair soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I might be wrong but it almost feels like it&#x27;s good for you hair.</li>
            <li> It didnt leave it super straight, however, it didnt get as frizzy as usually does.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works to tame the frizz and give me pretty bouncy curls all day.</li>
            <li> Certainly not big, not thick and not &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First--I have fairly straight hair, but if I don&#x27;t dry it, it has a lot of wave and some curl.</li>
            <li> Smooths your hair right down and can be used every day.  </li>
            <li> Next time I will just save my money and buy a simple $5 bottle of something that does the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> As a bonus it makes brushing tangles out of wet hair much easier.</li>
            <li> The top was broken off</li>
            <li> Though it is protecting my hair, it doesn&#x27;t really enhance the look of my hair or make my hair last longer than any other product would.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the price, I&#x27;ve gotten the same result from regular/cheaper hair spray (at a much cheaper price).</li>
            <li> It was a pure waste of money, though.</li>
            <li> So he used this on my hair told me to watch, slightly went over my hair with the flat iron again, and BAM just like that I had stick straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick hair &amp; whether I wear it wavy or straight, this product keeps my hair shiny &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight (very slight wave) &amp; oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It didn&#x27;t get keep my style in hold better than any other hair care products I&#x27;ve had before, and in fact I&#x27;d say it does a worse job.</li>
            <li> I finally got my Stylist to share her secret of how she gets my hair to shine and smell so clean.</li>
            <li> It makes my locks shiny and extra soft and smooths the little frizzies that are left over.</li>
            <li> (FYI-I have long length blonde hair)</li>
            <li> My hair is so flat that no product is at once, volume giving and lightweight AND anti-frizz.</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling dry from the alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would help me get straight, sleek hair for at least one day.</li>
            <li> and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> I dont want to walk around looking like a grease monkey.</li>
            <li> This size canister lasts me a couple of months and my hair is long.  </li>
            <li> Been using for a long time and plan to continue.</li>
            <li> It was about $4.50 for a small travel size, and I was never able to find it in a full size container until Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have very wavy thick hair and spray this on before and after blow drying.</li>
            <li> I use it in place of stiff hair spray, so that I have the natural look.</li>
            <li> I am always looking to improve my hair&#x27;s unruly behavior without having to constantly use hairspray,gel, or other hair styling products.</li>
            <li> I wash, dry and straighten my Keratin-treated hair about twice a week.</li>
            <li> maybe mine is too dry.</li>
            <li> Then blow dry with a minimum of care.</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars trying products to tame by granddaughter&#x27;s wild, bushy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have extreme curly hair and use a flat iron every week to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s rather oily, making my hair dull before I get out the door, &amp; also more expensive.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> and I received it sooner than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Product as expected.</li>
            <li> I just just can&#x27;t figure out how to use it without my hair looking wet.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair and when it is completely dry, I spray this in my hair and then straighten it with a paddle brush and the hair dryer for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way - think a bottle has lasted me almost a year</li>
            <li> I live Houston, and the humidity here SUCKS!</li>
            <li> Have been buying this stuff in small travel size bottles at my local drugstore because that&#x27;s the one size they carry it in, and I am hooked!  </li>
            <li> My stylist uses this product to keep your hair from burning and I wouldn&#x27;t want to use any other product.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t even bother doing my hair if its humid outside, which is all the time!</li>
            <li> She used it on my always frizzy, naturally wavy, very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth $15.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse wavy hair</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down like some sprays.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad on the expensive side, but since I only use it 2x a week, it isn&#x27;t a big hit to my wallet.</li>
            <li> I usually get it a local store who was out of stock for the past few weeks..</li>
            <li> no matter how little I put in</li>
            <li> I bought just cuz I was desperate to try something, as my porous hair gets really frizzy this time of year.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m in a rush I spray this on my hair, use a ceramic round brush</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that currently crying, begging, weilding their razors in the air threatening their hair to straighten up ( pardon the pun) or off with their roots!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to hold my breath and shut my eyes when applying because the heavy aroma kills me.</li>
            <li> does not make your hair stiff but does help control friz</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they have changed the name of this product, made it half the size and now charge double the price.</li>
            <li> If your ends get frizzy from over processing, blow drying, or just from skipping a day of shampoo&#x27;ing &amp; you need a little taming to freshen up, this is the stuff!  </li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not sure that i notice a difference when i use it or don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this product is getting discontinued in all the retailers.</li>
            <li> For years I have been wrestling with my hair, using potions, serums, crying, begging, and seriously contemplating shaving it all off.</li>
            <li> My hair frizzes really bad in high humidity.  </li>
            <li> It seriously cuts the straightening time in HALF!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thin and long bottle, so it&#x27;s not recommended for portability use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few hours, and my hair has puffed up bad on the side I sprayed it, as I had only done one side to see effectiveness.</li>
            <li> When i straight it, it usually waves up, its annoying :(.</li>
            <li> This item was delivered broken....</li>
            <li> I am unable to return it</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s my secret!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m now stuck with an item that is worthless.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible joke.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> didnt like it,my hair still the same frizzy in summer time</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  Really nice smell as well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> We bought this and now my hair is too sexy for my body.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s review: I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using Kenra&#x27;s Platinum Finishing Spray, mostly because it smells like candy! But it&#x27;s rather oily, making my hair dull before I get out the door, &amp; also more expensive. Well, Straight Sexy Hair does the job for a better value! I have coarse, thick hair &amp; whether I wear it wavy or straight, this product keeps my hair shiny &amp; soft. The pleasant surprise to me is that it seems to have a slight hold to it. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great product, offers great heat protection without making hair greasy or heavy. Adds shine. I don&#x27;t love the smell, it&#x27;s a bit chemicaly. It&#x27;s not horrible, just not as pleasant as, say, Kenra products.</li>
            <li> This product gives such great shine to my hair and makes it feel really soft. It also gets rid of the fly aways</li>
            <li> i have pretty fine hair and flyaways are this season trend. thankfully SSHS&amp;S keeps my locks straight and in line! (ha, did you see what i did there?)</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Left my hair feeling dry from the alcohol in it. Used it once. Tempted to throw it away but the cost has me holding off for now.</li>
            <li> This product is super fabulous! Love it! But it is an aerosol and therefore was confiscated at the airport ($%#&amp;($^&amp;!!!)  They should make a smaller product for traveling.</li>
            <li> Did not work on my hair.</li>
            <li> Have been buying this stuff in small travel size bottles at my local drugstore because that&#x27;s the one size they carry it in, and I am hooked!  It was about $4.50 for a small travel size, and I was never able to find it in a full size container until Amazon.  THANK YOU!

            <li> I like the way this product works when I straighten my hair.  It smells good and I received it sooner than I expected.  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and delivered right on schedule</li>
            <li> I have extreme curly hair and use a flat iron every week to straighten my hair. My stylist uses this product to keep your hair from burning and I wouldn&#x27;t want to use any other product. It also gives a shine to my hair!</li>
            <li> iT&#x27;S LIGHT, NOT STICKY, BUT CONTROLS HAIR.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I also use the smooth and protect for my flat iron product.  Both products makes my  hair feel so solt!  I was happy to find it here on amazon as my hair salon discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Great hair product for extra shine.</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars trying products to tame by granddaughter&#x27;s wild, bushy hair.  I took her to a salon last week, and the stylist used this.  Her hair became flat as a board and very, very shiny.  Where has this been all of my life?</li>
            <li> Makes your hair super shiny and soft and controls frizz.  Love it.  Wish I could find a travel size to bring on planes!</li>
            <li> My go to hair product. LOVE IT!  Keeps frizz off your hair!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery,!</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair. My hair is naturally straight (very slight wave) &amp; oily. I live in a sub-tropical humid climate that contributes to the frizz. (FYI-I have long length blonde hair) I am always looking to improve my hair&#x27;s unruly behavior without having to constantly use hairspray,gel, or other hair styling products. If I could find one great product to control a lot of the frizz without weighing it down or making it look like an oil slick then I would be a happy camper. This spray smells awesome but just seems to do an OK job. From my own experience, the price I paid for the results was not worth it. However, I like the Sexy Hair brand; I guess that&#x27;s why I was hoping this product would deliver. If at all possible to try the product out before purchasing, I would suggest to do so.</li>
            <li> Best price around.  Love this product.  I use it to do smooth curls.  No frizz.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much I buy the travel size to keep in my carry-on.  If you want smoothy silky hair this is for you.</li>
            <li> Protects your hair and makes it smooth and shiny. I&#x27;ve used it for years when I hot iron. Great product.</li>
            <li> I really love this spray.&lt;br /&gt;It really helps when I flat-iron my hair.</li>
            <li> This product makes my wavy colored hair smooth and shiny.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Smooths your hair right down and can be used every day.  My sister in law fell in love with it when we were in Europe and her flat iron broke.</li>
            <li> I wash, dry and straighten my Keratin-treated hair about twice a week. I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to use this a couple times now and I like it. I spray it on and brush my hair as a last step. It makes my locks shiny and extra soft and smooths the little frizzies that are left over. It&#x27;s a tad on the expensive side, but since I only use it 2x a week, it isn&#x27;t a big hit to my wallet.</li>
            <li> This spray is amazing. I actually curl my hair in big spirals and  then spray it. It gives you a nice, glossy wave.</li>
            <li> Not heavy and leaves my hair shiny.  Especially perfect when I wear my hair up or haven&#x27;t washed it for a few days.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I&#x27;ve used many sealers/smoothing products and this is by far my favorite.  Lightweight and smells nice. I first purchased on sale at a local salon that does &amp;#34;walk in&amp;#34; cuts for kids and have been buying it ever since.  A little goes a long way - think a bottle has lasted me almost a year and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS ITEM. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Arrived on time.  Product as expected.</li>
            <li> Its okay. I like the fragrance of it &amp; it stays till your next wash. But I don&#x27;t think it does what it says it does!&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t recommend or order again.</li>
            <li> Yes, it smoothed my hair and made it longer BUT it took away body so that while my hair was longer, It was flimsy with no hold and  looked thinner. Certainly not big, not thick and not &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34;. Not worth $15.</li>
            <li> love this product. Makes your hair shine and silkey!!</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse wavy hair and it is quite a chore straightening it. This product is the best ever for a straight smooth result. I love it and since it is a salon product that is rather hard to find in stores, I will continue to look for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. First found it at a local salon who straightened my hair. I was amazed how shiny and straight my hair looked. So of course I started buying the product. I usually get it a local store who was out of stock for the past few weeks.. Was fed up so went onto my amazon and found it for 4 dollars cheaper and free shipping. Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> This made my hair look greasy no matter how little I put in. I dont want to walk around looking like a grease monkey.</li>
            <li> Great stuff - no problems</li>
            <li> I use this product as a detangler and to smooth out my hair. It works wonders and smells great. If you&#x27;re still browsing. Stop. Try it out. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This spray is great to settle my frizzy hair down.  The only problem I have experienced  is the spray gets clogged up and you can&#x27;t get more to come out even though there is more left in the bottle.  I am trying to wash off the sprayer each time to see if that works.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything. It left my hair dryer than before application, probably because of the SD 40 and benzyl. I bought just cuz I was desperate to try something, as my porous hair gets really frizzy this time of year. It was a pure waste of money, though. I should have known better.  It&#x27;s been a few hours, and my hair has puffed up bad on the side I sprayed it, as I had only done one side to see effectiveness. It would have been more thrilling to rip twenty dollars up. This is a terrible joke.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years. does not make your hair stiff but does help control friz</li>
            <li> Good product but i&#x27;m not sure that i notice a difference when i use it or don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> this is the winner. I have fine, somewhat coarse hair. I dont know how to use a blow dryer and really have no sense of how to style hair. But it looks like I do now, when I spray this before blowing out. My hair is so flat that no product is at once, volume giving and lightweight AND anti-frizz. I might be wrong but it almost feels like it&#x27;s good for you hair. No product has given me this kind of bouncy hair even on unblowdried hair ! Get it girl. p.s And it smells sublime.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  I love the way it smells and it just gives my hair that extra touch.  Smooth, shiny, silky......  It&#x27;s not heavy, but it is effective, so you don&#x27;t need to use much.  This size canister lasts me a couple of months and my hair is long.  Works great for flat ironing, but you can use it with any style.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, curly hair and this product makes my hair so soft, shiny, and manageable! I tried it on my hair when it is straightened and didn&#x27;t see much improvement, but it makes my curly hair great! Wearing my hair curly a lot more often nowadays because of the product and because of that my hair is much more healthy!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hairspray i had in days. I am not sure why this product is getting discontinued in all the retailers. I wish this one stays.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Straight Sexy Hair Smooth and Seal by my stylist. She used it on my always frizzy, naturally wavy, very thick hair. She spayed this prior to blow drying and when straight ironing my hair. I walked out of the salon with this bottle, it lasted me for several months. It was worth the $20.... but than I came here on Amazon and saw it for $12, pssht I bought two.  If I&#x27;m in a rush I spray this on my hair, use a ceramic round brush and I get this amazing soft straight hair. Please try it out, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I have curly, frizzy hair, its a night mare. When i straight it, it usually waves up, its annoying :(. I live Houston, and the humidity here SUCKS! I usually don&#x27;t even bother doing my hair if its humid outside, which is all the time! I bought this hoping it would help me get straight, sleek hair for at least one day. It didnt leave it super straight, however, it didnt get as frizzy as usually does. I don&#x27;t love the smell, but its a good product.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery. Great Price</li>
            <li> Gotta have this if you want straight beautiful shiny hair.  Keeps away the frizzies -- really!! I&#x27;m been using this product for years.  Even my high-end hairdresser recommends it as a must have.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. I use it as that last step to smoothing my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! It works so well. I have course, naturally curly/wavy hair and my hair is so soft and straight with this product. Make sure you don&#x27;t use too much or spray too close to your hair or it will make it greasy. My hair stays straight for days! Why did I just now discover this product?? I&#x27;ve needed it my whole life! I will never straighten my hair without it ever again. It seriously cuts the straightening time in HALF!</li>
            <li> So about a month ago I got my hair cut and styled and the stylist that I had was using a few products in my hair and while he did great work, my hair is just frizzy. It can not be helped it is in the genetics. So he used this on my hair told me to watch, slightly went over my hair with the flat iron again, and BAM just like that I had stick straight hair. I.FELL.IN.LOVE. For years I have been wrestling with my hair, using potions, serums, crying, begging, and seriously contemplating shaving it all off. It is abused, but well it refuses to stop waving, frizzing and curling with wild abandon.&lt;br /&gt; So long story longer, I bought this magic stuff, it is now perched on my counter like a trophy that I will NOT share, no matter how cute my daughters are. I would recommend this to anyone that currently crying, begging, weilding their razors in the air threatening their hair to straighten up ( pardon the pun) or off with their roots!!!!&lt;br /&gt; I hope that they too can have the shiny stick straight hair of their dreams...Now off to go guard my bottle of magic.</li>
            <li> Great product makes my hair super straight and not frizzy!!!! Fast shipping:)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It works great. It keeps your hair straight and frizz free without feeling greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> I just ordered 2 of these and for the life of me I can&#x27;t figure out why the caps had been removed before shipping.  So the cans arrived just fine, but without tops, so there&#x27;s no way to pack one for travel, but I guess that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I still get mildly frizzy hair and the spray makes me cough. I have to hold my breath and shut my eyes when applying because the heavy aroma kills me. It smells like a salon which I can&#x27;t knock, but up my nose it feels like I&#x27;m inhaling pepper spray. It&#x27;s a very thin and long bottle, so it&#x27;s not recommended for portability use. Other than that, this product comes in handy and I can&#x27;t leave the house without giving it a spray.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t for my hair...maybe mine is too dry.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be without this product! A must have before straightening!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for your hair to keep it straight, silky and shiny without getting frizzy and preventing it from curling when it&#x27;s humid. Unfortunately they have changed the name of this product, made it half the size and now charge double the price. I grabbed a bunch while I could. And the stores you will find something else from now on. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this spray when I use my flat iron</li>
            <li> This item was delivered broken....I am unable to return it so I&#x27;m now stuck with an item that is worthless. The top was broken off I want aa refund</li>
            <li> cannot say enough about this product, have been using it for years.. its leaves your hair very silky.&lt;br /&gt;great for shine too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down like some sprays. I have very wavy thick hair and spray this on before and after blow drying. It helps smooth your hair and have less frizzy&#x27;s. As a bonus it makes brushing tangles out of wet hair much easier. Gives it some shine too!</li>
            <li> Great spray to help straighten and protect your hair without making your hair feel like it has product in it.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is neither straight nor curly, just wavy and fuzzy. This product really helps my hair look both straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> This product makes hair shiny and smooth-- it is especially great and helpful in the summer humidity. It smells fresh too!</li>
            <li> This is the best product i have found to straighten my hair, my friends and my family are using too :)</li>
            <li> I finally got my Stylist to share her secret of how she gets my hair to shine and smell so clean. Now it&#x27;s my secret! Thanks for the great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this product and hard to find in stores. If you straighten your hair and live in high humidity area this product is a must! Also gives hair a great shine. Thanks Amazon for having this product available.</li>
            <li> Works great! I do not go to Florida without it.</li>
            <li> Straight Sexy Hair Smooth &amp; Seal Spray by Sexy Hair is the best stuff I have ever used and it smells great.. im always getting compliments on my hair!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! So nice I&#x27;ll say it twice! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First--I have fairly straight hair, but if I don&#x27;t dry it, it has a lot of wave and some curl. Second--I don&#x27;t use this product according to the directions though--I blow dry my hair and when it is completely dry, I spray this in my hair and then straighten it with a paddle brush and the hair dryer for a few seconds. Works like a dream come true.</li>
            <li> Smells great and made my hair shiny but at a cost....left my fresh clean hair feeling a little greasy.</li>
            <li> Works well! leaves hair shiny with a great smell!</li>
            <li> This product protects my hair from the envoironment, antifreez and makes my hair silky,smooth and shiny. I love it and recomend it if u have long sexy hair</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and the formula has not changed like so many other hair care products.</li>
            <li> This product works fine but it did not have the wow factor that I was expecting after reading some of the reviews. I have very curly hair and I use it to protect my hair when I straighten it. Though it is protecting my hair, it doesn&#x27;t really enhance the look of my hair or make my hair last longer than any other product would. Next time I will just save my money and buy a simple $5 bottle of something that does the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> My daugher loves this stuff and it was the best price around</li>
            <li> I got this stuff because of all of the rave reviews. I certainly won&#x27;t buy it again once this can is gone. It&#x27;s not worth the price, I&#x27;ve gotten the same result from regular/cheaper hair spray (at a much cheaper price). It doesn&#x27;t have the best smell for one.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t get keep my style in hold better than any other hair care products I&#x27;ve had before, and in fact I&#x27;d say it does a worse job. And it didn&#x27;t last long. After about 4-5hours my straight hair was curling (i had been using the kertain 7 day smooth and that was keeping my hair straight for 3-4days). So, honestly wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying this product. Maybe it&#x27;s the simple fact that my hair is fairly curly. But I certainly DO NOT think this is an awesome product, sorry sexy straight, but my hair was anything but...</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my niece at Christmas to use with the PYT flat iron - she is happy and says it works very well.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair shiny and smooth. The price was lower than in the stores. I use it in place of stiff hair spray, so that I have the natural look.</li>
            <li> My hair frizzes really bad in high humidity.  This does the trick, keeps my hair straight and adds shine.  Been using for a long time and plan to continue.</li>
            <li> Great product! Smell great and makes hair really sleek and easy to work with! I have really course Asian hair, and allows me to &amp;#34;manage&amp;#34; and seal my hair, as I have many layers.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere in the stores...Great price and fast shipping. This stuff really works to tame the frizz and give me pretty bouncy curls all day.</li>
            <li> love this hairspray, not greasy and leaves my hair soft and not frizzy</li>
            <li> Straight, non-frizzy hair without a lot of fuss. After shampooing, I spray liberally. Then blow dry with a minimum of care. I can only find travel size bottles locally, so I will keep ordering through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The product make my hair look very oily. I&#x27;ve tried to use it lightly and then just on the ends.  I just just can&#x27;t figure out how to use it without my hair looking wet.</li>
            <li> simply the best! introduced to me by a friend, as I have chemically treated hair, this boosts shine and makes hair soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hairspray that adds shine to your hair. Hard to find but a great product. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Make your hair look smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> Love it only thing that helps keep my hair straight and silky</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only found this product once on a store shelf so I always buy it online.  My stylist recommended it for shine and it&#x27;s fantastic in that regard.</li>
            <li> I really like the product thank u so much</li>
