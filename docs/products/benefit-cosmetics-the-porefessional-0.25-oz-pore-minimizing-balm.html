            <li>I am in love with this product!</li>

            <li>Benefit Porefessional is amazing at covering the press on my face.</li>

            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Love the product</li>
            <li>I generally love products from Benefit</li>
            <li>Immediately after applying, it&#x27;s ok, but it has no staying power.</li>
            <li>Really glad I tried the mini bottle</li>
            <li>Also, this product did not allow me to put make up on over the top of it.</li>
            <li>love this product it keeps my make in place.</li>
            <li>Its one of the better primers that I have tried.</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin you would probably need a more matte primer though.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth powdery finish and nice feel.</li>
            <li>it makes them more enhanced.</li>
            <li>and i lOve it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the silky smooth feel of this ultra light primer.</li>
            <li>Package came quickly and I am pleased.</li>
            <li>It evens out the skin and hides my huge pores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Goes on silky smooth without leaving a greasy feeling at all.  </li>
            <li>one the vendor probably got for free.</li>
            <li>Feels amazing and silky on my skin and really  helps keep my makeup in place, i have oily skin</li>
            <li>Was smaller tube than I expected....but great stuff, have used it for years</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t believe how smooth it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!!!</li>
            <li>Pretty sure it is a sample.</li>
            <li>Have you seen the prices on the full size bottle of this?</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel silky smooth, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I really wish I had looked a little more closely as I would have gotten the regular size tube, but this is great as a travel size!</li>
            <li>Much smaller than expected but still great !</li>
            <li>Its worth it.</li>
            <li>its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but it makes my skin more oily than I would like but other than that its ok</li>
            <li>but I paid right at $15 w/ shipping and its the size of my thumb</li>
            <li>I have very large pores and this product helps a lot.  </li>
            <li>You want to dish out that much for a full size bottle go ahead</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing anything and would quickly order again from Amazing Beauty Emorium, who included a personal note with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I recently had skin cancer removed from the tip of my nose &amp; was able to apply this as coverage during some the recovery period.</li>
            <li>As I have super HUGE pores on my nose, this is the 1 product that gives me alot of self confidence when I&#x27;m out in public.</li>
            <li>so if you have large pores and think this will fix it, think again.</li>
            <li>Really cannot understand the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>then thats fine but do not give it low star ratings because you are incapable of realizing that you are to blame for not reading a product size description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I was very upset at the size.</li>
            <li>If you really want to try it, I would recommend this size...</li>
            <li>Really does work at reducing appearance of pores.</li>
            <li>Helps go on smooth and last all day.</li>
            <li>I really saw no diffrence</li>
            <li>but I should have read more carefully.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very oily</li>
            <li>Great product just very annoyed with the size of it.it pretty much looks like a free gift with the purchase of the big one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying the Full size tube (from the Benefit Cosmetics site.)</li>
            <li>The tube was smaller than trial size and cost more than a larger size.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to realize results; I will continue to use it for a few months; by that time, I should be able to give a better opinion...</li>
            <li>And yes, its a tiny sample size, but worth it.</li>
            <li>The seller should be a little bit more clear about the SAMPLE size.</li>
            <li>Extremely tiny!&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money!</li>
            <li>Only a very tiny amount is needed to give your face full coverage.  </li>
            <li>I always put a base of Neutrogena sunscreen on first, and then the POREfessional, and I&#x27;m good to go!  </li>
            <li>If you are looking to diminish/conceal pores, do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>The fact that I did not see a visible difference only magnified my feeling that I had paid way too much.</li>
            <li>It came out of the tube clumpy like it was old make up.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Smooths skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive face.  </li>
            <li>It maintains your natural skin color.</li>
            <li>It fills your pores making your complexion look natural and even eliminating age spots.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I had to pay 15 dollars for not even a travel size product and second, it left my skin feeling oily and stuffy</li>
            <li>$11 for a little tube smaller than the free tubes of toothpaste you get at the dentist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s maybe marginally better than nothing, but it&#x27;s expensive for only slightly better than your usual routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that i didnt buy the regular size, that&#x27;d be a total waste of money, though this one is not cheap either.</li>

            <li> I expected this to be at least a half size of the full bottle, and it is just barely getting by a fourth of the size.</li>
            <li> Bit smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> It does what it claims in covering up pores and acts as a good base for makeup.</li>
            <li> size was smaller than my pinky finger and did nothing more than every other pore refiner at CVS or Walmart yet the price is crazy</li>
            <li> Vey expensive for little bottle and worked ok</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Package took awhile to get here, not exactly what I expected, I think it git left in the sun, the product was kibd if runny, its not supposed to be</li>
            <li> Very expensive, but I love it.</li>
            <li> although I think even that is a total waste of your money.</li>
            <li> I spent over thirteen bucks on something that gave me acne.</li>
            <li> Read before you buy, this product is very tiny, it&#x27;s a waste of $12.99</li>
            <li> I cannot say that I see any improvement in the size of my pores from using this product, then again there is such a trace amount in this tube, I am not sure that it can be based on my limited usage.  </li>
            <li> Thought this would cover my pores and pok marks better but it does, I am disappointed with the results.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product gets such rave reviews.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products in the past that claim similar results, but don&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> This is very poor business practice and the first time I have found fault with a seller - but I won&#x27;t purchase from them again and they should be ashamed of charging $14.00 for a sample size.  </li>
            <li> Paying  $15 for such a small sized tube is not worthy.</li>
            <li> Too xpensive and very small for what i payed for was expecting more than what i received sadly :/ .</li>
            <li> I saw this product in a retail store for much less.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed less oiliness on my skin.</li>
            <li> I sweep it slightly out from my nose and up and can no longer see my pores.</li>
            <li> i bought a little tester one</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why people are so crazy about this product..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money</li>
            <li> plus the tubs is really small for the price</li>
            <li> It was waaaay too small.</li>
            <li> but this is ridiculously small... is a sample...</li>
            <li> price and size is too small</li>
            <li> My only complaint, is it&#x27;s so darn expensive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE READ OTHER REVIEWS HERE that stated this was a rip off and/or the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the larger sizes and they are all some weird color and real thick and pasty.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive for such a miniscule amount.  </li>
            <li> But its very very small...</li>
            <li> The size is expected because the seller posted the container size, but i dont think it in anyway helped to minimize the pores on my face, which was really disappointing.</li>
            <li> and so far i hate it.</li>
            <li> So small and too expensive, no way...&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I bought it before to read G. Casahuga.</li>
            <li> When I received it, I was so angry as well, how somebody can sell samples.</li>
            <li> I am angry about this, needless to</li>
            <li> And you won&#x27;t get a sample size of an expensive product for $1.</li>
            <li> but im not impressed.</li>
            <li> It did not fill in my pores unfortunately.</li>
            <li> But, I also hated that it was so small.</li>
            <li> You will want to use it sparingly because it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> im really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the price wtf!!</li>

            <li> About the size of a Juicy Fruit chewing gum. Will this be enough for me to use?</li>
            <li> Extremely tiny!&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love the product. Been using it for years. It was the size and price of what I ordered that I did not like. The tube was smaller than trial size and cost more than a larger size.</li>
            <li> Caveat emptor: This is .25 oz size. I didn&#x27;t check, and just paid $12 for a sample. Another seller is selling 1 oz tube for $9.</li>
            <li> Love the product but I was very upset at the size. This is a sample size and I paid $16 bucks for it!</li>
            <li> size was smaller than my pinky finger and did nothing more than every other pore refiner at CVS or Walmart yet the price is crazy</li>
            <li> Really cannot understand the positive reviews.  The product doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL for it&#x27;s intended purpose of diminishing the look of pores.  It may work a bit as a primer, but that is not it&#x27;s stated purpose.  If you are looking to diminish/conceal pores, do not waste your money.  And yes, this is a sample size bottle...a bit smaller than the tiny sample toothpastes you get when you go to the dentist.  If you really want to try it, I would recommend this size...nothing larger...although I think even that is a total waste of your money.</li>
            <li> it says travel size, it says mini.. but IT IS SAMPLE size!!!! I am so angry… it is a shame that someone sells samples!!!???? And for 13us???????</li>
            <li> When I received this product, I was floored by how tiny it was!  It is very expensive for such a miniscule amount.  I cannot say that I see any improvement in the size of my pores from using this product, then again there is such a trace amount in this tube, I am not sure that it can be based on my limited usage.  I generally love products from Benefit but I made a mistake with this order.  I saw this product in a retail store for much less.  The fact that I did not see a visible difference only magnified my feeling that I had paid way too much.</li>
            <li> The size is expected because the seller posted the container size, but i dont think it in anyway helped to minimize the pores on my face, which was really disappointing. I&#x27;m glad that i didnt buy the regular size, that&#x27;d be a total waste of money, though this one is not cheap either.</li>
            <li> Very expensive, but I love it.</li>
            <li> Thought this would cover my pores and pok marks better but it does, I am disappointed with the results.  plus the tubs is really small for the price</li>
            <li> My T-zone is oily, and nothing changes that - so if you have large pores and think this will fix it, think again. It&#x27;s maybe marginally better than nothing, but it&#x27;s expensive for only slightly better than your usual routine. I&#x27;ve tried several of these and nothing works an hour or so later. Immediately after applying, it&#x27;s ok, but it has no staying power.</li>
            <li> Does not work and actually seems to enhance my pores. I did a side by side with my regular primer and with no primer with and without foundation and I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference. It seemed to enhance my pores as compared to using no primer. Really glad I tried the mini bottle</li>
            <li> Really does work at reducing appearance of pores.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!!!! I would give it 5 stars but I paid right at $15 w/ shipping and its the size of my thumb lol!</li>
            <li> This product does not work. I spent over thirteen bucks on something that gave me acne. Also, this product did not allow me to put make up on over the top of it. It came out of the tube clumpy like it was old make up. I am extremely dissatisfied. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Smooths skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive face.  Goes on silky smooth without leaving a greasy feeling at all.  It&#x27;s a must before my foundation.  Helps go on smooth and last all day.</li>
            <li> Paying  $15 for such a small sized tube is not worthy. The primer is good, though. It does what it claims in covering up pores and acts as a good base for makeup.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! I just bought a mini size to see if I would like it and I without a doubt do! There is no con with this product. Package came quickly and I am pleased. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try this product!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. Minimizes the pores, with no detection that it is there. I love it!!!!!!!! You have to try this stuff!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to realize results; I will continue to use it for a few months; by that time, I should be able to give a better opinion...</li>
            <li> Works great! Much smaller than expected but still great ! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product gets such rave reviews. I can&#x27;t tell the difference in my pores after I use it. It smells great tho.</li>
            <li> i wouldnt buy it again.</li>
            <li> epensive for the size</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  I recently had skin cancer removed from the tip of my nose &amp; was able to apply this as coverage during some the recovery period.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to review the product because it&#x27;s excellent, but I need to alert everyone that this size is a SAMPLE size. Unfortunately, I bought it before to read G. Casahuga. When I received it, I was so angry as well, how somebody can sell samples. Very disappointed. Amazon should do something with this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muy molesta con este vendedor. Es tamaño de muestra, asi que tengan cuidado.&lt;br /&gt;No voy a opinar sobre el producto porque es excelente, pero tengo que advertirles que este tamaño es una muestra. Lamentablemente compre este producto antes de leer el review de G. Casahuga. Cuando lo recibi me moleste mucho porque no es posible que alguien venda \\&quot;MUESTRAS\\&quot;. Estoy muy decepcionada. Amazon deberia hacer algo al respecto con este vendedor.</li>
            <li> love this product it keeps my make in place. Plus it smells good.</li>
            <li> this is a sample. one the vendor probably got for free. not the mini!!!</li>
            <li> Too xpensive and very small for what i payed for was expecting more than what i received sadly :/ .</li>
            <li> If I could give it zero starts I would. First of all, I had to pay 15 dollars for not even a travel size product and second, it left my skin feeling oily and stuffy everytime I used it and didn&#x27;t even conceal pores! Don&#x27;t waste your time and money</li>
            <li> I feel ripped off!  The &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; size, I get, but this is  SAMPLE size and I was charged $13.95!  This is very poor business practice and the first time I have found fault with a seller - but I won&#x27;t purchase from them again and they should be ashamed of charging $14.00 for a sample size.  I am angry about this, needless to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen Tindall&lt;br /&gt;Amazon customer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I can only get this in the .25 oz tube. I&#x27;ve tried the larger sizes and they are all some weird color and real thick and pasty.</li>
            <li> Package took awhile to get here, not exactly what I expected, I think it git left in the sun, the product was kibd if runny, its not supposed to be</li>
            <li> I got this in my monthly Birchbox... And used every drop of it! I love the silky smooth feel of this ultra light primer. It&#x27;s tinted so I use this after a moisturizer then I apply powder. It evens out the skin and hides my huge pores.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!</li>
            <li> Feels amazing and silky on my skin and really  helps keep my makeup in place, i have oily skin and this feels oily on my fingers but not on my face at all and doesn&#x27;t look oily whatsoever</li>
            <li> I do not know why people complain about the size. Have you seen the prices on the full size bottle of this? You want to dish out that much for a full size bottle go ahead but if you want to try the product first then the sample size is perfect. And you won&#x27;t get a sample size of an expensive product for $1. It just doesn&#x27;t happen. Plus, the amount/size of the sample IS listed in the product description. Read it before you buy it. Don&#x27;t buy it without reading details and then complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like the product then thats fine but do not give it low star ratings because you are incapable of realizing that you are to blame for not reading a product size description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself - I personally like it. Its one of the better primers that I have tried. I also like DHC Velvet Skin Coat. I have dry skin. These both work great for me. If you have oily skin you would probably need a more matte primer though.</li>
            <li> Was smaller tube than I expected....but great stuff, have used it for years</li>
            <li> I think was my fault... But its very very small...</li>
            <li> I have very large pores and this product helps a lot.  It has a smooth powdery finish and nice feel. Will definitely be ordering the larger size.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!! As I have super HUGE pores on my nose, this is the 1 product that gives me alot of self confidence when I&#x27;m out in public. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying the Full size tube (from the Benefit Cosmetics site.) I&#x27;VE READ OTHER REVIEWS HERE that stated this was a rip off and/or the wrong product. This one wasn&#x27;t. And yes, its a tiny sample size, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed at the size of this for the price. I guess I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the ounce size and assumed it would be bigger than a trial size you get in the mail!  Great product just very annoyed with the size of it.it pretty much looks like a free gift with the purchase of the big one.</li>
            <li> im really disappointed in this product. i bought a little tester one so i could see how it went with my skin and so far i hate it. Its called the POREfessional.... but it doesnt hide my pores at all infact it makes them more enhanced. Everyone on youtube swears by this product but im not impressed. Not to mention the price wtf!! $11 for a little tube smaller than the free tubes of toothpaste you get at the dentist.</li>
            <li> It was waaaay too small. It is sample size and for $13. I can&#x27;t believe I payed for this.</li>
            <li> I paid extra money for this because I thought it would come in a bigger bottle, only to find out it is the same size as the 1 OZ bottle, a rip off.</li>
            <li> I like it but it makes my skin more oily than I would like but other than that its ok</li>
            <li> It helps, but it doesn&#x27;t do everything it says it does. Don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
            <li> This make-up is wonderful!  It glides on so smooth and gives your skin a very soft, flawless appearance.  Although it has a hint of shade to it, you would never know it. It maintains your natural skin color. Only a very tiny amount is needed to give your face full coverage.  You will want to use it sparingly because it is very expensive. I always put a base of Neutrogena sunscreen on first, and then the POREfessional, and I&#x27;m good to go!  I love it!  My only complaint, is it&#x27;s so darn expensive!</li>
            <li> Vey expensive for little bottle and worked ok</li>
            <li> This product came exactly as described in perfect condition still in the box... with more gifts included!  I highly recommend purchasing anything and would quickly order again from Amazing Beauty Emorium, who included a personal note with my purchase.  Wonderful purchase, ideal product, great service.</li>
            <li> I bought this size to test it out and i lOve it.&lt;br /&gt;It cost $10.00 at Macy&#x27;s. I use this,NYX and DHC Velvet. They are all Great products But NYX is the cheapest and you get 0.67 fl oz but made in Taiwan for$14.00 depending what drug store you buy it at These pore concealers do minimize and diminish my flaws and keep me matte in my t-zone area.&lt;br /&gt;Great for a trial run.</li>
            <li> I really saw no diffrence</li>
            <li> At this moment I don&#x27;t have a constructive opinion about the product itself. I&#x27;ve been wearing it daily without make up and I have noticed less oiliness on my skin. But, I also hated that it was so small. I needed a small presentation of the product to try it first but this is ridiculously small... is a sample... and it cost a lot in comparison with the size. The seller should be a little bit more clear about the SAMPLE size.</li>
            <li> This not a resale size. Pretty sure it is a sample. It did not fill in my pores unfortunately. Le sigh..</li>
            <li> I expected this to be at least a half size of the full bottle, and it is just barely getting by a fourth of the size. I may as well just hav bought the full size for twice the price!!! i feel jipped.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel silky smooth, exactly what I was looking for. Bit smaller than I expected but I should have read more carefully.</li>
            <li> it works. I love it!. that&#x27;s all I can say. Get it!! Helps w/ my oil and I&#x27;m very oily</li>
            <li> First time you use this product it is very beautiful and wonderful and I will use it permanently Thank you</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why people are so crazy about this product.. I didn&#x27;t see difference at all. Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> So small and too expensive, no way...&lt;br /&gt;Give me my money back</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.  It fills your pores making your complexion look natural and even eliminating age spots.  You won&#x27;t believe how smooth it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference at all.</li>
            <li> Okay this is a great product but OMG the 0.25 is literally the size of two quarters side by side. I really wish I had looked a little more closely as I would have gotten the regular size tube, but this is great as a travel size!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous and beautiful product and creativity&lt;br /&gt;Ghali price and size is too small&lt;br /&gt;I wished to be larger than that&lt;br /&gt;I benefited from it a lot in closing the pores while laying the foundation cream</li>
            <li> Benefit Porefessional is amazing at covering the press on my face. I have tried other products in the past that claim similar results, but don&#x27;t even compare. My pores are visibly reduced in size allowing my foundation to sit evenly on the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li> Best feeling product I have ever put on my face! I sweep it slightly out from my nose and up and can no longer see my pores.</li>
            <li> Read before you buy, this product is very tiny, it&#x27;s a waste of $12.99</li>
            <li> At first I was upset at how small the tube was for 13 bucks.  Then I realized a big tube was 33. Its worth it. This stuff is amazing, it makes you look flawless wothout any makeup at all.  Im a fan, its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great for covering my wrinkles</li>
