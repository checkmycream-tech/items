            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I user thie for many years</li>
            <li>but I have to run it under the water to get it to apply better.</li>
            <li>Original and nice product.</li>
            <li>because i don&#x27;t read that&#x27;s deodorant) , but it&#x27;s very nice smell and high quality</li>

            <li>Great Deodorant works fine easy to use no mess</li>
            <li>I am a loyal user of this for many years.  </li>
            <li>The Polo Blue smells great</li>
            <li>The brand is worth it!</li>
            <li>simple deodorant that smells good and does not stain your shirts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more comfortable every day no burn under your arms or live stain on your shirts.im</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product was shipped out quickly, and the package arrived intact -- as you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>Worth the money for me.</li>
            <li>just as I wanted because I can be sweat free using this and do not have strong smell of deodorant at the same time.</li>
            <li>Gave the Polo Blue stick a try last year and have been happy with it.</li>
            <li>Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last to long.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My expectations were higher for this Ralph Lauren production.</li>
            <li>when using -- instead of a fresh smell -- my wife consistently said I had body odor until I changed to old spice brand</li>
            <li>It is certainly cheaper than buying it at the mall, but I am concerned that&lt;br /&gt;three of the four containers I ordered were not sealed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Gentle whith the skin, it has discreet scent and very affordable price.</li>
            <li>Also the I received it on time and it was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>this is the real thing.</li>
            <li>Polo Blue by Ralph Lauren has a great scent but it does not last long enough and dissipates too quickly.</li>
            <li>Small size, packs well and happens to go along nicely with Polo Cologne.</li>
            <li>highly recommend to evryone</li>
            <li>I am allergic to many other deodorant products and so far no problems with this one.</li>
            <li>Really nice scent and fights off my tendency to stank up for at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I like the Green one better.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent in general and</li>
            <li>Love the product, but not sure yet</li>
            <li>Goes really well with Polo blue cologne</li>
            <li>May be really old.......</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sensitive with this deodorant</li>
            <li>Clearly, fragrances are a personal choice -- but having said that, I like this</li>
            <li>Regular Polo is rather putrid, but this is rather classy</li>

            <li> Stick lasts awhile, smells great, Polo quality. Goes really well with Polo blue cologne</li>
            <li> Hard to find but got it just in time for Christmas. Wish it was cheaper but it&#x27;s a limited item so I&#x27;m  not complaining.</li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last to long. Especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> Provides the deodorant protection without the alcohol ingredient.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my cousin and he liked it.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent in general and the deodorant is great.  It contains NO alcohol.  I&#x27;m uncomfortable with nearly all common brands, and tend to get rashes due to the alcohol.  this one does the job with no side effects.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this deodorant</li>
            <li> The only fragrance my wife likes so she me made me give it 5 stars (kidding).</li>
            <li> Even though you are saving between $7-$10(including taxes), the quality of the deodorant will disappoint you. The smell don&#x27;t even last like the one I bought from Bloomingdale&#x27;s. Scent is gone after an hour. This actually feels messy on your armpit unlike the one bought from Bloomingdale&#x27;s where the substance applies onto your skin slowly. May be really old.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, there was a piece of hair in one of the unused deodorant, I em editing this review since I saw it just now....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far very disgusting and disappointing.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle whith the skin, it has discreet scent and very affordable price. Bought at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Have used it for several years now. I am allergic to many other deodorant products and so far no problems with this one. Also the I received it on time and it was packaged very well. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product just as I wanted because I can be sweat free using this and do not have strong smell of deodorant at the same time. The brand is worth it!</li>
            <li> Ok,&lt;br /&gt;A simple deodorant that smells good and does not stain your shirts.  Small size, packs well and happens to go along nicely with Polo Cologne.</li>
            <li> Was a fan of the Polo SPort deodorant stick for years before it was phased out. Gave the Polo Blue stick a try last year and have been happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I am a loyal user of this for many years.  Amazon price much better than the store price.</li>
            <li> when using -- instead of a fresh smell -- my wife consistently said I had body odor until I changed to old spice brand</li>
            <li> I use this for the ease of use and great smell, makes the perfect gift for every man, treat yourself.</li>
            <li> Really nice scent and fights off my tendency to stank up for at least 24 hours. Regular Polo is rather putrid, but this is rather classy</li>
            <li> Good quality at a cost-effective price</li>
            <li> Great product.  I would buy it again.  I like it because I do not break out using it.</li>
            <li> Great Deodorant works fine easy to use no mess</li>
            <li> Great. I now have polo blue and limited edition polo red. A little upset they don&#x27;t make polo red deodorant anymore so this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> It is certainly cheaper than buying it at the mall, but I am concerned that&lt;br /&gt;three of the four containers I ordered were not sealed.  I just wonder&lt;br /&gt;if this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but not sure yet how well it will work in summer (warmer temperature). Will find out in a few months.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product was to my satisfaction. Clearly, fragrances are a personal choice -- but having said that, I like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was shipped out quickly, and the package arrived intact -- as you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> The only stick that doesn&#x27;t act as an irritant on my skin. Smells great of course!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love it. Each stick will last two or three months depending on how much/often you use it. Worth the money for me. No aluminum like the others that give cancer. Just found it on Amazon, so I will be ordering a few.</li>
            <li> Very nice product I use this at all the time my skin it&#x27;s sensitive with this deodorant I&#x27;m more comfortable every day no burn under your arms or live stain on your shirts.im highly recommend to evryone</li>
            <li> My fiance only wears Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Polo deodorant.  It is so fragrant that he does not need the cologne.  It smells great and the price is a great bargain.  Saved at least $2.00.</li>
            <li> I user thie for many years</li>
            <li> The only deodorant my husband will use.</li>
            <li> Original and nice product.</li>
            <li> Polo Blue by Ralph Lauren has a great scent but it does not last long enough and dissipates too quickly. My expectations were higher for this Ralph Lauren production. Quite unfortunate when I think about. I was somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> A fantastic deodorant stick that really works around the clock for a great price. Can&#x27;t be beaten!!! I can advise it to everyone.</li>
            <li> If you are a Polo Blue fan then this is the deodorant for you.  Not a lot of chemicals, easy to apply, works well, and smells good.  Even after a workout the scent remains.</li>
            <li> I order this item i think it&#x27;s perfume at first lol (because i don&#x27;t read that&#x27;s deodorant) , but it&#x27;s very nice smell and high quality thank you</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Great item !</li>
            <li> I like the Green one better. The Green one melts or should I say goes on easier. The Polo Blue smells great but I have to run it under the water to get it to apply better.</li>
