            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>find the more I rave about a product,</li>
            <li>the more it seems to be utilized</li>
            <li>Since I started using this, along with the 5 minute face lift, I&#x27;ve been told my sking glows, which is pretty remarkable for my age (almost 70).</li>
            <li>VERY RICH MOISTURIZER..WOULD BUY AGAIN ...</li>
            <li>Anti Aging Skin Care, Diminishes the Appearance of Fine Lines, Wrinkles &amp; Sagging Skin on &amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to smooth on.</li>

            <li>This is a fantastic product that delivers what it promises.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin soft but not greasy and it leaves skin looking good.  </li>
            <li>It is really a product that works!!!</li>
            <li>Was hesitant to order at first, but glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already excited about it</li>
            <li>like it enough will probably buy again when run out - seems to help fine wrinkles and price was good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit concerned about my skin injesting something that does not have full ingredients listed.  </li>
            <li>a Whole Lot Better.</li>
            <li>It has really helped my arms look much better.</li>
            <li>It is really good in smoothing dry and winkling skin.  </li>
            <li>Has a pleasant low key fragrance and is a great product for middle age skin that has sun damage.</li>
            <li>IT GOES ON LIGHT AND DRIES FAST NOT GREASY.</li>
            <li>Extracts Calm Irritation .Anti</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Skin Perfect was not a great moisturizer for me at all.</li>
            <li>Smooth under your makeup, not greasy and your skin feels vibrant.</li>
            <li>Nice texture,don&#x27;t leave my skin dry</li>
            <li>HOPING TO  BE ABLE TO BUY A BIG CONTAINER..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only in my early 60s, but I want my skin to stay nice and supple, not crepey, and this product really works!</li>
            <li>Really did nothing more than jergens lotion but much bigger price tag.</li>
            <li>I really like it as my facial moisturizer - as well or better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>The write up says &amp;#34;Treats Skin with a Special Blend of Natural OIL and SHEA BUTTER</li>
            <li>Have been using mainly on my arms which have gotten lots of sun this summer, really has them looking smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if this works well or not, but it&#x27;s NOT offensive odor, and it&#x27;s a large tube, so you have plenty of time to see if it works for you.  </li>
            <li>It dried up and wrinkled my skin more!</li>
            <li>this amazing cream truly does help eliminate crepy skin--like on the bottom of your upper arm and on the saggy skin above your knee.  </li>
            <li>It really felt like a soothing drink of water on my face.</li>
            <li>I really felt like it&#x27;s helped my skin, even after it recovered from my Nioxin mishap, and I&#x27;m not a kid</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t really absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li>Full ingredients are not clearly listed;  No clinical evidence is cited that proves product performance as a whole.  </li>
            <li>Also great on the arms for aging thin skin.  </li>
            <li>It really does help with &amp;#34;crepe paper skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This product delivers and delivers fast.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see it doing much for the &amp;#34;crepe&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m even more pleased that it is actually affordable enough to use regularly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it and especially for the more mature ladies.</li>
            <li>I have eliminated most of my other products.  </li>
            <li>I started buying moisturizers right and left, and stopped using the Nioxin of course, because that was the first culprit on my list.</li>
            <li>So Skin A Whole Lot Better, can you make a facial moisturizer that accomplishes the same thing</li>
            <li>I have my smooth, soft legs back.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it and the seller, too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This cream is extremely emollient &amp; goes on easily, leaving skin feeling softer immediately after application.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this is different from other moisturizers, but it does give you a nice natural glow.</li>
            <li>I love it especially in the winter when skin gets very dry</li>
            <li>cause still new for me</li>
            <li>It hydrates my skin better than more expensive formulas!</li>
            <li>I was totally disappointed with the DermaSilk Skin Perfect.  </li>
            <li>Makes my dry skin super soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Wow, my skin miraculously looks AND feels healthy after one application without a heavy perfume or greasy feeling!</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry, crepe-paper skin on my lower legs due to many medications.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m pushing 49 years old).</li>
            <li>This product really does work on wrinkles with daily use and patting it in as opposed to rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>SO FAR</li>
            <li>It always keep the skin soft and takes away dryness.  </li>
            <li>Works well made my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li>No messy residue to get on your clothes.</li>
            <li>A Unique Combination of GREEN TEA and CHAMOMILE Help SOOTHE Skin</li>
            <li>My hands were looking much older than they should and regular lotion was not doing the trick.</li>
            <li>I use it with my other Derma Silk serums like right under the chin area and forearms where the skin tends to look dehydrated.</li>
            <li>My face is smoother, the wrinkles are lessened, and comes in a large enough size to last nearly 2 months.</li>
            <li>I am an Esthetician in my mid-40&#x27;s and have tried NUMEROUS professional creams and OTC stuff on my face.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really good in the cold weather we are having.</li>
            <li>Hide the tube, your friends will be stealing it, or borrowing it, or using it behind your back, or better yet, buy 2, as one may disappear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I first found it at CVS, but they were sold out of it today, so here I am at amazon and the price was actually a little bit cheaper here.</li>
            <li>Excellent for severely dry crepey skin, especially the thin skin on the arms, where weather &amp; age may have left your skin looking tired &amp;/or saggy.</li>
            <li>With daily usage my skin does not dry out at all.  </li>
            <li>still using it not long enough to see results yet.</li>

            <li> The write up says &amp;#34;Treats Skin with a Special Blend of Natural OIL and SHEA BUTTER</li>
            <li> Have been using mainly on my arms which have gotten lots of sun this summer, really has them looking smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this works well or not, but it&#x27;s NOT offensive odor, and it&#x27;s a large tube, so you have plenty of time to see if it works for you.  </li>
            <li> It dried up and wrinkled my skin more!</li>
            <li> this amazing cream truly does help eliminate crepy skin--like on the bottom of your upper arm and on the saggy skin above your knee.  </li>
            <li> It really felt like a soothing drink of water on my face.</li>
            <li> I really felt like it&#x27;s helped my skin, even after it recovered from my Nioxin mishap, and I&#x27;m not a kid</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t really absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li> Full ingredients are not clearly listed;  No clinical evidence is cited that proves product performance as a whole.  </li>
            <li> Also great on the arms for aging thin skin.  </li>
            <li> It really does help with &amp;#34;crepe paper skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product delivers and delivers fast.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see it doing much for the &amp;#34;crepe&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m even more pleased that it is actually affordable enough to use regularly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it and especially for the more mature ladies.</li>
            <li> I have eliminated most of my other products.  </li>
            <li> I started buying moisturizers right and left, and stopped using the Nioxin of course, because that was the first culprit on my list.</li>
            <li> So Skin A Whole Lot Better, can you make a facial moisturizer that accomplishes the same thing</li>
            <li> I have my smooth, soft legs back.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it and the seller, too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This cream is extremely emollient &amp; goes on easily, leaving skin feeling softer immediately after application.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is different from other moisturizers, but it does give you a nice natural glow.</li>
            <li> I love it especially in the winter when skin gets very dry</li>
            <li> cause still new for me</li>
            <li> It hydrates my skin better than more expensive formulas!</li>
            <li> I was totally disappointed with the DermaSilk Skin Perfect.  </li>
            <li> Makes my dry skin super soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Wow, my skin miraculously looks AND feels healthy after one application without a heavy perfume or greasy feeling!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, crepe-paper skin on my lower legs due to many medications.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m pushing 49 years old).</li>
            <li> This product really does work on wrinkles with daily use and patting it in as opposed to rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> SO FAR</li>
            <li> It always keep the skin soft and takes away dryness.  </li>
            <li> Works well made my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li> No messy residue to get on your clothes.</li>
            <li> A Unique Combination of GREEN TEA and CHAMOMILE Help SOOTHE Skin</li>
            <li> My hands were looking much older than they should and regular lotion was not doing the trick.</li>
            <li> I use it with my other Derma Silk serums like right under the chin area and forearms where the skin tends to look dehydrated.</li>
            <li> My face is smoother, the wrinkles are lessened, and comes in a large enough size to last nearly 2 months.</li>
            <li> I am an Esthetician in my mid-40&#x27;s and have tried NUMEROUS professional creams and OTC stuff on my face.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really good in the cold weather we are having.</li>
            <li> Hide the tube, your friends will be stealing it, or borrowing it, or using it behind your back, or better yet, buy 2, as one may disappear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I first found it at CVS, but they were sold out of it today, so here I am at amazon and the price was actually a little bit cheaper here.</li>
            <li> Excellent for severely dry crepey skin, especially the thin skin on the arms, where weather &amp; age may have left your skin looking tired &amp;/or saggy.</li>
            <li> With daily usage my skin does not dry out at all.  </li>
            <li> still using it not long enough to see results yet.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old with average wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Only been using it a week so whether it helps crepe skin is still unknown.</li>
            <li> and then my skin got really dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> It says it restores dry parched crepe paper skin.  </li>
            <li> It says on the container, \\&quot;Restores Dry, Parched Crepe-Paper Skin\\&quot; and they&#x27;re not kidding!</li>
            <li> maybe I will look little younger skin,I hope</li>
            <li> My only sadness: It&#x27;s a bit too heavy for my face.</li>
            <li> Compared to many other creams and moisturizers, this stuff isn&#x27;t bad price-wise, so why not give it a go and see what you think?</li>
            <li> The stuff&#x27;s not cheap--it&#x27;s about $25 for 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> have tried other lotions but they were never satisfactory</li>
            <li> It did not improve the dry skin on my legs even a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is that I ordered 3 and recieved 2 and another 5 min.</li>
            <li> keeps your face, neck, or arms become less wrinkled.</li>
            <li> I still noticed the crepe-iness the product was supposed to make less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Something not right!</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy and rolls up in little balls.....</li>
            <li> Winter is here--this is a necessary item for cold, cold winter to keep you smooth &amp; protected.</li>
            <li> Minimal fragrance, smooths on nicely, not greasy.</li>
            <li> I mean it can be used as a moisture cream under make up or alone, also as a night cream.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has thin, crepe paper type skin.  </li>
            <li> I believe if I were to follow the instructions I would see a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> I purchased one tube in a store, and since then I&#x27;ve been unable to find it again except online.  </li>
            <li> Product has been difficult to obtain and price is expensive.</li>
            <li> (silly me!).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Weird...</li>
            <li> but this winter has been especially hard on my skin.</li>
            <li> AS THEY WERE NOT AS BAD.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have bad &amp;#34;crepe paper&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Terrible for my skin</li>
            <li> It is terribly dehydrated.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference and I experienced an allergic reaction to it. It dried up and wrinkled my skin more!</li>
            <li> Not what I was looking for will never buy this item again my skin looks the same I used as directed and no change</li>
            <li> I love this product. keeps your face, neck, or arms become less wrinkled. Was hesitant to order at first, but glad I did.</li>
            <li> I began using this out of desperation because I was actually having an allergic reaction to Nioxin products I was using on my hair, which had never happened before. It started off with what I believe was a Niacin flush and then my skin got really dry and flaky. NOTHING I used on my faced helped; I kind of looked like a leper (pardon those who suffer from Hansen&#x27;s Disease)! I started buying moisturizers right and left, and stopped using the Nioxin of course, because that was the first culprit on my list. Nothing I used helped except for the Dermasilk. It really felt like a soothing drink of water on my face. It says on the container, \\&quot;Restores Dry, Parched Crepe-Paper Skin\\&quot; and they&#x27;re not kidding! The stuff&#x27;s not cheap--it&#x27;s about $25 for 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way. I use it under sunscreen in the mornings and I use it before bed. I really felt like it&#x27;s helped my skin, even after it recovered from my Nioxin mishap, and I&#x27;m not a kid either (I&#x27;m pushing 49 years old). I wish I had known about this a lot sooner. Compared to many other creams and moisturizers, this stuff isn&#x27;t bad price-wise, so why not give it a go and see what you think? I first found it at CVS, but they were sold out of it today, so here I am at amazon and the price was actually a little bit cheaper here.</li>
            <li> Loving this cream, my skin feels and looks so much nicer.  Highly recommend it and the seller, too.</li>
            <li> like it enough will probably buy again when run out - seems to help fine wrinkles and price was good</li>
            <li> This works beautifully. I can see a difference in my skin. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Really did nothing more than jergens lotion but much bigger price tag. So disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Terrible for my skin I had bumps that I never had before and am still trying to get rid of them</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a Marshalls store and really liked it so I looked on Amazon to order more of it. I am 63 years old with average wrinkles. I do think it makes my skin look better. I use it every night.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. The product doesn&#x27;t really absorb into my skin. I still noticed the crepe-iness the product was supposed to make less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Love it, it absorbs so easily, the best I&#x27;ve found anywhere and so reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have noticed that my skin has improved, I am very satisfied with this product. I will continue buying this hand cream. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find Skin Perfect online.  I purchased one tube in a store, and since then I&#x27;ve been unable to find it again except online.  I really like it as my facial moisturizer - as well or better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  I do hope the makers are not planning to delete it from their product line.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It hydrates my skin better than more expensive formulas!</li>
            <li> I saw no difference in my skin&#x27;s texture or tone with the use of this product.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do as it claims</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizer.  Makes skin look and feel very nice.</li>
            <li> I started using this when I purchased it initially on sale at the drugstore.... then they did not have it any longer...  Found it on Amazon and I love it!! Makes your skin feel silky smooth and is not greasy!</li>
            <li> i love this cream and want go without it</li>
            <li> still using it not long enough to see results yet.</li>
            <li> This product really does work on wrinkles with daily use and patting it in as opposed to rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> I really love  the skin perfect. It makes my skin feel really good in the cold weather we are having.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a month as saw no noticeable difference. The product did not absorb into the skin and felt greasy.</li>
            <li> Ok does blend well and goes into skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this cream. It&#x27;s moisturizing without being oily and my skin looks wonderful.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING FOR 2 WEEKS AND YES I DO SEE SOME IMPROVEMENT.  IT GOES ON LIGHT AND DRIES FAST NOT GREASY. I STILL HAVE A TURKEY NECK BUT IS IS GETTING BETTER. I FOUND IT WORKED BETTER ON MY ARMS AS THEY WERE NOT AS BAD. I HAVE USED ALOT OF DIFFERENT CREAMS AND LOTIONS SO FAR THIS IS THE BEST ONE FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I have eliminated most of my other products.  I really love it and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Winter is here--this is a necessary item for cold, cold winter to keep you smooth &amp; protected. blah, blah, blah, blah, blah</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this works well or not, but it&#x27;s NOT offensive odor, and it&#x27;s a large tube, so you have plenty of time to see if it works for you.  I didn&#x27;t have bad &amp;#34;crepe paper&amp;#34; skin.  It is a bit greasy and rolls up in little balls..... The write up says &amp;#34;Treats Skin with a Special Blend of Natural OIL and SHEA BUTTER That Penetrates the Skin to NOURISH From Within. A Unique Combination of GREEN TEA and CHAMOMILE Help SOOTHE Skin While Botanical ..Extracts Calm Irritation .Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream for All in One for Face, Neck &amp; Body - Best Anti Aging Cream, Best Anti-wrinkle Cream, Instant-lift Solution. Anti Aging Skin Care, Diminishes the Appearance of Fine Lines, Wrinkles &amp; Sagging Skin on &amp;#34;  That&#x27;s some GREAT promises!.  Perhaps I&#x27;ll update my review after my tube is finished....  I don&#x27;t use close my eyes, but it may not matter.  Full ingredients are not clearly listed;  No clinical evidence is cited that proves product performance as a whole.  I don&#x27;t think this will go good UNDER makeup since it does roll over the skin in balls.  That tells me it doesn&#x27;t absorb well.  I&#x27;m a bit concerned about my skin injesting something that does not have full ingredients listed.  So, I will mostly use this on my neck...no change yet there....</li>
            <li> This lotion absorbs thoroughly and is non-greasy. I use this on my body and as a night cream. It is really a product that works!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best creams ever for all around use.  By that I mean it can be used as a moisture cream under make up or alone, also as a night cream.  It always keep the skin soft and takes away dryness.  I would highly recommend it and especially for the more mature ladies.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has thin, crepe paper type skin.  It is an excellent product!  Great!</li>
            <li> I love it. I have used it for years. The Store where I would buy it no longer sales it.  I was so happy to find it on line.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to smooth on. Not greasy feeling and most of all it works.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I do not use as instructions say to do but I have seen a difference! I believe if I were to follow the instructions I would see a dramatic difference. I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for your face and neck.  Smooth under your makeup, not greasy and your skin feels vibrant. Also great on the arms for aging thin skin.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Yes this makes your&#x27;e skin look lovely. I don&#x27;t know why this is different from other moisturizers, but it does give you a nice natural glow.I use this on my arms, when I am wearing sleeveles outfits and I can&#x27;t stop looking at my skin lol It is good on your&#x27;e face too. I have used it over my five minute facelift and it is great.</li>
            <li> This is actually cheaper than in the stores and is the same product.  It really does help with &amp;#34;crepe paper skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Makes my dry skin super soft and supple. Has a pleasant low key fragrance and is a great product for middle age skin that has sun damage.</li>
            <li> It is really good in smoothing dry and winkling skin.  Best Anti Aging  Moisturizer ever.....</li>
            <li> LOVE this product and will use it for the rest of time. I am an Esthetician in my mid-40&#x27;s and have tried NUMEROUS professional creams and OTC stuff on my face.  This product delivers and delivers fast.  The lines on my forehead and around my eyes softened almost instantly!  Typically topical creams take awhile to produce any results.  Not this line!  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Only been using it a week so whether it helps crepe skin is still unknown. But product is very light, no scent and feels very good on the skin. I think I&#x27;d buy it again just for that reason alone!</li>
            <li> I use it with my other Derma Silk serums like right under the chin area and forearms where the skin tends to look dehydrated.</li>
            <li> I saw the &amp;#34;paper skin&amp;#34; comments on the box and immediately decided to try it. If applied twice a day, I saw good results. Product has been difficult to obtain and price is expensive. I think if price were lower and easily available, I&#x27;d probably stick with it.</li>
            <li> I am 73 and this is the best lotion I have found for leathery skin.  My skin has improved greatly..</li>
            <li> Great product!  Light and smooths lines!</li>
            <li> CVS no longer sells this product.  I have been using it for over 6 months and have seen a difference.  My face is smoother, the wrinkles are lessened, and comes in a large enough size to last nearly 2 months.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!! Would definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> VERY RICH MOISTURIZER..WOULD BUY AGAIN ...HOPING TO  BE ABLE TO BUY A BIG CONTAINER.. BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH</li>
            <li> Works well made my skin feel soft.  With daily usage my skin does not dry out at all.  I whis I could find it locally to buy.</li>
            <li> Nice texture,don&#x27;t leave my skin dry and that&#x27;s what I like,let&#x27;s see cause still new for me maybe I will look little younger skin,I hope</li>
            <li> I was totally disappointed with the DermaSilk Skin Perfect.  It says it restores dry parched crepe paper skin.  It did not improve the dry skin on my legs even a little bit.  Someone else told me to try Gold Bond Ultimate and it is amazing.  Skin Perfect was not a great moisturizer for me at all.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have extremely dry, crepe-paper skin on my lower legs due to many medications.  This product is wonderful.  I have my smooth, soft legs back.</li>
            <li> have tried other lotions but they were never satisfactory and so I decided to try skin perfect and I am glad I did</li>
            <li> this amazing cream truly does help eliminate crepy skin--like on the bottom of your upper arm and on the saggy skin above your knee.  I&#x27;m 66 and looking better in both these areas.  Try it.</li>
            <li> I used it for over a year.</li>
            <li> This was what I was looking for.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good moisturizing cream but nothing else. It&#x27;s not helping with wrinkles. Not a miracle cream.</li>
            <li> this product does everything it says it will</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it Skin Perfect, but I would call it Skin a Whole Lot Better. I was stunned to see that the crepe-y stuff on my arms was gone or greatly diminished. My only sadness: It&#x27;s a bit too heavy for my face. Even at my age, my pores get clogged, and there&#x27;s nothing sadder than a gray-haired granny with zits. So Skin A Whole Lot Better, can you make a facial moisturizer that accomplishes the same thing but without that pore-clogging side effect?</li>
            <li> This is a really nice lotion but I don&#x27;t see it doing much for the &amp;#34;crepe&amp;#34; apperance on my skin.  Absorbs nicely.  Just got it though.  If anything changes.  I will update.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Only complaint I have is that I ordered 3 and recieved 2 and another 5 min. face lift (which I will use), but makes it that I will have to re-order sooner than planned.</li>
            <li> Excellent for severely dry crepey skin, especially the thin skin on the arms, where weather &amp; age may have left your skin looking tired &amp;/or saggy. This cream is extremely emollient &amp; goes on easily, leaving skin feeling softer immediately after application. Hide the tube, your friends will be stealing it, or borrowing it, or using it behind your back, or better yet, buy 2, as one may disappear.&lt;br /&gt;I find the more I rave about a product, the more it seems to be utilized (silly me!).&lt;br /&gt;This one deserves the kudos! It has really helped my arms look much better.</li>
            <li> My face loves this stuff! Soooo moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Makes skin soft but not greasy and it leaves skin looking good.  No messy residue to get on your clothes.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> wonderful product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Since I started using this, along with the 5 minute face lift, I&#x27;ve been told my sking glows, which is pretty remarkable for my age (almost 70). I&#x27;ve added Miracle Moisturizer and Miracle cream, but I don&#x27;t see a difference since I did so.</li>
            <li> excellent product-keeps my aging skin bruise free!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKED FOR ME</li>
            <li> the best lotion I ever used.</li>
            <li> This product is so nice. Minimal fragrance, smooths on nicely, not greasy. Almost 1/2 the price when purchased online vs. local pharmacy. I&#x27;m only in my early 60s, but I want my skin to stay nice and supple, not crepey, and this product really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 36 but this winter has been especially hard on my skin. It is terribly dehydrated. My hands were looking much older than they should and regular lotion was not doing the trick. I just received this and put it on my hands. Wow, my skin miraculously looks AND feels healthy after one application without a heavy perfume or greasy feeling! I wish I had taken a photo. I can&#x27;t wait to use it on my face, neck and knees. I&#x27;m already excited about it and I&#x27;m even more pleased that it is actually affordable enough to use regularly. I&#x27;m giving the second bottle I bought to my mom who can&#x27;t seem to get rid of the crepe look on her arms. I think this is going to make her day! Try it.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s up with this stuff?  Softens BUT, rolls up if you even rub an area of your arm or leg...Weird...Something not right!</li>
            <li> I personally would take a bath in this stuff. I love it especially in the winter when skin gets very dry also I recommend that people drink plenty of water which helps in staying warm in winter and hydrating the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Have been using mainly on my arms which have gotten lots of sun this summer, really has them looking smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product that delivers what it promises.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd tube.</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer!!</li>
