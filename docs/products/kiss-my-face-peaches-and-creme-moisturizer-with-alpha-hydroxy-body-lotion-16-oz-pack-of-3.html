            <li>At your own risk.</li>
            <li>My favorite hand and body lotion just cause it smells so good.</li>
            <li>So I was thrilled to find it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It moisturizes nicely without being greasy, and the scent is \\&quot;divine\\&quot; as she says.</li>
            <li>I love the 3-pack and am so glad I found it!</li>
            <li>this is the first lotion that keeps my hands in great condition...</li>
            <li>The number one thing I love about this lotion is its smell.  </li>
            <li>I find that I end up using it more at bedtime.  </li>
            <li>Love having lots of it on hand (no pun intended).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been my favorite since then.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is much better than at the store....</li>
            <li>This goes on light, not greasy, and has a nice fruity smell.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>It also keeps my hands nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>love it.....</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Use under cover and the cover goes on smoothly!</li>
            <li>I have some to my friends and they love it too.</li>
            <li>I liked it because it is a rich and creamy lotion.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>It went on a bit strong but lightened up over time.  </li>
            <li>I tried shampoo free, nothing.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li>the cream itself is so smooth and non greasy.</li>
            <li>The lotion is wonderful and keeps skin soft, I only wish the scent wasn&#x27;t this strong.</li>
            <li>we would not be willing to put in our mouths, and I ended up trying this after many varieties of lotions.</li>
            <li>The alpha hydroxy acids help my face to look fresh and hydrated in the morning!</li>
            <li>It literally smells like fresh peaches!</li>
            <li>I had worn a clean T-shirt after I applied this lotion for about 2 hours without perspiring (I had just bathed and was sitting watching TV before bed).  </li>
            <li>When we first opened the bottles it smelled AMAZING.,,,, exactly like fresh peaches.</li>
            <li>The scent is still to die for - smells exactly like real, fresh peaches, but it doesn&#x27;t soak in well and feels sticky on my skin.  </li>
            <li>strong smell at first but goes away after a bit</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who has dry skin and is looking for a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The lotion is quickly absorbed and moisurizing.  </li>
            <li>And I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>It smelled SO peachy and fresh when I opened the bottle in the store</li>
            <li>This lotion is great -the gentle fruit and sugar based exfoliating acids give this lotion an extra punch to do wonders that normal moisturizing ingredients alone can&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li>it was most likely the AHA content.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was because of my laundry machine</li>
            <li>I figured I just had a spoiled bottle that had perhaps been shipped in a hot truck and chalked it up to that.  </li>
            <li>it was the smell that got me first.</li>
            <li>My Face product with a relatively low percentage of AHAs suitable for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that the smell, while lovely at first - and as the other reviewer said, VERY true to the real smell of ripe peaches, it can become a bit overpowering after using it for a while.  </li>
            <li>So we rubbed it all over our arms and couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and just rub this over my whole body...</li>
            <li>I wish that KMF would take the same exfoliating properties and put them in a lighter scented or even fragrance free lotion.  </li>
            <li>I picked this lotion up at Whole Foods solely based on the smell.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it very often because of this.</li>
            <li>and I really like the Kiss</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s not over-powered by perfumes like a lot of other lotions are.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a BAD smell, I loved it at first, but when you want to use it daily to keep up the softness after a while your nose can get a bit tired of the peach smell.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, not true for me or the man in my life - he loves the scent:)</li>
            <li>I tried high quality shampoos, nothing.  </li>
            <li>And at 45, I consider this product a main contributor to my nearly wrinkle-free</li>
            <li>I also had dry patches that it improved better than other lotions.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to smell fruity, you should steer clear.</li>
            <li>While I DO always want my skin to be soft, I DON&#x27;T always want to smell like a peach.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my complexion clear and young looking.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be keeping my 80 yr old skin clear.  </li>
            <li>I also have a female friend who really dislikes the scent.  </li>
            <li>too thick, but worked ok</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very light, hardly noticeable after having it on a few minutes, just a fresh odor later.</li>
            <li>In a professional office environment you don&#x27;t always want to be walking around smelling like peaches all day long because the scent really does last.  </li>
            <li>Since I was only forty, I wasn&#x27;t ready for the more expensive, prescription-required retinol products.  </li>
            <li>This is my last purchase of Kiss My Face products, as none of the lotions they carry has the same AHA benefit as the old Vanilla.</li>
            <li>I personally could smell it and it really grossed me out, my friend on the other hand could not</li>
            <li>It was still hard to rub in, and the smell started peachy but quickly turned...unpleasant.  </li>

            <li> A lot of times the fragrance is a pale comparision to the real scent.  </li>
            <li> The scent and fragrance of this lotion is like cutting into a fresh peach in summer !!!</li>
            <li> Especially for the reasonable price, you&#x27;d he hard pressed to find anything that could leave you softer.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of lotions because my hands get really dry, especially in the winter...</li>
            <li> Cleared up dry skin on my arms that I had been dealing with for years.</li>
            <li> I bought this even though previously I had purchased the same lotion and found it to have a \\&quot;BO\\&quot; smell.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have used this lotion for at least four years now.</li>
            <li> For those who have impaired sense of smell, please be careful with this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I purchase this despite the other reviews I read about the cat pee smell.</li>
            <li> Knowing that, I used a small amount after my next shower.  </li>
            <li> agree with other reviewers that there is a slight sting and redness immediately after applying the product, but I believe that is just the AHAs doing their job.  </li>
            <li> Upon receiving this lotion, I opened it and detected a slight sour odor, but tried it anyway.  </li>
            <li> You only need a very , very small amount!  </li>
            <li> Then a few minutes after that a guy came in and exclaimed &amp;#34;D*&amp;n!</li>
            <li> Vinegar helped, but made my hair look terrible if I used it in large enough quantities to make a difference.  </li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t had the pleasure of smelling cat urine in person, it has a unique mildewy, musky, sickeningly maple-esque quality.</li>
            <li> Once she slathered it on, she warned me it was hard to rub in.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes well, but it&#x27;s hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my FACE at bedtime for the past 10 years!  </li>
            <li> This lotion seriously smells like ripe peaches.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> , unfortunately, the peach smell will come off but that urine smell stayed for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> The fragrance is mediocre, and so is the moisturizing.</li>
            <li> After wearing it for a few minutes the smell is absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> I know this is not what this product is designed for, but I got desperate and tried it.  </li>
            <li> , I was powerless to resist it!  </li>

            <li> My husband worked with his hands. He found this cream while working as an electrician in a construction setting. He used it ti soften his hands, and now retired, he uses it on hands and feet.</li>
            <li> Best stuff! I keep it in stock</li>
            <li> The number one thing I love about this lotion is its smell.  A lot of times the fragrance is a pale comparision to the real scent.  This lotion seriously smells like ripe peaches.  The lotion is quickly absorbed and moisurizing.  The price here on Amazon though will not save you any money.</li>
            <li> I purchase this despite the other reviews I read about the cat pee smell. I gave one of the bottles to a friend of mine at work. When we first opened the bottles it smelled AMAZING.,,,, exactly like fresh peaches. So we rubbed it all over our arms and couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and just rub this over my whole body...&lt;br /&gt;10 minutes later. A lady walks in the office and says &amp;#34;Whew! Man something has mildewed, there must be a leak from the bathrooms Ugh&amp;#34;. Then a few minutes after that a guy came in and exclaimed &amp;#34;D*&amp;n! What smells like cat pi$s?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;We both went to the bathroom and tried to wash it off with soap, unfortunately, the peach smell will come off but that urine smell stayed for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t had the pleasure of smelling cat urine in person, it has a unique mildewy, musky, sickeningly maple-esque quality. It&#x27;s not good. And although you may not smell it on yourself, everyone else will. At your own risk. I personally could smell it and it really grossed me out, my friend on the other hand could not but she took everyone else&#x27;s word for it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have used this lotion for at least four years now. I am so convinced we should not put things on our skin we would not be willing to put in our mouths, and I ended up trying this after many varieties of lotions. This is the best price anywhere. I do also use almond oil, putting some in my hand before adding the lotion, mix them together before putting on, but that has been since my skin has gotten drier. The fragrance is very light, hardly noticeable after having it on a few minutes, just a fresh odor later.</li>
            <li> I had some sort of reaction to this...it was most likely the AHA content. My face started burning, turning red and swelling. I bought the 16 oz bottle at Fred Meyer and now I am trying to give it away. Obviously not everyone has a problem with this, so that&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great stuff for those who can use it.</li>
            <li> The lotion is wonderful and keeps skin soft, I only wish the scent wasn&#x27;t this strong.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great -the gentle fruit and sugar based exfoliating acids give this lotion an extra punch to do wonders that normal moisturizing ingredients alone can&#x27;t do.  And I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.  Especially for the reasonable price, you&#x27;d he hard pressed to find anything that could leave you softer.  The only drawback is that the smell, while lovely at first - and as the other reviewer said, VERY true to the real smell of ripe peaches, it can become a bit overpowering after using it for a while.  While I DO always want my skin to be soft, I DON&#x27;T always want to smell like a peach.  I find that I end up using it more at bedtime.  In a professional office environment you don&#x27;t always want to be walking around smelling like peaches all day long because the scent really does last.  I wish that KMF would take the same exfoliating properties and put them in a lighter scented or even fragrance free lotion.  It&#x27;s not a BAD smell, I loved it at first, but when you want to use it daily to keep up the softness after a while your nose can get a bit tired of the peach smell.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer I use. I use it every day on my body, face, and hands. Cleared up dry skin on my arms that I had been dealing with for years. Keeps my complexion clear and young looking. Just don&#x27;t forget to wear sunblock outside after using this!</li>
            <li> strong smell at first but goes away after a bit</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my FACE at bedtime for the past 10 years!  The alpha hydroxy acids help my face to look fresh and hydrated in the morning!</li>
            <li> ...and you can&#x27;t rub it in. The fragrance is mediocre, and so is the moisturizing. My biggest problem with it is that it goes on white and simply doesn&#x27;t rub in. I had it all over my clothes.</li>
            <li> My favorite hand and body lotion just cause it smells so good. Moisturizes pretty good as well. Love having lots of it on hand (no pun intended).</li>
            <li> After wearing it for a few minutes the smell is absolutely horrible. At first I thought it was because of my laundry machine but it was in fact the lotion.</li>
            <li> I picked this lotion up at Whole Foods solely based on the smell.  It smelled SO peachy and fresh when I opened the bottle in the store, I was powerless to resist it!  When I got it home, my sister asked to use it.  Once she slathered it on, she warned me it was hard to rub in.  Knowing that, I used a small amount after my next shower.  It was still hard to rub in, and the smell started peachy but quickly turned...unpleasant.  I just sniffed myself, and only the peach smell seems to remain so that&#x27;s good!  But I think I&#x27;ll look for a different brand of peach lotion now.</li>
            <li> I know this is not what this product is designed for, but I got desperate and tried it.  I have tried lots of different things and nothing makes my dandruff go away!  Vinegar helped, but made my hair look terrible if I used it in large enough quantities to make a difference.  I tried lavender oil and had the same problem.  I tried high quality shampoos, nothing.  I tried shampoo free, nothing. I tried various herbal and home remedies, nothing satisfactory.  I slathered my scalp in this lotion and washed it out the next day, improvement.  Did it again a couple days later, and voila, no dandruff!  It&#x27;s amazing.  It also moisturizes in the way it was intended to be used, without creating acne.  It actually improves acne.  I also had dry patches that it improved better than other lotions.  This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> I apply it twice daily and it seems to be keeping my 80 yr old skin clear.  I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion has been my favorite for 15 years! A friend of mine introduced me to this lotion years ago when she gave me some for my birthday and it&#x27;s been my favorite since then. It literally smells like fresh peaches! I love how it&#x27;s not over-powered by perfumes like a lot of other lotions are. My only suggestion for this though would be to not put it on your face. I&#x27;ve tried it and I don&#x27;t like the way it makes my face feel. I&#x27;ll stick to my good face moisturizer and just use this on my body.</li>
            <li> Eactly as advertised , at a geat price ! I am very pleased .</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic. I would like some ice cream that smells this good. It moisturizes well, but it&#x27;s hard to apply. I end up with white goo all over me that I have to rub and rub to get it to absorb. I will use up the bottle and then try something else.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Years ago, I researched moisturizers for aging skin and learned that retinol or alpha hydroxy products were the way to go.  Since I was only forty, I wasn&#x27;t ready for the more expensive, prescription-required retinol products.  So I opted to try AHAs and found this Kiss My Face product with a relatively low percentage of AHAs suitable for my sensitive skin.  I have used it every night since.  And at 45, I consider this product a main contributor to my nearly wrinkle-free face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that there is a slight sting and redness immediately after applying the product, but I believe that is just the AHAs doing their job.  I also have a female friend who really dislikes the scent.  Thankfully, not true for me or the man in my life - he loves the scent:)</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of lotions because my hands get really dry, especially in the winter...this is the first lotion that keeps my hands in great condition...I love it!  And I love the scent!  The price on Amazon is much better than at the store....</li>
            <li> I used to use this when I was younger and I feel like the formula changed???  The scent is still to die for - smells exactly like real, fresh peaches, but it doesn&#x27;t soak in well and feels sticky on my skin.  I don&#x27;t use it very often because of this.</li>
            <li> This goes on light, not greasy, and has a nice fruity smell. If you don&#x27;t want to smell fruity, you should steer clear. I&#x27;ve been using this for years.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I looked all over and could not find it in any local stores. So I was thrilled to find it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing. It also keeps my hands nice and smooth. Did I mention the smell is wonderful? :-)</li>
            <li> The scent and fragrance of this lotion is like cutting into a fresh peach in summer !!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it.....the consistency of this is on the thicker side, but it absorbs into skin readily.&lt;br /&gt;I keep extra bottles always.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It is never greasy and smells wonderful.  I love the 3-pack and am so glad I found it!</li>
            <li> Both my mother-in-law and I really like the Kiss My Face products, and this lotion especially.  It moisturizes nicely without being greasy, and the scent is \\&quot;divine\\&quot; as she says.</li>
            <li> Smells great and seems to help with exfoliation</li>
            <li> too thick, but worked ok</li>
            <li> I bought this even though previously I had purchased the same lotion and found it to have a \\&quot;BO\\&quot; smell.  I figured I just had a spoiled bottle that had perhaps been shipped in a hot truck and chalked it up to that.  Upon receiving this lotion, I opened it and detected a slight sour odor, but tried it anyway.  It went on a bit strong but lightened up over time.  I had worn a clean T-shirt after I applied this lotion for about 2 hours without perspiring (I had just bathed and was sitting watching TV before bed).  The next day, I picked up the shirt to put it on after my bath, and lo and behold...the shirt reeked of cat urine.  It was so horrid I actually threw the T-shirt out. I wondered if batches of this just somehow spoiled.  So out of curiousity, I went to my local health food store and opened the bottles on the shelf by removing the cap but not activating the pump...just to sniff the fragrance.  EVERY BOTTLE smelled of BO/cat pee. I have a great palate and healthy sense of smell, but even my husband who has sinus/allergy problems that impair his ability to detect odors proclaimed the odor \\&quot;cat pee\\&quot; when I asked him what my shirt smelled like.  For those who have impaired sense of smell, please be careful with this lotion.  You may reek and people may be too polite to tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to religiously use their Alpha and Aloe Vanilla 5% Alpha Hydroxy lotion, but they stopped making it.  That lotion was perfect.  It made my skin glow, it smelled great, and didn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  Why they discontinued that one and went to this I will never understand.  This is my last purchase of Kiss My Face products, as none of the lotions they carry has the same AHA benefit as the old Vanilla. And the last thing in the world I want to smell like is cat pee.</li>
            <li> You only need a very , very small amount!  Lasts for ever!  Smells like peaches!  Love using this cream!  Use under cover and the cover goes on smoothly!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend mentioned this lotion to me and I decided to try it.  I liked it because it is a rich and creamy lotion.  I would recommend it to anyone who has dry skin and is looking for a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it was the smell that got me first. luscious, wonderful smell. the cream itself is so smooth and non greasy. I have some to my friends and they love it too.</li>
