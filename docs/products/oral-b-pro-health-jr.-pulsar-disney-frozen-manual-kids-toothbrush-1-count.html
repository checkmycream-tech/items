            <li>This is PERFECT for my two anti-teeth brushing kids.  </li>
            <li>I was so impressed with the results on my kids, I bought one for myself.  </li>
            <li>By the way my dental hygienist recommended this brush, and I am so happy she did!  </li>
            <li>The Pulsar category is awesome -</li>
            <li>LOL.  </li>
            <li>Great size, great amount of vibration.</li>
            <li>So, YES they are great toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush to have kids motivated to brush.</li>
            <li>It is a very nice gift for my grand-daughter.</li>
            <li>Oral-B is a good brand.</li>
            <li>Nice quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this great product to everyone for better dental care!  </li>
            <li>For probably 20 cents more in manufacturing cost this could take replace-able batteries.</li>
            <li>It is most assuredly disposable.</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes for my husband and myself.</li>
            <li>My kids love these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for the Frozen part, as I&#x27;m sure others do.</li>
            <li>love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The two brush heads are the perfect size for each, and they patiently wait until the other is done, for now.  </li>
            <li>Easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Brush with this pulsar toothbrush twice a day and enjoy cleaner, fresher teeth.</li>
            <li>They enjoy brushing their teeth with these.  </li>
            <li>Even after that he was excited to use it.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my daughter and she was excited - until she took it out of the package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Likes:  It does all the work, it fits my hand, it shakes and vibrates to clean my</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I used to have to bribe my kids to brush their teeth or tell them if they didn&#x27;t brush them, they would end up like their MeeMaw (who has FULL dentures).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many different toothbrushes for my three kids and this one tops them all.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to see they finally made one for kids!</li>
            <li>The bottom does screw right off and the AAA battery pops right out.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has really helped my son keep his teeth clean while he wears braces.</li>
            <li>Brushing the exact same way as before, my teeth now feel dentist smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>My only fault is that I wish it came in more colors</li>
            <li>Sure, there are plenty on the packaging, but the toothbrush itself is just a normal blue.</li>
            <li>The head is way too large for most children, and as others have said it is basically the same as the adult version.  </li>
            <li>I normally buy just the regular Oral-B Pulsar brushes, but we were going on vacation, so I thought I would surprise her with a cute new one.</li>
            <li>The thickness of the plastic head is very thin, which is good, but the length and width are huge as well as the length of the bristles.  </li>
            <li>The brush is fine - a typically high quality Oral-B toothbrush - and my entire family uses the Pulsar category.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that you are considering this particular toothbrush because you have a fan of Disney&#x27;s Frozen in your life.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Words fail me to express how great this pulsar is.  </li>
            <li>My 9 year old think it&#x27;s cool to have the bigger brush head.</li>
            <li>I try to replace our toothbrushes every 3 or so months, so it was time to get her a new tooth scrubber.</li>
            <li>and they are EXACTLY the same as the adult version and nearly twice as much.</li>
            <li>I love Oral-B&#x27;s Pulsar toothbrushes and usually buy them in twin packs.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 7 year old.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old loves that he is brushing by himself and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line: Since my daughter is older, the lack of graphics was not a big deal.</li>
            <li>Ours lasted barely 3 months.</li>
            <li>This is the same size as the adult toothbrush, it is not a child toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It would be 5 star if it actually lasted anywhere near the 3 months advertised.  </li>
            <li>My kid was very happy...but need to be careful with initial use as he hurt his gums once...</li>
            <li>At 15, I&#x27;m guessing she&#x27;s a little older than the normal demographic, but she and her friends are in love (obsessed?)</li>

            <li> I bought this for my 7 year old.  Listing her likes and dislikes of this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:  It does all the work, it fits my hand, it shakes and vibrates to clean my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes: It feels weird on your teeth and it needs to have a character on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My likes are..... that she brushes untill it stops viberating and for some reason we have not lost this one yet (it&#x27;s been three weeks since we opened the package).</li>
            <li> This is PERFECT for my two anti-teeth brushing kids.  I used to have to bribe my kids to brush their teeth or tell them if they didn&#x27;t brush them, they would end up like their MeeMaw (who has FULL dentures).  I know that sounds mean, but it works...they are horrified at the thought.  The two brush heads are the perfect size for each, and they patiently wait until the other is done, for now.  My 3 year old loves that he is brushing by himself and the \\&quot;music\\&quot; lets him know when he is almost done.  My 9 year old think it&#x27;s cool to have the bigger brush head. LOL.  If their patience wears off, I will probably buy a second just to avoid any bathroom brawls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many different toothbrushes for my three kids and this one tops them all.  Rather than spinning, the bristles vibrate, working their way into crevices that would be hard for an adult to reach, let alone a kid who considers brushing her teeth corporal punishment.  With previous toothbrushes, I had to do a teeth check after each brushing, and very frequently sent my kids back to brush again (and yes, we use a timer).  The beauty of this toothbrush is that you can press firmly and it doesn&#x27;t hurt tender gums (like where new teeth are coming in).  I was so impressed with the results on my kids, I bought one for myself.  Brushing the exact same way as before, my teeth now feel dentist smooth and clean.  My only fault is that I wish it came in more colors--I&#x27;ve had to use a Sharpie to mark initial on each toothbrush since now all 5 members of our household use this.  Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The brush head is way too big for a little kid. One of the largest I&#x27;ve seen on any toothbrush. Ours lasted barely 3 months. For probably 20 cents more in manufacturing cost this could take replace-able batteries. I&#x27;ve read elsewhere that you can fiddle with and replace the batteries in this model. The bottom does screw right off and the AAA battery pops right out. No. It is most assuredly disposable.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has really helped my son keep his teeth clean while he wears braces. We&#x27;ve used other power brushes, but this one has bristles that reach around his brackets. This is the only type of brush he&#x27;ll be using while he wears braces.</li>
            <li> Great size, great amount of vibration. Easy to travel with. Nice quality.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes for my husband and myself. I was thrilled to see they finally made one for kids! I assumed the head would be smaller, or the handle, or both. I was SORELY disappointed when they arrived today and they are EXACTLY the same as the adult version and nearly twice as much. So, YES they are great toothbrushes. YES, your kids will have cleaner teeth. Save money and buy the twin pack for adults.  We get them at 15% off through subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush to have kids motivated to brush.</li>
            <li> This is the same size as the adult toothbrush, it is not a child toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice gift for my grand-daughter.</li>
            <li> It would be 5 star if it actually lasted anywhere near the 3 months advertised.  The 4 I tried maxed out at 1 1/2 months.</li>
            <li> My kid was very happy...but need to be careful with initial use as he hurt his gums once...no harm done. Even after that he was excited to use it.</li>
            <li> Brush with this brush and your teeth will feel as though you just had your teeth cleaned at the dentist. Brush with this pulsar toothbrush twice a day and enjoy cleaner, fresher teeth. Words fail me to express how great this pulsar is.  I plan to order this brush for my family as a Xmas stocking stuffer. I highly recommend this great product to everyone for better dental care!  By the way my dental hygienist recommended this brush, and I am so happy she did!  I bought the brush on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My kids love these toothbrushes.  They enjoy brushing their teeth with these.  I would buy them again.  They like the feel of the vibrating brissles on their teeth.</li>
            <li> The brush is fine - a typically high quality Oral-B toothbrush - and my entire family uses the Pulsar category. If that&#x27;s what you are looking for, this has you covered. I&#x27;m guessing that you are considering this particular toothbrush because you have a fan of Disney&#x27;s Frozen in your life. If that isn&#x27;t the case, go check out other Oral-B Pulsar toothbrushes or just regular Oral-B toothbrushes - they make tons of different ones. Onto this toothbrush specifically...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my daughter. At 15, I&#x27;m guessing she&#x27;s a little older than the normal demographic, but she and her friends are in love (obsessed?) with Frozen. I try to replace our toothbrushes every 3 or so months, so it was time to get her a new tooth scrubber. I normally buy just the regular Oral-B Pulsar brushes, but we were going on vacation, so I thought I would surprise her with a cute new one. I knew anything Frozen would go over well - Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue with this brush has nothing to do with the quality. Let&#x27;s get that out of the way. Oral-B is a good brand. The problem? I bought this for the Frozen part, as I&#x27;m sure others do. (Why would you get a brush related to Frozen if not a fan? You wouldn&#x27;t. You would get a regular toothbrush.) I gave this to my daughter and she was excited - until she took it out of the package. Unfortunately, there aren&#x27;t any Frozen graphics ON the brush. Sure, there are plenty on the packaging, but the toothbrush itself is just a normal blue. Nothing special. Nothing referencing Frozen. Nothing better - or worse - than a regular, plain toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT the toothbrush for you if you are looking for something with any sort of Frozen graphics on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Since my daughter is older, the lack of graphics was not a big deal. Disappointing, but not life altering. I would imagine this could be a different story if your Frozen fan is younger. The Pulsar category is awesome - I love Oral-B&#x27;s Pulsar toothbrushes and usually buy them in twin packs. I bought this specifically for the Frozen graphics - of which, there are NONE. This is marketed as a child&#x27;s toothbrush, but I still can&#x27;t find any differences from the adult version I usually purchase (same size head, same softness of bristles, same vibrating motion). Save yourself some hassle and headache - just purchase the regular Oral-B Pulsar brushes. You won&#x27;t find anything &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; here.lly buy them in twin packs.
