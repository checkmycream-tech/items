            <li>I tested this product free but all my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I love how light it feels on my skin!</li>
            <li>I love the glow it gave my skin</li>
            <li>This seemed like a good low coverage foundation good for the summer time.</li>
            <li>I was able to test it for free and these are my opinions.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free from influenster.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free compliments of the Influenster program.</li>
            <li>This foundation was lovely and felt light on the skin.</li>
            <li>This foundation is lightweight, easy to apply, and not greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>In the end the only drawback I see is that it is not too blendable, but it give really good coverage and a nice glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, stays on through sweat, and wipes away clean at the end of the day!</li>
            <li>I was also super excited to look in the mirror at the end of the day and see my makeup still going strong!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of this product.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth without leaving my face feeling/looking greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li>I thought that would make me look like a disco ball in the light</li>
            <li>I applied it today over Neutrogena Shine Free primer with a Beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Stay Fabulous.</li>
            <li>I did get the produce free through Influenster, but I will defiantly keep buying this product.</li>
            <li>This product goes on smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li>After using it all day it did wear off a bit, but I had a bit of glow throughout which I liked because it wasn&#x27;t too much to make me look oily.</li>
            <li>and i got these samples for free to test by influnster</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel light</li>
            <li>so it is probably not the best for everyday</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t fit the bill.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free from influenster.com.</li>
            <li>I received this for free from influenster.com</li>
            <li>I received this product free from Influenster to test, but all opinions are mine.</li>
            <li>So I was excited to try this.</li>
            <li>and i am not disappointed by them</li>
            <li>I have to say im pretty pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Something I kind of struggled with is that it did not blend too well when applied directly to face, however when I used primer right before it seemed to be more blendable.</li>
            <li>The shade was lighter than I expected, which is rare considering my skin is very fair</li>
            <li>However, this one felt super light and stayed put all day, even in 90+ degree heat and lots of sweating.</li>
            <li>It went on great with this brush, however, the foundation stays tacky...which is really pretty gross.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and stays on for a good long while.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good product especially for being drugstore priced!</li>
            <li>I liked the natural look of my skin when I was wearing it.</li>
            <li>It give medium coverage that lasts a full 8hrs.</li>
            <li>I still probably won&#x27;t use this every day, but it&#x27;ll be great on those days when my skin tone needs a little evening out.</li>
            <li>I got to test this for free thanks to Influenster &amp; Covergirl</li>
            <li>I received this foundation complimentary in my #Idovoxbox from @influenster and wanted to share my opinion of this Cover Girl Outlast Luminous Foundaton.  </li>
            <li>However, once I applied some powder and bronzer, the color looked more natural.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, this foundation is lighter than I expected, although it works well for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>(3 hours of sweating) and a day of birthday fun.  </li>
            <li>I recieved this foundation in my VoxBox and I was so surprised at how much I love this foundation.</li>
            <li>I got the color classic ivory and it might be too light for me.</li>
            <li>It was in the 90s when I tried it out the first time, and off it melted</li>
            <li>The coverage is great and it isn&#x27;t really thick.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and it also leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be experimenting more with this and see how it goes.</li>
            <li>I will give this another shot but am pretty ambivalent.</li>
            <li>It stayed on pretty well considering the extremely hot weather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that helps with the application and lasting result of this product.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have tried a liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>(I do have sensitive skin, so that is important to me.)</li>
            <li>Although I recieved the bottle I have for free the opinion above is entirely my own with no outside influence.</li>
            <li>I first tried it yesterday with no primer, applied with the IT Cosmetics Flat Top Buffing Foundation #6 brush.</li>
            <li>I love this product but it was a little to light for me.</li>
            <li>The color was a little lighter than I expected but in the winter it would have been the perfect color.</li>
            <li>I generally stick to my normal routine, but I actually really enjoyed the way this make up looked on.</li>
            <li>I received this free to use through a product review company, and I will likely either see if a friend wants it or just toss it in the trash.</li>
            <li>All of this was accomplished with Cover Girl Outlast Luminous Foundation.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing this foundation from now on and highly recommend it to others!</li>
            <li>I really like this foundation.</li>
            <li>It wears very well throughout the day, with no reapplication needed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this foundation!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Influenster</li>
            <li>It feels very light, not cakey or greasy like some other foundations.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick and easy foundation for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>I actually wasn&#x27;t all that excited about trying a foundation.</li>
            <li>recommend to someone with smooth, non-dry skin with areas of redness, scarring, or flat blemishes</li>
            <li>This foundation had a very strong paint/chemical smell which I did not enjoy.</li>
            <li>foundation was much thicker than I expected and much lighter color-wise (which is fine, I&#x27;d just gotten a tan on vacation</li>
            <li>Thanks to Influenster I got to try the new Cover Girl Outlast Stay Luminous foundation.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t too pink or too yellow and blended without showing a line which was nice.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this product from Influenster Voxbox.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy -</li>
            <li>This did run a little darker than most that I have tried.</li>
            <li>If you have really oily skin and look naturally dewy, you might not like this foundation.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s good for covering up small things on my face (red spots, etc..).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use liquid foundation because it does feel as if you painted your face, but this is nothing like that.</li>
            <li>It covers well, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, something that I especially appreciated on these hot and humid summer days.</li>
            <li>The color was still a little too dark for my super fair skin, but it blended well enough to look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It went on smooth, but the coverage was odd:</li>
            <li>The rest of my skin was clear with a touch of redness and freckles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a busy mom of infant twins and a toddler, I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to worry about reapplying makeup once I walk out the door.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and recently went on vacation where I got a bit too much sun.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft to.  </li>
            <li>and I was surprised at how well it looks.</li>
            <li>it felt thick and it was kind of hard to blend in at first, then ultimately didn&#x27;t provide much coverage.</li>
            <li>Just be careful, it is not for hot and sweaty days.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t like covergirl because of the yellow hues and the smells of the foundations</li>
            <li>I like very smooth, thin foundation that creates a natural look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recently gotten a bit of sun, so the product is much lighter than my actual tone.</li>
            <li>2nd time I wore primer and only used a damp beauty sponge I made sure to use my time and blend it in while.and there is very little tackyness when applied this way.</li>
            <li>1st time I tried it I applied it to my bare face with no primer and using a stippling brush.</li>
            <li>so I found myself missing that moisture and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>With regards to coverage it can be built, so you can use a little for slight coverage and be okay.</li>
            <li>The coverage was decent compared to other foundations I&#x27;ve used - my blemishes and under-eye circles were clearly diminished.</li>
            <li>I have porcelain skin, and even the lightest shade was much too dark for me.</li>
            <li>I have pretty even skin with a few blemishes</li>
            <li>I am 33, VERY pale, and this gave my skin a very nice, very subtle glow.</li>
            <li>I have a fair complexion, and as such I usually have trouble finding a foundation that isn&#x27;t too dark on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually pretty skeptical about foundation because most of them feel heavy, sticky, and melt in the heat.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would not use this foundation since I naturally have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>A little is all you need and it blends very well without making my face look darker than the rest of my body.  </li>

            <li> I have porcelain skin and this blends perfectly and doesn&#x27;t look yellow on me.</li>
            <li> I tested this product free but all my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I love how light it feels on my skin!</li>
            <li> I love the glow it gave my skin</li>
            <li> This seemed like a good low coverage foundation good for the summer time.</li>
            <li> I was able to test it for free and these are my opinions.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free from influenster.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free compliments of the Influenster program.</li>
            <li> This foundation was lovely and felt light on the skin.</li>
            <li> This foundation is lightweight, easy to apply, and not greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> In the end the only drawback I see is that it is not too blendable, but it give really good coverage and a nice glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, stays on through sweat, and wipes away clean at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> I was also super excited to look in the mirror at the end of the day and see my makeup still going strong!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of this product.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth without leaving my face feeling/looking greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li> I thought that would make me look like a disco ball in the light</li>
            <li> I applied it today over Neutrogena Shine Free primer with a Beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Stay Fabulous.</li>
            <li> I did get the produce free through Influenster, but I will defiantly keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li> After using it all day it did wear off a bit, but I had a bit of glow throughout which I liked because it wasn&#x27;t too much to make me look oily.</li>
            <li> and i got these samples for free to test by influnster</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel light</li>
            <li> so it is probably not the best for everyday</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t fit the bill.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from influenster.com.</li>
            <li> I received this for free from influenster.com</li>
            <li> I received this product free from Influenster to test, but all opinions are mine.</li>
            <li> So I was excited to try this.</li>
            <li> and i am not disappointed by them</li>
            <li> I have to say im pretty pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Something I kind of struggled with is that it did not blend too well when applied directly to face, however when I used primer right before it seemed to be more blendable.</li>
            <li> The shade was lighter than I expected, which is rare considering my skin is very fair</li>
            <li> However, this one felt super light and stayed put all day, even in 90+ degree heat and lots of sweating.</li>
            <li> It went on great with this brush, however, the foundation stays tacky...which is really pretty gross.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and stays on for a good long while.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good product especially for being drugstore priced!</li>
            <li> I liked the natural look of my skin when I was wearing it.</li>
            <li> It give medium coverage that lasts a full 8hrs.</li>
            <li> I still probably won&#x27;t use this every day, but it&#x27;ll be great on those days when my skin tone needs a little evening out.</li>
            <li> I got to test this for free thanks to Influenster &amp; Covergirl</li>
            <li> I received this foundation complimentary in my #Idovoxbox from @influenster and wanted to share my opinion of this Cover Girl Outlast Luminous Foundaton.  </li>
            <li> However, once I applied some powder and bronzer, the color looked more natural.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this foundation is lighter than I expected, although it works well for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> (3 hours of sweating) and a day of birthday fun.  </li>
            <li> I recieved this foundation in my VoxBox and I was so surprised at how much I love this foundation.</li>
            <li> I got the color classic ivory and it might be too light for me.</li>
            <li> It was in the 90s when I tried it out the first time, and off it melted</li>
            <li> The coverage is great and it isn&#x27;t really thick.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and it also leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be experimenting more with this and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> I will give this another shot but am pretty ambivalent.</li>
            <li> It stayed on pretty well considering the extremely hot weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that helps with the application and lasting result of this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have tried a liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> (I do have sensitive skin, so that is important to me.)</li>
            <li> Although I recieved the bottle I have for free the opinion above is entirely my own with no outside influence.</li>
            <li> I first tried it yesterday with no primer, applied with the IT Cosmetics Flat Top Buffing Foundation #6 brush.</li>
            <li> I love this product but it was a little to light for me.</li>
            <li> The color was a little lighter than I expected but in the winter it would have been the perfect color.</li>
            <li> I generally stick to my normal routine, but I actually really enjoyed the way this make up looked on.</li>
            <li> I received this free to use through a product review company, and I will likely either see if a friend wants it or just toss it in the trash.</li>
            <li> All of this was accomplished with Cover Girl Outlast Luminous Foundation.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this foundation from now on and highly recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> I really like this foundation.</li>
            <li> It wears very well throughout the day, with no reapplication needed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this foundation!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster</li>
            <li> It feels very light, not cakey or greasy like some other foundations.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick and easy foundation for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I actually wasn&#x27;t all that excited about trying a foundation.</li>
            <li> recommend to someone with smooth, non-dry skin with areas of redness, scarring, or flat blemishes</li>
            <li> This foundation had a very strong paint/chemical smell which I did not enjoy.</li>
            <li> foundation was much thicker than I expected and much lighter color-wise (which is fine, I&#x27;d just gotten a tan on vacation</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster I got to try the new Cover Girl Outlast Stay Luminous foundation.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t too pink or too yellow and blended without showing a line which was nice.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product from Influenster Voxbox.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy -</li>
            <li> This did run a little darker than most that I have tried.</li>
            <li> If you have really oily skin and look naturally dewy, you might not like this foundation.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s good for covering up small things on my face (red spots, etc..).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use liquid foundation because it does feel as if you painted your face, but this is nothing like that.</li>
            <li> It covers well, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, something that I especially appreciated on these hot and humid summer days.</li>
            <li> The color was still a little too dark for my super fair skin, but it blended well enough to look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It went on smooth, but the coverage was odd:</li>
            <li> The rest of my skin was clear with a touch of redness and freckles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a busy mom of infant twins and a toddler, I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to worry about reapplying makeup once I walk out the door.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and recently went on vacation where I got a bit too much sun.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft to.  </li>
            <li> and I was surprised at how well it looks.</li>
            <li> it felt thick and it was kind of hard to blend in at first, then ultimately didn&#x27;t provide much coverage.</li>
            <li> Just be careful, it is not for hot and sweaty days.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t like covergirl because of the yellow hues and the smells of the foundations</li>
            <li> I like very smooth, thin foundation that creates a natural look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recently gotten a bit of sun, so the product is much lighter than my actual tone.</li>
            <li> 2nd time I wore primer and only used a damp beauty sponge I made sure to use my time and blend it in while.and there is very little tackyness when applied this way.</li>
            <li> 1st time I tried it I applied it to my bare face with no primer and using a stippling brush.</li>
            <li> so I found myself missing that moisture and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> With regards to coverage it can be built, so you can use a little for slight coverage and be okay.</li>
            <li> The coverage was decent compared to other foundations I&#x27;ve used - my blemishes and under-eye circles were clearly diminished.</li>
            <li> I have porcelain skin, and even the lightest shade was much too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I have pretty even skin with a few blemishes</li>
            <li> I am 33, VERY pale, and this gave my skin a very nice, very subtle glow.</li>
            <li> I have a fair complexion, and as such I usually have trouble finding a foundation that isn&#x27;t too dark on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty skeptical about foundation because most of them feel heavy, sticky, and melt in the heat.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would not use this foundation since I naturally have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> A little is all you need and it blends very well without making my face look darker than the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li> It last all day long.</li>
            <li> It had a long wear time and I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I tend to look dry all day long.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, you only need 1-2 pumps to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really dry.</li>
            <li> but I have dry skin</li>
            <li> So, when I went to use this foundation I had one patch of dry skin and a blemish.</li>
            <li> My freckles and redness disappeared, but my dry skin and blemish were highlighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t cakey or clingy to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had dry patches and was oily in my T zone, which i&#x27;m normally not.</li>
            <li> Just not high coverage (</li>
            <li> And the color was only slightly off.</li>
            <li> The color was lighter than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> It feels like a moisturizer, but it hides all the pores on my nose and covers up other &#x27;flaws&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I usually wear brands such as MAC or Kat Von D.</li>
            <li> If your skin tends to be a little dry (like mine) I would recommend using a primer or moisturizer under this product.</li>
            <li> I have a bad history with most foundations, they usually cling to my dry patches on my nose and break up/settle strangly within 15 minutes of application.</li>
            <li> and I usually have the opposite issue of the lightest shade being too dark.</li>
            <li> It was also a little thicker/tackier than other foundations when I first started putting in on my face, but once I had blended it in, it didn&#x27;t feel heavy or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I found it thick and hard to apply, and it sits very heavy on my skin, causing breakouts and a very unnatural, caked-on look.</li>
            <li> I has a little bit of a smell, but that could be because I haven&#x27;t used a foundation in a while.</li>
            <li> This foundation can be a little tricky to use.</li>
            <li> It has a very subtle shimmer to it and you can barely see the micro glitters in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of liquid foundations but this one has changed my mind.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight shimmer that isn&#x27;t too drastic and isn&#x27;t too thick or greasy.</li>
            <li> I got oily in the usual spots but nothing out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> I do usually use a primer and also a setting spray after I apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> I applied it with a wet Beauty Blender and started off with a thin application.</li>
            <li> There is a very slight, subtle shimmer when you apply it.</li>
            <li> I also have a really hard time getting a foundation to match my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It was hard to blend in and tacky.</li>
            <li> This foundation does not leave my skin feeling icky or cakey looking either.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t cakey or thick either.</li>
            <li> However it also has a subtle shimmer that gives it a luminous quality.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any breakouts, well at least that were caused by the makeup and not those pregnancy hormones!</li>
            <li> It is very subtle but can be seen.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Covergirl.</li>
            <li> It looked BAD before noon.</li>
            <li> Real bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this product to try in my I Do box from Influenster.com. I&#x27;m usually pretty skeptical about foundation because most of them feel heavy, sticky, and melt in the heat. However, this one felt super light and stayed put all day, even in 90+ degree heat and lots of sweating. I still probably won&#x27;t use this every day, but it&#x27;ll be great on those days when my skin tone needs a little evening out. The color was still a little too dark for my super fair skin, but it blended well enough to look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I tested this product for free, my opinions are entirely my own.</li>
            <li> I love this product but it was a little to light for me. But it covered well and I never had to re-apply it in my 12 hour shift at work. I was able to test it for free and these are my opinions.</li>
            <li> This seemed like a good low coverage foundation good for the summer time. Just be careful, it is not for hot and sweaty days. It was in the 90s when I tried it out the first time, and off it melted (but hey everything felt melty that day). I have tried it again, and it was better! Just not high coverage (what I prefer, got to let those freckles shine through).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product especially for being drugstore priced! I got this product as part of an Influenster Vox Box review. So I didn&#x27;t pay for it, BUT all of my opinions are all my own!</li>
            <li> The only issue I had with this product is that the color didn&#x27;t match well with my skin tone. I&#x27;d recently gotten a bit of sun, so the product is much lighter than my actual tone. It will match better when it&#x27;s winter again, and my tan fades. Otherwise, it&#x27;s good for covering up small things on my face (red spots, etc..). I was able to try this product for free from influenster. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free in my influenter Vox Box and all opinions are my own. It&#x27;s a great foundation. The coverage is great and it isn&#x27;t really thick. I love how the color blends well and covers up my freckles.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of liquid foundations but this one has changed my mind.  It goes on so smooth without leaving my face feeling/looking greasy or oily.  A little is all you need and it blends very well without making my face look darker than the rest of my body.  It lasts all day and it also leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I tested Covergirl for free but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I really love this foundation! I have very fair skin and I&#x27;m really dry. I tend to look dry all day long. So I was excited to try this. It has a very subtle shimmer to it and you can barely see the micro glitters in the bottle. I thought that would make me look like a disco ball in the light but it doesn&#x27;t. If you have really oily skin and look naturally dewy, you might not like this foundation. It is very subtle but can be seen. It goes on very nice and you do have to use a brush for more coverage. It stayed on all day for me. I wasn&#x27;t running all over the place but I wasn&#x27;t just sitting around either. I loved how it made me look and I liked how it felt on my face. Will definitely be experimenting more with this and see how it goes. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;I received this products free from Influenster for review and all opinions are my own!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster I got to try the new Cover Girl Outlast Stay Luminous foundation. I&#x27;m on the fence with this product. I tend to stay away from luminous or dewy products as my t-zone can get greasy...but I gave this a shot. I first tried it yesterday with no primer, applied with the IT Cosmetics Flat Top Buffing Foundation #6 brush. It went on great with this brush, however, the foundation stays tacky...which is really pretty gross. With that being said, it looked pretty great all day. I got oily in the usual spots but nothing out of the ordinary. I applied it today over Neutrogena Shine Free primer with a Beauty blender. It looked BAD before noon. Real bad. My t-zone was out of control and coverage wasn&#x27;t anything to write home about. And the tackiness was still there today (I set the foundation both days with translucent powder). I&#x27;m glad I got this to try and review...it would be going back if I had purchased it myself. I will give this another shot but am pretty ambivalent. At this point, I say save your money. If you want #covergirl foundation, get the 3-in-1 Stay Fabulous. It&#x27;s a much better product than this!</li>
            <li> I really liked this foundation. It went on even and has great coverage. I was also super excited to look in the mirror at the end of the day and see my makeup still going strong! I did get the produce free through Influenster, but I will defiantly keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> I received this foundation complimentary in my #Idovoxbox from @influenster and wanted to share my opinion of this Cover Girl Outlast Luminous Foundaton.  As a busy mom of infant twins and a toddler, I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to worry about reapplying makeup once I walk out the door.  I have a fair complexion and freckles so I&#x27;m always looking for something to give me a put-together flawless look that doesn&#x27;t need to be touched up mid-day. All of this was accomplished with Cover Girl Outlast Luminous Foundation.  I will be purchasing this foundation from now on and highly recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> I am happy with this liquid foundation. I don&#x27;t normally use liquid foundation because it does feel as if you painted your face, but this is nothing like that. It feels like a moisturizer, but it hides all the pores on my nose and covers up other &#x27;flaws&#x27;. And it blends, so your face is not a different color than your neck and chest! It&#x27;s light, stays on through sweat, and wipes away clean at the end of the day! I am grateful for this free sample, and am giving this rating out of my own opinion.</li>
            <li> From the moment I saw this in my Influenster VoxBox, I was hoping it had sparkle. This foundation is AMAZING. There is a very slight, subtle shimmer when you apply it. I am 33, VERY pale, and this gave my skin a very nice, very subtle glow. I has a little bit of a smell, but that could be because I haven&#x27;t used a foundation in a while. It stayed on pretty well considering the extremely hot weather. Absolutely fabulous for the price! I got to try the product for free, but my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I received this foundation in my I Do Voxbox from Influenster. I generally stick to my normal routine, but I actually really enjoyed the way this make up looked on. It wasn&#x27;t cakey or thick either.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth and evenly. It feels very light, not cakey or greasy like some other foundations. It dries to a powder like finish. However it also has a subtle shimmer that gives it a luminous quality. It is the perfect amount of shimmer without making your skin look too dewy or feeling sticky. A little goes a long way, you only need 1-2 pumps to cover your entire face. If your skin tends to be a little dry (like mine) I would recommend using a primer or moisturizer under this product. The color worked well for my fair skin it wasn&#x27;t too pink or too yellow and blended without showing a line which was nice. I tested this product for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I tried the foundation by I DO VOX BOX, it was luminous but it made me too luminous. I like more of a matte finish but I have dry skin and it made me oily. How is that possible?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, it doesn&#x27;t hold well. I had dry patches and was oily in my T zone, which i&#x27;m normally not. I tested my COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free compliments of the Influenster program. I actually wasn&#x27;t all that excited about trying a foundation. I&#x27;m a foundation snob. I have sensitive skin and I like coverage but don&#x27;t like my make-up caked on. I also have a really hard time getting a foundation to match my skin tone.I really like this foundation. I didn&#x27;t have any breakouts, well at least that were caused by the makeup and not those pregnancy hormones! It covers well, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, something that I especially appreciated on these hot and humid summer days. Even though I didn&#x27;t pick out the color, it looked great on my skin. I do usually use a primer and also a setting spray after I apply my makeup. I&#x27;m sure that helps with the application and lasting result of this product. However, I&#x27;ve also worn it alone and I do find that it blends easier without the primer, and seems to last the entire work day. I would definitely consider buying this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this foundation! The shade was lighter than I expected, which is rare considering my skin is very fair and I usually have the opposite issue of the lightest shade being too dark. However, once I applied some powder and bronzer, the color looked more natural. The coverage was decent compared to other foundations I&#x27;ve used - my blemishes and under-eye circles were clearly diminished. It was also a little thicker/tackier than other foundations when I first started putting in on my face, but once I had blended it in, it didn&#x27;t feel heavy or uncomfortable. Overall, I would recommend this foundation and use it again.  I received this product for free in return for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Hi there! So I got this foundation from Influenster for testing purposes. My review contains solely my personal opinion about this product. I got the color classic ivory and it might be too light for me. Something I kind of struggled with is that it did not blend too well when applied directly to face, however when I used primer right before it seemed to be more blendable. With regards to coverage it can be built, so you can use a little for slight coverage and be okay. After using it all day it did wear off a bit, but I had a bit of glow throughout which I liked because it wasn&#x27;t too much to make me look oily. I liked the natural look of my skin when I was wearing it. In the end the only drawback I see is that it is not too blendable, but it give really good coverage and a nice glow.</li>
            <li> i got this foundation in my idovoxbox by influnester and it was amazing i love the coverage and its makes my skin nice and and smooth i didn&#x27;t expect it to be that great because they are samples i got by influnester.com but i would recommend this to everyone it is an amazing product and i got these samples for free to test by influnster and i am not disappointed by them&lt;br /&gt;  from katrina</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product wasn&#x27;t for me. I have combination skin and recently went on vacation where I got a bit too much sun. I also used sunscreen on my face and broke out a tiny bit on my chin. So, when I went to use this foundation I had one patch of dry skin and a blemish. The rest of my skin was clear with a touch of redness and freckles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation was much thicker than I expected and much lighter color-wise (which is fine, I&#x27;d just gotten a tan on vacation so I wasn&#x27;t Ivory anymore). It went on smooth, but the coverage was odd: it felt thick and it was kind of hard to blend in at first, then ultimately didn&#x27;t provide much coverage. I ended up looking like I was wearing makeup, but it didn&#x27;t cover my imperfections. To me, what&#x27;s the point of a foundation if it doesn&#x27;t provide coverage? I&#x27;ve had BB and CC creams that do more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend to someone with smooth, non-dry skin with areas of redness, scarring, or flat blemishes they&#x27;d like to cover. My freckles and redness disappeared, but my dry skin and blemish were highlighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the foundation in the Influenster I Do Vox Box. Opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I have a fair complexion, and as such I usually have trouble finding a foundation that isn&#x27;t too dark on my skin. Surprisingly, this foundation is lighter than I expected, although it works well for my skin tone. It wears very well throughout the day, with no reapplication needed. It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy - once applied you don&#x27;t notice it&#x27;s there. I highly recommend this foundation! I tested this product for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster I was able to try this foundation. I think I should have had a darker color. I do suggest using it with moisturizer and a primer. It tended to settle into my pores if I didn&#x27;t (and it was a lighter color than my skin, so it looked like I had lighter colored dots all over my cheeks). It did hide my darker spots from my pregnancy, so that was a plus!</li>
            <li> I did like the texture and the ease to apply this foundation. I have pretty even skin with a few blemishes so I don&#x27;t have a lot to cover in that area. The color was a little lighter than I expected but in the winter it would have been the perfect color. I did receive this product for free through a voxbox and these experiences and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This product lasts all day through heat, through getting tattooed (3 hours of sweating) and a day of birthday fun.  It has a great coverage and feels amazing on the skin.  The only problem I had was waiting for the product to set into my skin.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick and easy foundation for everyday use.  I did receive this product through Influenster, but all my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have tried a liquid foundation. I love the formula of it, and the coverage is wonderful! This foundation does not leave my skin feeling icky or cakey looking either. That was something that I was worried about when I got this foundation. The color matches my skin almost perfectly, and that was a real surprise to me! I would definitely be recommending this foundation to my friends. **I received this foundation from Influenster for free, but my opinions are all my own**</li>
            <li> I have to say im pretty pleased with this product. It&#x27;s not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin all caked with foundation. I like that there is some shimmer and not to overpowering. Leaves your skin soft to.  I tested this covergirl product for free and my opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> This did run a little darker than most that I have tried. But the coverage was good. And the color was only slightly off. It did not irritate my skin, or make me break out. (I do have sensitive skin, so that is important to me.) I got this as part of my IDO box from Influenster, but my opinion definitely is my own. And it stands that this is a good product, and I would recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> I recieved this foundation in my VoxBox and I was so surprised at how much I love this foundation. Normally I don&#x27;t like covergirl because of the yellow hues and the smells of the foundations but this went above my wildest expectations. I have porcelain skin and this blends perfectly and doesn&#x27;t look yellow on me. When I run out of this bottle I will be purchasing a bottle for myself. Although I recieved the bottle I have for free the opinion above is entirely my own with no outside influence.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It covers well and does not give my skin an oily feel. I tested this product free but all my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product from Influenster Voxbox. I love how light it feels on my skin! Will use always! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love the glow it gave my skin and I did not need to set it with a powder. It made my skin feel light</li>
            <li> This foundation can be a little tricky to use. 1st time I tried it I applied it to my bare face with no primer and using a stippling brush. It was hard to blend in and tacky. 2nd time I wore primer and only used a damp beauty sponge I made sure to use my time and blend it in while.and there is very little tackyness when applied this way. It give medium coverage that lasts a full 8hrs. It is a dewy/luminous/shiny foundation so it is probably not the best for everyday but I do think it would be a great foundation for a night out or something like that. I got to test this for free thanks to Influenster &amp; Covergirl but my opinion s are all my own.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of this product. I have porcelain skin, and even the lightest shade was much too dark for me. I found it thick and hard to apply, and it sits very heavy on my skin, causing breakouts and a very unnatural, caked-on look. I received this free to use through a product review company, and I will likely either see if a friend wants it or just toss it in the trash. I like very smooth, thin foundation that creates a natural look. This didn&#x27;t fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I received this in my Influenster IDoVoxBox for free for testing and review purposes but these are my own thoughts! I am not one to use a lot of foundation, but I tried it and it works great! It has a slight shimmer that isn&#x27;t too drastic and isn&#x27;t too thick or greasy.</li>
            <li> I got a sample from influenster. The color matched my skin color great. It last all day long. It&#x27;s smooth and doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes. After wearing for a week. I would buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from influenster.com. I usually wear brands such as MAC or Kat Von D. I gave this a go and I was surprised at how well it looks. It goes on smoothly and stays on for a good long while.&lt;br /&gt;The coverage was also really nice. I would definitely give this foundation a try if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
            <li> I received this for free from influenster.com but all opinions are my own. This foundation was lovely and felt light on the skin. It had a long wear time and I would recommend to a friend. Great for the price. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Covergirl.</li>
            <li> This foundation is lightweight, easy to apply, and not greasy or oily. I received a sample from Influenster, but these opinions are my own!</li>
            <li> This foundation had a very strong paint/chemical smell which I did not enjoy. It can be a bit drying when applied without moisturizer so I mixed it in with this foundation.  The color was lighter than I expected it to be. It&#x27;s moderate in coverage. It gets the job done... I&#x27;m used to using bb creams so I found myself missing that moisture and fresh scent. When I didn&#x27;t mix it with a moisturizer it was a chalky consistency.  Overall, I would not use this foundation since I naturally have dry skin.  I received this product free from Influenster to test, but all opinions are mine.</li>
            <li> I received this product in my I Do Vox Box. I have a bad history with most foundations, they usually cling to my dry patches on my nose and break up/settle strangly within 15 minutes of application. When I received this in the mail, I was so worried this would be another foundation like that. I applied it with a wet Beauty Blender and started off with a thin application. I then went back and applied another layer to cover my hyper-pigmentation. It covered BEAUTIFULLY. I did still need a concealer but it isn&#x27;t cakey or clingy to my dry skin. I will definitely be buying another bottle of this!</li>
