            <li>GOOD JOB!!...</li>
            <li>For the price these are great!!!</li>
            <li>these are the best out of all the others I have tried</li>
            <li>Great item!</li>
            <li>so if you lay in a bed you don&#x27;t have to use them which is great.</li>
            <li>i got these when i bought my tanning bed love them best ever for the price</li>
            <li>But they&#x27;re good for the price.</li>
            <li>This product was good for the price paid.</li>
            <li>Nice product and good quality.  </li>
            <li>Good goggles, feel comfortable, eyes feel great.</li>
            <li>- I haven&#x27;t had that in goggles yet and really liked it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE these tanning goggles!!</li>
            <li>The shipping was also very good, they came fast!</li>
            <li>These are also very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Eye Candy for years and love them.  </li>
            <li>Assorted colors was ok.</li>
            <li>These are the best tanning goggles I have ever used, these prevent you from getting the RACOON eyes like the regular ones, I use mine all the time in the tanning bed!</li>
            <li>Nice and light weight.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;re better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>I just wish I had more faith that they&#x27;re doing more than just putting lightly colored plastic over my eyes.  </li>
            <li>They also let some light in while I&#x27;m wearing them (through the resulting crevices on the top and bottom).  </li>
            <li>The glasses fit snugly across my eyes for a safe fit.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s an easy fix.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the full view</li>
            <li>The plastic on these glasses are soo cheap</li>
            <li>plastic is sort of cheap looking</li>
            <li>Would have been really cool if I got to pick what color I wanted, but overall, I AM VERY SATISFIED!</li>
            <li>Not only did these arrive quickly, they are great goggles that are comfortable and don&#x27;t leave tan lines around your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Its not painful, but its a noticeable hugging feeling around your eyeball that can&#x27;t be considered comfortable.  </li>
            <li>One is able to see the majority of the visual field with these on, in rose color anyway.  </li>
            <li>They could be a little more comfortable, but they really do a good job at not leaving a line.</li>
            <li>colors\\&quot; which may be true.  </li>
            <li>What I do with every pair of tanning goggles is to run the nose bridge under hot water (like from an instant hot) to soften up the plastic and then fit the goggles more to my eyes and face for a good seal.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered and given away a large number of them, though I have yet to see the purple ones (which I really would have liked) but still not a bad price</li>
            <li>My eyes are super protected while I&#x27;m crisping up the rest of me.</li>
            <li>First time I used these cheap glasses the busted.</li>
            <li>I spend most of my time in a tanning bed with my eyes shut while I listen to the music and rest, but It&#x27;s really easy to see through these goggles when I do have my eyes open.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s what I should expect for paying under $5, but the plastic is cheap and they don&#x27;t stay on your eyes very well.</li>
            <li>good product, exactly as expected, cheap, arrived fast, does its job.</li>
            <li>I bought a pair of these right from the tanning salon I visit.</li>
            <li>Never found anything I like as much as these!</li>
            <li>No tan lines or funny eyes.</li>
            <li>like i was going to snap them the first time i picked them up.</li>
            <li>They are super comfortable and you can still see everything if you want to open your eyes and look around!</li>
            <li>Maybe I was unlucky, but I wonder how many others are really getting different colors.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly be a return customer &amp; have referred my friends to you.</li>
            <li>I received the red which was fine.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get some cute pink tanning goggles, but was very surprised to see just how completely transparent and flimsy these goggles were.  </li>
            <li>i like these goggles they work well although they didnt do much for my racoon eye which was my reason for buying them.</li>
            <li>There are no specifics listed as to how much UV protection is provided.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;What is really killer about these is the 360 degree viewing.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a big gap causing light to come in around my eyes and even the insert that came along with them</li>
            <li>/&gt;However the drawback is that these goggles are kind-of narrow fitting around your eyeball and cause your eyebrow area to really stand out while your tanning - the change made me burn right under my eyebrows and above the plastic.</li>
            <li>I don;t think I have a big head, but I knotted the string right at each end</li>
            <li>I honestly could not bring myself to use them in the tanning booth, because I have a hard time believing that they protect your eyes at all, compared to darker goggles that actually dim visible</li>
            <li>They completely cover the eyes but not your face!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These work so well that I have bought a second pair in case I lose my first ones.  </li>
            <li>Wish they came with some sort of clear elastic strap</li>
            <li>It is a nicer/newer/trendier place, and quite professional as well.</li>
            <li>have had mine for several years, and they have not broken.  </li>
            <li>Many issue is that many newer tanning beds have complicated controls, and you just cannot see them with other goggles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instead of trying to look out a tiny dot of a hole in opaque plastic, you can see fairly clearly all around you.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it is just paranoia, I don&#x27;t know, but I think it&#x27;s worth sacrificing a little goggle-cuteness in order to actually protect your eyes.  </li>
            <li>The booth will be a bit brighter with these goggles than it would be with the opaque tanning goggles (which seemed obvious to me, but apparently it isn&#x27;t to everyone, as evinced by one of the reviews herein).  </li>
            <li>My first pair was green BTW.  </li>
            <li>These particular ones here on Amazon though, are not first run quality.  </li>

            <li> These particular ones here on Amazon though, are not first run quality.  </li>
            <li> The product description says \\&quot;Single Pair of Goggles, One Pair Only.</li>
            <li> These goggles will barely stay on my face with a little squinting while standing (I have a larger sized head).  </li>
            <li> Other tanning bed glassed has left non-tanned marks across the nose...</li>
            <li> Your fast turnaround time tells me that you take your business &amp; customers seriously.</li>
            <li> so I could keep them tight against my eyes, but no such luck!</li>
            <li> The tiny little hook used will probably break off.</li>
            <li> And when you are wearing the string with it, the plastic is rough feeling on my eyes.</li>
            <li> not a huge issue for me since i only do lay down beds.</li>
            <li> and i just feel like it doesnt protect my eyes at all compared to other glasses ive tried.</li>
            <li> You can see everything unlike other tanning bed goggles.</li>
            <li> Also, these are not as dark as the typical sunnies goggles.  </li>
            <li> Not entirely comfortable as the frame that rests on your eyelid skin feels sharp.  </li>
            <li> and it is a little tight.</li>
            <li> Seems a little dubious.    </li>
            <li> I wasted my $10.</li>
            <li> I got green when I ordered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really, it just feels that way on delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> I mean they work, the string just bugs me after a few mins because it is so tight.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product with the intention to use in a stand up tanning bed - I try to avoid all of the fungi growing on the usual beds.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sit on them or do anything careless and find them durable enough.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a small piece of plastic.  </li>
            <li> The little tabs on the side where you tie the elastic band are very thin and not complete, so my elastic keeps popping off</li>
            <li> Hard to keep it on my eyes without it.</li>
            <li> I mean, come on, if you get skin cancer on an arm or leg and they have to cut a chunk out, no biggie, but if you get it on your eyelid, and they have to cut a chunk out ...</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> These are poorly made.</li>
            <li> and i just carry them in my purse and they have already broken on the eye strap part</li>
            <li> Also, the description says \\&quot;random pick</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I received the pepto-pink shown.  </li>
            <li> Random Pick of color.</li>
            <li> So if you tan in a stand-up bed these are useless.</li>
            <li> and they tell you that the color is random.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> so unfortunately I bought something I can&#x27;t even use!</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> I hated them and threw th away.</li>

            <li> Not only did these arrive quickly, they are great goggles that are comfortable and don&#x27;t leave tan lines around your eyes.  NOTE: The booth will be a bit brighter with these goggles than it would be with the opaque tanning goggles (which seemed obvious to me, but apparently it isn&#x27;t to everyone, as evinced by one of the reviews herein).  According to the people at the tanning salon, these goggles still offer sufficient UV protection.</li>
            <li> No sooner than I ordered these tanning goggles, they were in my mailbox 2-3 days later!! GOOD JOB!!...I will certainly be a return customer &amp; have referred my friends to you. Your fast turnaround time tells me that you take your business &amp; customers seriously. Thank You!</li>
            <li> I have been using Eye Candy for years and love them.  These particular ones here on Amazon though, are not first run quality.  The little tabs on the side where you tie the elastic band are very thin and not complete, so my elastic keeps popping off and they fall off.  Very poor quality. I wasted my $10. Not happy.</li>
            <li> i like these goggles they work well although they didnt do much for my racoon eye which was my reason for buying them.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these tanning goggles!! Never found anything I like as much as these! The shipping was also very good, they came fast! They are super comfortable and you can still see everything if you want to open your eyes and look around!</li>
            <li> Ordered this product with the intention to use in a stand up tanning bed - I try to avoid all of the fungi growing on the usual beds.  The goggles arrived in a timely manner, though without the promised elastic strap.  I don&#x27;t even know how a strap would be attached to these things.  These goggles will barely stay on my face with a little squinting while standing (I have a larger sized head).  My fiance can&#x27;t get them to stay put at all.      They also let some light in while I&#x27;m wearing them (through the resulting crevices on the top and bottom).  One is able to see the majority of the visual field with these on, in rose color anyway.  There are no specifics listed as to how much UV protection is provided.  There is a mention of adherence to some tanning guideline/law but after looking this up I was unsure of any implication for tanning goggles in the document.  Seems a little dubious.    Also, the description says \\&quot;random pick colors\\&quot; which may be true.  Unfortunately, I received the pepto-pink shown.  Maybe I was unlucky, but I wonder how many others are really getting different colors.  That&#x27;s not really a big deal, but what IS a big deal is charging almost seven dollars for something that others are charging only a couple for then lying about the contents.</li>
            <li> They work well. I want to get another pair, too. No tan lines or funny eyes. The only problem I have is the cord. The tiny little hook used will probably break off. But they&#x27;re good for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought a pair of these right from the tanning salon I visit. It is a nicer/newer/trendier place, and quite professional as well. I trust that they wouldn&#x27;t be promoting these if they didn&#x27;t protect the eyes.    The glasses fit snugly across my eyes for a safe fit. I spend most of my time in a tanning bed with my eyes shut while I listen to the music and rest, but It&#x27;s really easy to see through these goggles when I do have my eyes open.</li>
            <li> These are poorly made. I hated them and threw th away.</li>
            <li> The product description says \\&quot;Single Pair of Goggles, One Pair Only. Random Pick of color. comes with elastic strap\\&quot;...they do not come with an elastic strap! So if you tan in a stand-up bed these are useless.</li>
            <li> For the price these are great!!!</li>
            <li> No rocket science here. good product, exactly as expected, cheap, arrived fast, does its job. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good goggles, feel comfortable, eyes feel great. They have no strap or anything though so you can only use them in a tanning bed not in a stand up booth.</li>
            <li> First time I used these cheap glasses the busted. Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money no matter how low the price.</li>
            <li> Other tanning bed glassed has left non-tanned marks across the nose... these don&#x27;t! (I no longer have raccoon eyes!) They completely cover the eyes but not your face!</li>
            <li> They are what they are and they work! I have the red ones and I&#x27;d definitely buy them again. My eyes are super protected while I&#x27;m crisping up the rest of me.</li>
            <li> The plastic on these glasses are soo cheap i felt like i was going to snap them the first time i picked them up. Also in the tanning bed im still squinting and i just feel like it doesnt protect my eyes at all compared to other glasses ive tried.

I mean, come on, if you get skin cancer on an arm or leg and they have to cut a chunk out, no biggie, but if you get it on your eyelid, and they have to cut a chunk out ... THEN YOU HAVE NO EYELID.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Priorities, people.</li>
            <li> i got these when i bought my tanning bed love them best ever for the price</li>
            <li> Nice product and good quality.  I have ordered and given away a large number of them, though I have yet to see the purple ones (which I really would have liked) but still not a bad price and it holds up well.</li>
            <li> This is my second pair like this. The string is detachable so if you lay in a bed you don&#x27;t have to use them which is great. You can see everything unlike other tanning bed goggles. Assorted colors was ok. I got green when I ordered. Would have been really cool if I got to pick what color I wanted, but overall, I AM VERY SATISFIED!</li>
            <li> After I got these, I never use my sunnies (or similar-construction products) any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had mine for several years, and they have not broken.  I don&#x27;t sit on them or do anything careless and find them durable enough.  I also don&#x27;t care about and never use the elastic bands.  What I do with every pair of tanning goggles is to run the nose bridge under hot water (like from an instant hot) to soften up the plastic and then fit the goggles more to my eyes and face for a good seal.  These are also very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is really killer about these is the 360 degree viewing.  Instead of trying to look out a tiny dot of a hole in opaque plastic, you can see fairly clearly all around you.  Also, these are not as dark as the typical sunnies goggles.  Many issue is that many newer tanning beds have complicated controls, and you just cannot see them with other goggles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work so well that I have bought a second pair in case I lose my first ones.  My first pair was green BTW.  My second pair is still in shipping.</li>
            <li> These are the best tanning goggles I have ever used, these prevent you from getting the RACOON eyes like the regular ones, I use mine all the time in the tanning bed!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the full view - I haven&#x27;t had that in goggles yet and really liked it!&lt;br /&gt;However the drawback is that these goggles are kind-of narrow fitting around your eyeball and cause your eyebrow area to really stand out while your tanning - the change made me burn right under my eyebrows and above the plastic. Its not painful, but its a noticeable hugging feeling around your eyeball that can&#x27;t be considered comfortable.  I&#x27;ll try a different brand after these wear out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give 5 stars cause it&#x27;s a small piece of plastic.  But it does just what I want them to do.  They could be a little more comfortable, but they really do a good job at not leaving a line.</li>
            <li> This product was good for the price paid. plastic is sort of cheap looking and i just carry them in my purse and they have already broken on the eye strap part so i have to just set them on my face. not a huge issue for me since i only do lay down beds.</li>
            <li> I prefer the stand-up tanners...this is advertised to include an elastic strap, but it didn&#x27;t come with one. Hard to keep it on my eyes without it. Only buy this if you plan to user the beds.</li>
            <li> Item was just as described HOWEVER I can&#x27;t use the goggles because when I set them over my eyes there&#x27;s a big gap causing light to come in around my eyes and even the insert that came along with them said not to use them if that happens... so unfortunately I bought something I can&#x27;t even use! Wish they came with some sort of clear elastic strap so I could keep them tight against my eyes, but no such luck! &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> these are the best out of all the others I have tried</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s what I should expect for paying under $5, but the plastic is cheap and they don&#x27;t stay on your eyes very well.</li>
            <li> Nice and light weight.</li>
            <li> Great item! I received the red which was fine. I didn&#x27;t care which color and they tell you that the color is random. I don;t think I have a big head, but I knotted the string right at each end and it is a little tight. I think I need another string, which is no big deal. I mean they work, the string just bugs me after a few mins because it is so tight. So that&#x27;s an easy fix. Thanks for a great product. I would recommend and I would order again if I lose or break these.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok. Not entirely comfortable as the frame that rests on your eyelid skin feels sharp.  It&#x27;s not really, it just feels that way on delicate skin.  It didn&#x27;t come with any labeling that said it actually protects your eyes from harmful tanning lamp rays.  I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;re better than nothing.  I don&#x27;t tan at a salon often (only 2 weeks out of the year) so they&#x27;ll do for now.  I just wish I had more faith that they&#x27;re doing more than just putting lightly colored plastic over my eyes.  I won&#x27;t be buying another pair.</li>
