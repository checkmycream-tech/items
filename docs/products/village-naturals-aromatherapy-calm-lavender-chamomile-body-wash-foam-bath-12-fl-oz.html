            <li>I use it with the Body Butter and simply love how my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and glad I was able to find it....</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>Sophisticated and perfumey.</li>
            <li>I loved it right away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine for others</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the &amp;#34;aromatherapy&amp;#34; part, but it definitely was incredibly relaxing when I used it for my bath.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice, like Jergens, but doesn&#x27;t suds up at all, so i dont really feel like I&#x27;m getting very clean.</li>
            <li>The scents were cheap.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I really think it helps me sleep better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to cheap scents, and this is fabulous.</li>
            <li>The smell is so relaxing and fresh.  </li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s a good product, and you don&#x27;t need a whole lot for a bubble bath either.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin so smooth&amp; soft; I used it as bubbles for the bath tub !!!</li>
            <li>I sleep like a baby when I use it right before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li>So very yummy!  </li>
            <li>I first got the product as a hostess gift.  </li>
            <li>Ordered the 1st one for myself, then came back for more for my sister and my friend.  </li>
            <li>Wish it came in a large pump bottle</li>
            <li>IT IS A VERY CALMING SCENT.</li>
            <li>I really helps me to relax.</li>
            <li>it is very relaxing</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>really wanted</li>
            <li>I tried the village natural with hopes of a moisturizing latherful calming body wash with a calming scent.</li>
            <li>This gel is made of natural components and laves skin soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>what have you, it also lathers nice, and it&#x27;s a thin, clear liquid, but not oily to me.</li>
            <li>was glad to come across it because it&#x27;s a few bucks less than the 100% Pure Body Foam, and I&#x27;m on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I normally use mine in the shower especially after I come in from the gym to help me relax.  </li>
            <li>Will purchase again in the near future.</li>
            <li>I have very dry and sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li> I am a little congested from being sick so that could be why the smell and aroma wasn&#x27;t doing wonders for me.</li>

            <li> I tried the village natural with hopes of a moisturizing latherful calming body wash with a calming scent. The scent seems to be more pleasant for men but women may prefer something more floral. I&#x27;ll continue my search for the perfect calming body wash and I may even try this one again if it is improved.</li>
            <li> I LOVED THE PRODUCT. IT IS A VERY CALMING SCENT.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. The scents were cheap. I was expecting more for the price. Now I&#x27;m stuck with 3 bottles of yuck!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful.  Ordered the 1st one for myself, then came back for more for my sister and my friend.  They both loved it.  I normally use mine in the shower especially after I come in from the gym to help me relax.  One bottle lasts me a long time.  I just finished it this morning and have the next one on standby.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and living in a small rural community, I am unable to buy it locally.  How often do you find a \\&quot;Bubbling Bath Oil\\&quot;?  It&#x27;s almost an \\&quot;oxymoron\\&quot;.  Bath oil and Bubbles.  I love it.  Thank-you Amazon for having this product available to me!!!!  Shirley</li>
            <li> This body wash is an excellent product</li>
            <li> This Body Wash leaves you smelling wonderful. I use it with the Body Butter and simply love how my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful lathers great ! Leaves skin so smooth&amp; soft; I used it as bubbles for the bath tub !!!</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin.  So i thought this would be non-drying as soap.  It smells really nice, like Jergens, but doesn&#x27;t suds up at all, so i dont really feel like I&#x27;m getting very clean.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I sleep like a baby when I use it right before I go to bed.  I really helps me to relax. LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine for others I just don&#x27;t use products with sulfates.</li>
            <li> Foams well and has a great smell to go along with it. It will not work as a bubble bath doesn&#x27;t bubble well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the &amp;#34;aromatherapy&amp;#34; part, but it definitely was incredibly relaxing when I used it for my bath. I am a little congested from being sick so that could be why the smell and aroma wasn&#x27;t doing wonders for me. Not sure if it affects the temp. of the water either, but my bath seemed hotter than I was expecting it! I like the product, not sure how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; it is it seems a bit syrupy. But overall it&#x27;s a good product, and you don&#x27;t need a whole lot for a bubble bath either.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and glad I was able to find it.... It smells wonderful and it is very relaxing</li>
            <li> Okay. This smells like what an aunt would wear haha if that makes any sense. It does smell good though. Sophisticated and perfumey. Don&#x27;t know about the calming effect or what have you, it also lathers nice, and it&#x27;s a thin, clear liquid, but not oily to me. I probably would purchase again. Especially at $2 lol Also came fast, and was packaged nicely. Give it a try. It&#x27;s at a good price so why not lol</li>
            <li> This gel is made of natural components and laves skin soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I was glad to come across it because it&#x27;s a few bucks less than the 100% Pure Body Foam, and I&#x27;m on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted</li>
