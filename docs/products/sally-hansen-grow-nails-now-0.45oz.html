            <li> It&#x27;s sort of like a really thick nail polish that doesn&#x27;t chip off because you message it in to your nails.</li>

            <li> I used to bite my nails and I finally stopped but I couldn&#x27;t get my nails to grow very long before they&#x27;d break or chip or split. I tried a few different things and then I found this by Sally Hansen and it worked stunningly!! It&#x27;s sort of like a really thick nail polish that doesn&#x27;t chip off because you message it in to your nails. Using this, I was able to grow my nails. What I&#x27;ve found works best is to put a coat of this on message it into your nails and cuticles, and then wipe off the rest. I apply it about every other day. I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know who is trying to grow their nails out. This is an awesome product. The best one out there, in my opinion!! Try it!!!</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen Grow Nails Now product is great.  It does exactly what it says ....the only product I can use and grow nails.  Whatever my nails are lacking this product helps as they are growing ...no more splitting or breaking.  My nails look healthy and Grow Nails Now is the reason for my healthy nails.</li>
            <li> I used this product a while ago and it worked well. IK used to bite my nails so I needed something to make them grow fast. I used it daily for a long time and my nails looked beautiful. Then I couldn&#x27;t find it so I stopped using it.  I found it again and I am so happy. I have pretty nice nails already but they are a little weak and break easily. I decided to try this again with the miracle cure strengthener [[ASIN:B0046MI3SO Sally Hansen Miracle, Cure for Severe Problem Nails, 0.45 Fluid Ounce]]to see if I can toughen them up.</li>
            <li> I am a guy with messed up nails. I tried another Sally Hansen product but it looked like I had put polish on my nails. NOT a good look. And it did not come off. Being a guy I did not have polish remover around. \\&quot;face palm\\&quot;. But this stuff does seem to make my nails more attractive with regular use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for growing nails.I&#x27;ve been using this on and off for years! I also use other product by Sally Hansen the nail and cuticle cream . So far I&#x27;ve used other products but nothing seems to work except this . This has worked on my splitting and cracking nails.</li>
            <li> works great this is the second time I buy it, It works great for nail growth I recommend to everyone who is trying to grow their nail</li>
            <li> Great product!! It lives up to it&#x27;s promise to help you grow nails in s week. It works!!!</li>
            <li> I used sally Hansen product all the time. but unfortunately the stores sell out so quickly until I had to order online. I use this product for 4 years and got great result.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim because my nails would frequently chip and break, and this is the only nail strengthening product I have used that I have actually seen results! I used it every day for two weeks and my nails were visibly stronger and were growing longer and faster! 100% would recommend to anyone with nails that frequently break due to biting or who use their hands a lot (I worked at a coffee shop and constantly washing dishes and making food did a number on them). Only product I will use!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best SH products, if not *the* best for growing weak brittle nails. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> it is a really nice product!&lt;br /&gt;definetly sally hansen is one of the best brands for nail care! love it!</li>
            <li> I dont know if this will help your nails to grow or not. I dont care for it when you put it on it leaves a sticky residue. So right after you will either have to wash your hands or put on lotion</li>
            <li> I read so many great reviews on this but it was a waste of my money. I gave it three stars because I think the indigents are great and that this would work for people who don&#x27;t have serious nail issues. However, I&#x27;ve been unable to grow my nails since childhood. They peel,bend and tear. I applied this twice daily for two Weeks then once daily and had zero improvement. I also hate how sticky it leaves your nails, so lint and dust cling to them unless you wash it off. Seems to defeat the purpose! I&#x27;m going to try Quimica instead.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! Makes your nails strong, no more splitting.. so they actually will grow.  The only down side, application is 1 to 2 times a day...your nail must be bare in order for it to work and in doing so you leave it unprotected.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this at the BX and it has literally grown my nails an inch or two within 5 days and I don&#x27;t even put on everyday or twice a day at that, Ive never had something that worked this well before and my nails are stronger and longer which was crazy because my nails were so brittle from having fake nails, I&#x27;m glad I got this cause now I&#x27;ll probably never get any gel or acrylic on my nails again.</li>
            <li> This is a magical potion, and I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s in such short supply.  I couldn&#x27;t find it at Bartells, Safeway or Fred Meyer.  I only hope it&#x27;s not being discontinued.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and makes my nails rock hard. I also like how it helps with my dry split cuticles in the winter time. I keep a bottle of this on my desk at work and a bottle on my coffee table. It doesn&#x27;t leave my fingers greasy and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. I always had short nails until I found this.</li>
            <li> Yup...this one is the best out there...I have a bad habit of bitting my nails. I love how my hands look when I ACTUALLY LET THEM GROW!! lol...so this product does help me...within 2-3 days I start seeing results...then I can color my nails...oh so pretty:D&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Sally!!:D</li>
            <li> Love it and it arrived fast!</li>
            <li> I have used many different products to help my weak, splitting nails - some of them also made by Sally Hansen - but this is the only one that has ever WORKED!!!  I found this product about two years ago.  After years of frustration with nails that split and break before they achieve any length, I tried acrylic nails.  These look good for a few weeks, but they require constant maintenance, and they destroy your natural nail in the process.  After getting a nail fungus from the acrylics, I swore off of those.  But how to heal my destoyed nails?  I saw this product at the drug store and decided it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.  Within two days of the first use, I saw a little growth in my nails.  Within two weeks I saw noticeable growth, and the nails were stronger.  Now I use this product daily and my nails are long, strong and beautiful!  Since the drug stores only carry this product sporadically, I buy it from Amazon.  Buy it!  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
