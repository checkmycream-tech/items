            <li> Unfortunately, although it does take the frizz away, it&#x27;s so light that it acts on my hair the way water does, i.e., it curls it.  </li>

            <li> hands down the only leave in I use...not sticky..does not have any hold...</li>

            <li> I think only half of it will be over till that time.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve found that the only use I have for this is to spray it on my freshly-washed, towel-dried hair, work it in, add a few pumps of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This works but not as well as I expected</li>
            <li> hair sprays have dried my hair out.</li>

            <li> the product is buildable and doesn&#x27;t react poorly with my other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Today, I went out in the rain and normally that&#x27;s a big no without an umbrella: I usually have hair that feels disgusting after being touched by weather.</li>
            <li> It dried My Hair out worse than it  was.</li>
            <li> If you have fly-away hair, or cowlicks, or annoying hair in general, GK will help.</li>
            <li> I felt a bit stupid paying double digits for  hair spray, of all things.</li>

            <li> This product works great for fine color treated hair. Products were shipped perfectly</li>

            <li> Absolutely life changing!! Best leave in your hair will love you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m torn about this product.  It&#x27;s a light keratin spray that I thought I could use as a touch-up between hair washings when Florida humidity had frizzed up what had been nicely behaving, controlled hair.  Unfortunately, although it does take the frizz away, it&#x27;s so light that it acts on my hair the way water does, i.e., it curls it.  So I&#x27;ve found that the only use I have for this is to spray it on my freshly-washed, towel-dried hair, work it in, add a few pumps of [[ASIN:B0041R7C4A Global Keratin Serum 1.69oz]], and then blow dry.  The new spray keeps the hair soft and the serum keeps it from curling.</li>
            <li> I am a huge hair care junkie and I am certain this spray is a must have for girls who need to maintain their locks. Spray leaves your hair feeling conditioned and moisturized. No drying properties and for me the Juviderm property in this spray (I think thats what it&#x27;s called?) thickens my strands to reduce fly aways. The spray is also light-weight so it doesn&#x27;t look greasy whether you spray it on wet or dry hair. People often ask me if I blow dried or flat ironed after only spraying this in my hair &amp; then letting air dry because my hair looks smooth and freshly blown out after using it! So yes, I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> received product quickly, works well on hair.</li>
            <li> My stylist uses this product which I love.  She charges twice as much as Amazon.  Keeps the style for a couple of days.  Will purchase again.</li>

I didn&#x27;t expect it to completely restore the style and make my hair completely manageable as it did.&lt;br /&gt;Most hair sprays have dried my hair out. GK keeps it in perfect shape. If you have fly-away hair, or cowlicks, or annoying hair in general, GK will help.</li>
            <li> I love this leave-in. I discovered it in a salon near me and when I ran out I was happy to see that Amazon carried it.

            <li> I like it because it smells great.  It honestly isn&#x27;t my favorite, though.  If you&#x27;re just looking for something that smells nice and is SUPER light...this is for you.  I couldn&#x27;t tell that it did much as a leave- in.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for the hair. It works great in my hair it was fantastic.  I will buy it again. Love it.</li>
            <li> Eliminates frizzies while conditioning your hair! One of the best products I have used! Is a new favorite as well as the shampoo and conditioner..a must have! Does not weigh your hair down and adds exceptional shine</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love it.  If you have the keratin on your hair this a a great leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing and getting out the frizz! Hydrates your hair! Just spray it in and comb it through! Easy!</li>

            <li> I love these product they give my hair lasting shine without weighing down my hair. That&#x27;s why I give them 5 stars</li>
            <li> The best hair products around for Keratin - treated hair.  My hair finishes with silky and soft texture every time.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> It dried My Hair out worse than it  was. Its in the trash and gone. I was hoping it would worl.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this product. My hair is naturally curly so I can just let it air dry and the curls look great. No frizz.</li>
            <li> I honestly have never experienced a hair product like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is mildly damaged from continued hair coloring and I always have a hard time finding a product that keeps my hair feeling sleek and smooth with subtle shine. Everything I have tried in the past leaves my hair feeling sticky by the end of the day, or gets greasy throughout. Today, I went out in the rain and normally that&#x27;s a big no without an umbrella: I usually have hair that feels disgusting after being touched by weather. My hair felt like it had not been affected by the rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s best is the product is buildable and doesn&#x27;t react poorly with my other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> A++ Light weight. My hair loves this product. Even in FL&#x27;s humidity it works great. Good product. Would buy again. Use it along with Beach Babe texturizing cream OR It&#x27;s a 10 styling gel. One or the other with this product is good.</li>
            <li> This just makes your hair softer and more manageable after you wash and condition your hair.  Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> Works well to extend the life of my Keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> hands down the only leave in I use...not sticky..does not have any hold...just nice smooth soft hair</li>
            <li> It has only 4 months left to expiration date.I think only half of it will be over till that time.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times from my hairdresser and loved it and never had a problem with the sprayer until now. Had to pour the product into a different bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Conditions, detangles, light, and has a great scent.  No problems with spray or leakage.  Arrived quickly and intact.</li>
            <li> If you have curly or wavy hair this product applied after shampoo and conditioner (preferably Global Keratin) will give you all the benefits of a Brazilian Blowout without having to pay large amounts of money.  I call it the Miracle Maker because it leaves my hair soft, shiny, manageable and definitely without any FRIZZ for several days!  I&#x27;ve been buying it for over a year with no regrets.
