            <li> Gift for mother&#x27;s day to the wife.  She liked it, I love it.</li>
            <li> This perfume confuses me so much. I really want to like it. Looking at the notes, I should be crazy about it. Yet every time I try it on, I am tempted to scrub it off. I get a strongly unpleasant alcohol-like blast when I spritz it on. After a few minutes that is gone but what replaces it is not much better. To describe it I would say if you lit a big pile of pencil shavings on fire, and then threw in a couple of cloves and a couple of wilted gardenia petals, the smoke from that fire would be what this scent smells like on me. That is all I smell until after a couple of hours, at which point I can smell nothing unless I bring my wrist to my nose. On my wrist I smell a powdery, perfume-that&#x27;s-so-old-its-turned-to-alcohol smell. Sadness. I normally love anything rose! Why can&#x27;t this perfume be nice to me? I&#x27;m not giving up this easily, though. I think I&#x27;m going to try layering it with other scents.</li>
            <li> If your looking for strictly rose perfume, don&#x27;t buy this.&lt;br /&gt;I made that mistake. But I gave it away as a Christmas present&lt;br /&gt;for my sister in law! She loved it!</li>
            <li> This was very bad...i don&#x27;t even smell it once I spray it on.I brought this many times else were and it was great...</li>
            <li> Great smell i have even gotten compliments</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It is exactly as I bought it</li>
            <li> Bought per wife&#x27;s request. She loves it. Has been using it for years. Will continue to buy it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> It smells rosey, but somehow just.... not in a good way, somehow a mixture of slightly rotten flowers and old lady.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my body chemistry but eurgh</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t smell very good but you pay for what you get</li>
            <li> I LOVE VERY SATISFIED</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say since perfume is really something that is a personal preference. I will say, however, that I like how this leaves a light scent that isn&#x27;t too over powering. It also last a long time and doesn&#x27;t fade like other perfumes. Overall a nice little bottle and does what it was made for.</li>
