            <li>It&#x27;s my own fault for not staying away from a product with sulfates.</li>

            <li>Using this product for years and my skin is great and I am 81 years old.</li>
            <li>Feels very clean and smooth after using.  </li>
            <li>Owe that to the fact that I&#x27;m totally immature (LOL) but gotta give a nod to the fact that dermalogica and I have been friends for many years now</li>
            <li>But this product is easy to use.</li>
            <li>A very mild cleanser</li>
            <li>This is a nice facial cleanser with lactic acid which is really good for your skin.</li>
            <li>am 41 and have tried many products to take care of my aging skin, and the Dermalogica Age Smart line has made me overall very happy.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels after using this cleanser - thoroughly clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Price was fantastic......</li>
            <li>I just wish it was sulfate free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and effective.</li>
            <li>Smooth, was recommended by a friend in the beauty field.</li>
            <li>I use are better absorbed ..</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the results...</li>
            <li>Gentle, effective for helping exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>and I have several others (without sulfates) that work great.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic which makes me want to use the product.</li>
            <li>My skin seems to do better when I rotate this cleanser with another more gentle cleaner.</li>
            <li>first time trying , enjoying it.</li>
            <li>great cleanser, lasts a long time, rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>Seems to get my skin clean.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean off makeup..</li>
            <li>but my face did feel ultra clean.</li>
            <li>love them all and use age smart ones</li>
            <li>I love the age smart products - my friends say I &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The zits cleared and my face looked smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li>The seller should focus on detailing when shipping products because as a buyer to order it online, I need to have full faith on what I am getting.</li>
            <li>So I bought the full size.</li>
            <li>Have loved this product for several years.</li>
            <li>The whole AgeSmart product line is top notch quality.  </li>
            <li>It came quickly</li>
            <li>It really does leave my skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Really makes my skin feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>My favorite product ever my face feels so soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a must buy so worth the money.</li>
            <li>I ordered this cleanser right away.</li>
            <li>My serums soak right in after use.</li>
            <li>so I use lotion right afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels clean and ready to receive toner and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and on top of it, very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have  never spent more than $10.00 on a cleanser</li>
            <li>I have used Dermalogica products for over 10 years and am moving into using more of the age smart products as  am now over 40 years old.</li>
            <li>Good for older skin and doesn&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
            <li>Hydrating, clear skin, keeps the fine lines at bay.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I will never go back to cheap drugstore cleansers!</li>
            <li>I only wish it was more affordable.</li>
            <li>At first because it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;foam&#x27;</li>
            <li>I do wish it lathered more, but that is just a personal preference.</li>
            <li>Dermalogica skin resurfacing cleanser cleanses and makes my skin soft and oil free.</li>
            <li>but I did feel it could have more of a gritty effect to remove</li>
            <li>This cleanser really makes a difference, you see immediately!</li>
            <li>Will take a little time, but so far, I&#x27;m happy with results.  </li>
            <li>That may very well be the way it is supposed to be used, but I like it so much I tried using it every day!</li>
            <li>plus I now get the full benefits of my serums since they don&#x27;t lay on top of dead skin .</li>
            <li>Huge overall appearance of my skin!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li>I have used it for two years and will absolutely continue.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>This Dermalogica cleanser is gentle</li>
            <li>Really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t buy anything over a 2, but I am willing to make an exception for this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much either.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive/oily skin</li>
            <li>but it is also gentle.</li>
            <li>and I can see my acnes diminishing leaving clear and fresh skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks  jb</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t like this product as much as I thought I would.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I had a sample of this and did not expect much but</li>
            <li>but this is so gentle.</li>
            <li>Precleanse really allows the Resurfacing Cleanser to do its job.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a full out breakout, but I think that the daily use is too much for my skin.</li>
            <li>It works really well for me, oily skin, living in high humidity environment.</li>
            <li>no hydration and much older than I am.</li>
            <li>highly recommended by another user.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Dermalogica.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations</li>
            <li>It is a good cleanser for someone with less dry skin.</li>
            <li>use the Dermalogica line, but this is my first purchase of this particular product and will be my last.</li>
            <li>I have adult hormonal acne and this really impacts it and helps keep my pores clear.</li>
            <li>I was using Dermalogica clay cleanser which is made for super oily skin, but it seemed to make my face dry.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle but very affective in removing makeup and deep cleansing my face/neck area.  </li>
            <li>But, I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It is however too strong for daily use for my normal, yet tending to dry maturing skin.  </li>
            <li>So 4 weeks for a 52 year old!</li>
            <li>I initially thought my face cleared because I was eating better, but I used it again the next two times I was visiting and had the same results.  </li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>In general I really like Dermalogica products</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and though  generally oily, if I use this too much I get dryness and some peeling at the corners of my nose and my chin.  </li>
            <li>For now I will stick to old faithful, Yonka.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>but if you keep with it, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, alergic and rashes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Resurfacing Cleanser is an effective product but beware not to overdo it, as the active ingredients can overwhelm some of us in a most uncomfortable way!  </li>
            <li>Long time Dermalogica user, ticked passed 40 this year and my dermatologist recommended changing to the age smart line.  </li>
            <li>This product really cleans my face but using it every day seems to make my face feel to dry</li>
            <li>It looked to be the same as what the salon used, however this is probably something made for young 20 something girls, not for a 40yr old.</li>
            <li>I usually get this locally but this was a better price for same item.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with many scars from acne breakout during pregnancy, dark spots and uneven skintone.</li>
            <li>I have this product before &amp; I can only guess that its old.</li>
            <li>and wow.  Makes my skin look totally rejuvenated after use!  </li>
            <li>and it does not get back to normal until a week later.</li>
            <li>how many times I used the stuff to moisturize, I always looked like I was so tired,</li>
            <li>At first it might be a little irritating (mostly around my nose area)</li>
            <li>I use this with my clear sonic and it works very well dor everyday use.  </li>
            <li>I thought I had everything under control with all natural products (I only use things with low-toxicity ratings found on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep website).  </li>
            <li>Did not smell the same or have same results when purchased directly form a spa.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Smooth skin!</li>
            <li> It works great and really cleanses your face and neck.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I believe this product works for others who have healthy skin.</li>
            <li> my skin just couldn&#x27;t handle it any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works better for others.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I have found in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product, works great on making hands look younger too!</li>
            <li> Using this product for years and my skin is great and I am 81 years old.</li>
            <li> Feels very clean and smooth after using.  </li>
            <li> Owe that to the fact that I&#x27;m totally immature (LOL) but gotta give a nod to the fact that dermalogica and I have been friends for many years now</li>
            <li> But this product is easy to use.</li>
            <li> A very mild cleanser</li>
            <li> This is a nice facial cleanser with lactic acid which is really good for your skin.</li>
            <li> am 41 and have tried many products to take care of my aging skin, and the Dermalogica Age Smart line has made me overall very happy.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels after using this cleanser - thoroughly clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Price was fantastic......</li>
            <li> I just wish it was sulfate free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and effective.</li>
            <li> Smooth, was recommended by a friend in the beauty field.</li>
            <li> I use are better absorbed ..</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the results...</li>
            <li> Gentle, effective for helping exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> and I have several others (without sulfates) that work great.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic which makes me want to use the product.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to do better when I rotate this cleanser with another more gentle cleaner.</li>
            <li> first time trying , enjoying it.</li>
            <li> great cleanser, lasts a long time, rinses clean.  </li>
            <li> Seems to get my skin clean.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean off makeup..</li>
            <li> but my face did feel ultra clean.</li>
            <li> love them all and use age smart ones</li>
            <li> I love the age smart products - my friends say I &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The zits cleared and my face looked smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li> The seller should focus on detailing when shipping products because as a buyer to order it online, I need to have full faith on what I am getting.</li>
            <li> So I bought the full size.</li>
            <li> Have loved this product for several years.</li>
            <li> The whole AgeSmart product line is top notch quality.  </li>
            <li> It came quickly</li>
            <li> It really does leave my skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Really makes my skin feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> My favorite product ever my face feels so soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must buy so worth the money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cleanser right away.</li>
            <li> My serums soak right in after use.</li>
            <li> so I use lotion right afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels clean and ready to receive toner and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and on top of it, very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have  never spent more than $10.00 on a cleanser</li>
            <li> I have used Dermalogica products for over 10 years and am moving into using more of the age smart products as  am now over 40 years old.</li>
            <li> Good for older skin and doesn&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
            <li> Hydrating, clear skin, keeps the fine lines at bay.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to cheap drugstore cleansers!</li>
            <li> I only wish it was more affordable.</li>
            <li> At first because it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;foam&#x27;</li>
            <li> I do wish it lathered more, but that is just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> Dermalogica skin resurfacing cleanser cleanses and makes my skin soft and oil free.</li>
            <li> but I did feel it could have more of a gritty effect to remove</li>
            <li> This cleanser really makes a difference, you see immediately!</li>
            <li> Will take a little time, but so far, I&#x27;m happy with results.  </li>
            <li> That may very well be the way it is supposed to be used, but I like it so much I tried using it every day!</li>
            <li> plus I now get the full benefits of my serums since they don&#x27;t lay on top of dead skin .</li>
            <li> Huge overall appearance of my skin!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> I have used it for two years and will absolutely continue.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> This Dermalogica cleanser is gentle</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t buy anything over a 2, but I am willing to make an exception for this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much either.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive/oily skin</li>
            <li> but it is also gentle.</li>
            <li> and I can see my acnes diminishing leaving clear and fresh skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks  jb</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t like this product as much as I thought I would.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this and did not expect much but</li>
            <li> but this is so gentle.</li>
            <li> Precleanse really allows the Resurfacing Cleanser to do its job.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a full out breakout, but I think that the daily use is too much for my skin.</li>
            <li> It works really well for me, oily skin, living in high humidity environment.</li>
            <li> no hydration and much older than I am.</li>
            <li> highly recommended by another user.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Dermalogica.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations</li>
            <li> It is a good cleanser for someone with less dry skin.</li>
            <li> use the Dermalogica line, but this is my first purchase of this particular product and will be my last.</li>
            <li> I have adult hormonal acne and this really impacts it and helps keep my pores clear.</li>
            <li> I was using Dermalogica clay cleanser which is made for super oily skin, but it seemed to make my face dry.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle but very affective in removing makeup and deep cleansing my face/neck area.  </li>
            <li> But, I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It is however too strong for daily use for my normal, yet tending to dry maturing skin.  </li>
            <li> So 4 weeks for a 52 year old!</li>
            <li> I initially thought my face cleared because I was eating better, but I used it again the next two times I was visiting and had the same results.  </li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> In general I really like Dermalogica products</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and though  generally oily, if I use this too much I get dryness and some peeling at the corners of my nose and my chin.  </li>
            <li> For now I will stick to old faithful, Yonka.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> but if you keep with it, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, alergic and rashes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Resurfacing Cleanser is an effective product but beware not to overdo it, as the active ingredients can overwhelm some of us in a most uncomfortable way!  </li>
            <li> Long time Dermalogica user, ticked passed 40 this year and my dermatologist recommended changing to the age smart line.  </li>
            <li> This product really cleans my face but using it every day seems to make my face feel to dry</li>
            <li> It looked to be the same as what the salon used, however this is probably something made for young 20 something girls, not for a 40yr old.</li>
            <li> I usually get this locally but this was a better price for same item.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with many scars from acne breakout during pregnancy, dark spots and uneven skintone.</li>
            <li> I have this product before &amp; I can only guess that its old.</li>
            <li> and wow.  Makes my skin look totally rejuvenated after use!  </li>
            <li> and it does not get back to normal until a week later.</li>
            <li> how many times I used the stuff to moisturize, I always looked like I was so tired,</li>
            <li> At first it might be a little irritating (mostly around my nose area)</li>
            <li> I use this with my clear sonic and it works very well dor everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had everything under control with all natural products (I only use things with low-toxicity ratings found on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep website).  </li>
            <li> Did not smell the same or have same results when purchased directly form a spa.</li>
            <li> then I needed to but 3 small drops is all you really need.  </li>
            <li> Then when I used the cleaner for a few more days I noticed it was drying my skin pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Minor breakouts post use.</li>
            <li> It felt tight, looked flaky and I had stop for several days... when I went back and tried it again</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make you feel dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> It cleans thoroughly without leaving my face and neck dry or irritated.</li>
            <li> It causes noticeable dry skin patches on your face if you already have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> You can use it everyday, it gives you back your skin, that you actually like.</li>
            <li> Finally a line of face products that isn&#x27;t a complete waste of money!!  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and usually can not handle exfoliaters  </li>
            <li> I only use a small dot, so the bottle should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I do have to be careful that I do not get it on my lips or eyelids, as it does tend to cause them to chap.  </li>
            <li> Even though I closed my eyes when rinsing off, they were still affected by the product.  </li>
            <li> but this is well worth the money and will save me money on expensive facials</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday, because my skin is uber sensitive and everyday use was drying.  </li>
            <li> I am tired of looking old and adolescent at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I hope this has been fixed as the first time I passed it off, but the second time after explaining the situation was downright annoying.</li>
            <li> It should last a very long time because a very small amount goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m often flattered by &#x27;you&#x27;re not really 40, you don&#x27;t look it!&#x27;</li>
            <li> As a side note, some of Dermalogica&#x27;s products are extremely toxic.  </li>
            <li> The other days I just use something off the shelves from walmart</li>
            <li> ...that this product can be EXTREMELY drying.  </li>
            <li> Other than that give it a try.</li>
            <li> Also, my experience using this product with a spa face brush was less than favorable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically a fan of Dermologica, but not this product.</li>
            <li> I use a face brush to apply, and my face always feels tight and softer afterwords.</li>
            <li> It lasts for months due to the small amount needed per application.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to buy off Amazon since it was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I do find it dries out my skin a little bit</li>
            <li> After washed my face and applied this product to my skin as instruction on the label, I felt a little burnt on my face.</li>
            <li> and a few layers I would rather have kept.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years</li>
            <li> It cleans well without being harsh my skin.  </li>
            <li> It cleanses but it&#x27;s too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve had trouble folding products like this into my hectic morning routine.</li>
            <li> Also feel like skin is brightened and less dull.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m cutting back to washing with it every 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> The pump was broken when it arrived</li>
            <li> With a lot of moisturizing and horrible discomfort of a stiff dry</li>
            <li> Needless to say I returned, I am not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I broke out after 2-days use.  </li>
            <li> Ugh, seriously?!?!?  </li>
            <li> It broke my face out BAD, through out the day no matter</li>
            <li> :((</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Using this product for years and my skin is great and I am 81 years old.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the very best products for my face&lt;br /&gt;I love them all and use age smart ones</li>
            <li> Noticed no changes while using this product.</li>
            <li> Yes this product is a great cleanser to use in the morning and evening. It doesn&#x27;t make you feel dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Smells so good too.</li>
            <li> This brand of products is amazing! People noticed the difference after 4 facials and me buying the products . So 4 weeks for a 52 year old! Men made comments.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday, because my skin is uber sensitive and everyday use was drying.  I use it about twice a week and I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> I went to a spa and they used this stuff on my facial!!  I can&#x27;t believe it actually works.  Finally a line of face products that isn&#x27;t a complete waste of money!!  I love it</li>
            <li> first time trying , enjoying it. will def get anthr bottle once done</li>
            <li> Dermalogica is the only pricey product I buy.  It lasts for months due to the small amount needed per application.  I have used it for two years and will absolutely continue.  It is the one line of products that has gotten me to commit to long-term skin care.</li>
            <li> got product on time and pkg/priced well. I would definitely order this product from there again,even with a discount that I get this was still cheaper here but make sure you look at s/h &amp;#34;cause there is another that charges.</li>
            <li> I went to a spa and had a facial done using this product line. I liked it so I decided to buy off Amazon since it was a little cheaper. It looked to be the same as what the salon used, however this is probably something made for young 20 something girls, not for a 40yr old. It broke my face out BAD, through out the day no matter how many times I used the stuff to moisturize, I always looked like I was so tired, no hydration and much older than I am. I used it for about 3 weeks. Needless to say I returned, I am not happy with this product at all. For now I will stick to old faithful, Yonka.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice gentle cleanser. It cleans thoroughly without leaving my face and neck dry or irritated. Worth every penny and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was using Dermalogica clay cleanser which is made for super oily skin, but it seemed to make my face dry. I recently tried this age cleanser and I absolutely love it. When I wash my face, I also use some on my throat and chest. It makes my skin feel smooth. I will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> Worked well for awhile and discoloring of my skin occurred; maybe my skin was too sensitive;may not be the cause either; not sure.&lt;br /&gt;Came highly recommended by another user.</li>
            <li> I use this once a day.  This product does a very effective job cleansing and getting all make up off.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is amazing it makes my skin feel so soft I love it! It&#x27;s a must buy so worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am 48 with acne prone skin.  I do not break out from this product.  I do have to be careful that I do not get it on my lips or eyelids, as it does tend to cause them to chap.  I really like it.  Seems to get my skin clean.</li>
            <li> Long time Dermalogica user, ticked passed 40 this year and my dermatologist recommended changing to the age smart line.  Ugh, seriously?!?!?  Gotta say, it is better for my skin.  Hydrating, clear skin, keeps the fine lines at bay.  I&#x27;m often flattered by &#x27;you&#x27;re not really 40, you don&#x27;t look it!&#x27; Owe that to the fact that I&#x27;m totally immature (LOL) but gotta give a nod to the fact that dermalogica and I have been friends for many years now and she&#x27;s done me proud!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  Dermologica is a great skin product line.  I treasure this product and use it daily.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I have found in a long time.  It really does leave my skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to cheap drugstore cleansers! This Dermalogica cleanser is gentle yet it does a great job exfoliating and evening out my skin tone. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now and my skin has never been smoother. I do find it dries out my skin a little bit so I plan on ordering the matching moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  Feels very clean and smooth after using.  Also feel like skin is brightened and less dull.</li>
            <li> I am 34 and I have had problems with my skin since college.  I thought I had everything under control with all natural products (I only use things with low-toxicity ratings found on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep website).  This year my skin began flipping out.  I look like a wrinkled, zitty teen.  Several months ago I was visiting my parents and my mom had this product.  I used it every night for a week and it made a noticeable different.  The zits cleared and my face looked smooth and fresh.  I initially thought my face cleared because I was eating better, but I used it again the next two times I was visiting and had the same results.  My mom even noticed and commented that I need to start buying Dermalogica.  I checked it out on the Skin Deep website and found it is a 4 out of 10 on the toxicity scale.  Normally I don&#x27;t buy anything over a 2, but I am willing to make an exception for this cleanser.  I am tired of looking old and adolescent at the same time.  As a side note, some of Dermalogica&#x27;s products are extremely toxic.  If you use a lot of them you should check out the ratings at www.ewg. org/skindeep/</li>
            <li> Went on beautifully; felt nice...  Sadly, I broke out after 2-days use.  But, I have very sensitive skin.  (Thought that was what this was for, but then, &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; can be defined in a variety of ways, I suppose. Sure cleaned my skin though...  and a few layers I would rather have kept.</li>
            <li> I have this product before &amp; I can only guess that its old. Did not smell the same or have same results when purchased directly form a spa.</li>
            <li> Really makes my skin feel smooth and clean. I only wish it was more affordable. I cannot purchase as often as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for two at the recommendation of my esthetician.  This stuff is wonderful.  It took a couple days to get use to not having my face wash lather up/foamy.  You don&#x27;t need much either.  At first because it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;foam&#x27; up I used more then I needed to but 3 small drops is all you really need.  I have very sensitive/oily skin and this does not cause any sensitivity (including no redness) after I use it.</li>
            <li> Price was fantastic......</li>
            <li> Yowza!  Total skin resurfacing while cleansing.  The ultimate exfoliant.</li>
            <li> No only is this cleanser thorough but it is also gentle. Leaves no filmy feeling but is not abrasive. Skin feels clean and ready to receive toner and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I have used Dermalogica products for over 10 years and am moving into using more of the age smart products as  am now over 40 years old. I am using the Resurfacing Cleanser with my Clairsonic. I have found that using the Resurfacing Cleanser every day leads to a blemish here and there. It isn&#x27;t a full out breakout, but I think that the daily use is too much for my skin. My skin seems to do better when I rotate this cleanser with another more gentle cleaner. That may very well be the way it is supposed to be used, but I like it so much I tried using it every day! It should last a very long time because a very small amount goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Good cleanser for the price.  Will take a little time, but so far, I&#x27;m happy with results.  Good company to deal with.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and on top of it, very sensitive. I have tried zillions of products in vain. But this product is a wonder. It works well on my skin. It has just been 2 weeks with the travel size cleanser and I can see my acnes diminishing leaving clear and fresh skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, one star because the product delivered to me was defective. The pump was broken when it arrived :(( The seller should focus on detailing when shipping products because as a buyer to order it online, I need to have full faith on what I am getting.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Been using for years now !!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about 2 years. I highly recommend Dermalogica. I use the moisturizer, face mask, and exfoilant. Love it.</li>
            <li> Authentic dermalogica product. Excellent cleanser. Great price and fast shipping. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Great cleaner however 2 times I ordered this and just received the one ounce sample. I hope this has been fixed as the first time I passed it off, but the second time after explaining the situation was downright annoying.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I&#x27;ve used it for years.  It came quickly and I bought it at a great price.</li>
            <li> This product really cleans my face but using it every day seems to make my face feel to dry so I use it only 2 or 3 times a week and that seems to be working for me. The other days I just use something off the shelves from walmart</li>
            <li> This product is gentle but very affective in removing makeup and deep cleansing my face/neck area.  Great find!!  Thanks  jb</li>
            <li> excellent facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser especially after the Precleanse from Dermalogica</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t like this product as much as I thought I would.  Even though I closed my eyes when rinsing off, they were still affected by the product.  I wear contact lenses and my eyes sense irritants and felt like they were burning every time I used this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this, and really liked it. So I bought the full size. I&#x27;m almost 40 with great skin and I want to keep it that way. I use a face brush to apply, and my face always feels tight and softer afterwords.And the feeling doesn&#x27;t go away. Combine with your favorite moisturizer and you&#x27;ll be very happy!</li>
            <li> Have loved this product for several years. You just feel good after your wash. Dermalogica don,t change a thing with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great skin cleanser. It definitely gives you that glow. I have adult hormonal acne and this really impacts it and helps keep my pores clear. I just wish it was sulfate free. The fragrance is very pleasant (and I&#x27;m picky in that area). It&#x27;s very creamy and effective. I use it in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> Great price, great shipping, great product!  I use this with my clarisonic and I am very happy with the results.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am 60 and was beginning to get allot off dullness and flaking . I had a sample of this and did not expect much but wow! After 2 times I saw the rosy glow return to my skin. I ordered this cleanser right away. I have sensitive skin and usually can not handle exfoliaters  but this is so gentle. My serums soak right in after use. Huge overall appearance of my skin! I have  never spent more than $10.00 on a cleanser but this is well worth the money and will save me money on expensive facials plus I now get the full benefits of my serums since they don&#x27;t lay on top of dead skin . I must add that it also cleans the pores on my nose!</li>
            <li> Wow and wow.  Makes my skin look totally rejuvenated after use!  I only use it 1-2 x per week bc I have sensitive skin and though  generally oily, if I use this too much I get dryness and some peeling at the corners of my nose and my chin.  Otherwise, this is Must-Have in your skin are regimen.  The lactic acid in the product does WONDERS for your skin.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I love the age smart products - my friends say I &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  I also like the daily microfoliant to follow this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Good for older skin and doesn&#x27;t dry out.  Also hypoallergenic</li>
            <li> ...that this product can be EXTREMELY drying.  I was using it daily (am &amp; pm).  Too drying.  I switched to nights-only.  Too drying.  Now I&#x27;m cutting back to washing with it every 3-4 days.  (In the interim I use Purity wash by Philosophy.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resurfacing Cleanser is an effective product but beware not to overdo it, as the active ingredients can overwhelm some of us in a most uncomfortable way!  Also, I find the Dermalogica Precleanse a nice compliment to the Resurfacing Cleanser.  Precleanse really allows the Resurfacing Cleanser to do its job.</li>
            <li> great cleanser, lasts a long time, rinses clean.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Quality is very good.That I like.I would recommend to my friends.I trust the amazon</li>
            <li> Smooth, was recommended by a friend in the beauty field. Doesn&#x27;t clean off makeup..maybe it&#x27;s meant for after using a regular cleanser? Minor breakouts post use. A bit pricey. Other than that give it a try. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  It cleans well without being harsh my skin.  At first it might be a little irritating (mostly around my nose area) but if you keep with it, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;I am 41 and have tried many products to take care of my aging skin, and the Dermalogica Age Smart line has made me overall very happy.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser but it is to be respected.  I use it as a 3 x&#x27;s a week morning cleanser/ a kind of scrub.  My skin feels cleaner and it shows.  The moisturizers and serums I use are better absorbed .. It is however too strong for daily use for my normal, yet tending to dry maturing skin.  I love it !</li>
            <li> I usually get this locally but this was a better price for same item. Have used it for some time and love it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, works great on making hands look younger too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s now and feel the cleanser has made my skin look younger.  I also feel it leaves it a drier so I use lotion right afterwards.  But overall I am a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> This product has my skin feeling smoother and younger.</li>
            <li> One of the best Cleansers you&#x27;ll ever use. I use it with a buff sponge for exfoliation, works so well.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. I have issues with hyperpigmentation. This cleanser helps control the spots. I do wish it lathered more, but that is just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a facial product for a while and I was happy to come across this line.  I am very pleased with the product and it leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use this with my electronic face brush and i get great results. I really enjoy the results...Smooth skin!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! It works great and really cleanses your face and neck. I have been using it for awhile now and notice a difference every week. I received great shipping on product and wonderful price. Will buy from again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This cleanser is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years. I love it. Dermalogica skin resurfacing cleanser cleanses and makes my skin soft and oil free. In the past, I&#x27;ve had trouble folding products like this into my hectic morning routine. But this product is easy to use. I put it in my face before getting into the shower and then wash it off under the water.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Leaves skin with perfect texture.</li>
            <li> See no improvement with use...but my face did feel ultra clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year. It is a wonderful cleanser. As always Dermalogica is the best and Amazonmakes it more affordable!</li>
            <li> Good product but I did feel it could have more of a gritty effect to remove&lt;br /&gt;Dirt and open poures</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly.  It works really well for me, oily skin, living in high humidity environment.</li>
            <li> Really great stuff, for oilier skin types.  It causes noticeable dry skin patches on your face if you already have dry skin.  Also, my experience using this product with a spa face brush was less than favorable.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dermalogica since my  esthatician recommended it about 7 years ago.  I have extremely sensitive skin, alergic and rashes.  But not anymore.  These products are great for balancing the skin to stop dryness, excess oil, etc.  Balances the skin.</li>
            <li> I can only use this cleanser every 2 or 3 days. It dries my skin out a lot. It is a good cleanser for someone with less dry skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle, effective for helping exfoliate.  Keeps milia in check.  I use it twice daily on face, neck, decollete.  Best price is on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels after using this cleanser - thoroughly clean and smooth.  I didn&#x27;t take it on a vacation recently and could tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I saw some good reviews and decided to give it a try. I have sensitive skin with many scars from acne breakout during pregnancy, dark spots and uneven skintone. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkle. After washed my face and applied this product to my skin as instruction on the label, I felt a little burnt on my face. My skin turned red and started to have some red bumps. I stopped using it after that and had to return it. I believe this product works for others who have healthy skin. Unfortunately, it is too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> Gives my skin a nice tingly feel.</li>
            <li> The first use I thought hey this cleaner work great for me. Then when I used the cleaner for a few more days I noticed it was drying my skin pretty bad. It felt tight, looked flaky and I had stop for several days... when I went back and tried it again my skin just couldn&#x27;t handle it any more. I cannot use it. Too drying for me.</li>
            <li> This is a nice facial cleanser with lactic acid which is really good for your skin.</li>
            <li> Nice product great results</li>
            <li> This cleanser really makes a difference, you see immediately! You can use it everyday, it gives you back your skin, that you actually like.</li>
            <li> Caused my cheeks to break out in tiny bumps. It&#x27;s my own fault for not staying away from a product with sulfates. In general I really like Dermalogica products and I have several others (without sulfates) that work great.</li>
            <li> The whole AgeSmart product line is top notch quality.  They all smell wonderfully and I can see the results since I have started using the products.</li>
            <li> My favorite product ever my face feels so soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically a fan of Dermologica, but not this product. It cleanses but it&#x27;s too harsh for my skin. I had high expectations but I can&#x27;t use it? I&#x27;m sure it works better for others.</li>
            <li> Dermalogica is a great product line but if you are in the older generation, this is a great line.  As a face wash, your skin feels great (very clean) and looks bright.</li>
            <li> I use this with my clear sonic and it works very well dor everyday use.  A very mild cleanser and I would buy again.  I only use a small dot, so the bottle should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but am one of those users ho can only use it twice per week or my face ends up  looking and feeling like sandpaper and it does not get back to normal until a week later. With a lot of moisturizing and horrible discomfort of a stiff dry face.&lt;br /&gt;I use the Dermalogica line, but this is my first purchase of this particular product and will be my last.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic which makes me want to use the product.</li>
