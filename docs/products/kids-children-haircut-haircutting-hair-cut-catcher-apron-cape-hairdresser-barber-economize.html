    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>One star is even much more!!!!</li>
            <li>I gave this Hair Cut Catcher to a retired Hair Dresser lady, and she loved it!</li>
            <li>For her was a great novelty and immediately start using it.</li>
            <li>Great product...</li>
            <li>This purchase was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>what she liked the most, is that she didn&#x27;t have to sweep the floor, she just went to dispose the her to her garbage can.</li>
            <li>It is made very cheaply material even for the price</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to cut his hair in the winter when we can&#x27;t do it outdoors.</li>
            <li>Easy clean up..</li>
            <li>it was just a cheap vinyl cape with no raised sides to catch the hair</li>
            <li>When he saw how nicely it worked he was pleasantly surprised!!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what its supposed to do!</li>
            <li>My son is allergic to his own hair if it falls on his back, so this solved everything.  </li>
            <li>They can not pick up the right order.</li>
            <li>The apron is very much like the type they have a salon, the floor must be swept.  </li>
            <li>It ripped on our first use.</li>
            <li>( I was the first one)...</li>
            <li>It barely fit around my 4yr old son&#x27;s neck</li>
            <li>haha !</li>
            <li>I liked the concept, but it&#x27;s so very flimsy in person, even a new one would probably only merit 2 stars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much just a plastic tarp with velcro to fasten around the neck.</li>
            <li>This is by far a wonderful item to have especially with small children that like to move around since it catches the hair</li>
            <li>This arrived absolutely covered in machine grease.  </li>
            <li>also its reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I absolutely would recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li>This is very usable item.</li>
            <li>I trust Amazon so much, but this time......</li>
            <li>I got a cheap, flat cape, nothing at all like what&#x27;s shown and described here.</li>
            <li>This is very effective but giving 4 stars as it is thin and cheaply made and already has a small hole in it.  </li>
            <li>and my little guy was comfortable in it.</li>
            <li>It is foldable the way those automotive windshield sun shades are, so after folding it, it becomes really compact and I place it inside a big ziploc bag.</li>
            <li>Ready and waiting for the next haircut.</li>
            <li>Fits my 5 and 2 year old well and keeps its shape and holds in the hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> 25.6 inches long</li>
            <li> This thing seems practical but its pretty dumb.</li>
            <li> It seems a little fragile.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Flimsy and not really reusable.</li>
            <li> A big waste of time and resources for the cape I received to be sent and returned.</li>
            <li> Too big and not easy to navigate around once on the kid.  </li>
            <li> Not easy to fold back.</li>
            <li> Also to clean the plastic after using is very difficult.</li>
            <li> I work at a kids hair salon and there is no way kid&#x27;s would leave this on, they hardly like the regular capes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless, it&#x27;s so useful when I&#x27;m cutting my boys&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> Material average quality which is what you will get for the price.</li>
            <li> used it once, hair still goes down the neck area.  </li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve gone down to the store to buy one 1/2 price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little bits of hair all over it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $</li>
            <li> there is just no easy way to cut a kids hair and not have it go everywhere...</li>
            <li> He thought it was a waste of money.. a gimmick.!!</li>
            <li> Hard to believe!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too thin.</li>
            <li> Hair does NOT collect as you would think because of poor design.</li>
            <li> But The vinyl is very weak.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still too expensive for its quality</li>
            <li> Terrible, receive product not the same as the one in picture.</li>
            <li> found it something of a disappointment.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> this is soso becose it is Lacerated</li>
            <li> This arrived absolutely covered in machine grease.  So unacceptable!  It was returned immediately so I have no ability to comment on the actual product itself.</li>
            <li> works well for haircuttig</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too thin. It ripped on our first use.</li>
            <li> It seems a little fragile.  Not sure how long it will last.</li>
            <li> I gave this Hair Cut Catcher to a retired Hair Dresser lady, and she loved it! For her was a great novelty and immediately start using it. ( I was the first one)... what she liked the most, is that she didn&#x27;t have to sweep the floor, she just went to dispose the her to her garbage can.</li>
            <li> used it once, hair still goes down the neck area.  there is just no easy way to cut a kids hair and not have it go everywhere...</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t stay like in the picture so it doesn&#x27;t hold the hair properly. Also to clean the plastic after using is very difficult.</li>
            <li> The packaging was apparently different from the one that I saw on the website.&lt;br /&gt;I found it something of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this item my husband thought I was crazy.. He thought it was a waste of money.. a gimmick.!! When he saw how nicely it worked he was pleasantly surprised!! It does exactly what its supposed to do! Easy clean up.. no hair on the floor.. and my little guy was comfortable in it. also its reasonably priced. I absolutely would recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> It barely fit around my 4yr old son&#x27;s neck but hey,everyones neck size is different, I made it work, I also purchased some of those tissue paper looking things to lay on the neck before putting these things on. It catches hair, makes things less messy, when you try to clean it some of the hair like to stick on though. Not of highest quality so I take care of it. It is foldable the way those automotive windshield sun shades are, so after folding it, it becomes really compact and I place it inside a big ziploc bag. Voila! Ready and waiting for the next haircut.</li>
            <li> This is by far a wonderful item to have especially with small children that like to move around since it catches the hair</li>
            <li> This is very usable item. But The vinyl is very weak. So I think that this is disposable item.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the one in the picture.  I receive a regular plastic blue thing like and apon.  There was no twisting involve.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the one in the picture, instead I received a regular plastic apron and it can&#x27;t hold hair at all.</li>
            <li> It is made very cheaply material even for the price it&#x27;s still too expensive for its quality</li>
            <li> Awful. Flimsy and not really reusable. Hair does NOT collect as you would think because of poor design. Skip it</li>
            <li> A big waste of time and resources for the cape I received to be sent and returned. I got a cheap, flat cape, nothing at all like what&#x27;s shown and described here. ZERO STARS</li>
            <li> Great product... but if I had known this is from Daiso I would&#x27;ve gone down to the store to buy one 1/2 price.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, it&#x27;s so useful when I&#x27;m cutting my boys&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> This is just a cape. There&#x27;s nothing to catch hair. Don&#x27;t waste your $</li>
            <li> Catches all the hair.  Like it a lot.  Only drawback is it&#x27;s a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> It came ripped and used!  Little bits of hair all over it.  So gross.  I liked the concept, but it&#x27;s so very flimsy in person, even a new one would probably only merit 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Terrible, receive product not the same as the one in picture. Just a cape. They can not pick up the right order.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the item pictured it was just a cheap vinyl cape with no raised sides to catch the hair</li>
            <li> This thing seems practical but its pretty dumb. Too big and not easy to navigate around once on the kid.  I should have stuck with a towel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a foldable umbrella style hairdresser cape. it&#x27;s just a peace of sheet with velcro.</li>
            <li> The item is being returned.  The product I received is just a kids sized apron.  the package says its approx. 25.6 inches long but there is no catcher of any sort.  The apron is very much like the type they have a salon, the floor must be swept.  The apron I got only protects the clothing.  Also, the package says DAISO.  I can go to the DAISO store and buy it for $1.50.  Not $5.99!!</li>
            <li> This purchase was a pleasant surprise.  Fits my 5 and 2 year old well and keeps its shape and holds in the hair.</li>
            <li> Material average quality which is what you will get for the price. Some hair still fell off yo the floor. It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This product is shower curtain material with a piece of velcro. Not at all what the picture shows. I should have read the reviews before I purchased this product. Don&#x27;t make my mistake.</li>
            <li> This works just as you think it would.  My son is allergic to his own hair if it falls on his back, so this solved everything.  It makes it so easy to cut his hair in the winter when we can&#x27;t do it outdoors.</li>
            <li> This is very effective but giving 4 stars as it is thin and cheaply made and already has a small hole in it.  We are still using it, though.</li>
            <li> Does not catch the hair. There was nothing to like about it. I do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> haha ! I work at a kids hair salon and there is no way kid&#x27;s would leave this on, they hardly like the regular capes. Maybe adults will like to wear it.</li>
            <li> It does not catch the hair. It&#x27;s pretty much just a plastic tarp with velcro to fasten around the neck.</li>
            <li> One star is even much more!!!! Cheating!!!!!! What I received is just a piece of cape, not the one in the picture with a catcher!!!! Hard to believe! I trust Amazon so much, but this time...... so disappointed!</li>
            <li> Not easy to fold back.</li>
            <li> I also did not receive the one in the picture. I received a regular plastic blue cape.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a plastic cape, and at the smallest setting, too big for a kid.</li>
