            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but I love this polish more than the Sensationail gel polish.</li>
            <li>I must say Ibd is easy to apply, easy to wear and a breeze to remove.  </li>
            <li>It went on like a dream and the results were super!  </li>
            <li>This is a rich color, it goes on so even and easy.</li>
            <li>Great quality, big bottle &amp; cheaper on Amazon then wholesale shops..  </li>
            <li>My nails are chip free and glossy, I&#x27;m going on about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Not got to see it in sun yet as just used it tonight, but under light can catch the shimmer.</li>
            <li>The color is awesome - a deep purple with only a tiny bit of sparkle that shows in bright light.  </li>
            <li>recommend it to everyone&lt;br /&gt;Anlasts more than three weeks and the color does not rised very timely delivery</li>
            <li>This is a gorgeous shimmery deep purple.</li>
            <li>Great purple color not too dark</li>
            <li>Live how well IBD went on and plan on buying lots more.</li>
            <li>No shrink back issues and the color is stunning in the light.</li>
            <li>IT IS A DEEP RICH PURPLE AND GOES ON SMOOTHLY.</li>
            <li>As with most other IBD gel polishes, this one applies smoothly and wears well.</li>
            <li>So pretty in the sunlight</li>
            <li>THIS IS A REALLY PRETTY PURPLE.</li>
            <li>MORE COATS NEEDED TO GET THAT DEEP PURPLE</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with the Ibd polish so time will tell if it holds up.  </li>
            <li>we use it so much!</li>
            <li>Totally ordering more.</li>
            <li>Love the coordinating regular nail polish too!</li>
            <li>This color is as pretty as everyone described.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy like regular polish.</li>
            <li>I used it with the Gelish Kit and they worked very well together.  </li>
            <li>very good&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it only takes two coats for full opacity.</li>
            <li>well under the description of a photo image that corresponds to it live on the accuracy of thanks and express letter.</li>
            <li>however the cost of their polish can be high.  </li>
            <li>This color is a very pretty plum color with a small amount of shimmer in the light.</li>
            <li>This is very nice deep, dark, shimmery purplish blue color.</li>
            <li>but I put a coat of black first &amp; it deepens it right up!</li>
            <li>I have a Sensationail led gel polish kit and wanted some new gel colors.</li>
            <li>In future Ill buy again more from this seller :)</li>
            <li>The only colors I&#x27;ve had problems with are the neon colors of IBD they tend to peel off much quicker.</li>

            <li> This color is so classy and sophisticated, really impressed and I&#x27;m happy to add this to my IBD collection. I love the price of this brand of gel polish and works just as great as sensationail polish.

            <li> Excellent gel nail polish. Did not chip for at least 2 weeks. Good price as compared to Gelish Gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> Love these IBD Gel polishes.  Great quality, big bottle &amp; cheaper on Amazon then wholesale shops..  Great purple color not too dark but I put a coat of black first &amp; it deepens it right up!</li>
            <li> This color is a very pretty plum color with a small amount of shimmer in the light. My new favorite purple color, IBD polish is great and cost effective. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The Salon I worked in only wanted to work with Shellac so I have since it hit the market.  I&#x27;m now a salon owner myself and tested many many gel polishes. I must say Ibd is easy to apply, easy to wear and a breeze to remove.  I still offer Cnd Shellac but my clients are trusting me and moving to Ibd (it comes off so clean).&lt;br /&gt;I started with 4 colors for my trial,  now I have 20! I love the fact that they have lots of colors to choose from. Great job Ibd!</li>
            <li> This is a deep purple with TONS of shimmer.  So pretty in the sunlight and it only takes two coats for full opacity.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A REALLY PRETTY PURPLE. IT IS A DEEP RICH PURPLE AND GOES ON SMOOTHLY. MORE COATS NEEDED TO GET THAT DEEP PURPLE BUT IS BEAUTIFUL</li>
            <li> Great color,on time,i&#x60;m happy :) In future Ill buy again more from this seller :)</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with the Ibd polish so time will tell if it holds up.  I have been using Harmony Gelish products for over a year and been very happy however the cost of their polish can be high.  I used the Gelish base coat and top coat with this Ibd polish and cured each coat.  Fingers crossed the polish stays  put for the 2+ weeks I get from Harmony Gelish polishes.</li>
            <li> the product is great and beautiful color&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone&lt;br /&gt;Anlasts more than three weeks and the color does not rised very timely delivery</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use at home for gel manicures.  The color is awesome - a deep purple with only a tiny bit of sparkle that shows in bright light.  It went on like a dream and the results were super!  I used it with the Gelish Kit and they worked very well together.  I&#x27;ve ordered more colors and can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> This is very nice deep, dark, shimmery purplish blue color. It goes on easy like regular polish. It is one of the favorite colors, what I have.</li>
            <li> This is a rich color, it goes on so even and easy. No shrink back issues and the color is stunning in the light. Love it.</li>
            <li> Color is good. Needs 3 coats though.</li>
            <li> Stays on as well a Gelish brands. I will save money by buying this brand from now on.  Actually soaked off easier.</li>
            <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;very well under the description of a photo image that corresponds to it live on the accuracy of thanks and express letter.</li>
            <li> This was the prettiest purple, dark lavender I&#x27;d ever seen. Almost gone we use it so much!</li>
            <li> I have a Sensationail led gel polish kit and wanted some new gel colors. I saw no reason to not purchase this when it works with an led lamp which my Sensationail lamp is. IT IS AMAZING. My nails are chip free and glossy, I&#x27;m going on about 2 weeks. Of course it takes practice but I love this polish more than the Sensationail gel polish. And the price is unbelievable. Totally ordering more.</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous shimmery deep purple. As with most other IBD gel polishes, this one applies smoothly and wears well. Love the coordinating regular nail polish too!</li>
            <li> A bright grape with No shimmer/No glitter. Just a great purple.  Would look great with sparkle tips! A big bottle too!</li>
            <li> This color is as pretty as everyone described. Not got to see it in sun yet as just used it tonight, but under light can catch the shimmer. This is the nicest shade of purple I have ever found in any polish! Live how well IBD went on and plan on buying lots more. Love the savings over the brand I have got before and works just as great.</li>
