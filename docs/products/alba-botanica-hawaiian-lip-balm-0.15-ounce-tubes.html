            <li>taste good too.  </li>
            <li>Really good lipbalm, it does start getting &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34; and melty after a while</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Makes my lips feel and look so nice.</li>
            <li>but what I really love is it stays on even after you eat and it has a nice glossy look.</li>
            <li>bought this for my wife, but kids just love the taste of it.&lt;br /&gt;to</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>The pineapple flavor is okay.</li>
            <li>I was beyond thrilled to find this available here.  </li>
            <li>OK, this does taste like pineapple</li>
            <li>I buy them in bulk and keep my kids and hubby always supplied :)</li>
            <li>Likes this one much better. .</li>
            <li>This ones smells soooo good &amp; a super smooth texture.</li>
            <li>Very good alternative to regular market brands that do not heal,or do the intended work against chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>The smell is good and it is not as soft as the coconut one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands and alba in pineapple not only tastes great but helps heal chapped lips within 2 days!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned that Chapstick is addictive and not made with as good ingredients as Alba&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li>I love this product and we were elated to buy at such a good price and get the delivery so fast.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a good lip balm for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It stays on great and doesn&#x27;t feel to heavy.  </li>
            <li>however I do not feel that it&#x27;s worth $18.00 for a six pack.</li>
            <li>me, it is a little oil-ish, but smells good.</li>
            <li>Thanks Alba!</li>
            <li>The first ingredient listed for this chapstick is: organic cocos nucifera (coconut) oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better deal to buy several at a time, and then I never run out.</li>
            <li>I live in the North and every winter my lips get super chapped.  </li>
            <li>I really like this balm.  </li>
            <li>(I really like pineapple as a fruit.)     </li>
            <li>It smells&lt;br /&gt;good and doesn&#x27;t require as much application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small tube of lip balm and so it seemed a little over-priced; but the product smells good and feels nice on the lips, especially if you like pineapple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better for less the money.</li>
            <li>It is highly flavored.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t find it to be very long lasting as the beeswax kind and definitely doesn&#x27;t stay on after I eat.</li>
            <li>Intially went on smooth but by the third application gets very gritty like there is sand in it.  </li>
            <li>I love this chapstick, and it could just possibly have been this batch, but all 6 of them were extremely grainy and could not use.</li>
            <li>Within a few days my lips were soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this is not as smooth &amp; buttery as chapsticks made primarily of beeswax.</li>
            <li>Makes my lips soft.</li>
            <li>Most chapsticks leave your lips worse off after using them, but this really protects them and moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>In general, I need to reapply this about every couple of hours.</li>

            <li> In general, I need to reapply this about every couple of hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right consistency, highly moisturizing (which in the dead of bitter, cold, dry MN winters is oh so important) and the pineapple smell is divine.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars though because it doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>

            <li> I was down to the nub and sticking the end of my finger into the tube to hopefully get enough to apply to my lips.  </li>
            <li> The tube is the average capacity.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t waxy, and instead goes on moist but thick enough to stay on.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s less that remains in the container.  </li>
            <li> I seriously rationed my use of it as I was not looking forward to the day the last little bit was used up.  </li>
            <li> Some people may not like it as it can be a little thick, so just use a dab and spread it around.</li>
            <li> Hard for me to explain.  </li>
            <li> This was not good as they were gifts</li>
            <li> I think because it goes on real thick</li>
            <li> Plus it does not have all the artificial fillers that Blistex has.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste bad!  </li>

            <li> I really like this balm.  I gave it 4 stars though because it doesn&#x27;t last long.  Hard for me to explain.  The tube is the average capacity.  I think because it goes on real thick there&#x27;s less that remains in the container.  It feels the thickest and I like that (some people don&#x27;t).  It is highly flavored.</li>
            <li> I love this chapstick, and it could just possibly have been this batch, but all 6 of them were extremely grainy and could not use. This was not good as they were gifts</li>
            <li> I live in the North and every winter my lips get super chapped.  I have tried just about EVERYTHING and had given up hope until I bought this.  Within a few days my lips were soft and smooth.  Most chapsticks leave your lips worse off after using them, but this really protects them and moisturizes.  It stays on great and doesn&#x27;t feel to heavy.  It smells and tastes wonderful.  I&#x27;m converted for life.  I&#x27;ve tried all three \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; (pineapple, coconut, and passion fruit) and they are all great.  Thanks Alba!</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm ever. I got the 6 pack from Amazon and share it with my husband. It smells good and is moisturizing. Plus it does not have all the artificial fillers that Blistex has.</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife, but kids just love the taste of it.&lt;br /&gt;to me, it is a little oil-ish, but smells good. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great protection for winter lips.  taste good too.  Love them.</li>
            <li> I have used chap-stick all my life. I keep it in my purse, desk, car, everywhere. I&#x27;ve used cheap ones, expensive ones &amp; everything in between. This ones smells soooo good &amp; a super smooth texture. Some people may not like it as it can be a little thick, so just use a dab and spread it around.</li>
            <li> This tastes and smells great but what I really love is it stays on even after you eat and it has a nice glossy look. Makes my lips soft.</li>
            <li> The first ingredient listed for this chapstick is: organic cocos nucifera (coconut) oil. Unfortunately, this is not as smooth &amp; buttery as chapsticks made primarily of beeswax. I also don&#x27;t find it to be very long lasting as the beeswax kind and definitely doesn&#x27;t stay on after I eat. In general, I need to reapply this about every couple of hours. The pineapple flavor is okay. (I really like pineapple as a fruit.)     Ingredients: coconut oil, castor seed oil, beeswax, pineapple flavor, candelilla wax, jojoba seed oil, sunflower seed wax, ammonium glycyyrrhizate, aloe barbadensis leaf extract, apricot kernel oil, rosemary leaf extract, vitamin E, wheat germ oil, allantoin, pineapple fruit extract, soybean oil    100% Vegetarian ingredients. No animal testing. 82% certified organic ingredients</li>
            <li> I had read the rave reviews so I bought this.  I have been trying to find a good lip balm for a long time.  Intially went on smooth but by the third application gets very gritty like there is sand in it.  I would not recommend.  I am stuck with 6 balms I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I used to get this at [a big box store].  They stopped carrying it.  I seriously rationed my use of it as I was not looking forward to the day the last little bit was used up.  I was down to the nub and sticking the end of my finger into the tube to hopefully get enough to apply to my lips.  I was beyond thrilled to find this available here.  It&#x27;s just the right consistency, highly moisturizing (which in the dead of bitter, cold, dry MN winters is oh so important) and the pineapple smell is divine.  Get it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give 5 stars often, but this lip balm is excellent.  It isn&#x27;t waxy, and instead goes on moist but thick enough to stay on.  It doesn&#x27;t taste bad!  It smells great.  You never find all of these  qualities in the same lip balm!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> OK, this does taste like pineapple however I do not feel that it&#x27;s worth $18.00 for a six pack. I&#x27;ve had better for less the money.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Chapstick!!! I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands and alba in pineapple not only tastes great but helps heal chapped lips within 2 days! I buy them in bulk and keep my kids and hubby always supplied :)</li>

            <li> The smell is good and it is not as soft as the coconut one. Likes this one much better. .</li>
            <li> Really good lipbalm, it does start getting &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34; and melty after a while but I store it in my refrigerator and it lasts forever and the texture doesn&#x27;t change that way.</li>
            <li> I love this product and we were elated to buy at such a good price and get the delivery so fast.</li>
