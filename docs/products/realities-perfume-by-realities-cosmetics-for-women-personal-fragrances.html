    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Came on time &amp; I bought it as a gift...and my mother loved it!!!</li>
            <li>how happy I was to get these!</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance!!!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice perfume</li>
            <li>cause if I don&#x27;t like it in any season, it will become a great gift for one of the women in my family who like flowerry-sharp scents, plus this perfume was a great price, and it is nicely bottled.</li>
            <li>and I loved the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>Good size bottle for the money.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful and sweet scent.</li>
            <li>I have worn this perfume for years and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Best perfume ever worth every penny</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s still available from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Really nice scent.</li>
            <li>Smells really nice and sexy.</li>
            <li>Love this scent that&#x27;s not carried anymore in the retail store.</li>
            <li>I like triangular bottled \\&quot;Liz Claibourne perfume\\&quot; better than this one.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this scent for years and love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume to wear.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Not too strong or overpowering and the scent stays on for hours.  </li>
            <li>Before then, I wore the original Realities.</li>
            <li>This perfume, I read somewhere, that it leaves a sweet fragrance on you, but it is anything but sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>But not a fruity sweet scent.</li>
            <li>it smells very good and very flowery but not sweet</li>
            <li>A Great everyday parfum spray</li>
            <li>I will try it again in another season of the year (because I like certain perfumes different times of the year, kind of by season), and I hope I will feel good wearing it at that time, but for this season I will put it aside and I will stick to my sweet-fragranced perfumes (e.g. Curious, Incanto Shine, Incanto Bliss, orange-blossom perfumes, etc.)</li>
            <li>&quot; Years later, my grand kids say almost the same thing after I have held the new dog, used a blanket, etc, \\&quot;It smells good like Nana!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting and was a great deal.</li>
            <li>Overall satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>Found it at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>I was really upset when I received it because it didn&#x27;t have a box</li>
            <li>I have worn it since Realities (new) came on the market.  </li>
            <li>It is a soft fragrance and last through the day.  </li>
            <li>It smells quite sharp with a major scent of lilac and lillies of the vally, plus other scents which I cannot tell, and also it smells kind of common.</li>

            <li> It was everything I expected.  </li>
            <li> It is a little expensive, but well worth the price</li>

            <li> Well I am not too unhappy about purchasing this perfume,</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed because now it looks like I gave her a bottle that I found somewhere!</li>

            <li> Love this scent that&#x27;s not carried anymore in the retail store.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance!!! I have worn it since Realities (new) came on the market.  Before then, I wore the original Realities. It is a soft fragrance and last through the day.  When my kids were younger, they would pick up our dog after I held him and they would say \\&quot;he smells like Mom!!\\&quot; Years later, my grand kids say almost the same thing after I have held the new dog, used a blanket, etc, \\&quot;It smells good like Nana!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This perfume, I read somewhere, that it leaves a sweet fragrance on you, but it is anything but sweet smelling. It smells quite sharp with a major scent of lilac and lillies of the vally, plus other scents which I cannot tell, and also it smells kind of common. I like triangular bottled \\&quot;Liz Claibourne perfume\\&quot; better than this one. I wish it were flowery-sweet smelling (not to be confused with cotton-candy or sugar sweet), just the way I like perfumes on me, so that I don&#x27;t get a headache. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it smells very good and very flowery but not sweet like I thought it would be after reading some reviews. I will try it again in another season of the year (because I like certain perfumes different times of the year, kind of by season), and I hope I will feel good wearing it at that time, but for this season I will put it aside and I will stick to my sweet-fragranced perfumes (e.g. Curious, Incanto Shine, Incanto Bliss, orange-blossom perfumes, etc.) Well I am not too unhappy about purchasing this perfume, cause if I don&#x27;t like it in any season, it will become a great gift for one of the women in my family who like flowerry-sharp scents, plus this perfume was a great price, and it is nicely bottled.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent for years and love it. I constantly get compliments from friends and even people I don&#x27;t know who ask me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing. Department stores no longer carry it so I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s still available from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice perfume but I understand that they have discontinued this fragance.  I get a lot of compliments on this fragrance.  It was shipped to me in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I could no longer find Realities at Macy&#x27;s, so decided to try Amazon. Found it at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift for a friend who loves this fragrance. It wears well on her, people often ask her what perfume she&#x27;s wearing and compliment her as well. It&#x27;s long lasting and was a great deal. Overall satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> Came on time &amp; I bought it as a gift...and my mother loved it!!! The smell is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> My sister in law was wearing this one day and I loved the smell of it.  Not too strong or overpowering and the scent stays on for hours.  I bought a bigger bottle about 8 years ago and just ran out.  My favorite perfume to wear.  It is a little expensive, but well worth the price</li>
            <li> You have no idea how happy I was to get these! Don&#x27;t know what I will do once I have to switch to something else!</li>
            <li> A Great everyday parfum spray</li>
            <li> Really nice scent. Good size bottle for the money. Smells really nice and sexy. Have had a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> I too have gotten the same reaction from this perfume. Years ago, I walked into the bank and when I got to the window, the teller asked me what I was wearing and later told me that he had bought a bottle for his girlfriend. The grandkids also tell me that  it smells like Grandma. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for years and am very pleased. It was everything I expected.  I would order this again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful and sweet scent. But not a fruity sweet scent. It is very hard to find in the stores. Got it as a gift for a dear friend and she loves it of course.</li>
            <li> I was really upset when I received it because it didn&#x27;t have a box and it was for a gift. The picture showed a box with it and the order did not say it didn&#x27;t have a box with it. I was really disappointed because now it looks like I gave her a bottle that I found somewhere!</li>
            <li> Wish I had gotten the box</li>
            <li> Best perfume ever worth every penny</li>
