            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Molivera Sweet Almond Oil for about a week, and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love sweet almond oil!  </li>
            <li>Molivera Sweet Almond Oil is by far one of the BEST products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Great for skin but the main reason I got</li>
            <li>The Sweet Almond Oil from Molivera worked excellently on her - no rash, absorbs quickly, and moisturizes very well!  </li>
            <li>It has the perfect consistency, no over-powering smell, perfect packaging and last but not the least, good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working great so far !!</li>
            <li>Almond Oil feels great, works really good on dry skin, feet, and heals.</li>
            <li>Very clean.</li>
            <li>no breakouts and I can trust that I am going to bed with very clean skin.  </li>
            <li>As far as fragrance, there isn&#x27;t one, which in my opinion, makes it extremely versatile - perfect for adding to homemade skin care products... perfect for using with other scented products/colognes, etc... perfect for unisex</li>
            <li>Loving this Sweet Almond Oil.</li>
            <li>I have used others that cost more than twice as much and feel this is just as good as Eden&#x27;s Gardens and better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I put it a couple drops in my shampoo and conditioner for a beautiful soft shine hair.</li>
            <li>I make my own makeup remover using sweet almond oil, jojoba, and olive oil</li>
            <li>I use it after a hot shower, and it feels really good on my skin.</li>
            <li>The Sweet Almond Oil is very gentle on the skin and adds great moisture.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love my sweet almond oil!</li>
            <li>It is well worth getting!!</li>
            <li>Love the Sweet Almond oil!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this sweet almond oil!</li>
            <li>I love sweet almond oil and use it for just about everything!.</li>
            <li>Love my sweet almond oil!</li>
            <li>but I need more time to give a more accurate assessment.</li>
            <li>Excellent moisturizer for dry hair and split ends....will be a staple for my hair care regime.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use (has a flip top).</li>
            <li>the scent is not as great as expected but its a good product....</li>
            <li>nice smooth light oil that i put in my  1 year olds hair.  </li>
            <li>In my case it didn&#x27;t work, but otherwise I&#x27;m sure the product is fine.</li>
            <li>Wonderful surprise as I hadn&#x27;t researched it yet and am now really excited to start using it with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly and a very good value for the amount relative to price.  </li>
            <li>They also shared some very good recipes of using almond oil for various applications.</li>
            <li>Love it....soft and smooth, not oily.</li>
            <li>They give so many helpful tips on their products and make themselves available at all times.</li>
            <li>it feels great in my skin, I have used it for my hair once to prevent hair loss and made my hair so soft to touch.  </li>
            <li>I was also surprised to learn that it works great for cleansing and have been using it for that, as well.  </li>
            <li>But what I really enjoy the most is the way my hair feels since using this oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so convenient to be able to just pour some into my hands and smooth it on from head to toe.</li>
            <li>and it works much better than the chemical filled makeup removers at the store</li>
            <li>I apply it while still wet, after a shower, which I believe works best.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly what I wanted, very pleased.</li>
            <li>Fast deliery and good product.</li>
            <li>good product,  fast delivery</li>
            <li>Seller shipped fast and sent good instructions and product info.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be a great product, it certainly has a super product support team.</li>
            <li>(sweet almond oil is the best oil for my hair thus far), on my face to remove my make up, on my body and my razor before I shave (super close shave and no nicks), and in the whipped shea body butter I make.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face so soft and feels very nice.</li>
            <li>Excellent product,  large, priced right, delivered quickly, product is great on my skin I will be purchasing this product again in the future!</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Almond Oil and we love it!</li>
            <li>thinking that it will smell delicious as some other almonds products I have used before.  </li>
            <li>The texture is divine; much more rich and silky than coconut oil.</li>
            <li>How cool it that!</li>
            <li>I tied this oil for the first time and am in love with it!</li>
            <li>It shipped very quickly</li>
            <li>thrilled, so professional and amazing follow up and&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item received very quickly, on time as promised.</li>
            <li>created a pre shave blend with essential oils and it works great, better than products that are in the $100</li>
            <li>This allows my hands to glide across the skin easily.</li>
            <li>As soon as I received the oil, which arrived very quickly, I have been putting it on</li>
            <li>Took one star away because I wish it came in a pump dispenser since the bottle easily becomes covered in oil</li>
            <li>It Came very quickly, it is just was I wanted.</li>
            <li>Soaks into scalp very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to massage into the skin.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price, especially if you make your own skin care stuff.</li>
            <li>that is a plus in her case, she doesn&#x27;t like strong smell.</li>
            <li>It can be used on its own as a great moisturizer and for oily skinned people who are worried this will make them more oily, it is simply not true.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good product I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>So far so good, the oil is very smooth and almost smell free</li>
            <li>The oil is very light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have tried many lotions and oils over the years but by far this is the best oil I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Interesting, it is called sweet almond oil, I tasted it and it has no flavor.  </li>
            <li>I gave been using the sweet almond oil for almost a week and am enjoying it.</li>

            <li>Great oil, it absorbs into skin quickly and leaves a soft feeling.</li>
            <li>It is very light and easily absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>(see below) and all of the products worked great, but I wanted to find a moisturizer I could use that would fit right in with the rest of my new routine.</li>
            <li>My overly oily skin has seen a huge improvement already.</li>
            <li>and my skin stayed smooth.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>The inclusion of a rubber stopper inside the top keeps the oil fresh and prevents leaking during transport.</li>

            <li>There is almost no almond smell in it which I personally think its great since I use it liberally on my hair and body</li>
            <li>so I felt it was important to write a review.</li>
            <li>I use it as my primary and sometimes with Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;April 2017: just downgraded to one star because description does not mention hexane free.</li>

            <li>results were fantastic.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great decision on my part to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>Smooth.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so smooth.</li>
            <li>Smooth; not oily, and dissolves into skin</li>
            <li>Worked great in the blends I have mixed.</li>
            <li>Fantastic....</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Its a good almond oil, but its a bit liquid the oil, i have had others before and they have more consistency and thickness, so i use more than what i expected to use because of that</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I never realizing that baby oil just lays on the top layer of your skin and really does not have any benefits and most moisturizing lotions are made with alcohol.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m delighted.</li>
            <li>Product came w/o safety cap and oil was all over the package the little I did salvage was very nice!</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!!!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a very nice personal touch.</li>
            <li>Very nice oil to use when using essential oils</li>
            <li>It is perfect, not too heavy and the smell is so clean.  </li>
            <li>Partly because of already great reviews and partly because I wanted to try something a natural for a change instead of the typical great smelling but overpriced moisturizers and creams.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even smell like almond oil which has a particular nice smell....</li>
            <li>This is great, I use it in my homemade body cream (shea butter, avocado butter, sweet almond, jojoba) as well as my facial serums.</li>
            <li>Molivera Organics Sweet Almond Oil has a light, smooth texture.</li>
            <li>Great oil not watered down feeling like most.</li>
            <li>I received it very fast and was extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m loving it so far!!</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and really helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild enough to layer with perfume, but great even on</li>
            <li>Smells very clean, very pure product.</li>
            <li>Ordered the Sweet Almond Oil by Molivera Organics and it arrived very quickly and I love that they had a plastic stopper at the top to completely prevent spills.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ll see more results if I am consistent.</li>
            <li>Once again not disappointed in Molivera ..</li>

            <li>Great quality, pure and natural.  </li>

            <li>Now, don&#x27;t take this to the bank, but I accidentally spilled a bit of this oil on my wooden coffee table, wiped it up with an old t-shirt, and it looked so great</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice big bottle too!</li>
            <li>Such a nice combination with all three.</li>
            <li>This oil has replaced a LOT of my old products and saved me a ton of money AND does a better job than what I once purchased off the store shelves.  </li>
            <li>wow, i really do love this.  </li>
            <li>, I use it fresh out of the shower...</li>
            <li>Rare these days.</li>
            <li>and so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li>It also serves as a nice night time moisturizer, especially during these winter months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will be just a matter of weeks until they completely diminish.</li>
            <li>They placed a red stopper in the top of the bottle under the cap to help prevent leaking; I thought this was really thoughtful.</li>
            <li>So far I love it and the way it softens my hair and skin.</li>
            <li>The way I have been using it is; first wash my face, then apply sweet almond oil.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pleased with results</li>
            <li>The oil is nicely absorbed by morning.</li>
            <li>This oil absorbed in my skin almost immediately and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a nice size bottle so it&#x27;ll last me for a while.</li>
            <li>This was kind of a gift, im starting to use it</li>
            <li>Was a nice bottle of carrier oil, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I found this product, definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re tired of putting products on your skin with a ton of ingredients you can&#x27;t pronounce, then this wonderful oil is for you.  </li>
            <li>So creamy and fresh.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Sweet Almond Oil.  </li>
            <li>Some people might not like to be bothered with extra e-mail, but I thought it was nice.</li>
            <li>Supposedly, useful in reducing DHT in scalp.  </li>
            <li>It keeps her silky coat shiny and healthy looking between her professional grooming appointments.</li>
            <li>Worth every drop.  </li>
            <li>The oil is a new experience, but so far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I use this all over my body because it not only conditions great, but it absorbs unlike so many other oils I have tried.</li>
            <li>I repurchased this oil because it is the best that I have found after trying several other brands.</li>
            <li>I am not sure whether it&#x27;ll help keep me stretch-mark free but the oil is awesome, easily absorbed through the skin and not sticky or gross at all.</li>
            <li>This is such a great quality oil with no other ingredients or fillers added to it.</li>
            <li>but I am determined to do the right thing for my body.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
            <li>It was priced right.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to ensure keeping the right ingredients on hand to make lotions and potions for myself and others.</li>
            <li>It got here right on time.</li>
            <li>It has the right size non greasy just perfect...and it goes with every oil....</li>
            <li>right away soothed my skin</li>
            <li>I massage it onto my face right after my shower at night.</li>
            <li>Of all the butters and oils and such, my number one favorite is SWEET ALMOND OIL.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it, only used it less than a week and can already see the great affects it has had on my skin, my elbows are no longer ruff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a better Sweet Almond Oil in a different brand.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit thinner than some other sweet almond oils, which I feel makes it easier to use, more comfortable to apply.</li>
            <li>Without being an oily mess, I dont use it daily on my hair, and I am going to give it some more time on my hair but its great for your skin and hands.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, high quality.  </li>
            <li>The sweet almond oil smells very fresh and made my hair and skin feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Very high quality Sweet Almond Oil.  </li>
            <li>It must be very pure oil with no distillate because there is no residue.</li>
            <li>I really like it, specially for my skin.</li>
            <li>a long way andmakes your skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li>Sweet almond oil has really done wonders for my skin, I use it as a face cleanser (OCM).</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d much rather use use sweet almond oil over lotions any day</li>
            <li>I really like sweet almond oil</li>
            <li>and I use the sweet almond oil by itself in the morning after washing my face when getting ready for the day.</li>
            <li>I came across sweet almond oil since it did not have as much of a smell like coconut oil and wouldn&#x27;t clash with my perfume.</li>
            <li>fast fast fast delivery :)</li>
            <li>Nice soft natural feel!</li>

            <li>i really enjoy this thanks so much...</li>
            <li>It is especially nice mixed with a few drops of peppermint oil.</li>
            <li>My wife is using this oil on her belly because she is pregnant and wants to avoid stretching mark.</li>
            <li>I would much rather put natural products on my body, and I&#x27;m glad I purchased this oil.</li>
            <li>You get a lot of oil for your money plus the bottle is a great design since it works much like a dropper thus preventing waste.</li>

            <li>Shipping fast and replied to my email fast!!  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of sweet almond oil and I am glad that i found this particular brand.</li>
            <li>and one of the best parts is that a little bit of it goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The glide is probably one of the best as a little drop of this oil goes a long way and with the amount of oil</li>
            <li>This oil is a good product , some seem to be tampered with or watered down , so they do not seem pure.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the carrier oil</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend you all if you want a healthy looking skin and lustrous hair...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna try making a face mask with it and honey next :)</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying this product.  </li>
            <li>I was petting my cat after using it the first night, and she started licking my hands and then tried to lick my face.</li>
            <li>I expected it to have a nice fragrance, but it is odorless.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>

            <li>It was exactly what I had heard about.  </li>

            <li>Thanks Molivera!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks in this pregnancy and only 7 weeks more to go.</li>
            <li>I use this mostly as a carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li>but next time I order I will be ordering shea butter from Molivera despite it being a bit more in price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Vendor ships fast and is proactive with customer service to ensure satisfaction!</li>
            <li>Love this oil use on my face twice daily and also has a carrier oil.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised...</li>
            <li>Very helpful, thank you!</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying Almond Oil.</li>
            <li>After several uses I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have just received and only been able to use one.</li>
            <li>Molivera almond oil is a bit thicker and feels like an actual oil which leads me to believe the quality is better.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the follow up emails with useful tips and recipes.</li>
            <li>My hair has been so smooth and soft in my hands.</li>
            <li>My face feels soft and smooth waiting to get results on the wrinkle on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what they say it will.</li>
            <li>Love this oil and the customer service is terrific.</li>
            <li>:) will definitely buy again.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li>You can mix it with another essential oil if you want something more fragrant.</li>
            <li>No noticeable scent, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Love the customer service and extra info</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my fault because I just looked at the name and didn&#x27;t make sure the actual product was organic.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to buy this product for my baby and I.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even funny</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant to put oil on my face, thinking it would cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>Be aware this has no scent at all</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will probably be ordering more in the future, but it does go a long way and does such a great job.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased Molivera Organics brand</li>
            <li>My skin feels better with the Aura Cacia product to warrant the extra cost, plus it us truly organic.</li>
            <li>Will buy more when the bottle runs low.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on at first</li>
            <li>I thought it was wet and slippery kind of feeling</li>
            <li>The smell is very little and pleasant.</li>
            <li>This oil absorbed very quickly into my skin when I applied especially on my face.</li>
            <li>No weird scent, but very slightly nutty in a really good way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m integrating it into my own beauty/ health care regimen as well - using it on my face and body in place of other moisturizers with lots of chemicals and much higher in cost.  </li>
            <li>She was using it for a month and was excited to tell me that the Sweet almond oil mixed with Lavender EO already seemed to be improving the appearance of acne and scarring on her face, as well as, making her skin softer.</li>
            <li>The tinted bottle keeps the oil away from harsh light and it comes with an awesome second, internal cap that means I can travel with the bottle without worry of leakage.</li>
            <li>They also email nice recipes for scrubs and moisturizer using almond oil and other oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it before and after flat ironing my hair and it makes my hair so smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m serious, it&#x27;s great for the eyes.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product but it came with a broken top.  </li>
            <li>And as a very special facial moisturizing treatment on those days I don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and absorbs fully very fast.  </li>
            <li>Fast service and product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>At first I used this oil just on my face, but after I saw how gentle and non greasy</li>
            <li>Sweet almond oil is recommended as a natural laxative in Ayurveda the ancient Indian science of health.</li>
            <li>I stopped using all my lotions but one for sensitive skin and my sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>This means very pure and high quality.</li>
            <li>I love it enjoy it everyday aftee my shower!</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product as a carrier oil for my DIY facial moisturizer with lavender, lemon and grapefruit essential oils.</li>
            <li>I am going to try a few more of the companies suggestions for using the sweet almond oil in shower and beauty routines.</li>
            <li>She seems happy with it and uses it regularly for her skin, mainly the scalp, with the combination of other oils.</li>
            <li>The rests were very positive as our skin was so soft!</li>
            <li>Molivera for making such a fine product.</li>
            <li>It has 100% surpassed its main job!</li>
            <li>I really was looking for something organic and pure and this is it.</li>
            <li>I absorbs nicely and leaves a little shine.</li>
            <li>I can tell this is a high quality product from the first touch.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this mixed with a couple sprays of pure aloe and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li>but I really like the follow-up email with additional information about use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it for face,body, hair moisturizing for our whole family.</li>
            <li>I use this on my face, I really like it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I received my order fast with helpful hints on how to use the oil.</li>
            <li>Im dealing with sinus issues, &amp; I  can&#x27;t smell much.</li>
            <li>Before this I used coconut oil for my hair, but it would leave it very greasy</li>
            <li>The difference ORGANIC, COLD PRESSED oil makes is priceless.</li>

            <li>have been using coconut oil for a nighttime moisturizer for months and it words really well,</li>
            <li>Thanks  </li>
            <li>Works very well as a massage oil.</li>
            <li>I found the oil didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>I have VERY dry/oil t-zone skin sensative skin.</li>
            <li>It has worked very well for that purpose.  </li>

            <li>I am enjoying how the oil feels on my skin and sinks in.</li>

            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I use this on so much</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for this oil.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Feels very silky on my skin</li>
            <li>I expected better.</li>
            <li>I also appreciated this company&#x27;s customer service.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Came at reasonable  time.</li>
            <li>Even better than expected.</li>
            <li>Too much hassle to try to exchange</li>
            <li>absolutely love this oil with my Young Living essential oils!</li>
            <li>Delivery was a few days, and it was a nice size bottle.  </li>
            <li>I bought this initially to thin out Castor Oil, but use it for so many more things.</li>
            <li>But it really just works as a natural moisturizer and absorbs right into my skin.</li>
            <li>I combine almond oil jojopa and seaweed and few other natural products together and the result for my skin has been the best I have ever came across for reducing or even eliminating.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this to use in a recipe to make a homemade &amp;#34;vapor rub&amp;#34; with essential oils.</li>
            <li>However, only Sweet Almond Oil is not toxic to cats, make sure you DO NOT give your cats bitter almond oil because it has some sort of poisons.</li>
            <li>I originally tried a different type oil</li>
            <li>I LOVE this almond oil, i use it with other products to make body butter or just by itself.  </li>
            <li>oil was a couple dollars more than some other brands.</li>
            <li>but better than other almond oils, olive oil or coconut oils I have tried.</li>
            <li>This particular product is a very high quality product and the almond oil is pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it comes in a dark bottle; really helpful for conserving the oil.</li>
            <li>Using Sweet Almond Oil as a gentle skin cleanser can alleviate all problems related to overproduction of oil by skin; i.e. blackheads, whiteheads, oily skin, etc.</li>
            <li>I am definitely a returning costumer and the emailed tips for natural homemade product that I can use the oil to make are right on point!!</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly, has little to no fragrance, and is light.  </li>
            <li>The Bitter Almond tree has pink flowers and its nuts produce a different kind of oil, used mostly for fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>plus it keeps the skin around eyes moisturized which means less fine lines!</li>
            <li>What could be better for you than a single, natural ingredient that is also ingestible?</li>
            <li>Usually, I soak my hands in warm water, then apply sweet almond oil, then cover my hands in plastic gloves for ten minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using you&#x27;re sweet almond oil as a carrier oil with some essential oils in a roll on.</li>
            <li>Mix equal parts ground coffee, sea salt, brown sugar, and Sweet Almond Oil together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been slowly trying more and more essential oils.</li>
            <li>and I especially appreciate the emails from the company providing me with tips and recipes for my Sweet Almond Oil.</li>
            <li>I now only purchase body lotion made with Sweet Almond Oil too.</li>
            <li>I have been using their Sweet Almond Oil mixed with the shea butter for a couple of months now</li>
            <li>These are the same Almonds we use to get our Sweet Oil.</li>
            <li>does Sweet Almond Oil &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; my skin?&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Almond Oil has been used, dating back thousands of years by the Romans for skin care, beauty, and healing.</li>
            <li>I had never used sweet almond oil before and decided to give it a try as a carrier oil for essential oils of which I am a newbie.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from really dry skin I have only been using this for a couple of days but in love how it makes my skin feel so soft and it absorbs quickly too.</li>
            <li>I bought this to make beard oil, but it has so many other uses!</li>
            <li>Found a new product for life!</li>
            <li>My new obsession is this oil!</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase, I&#x27;m currently using it with few other ingredients to make a body lotion.</li>
            <li>Although you could use this on its on to smooth your dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I had hoped it would have an almond smell as some of the reviewers claimed the smell was great.  </li>
            <li>Decent price.</li>
            <li>I already purchased second one of the same and will be buying more from this seller.</li>
            <li>thanks for the great info, we were using the wrong oil.</li>
            <li>This was the main ingredient for the lotion</li>
            <li>High quality product at a decent price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my very first essential oil to try</li>
            <li>Makes my skin very, very soft!</li>
            <li>Warm you face with a ht, wet cloth for a few seconds, then wash it with Molivera Organics Sweet Almond oil.</li>
            <li>Excellent product that I have been using for the past 2 months both &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; and in mad scientist combinations to make my own body creams that save me money and have no hidden chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It is of High quality</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.....</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>So I found this product after a search of high quality affordable almond oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>

            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil and this company.</li>
            <li>I  greatly prefer it to almond oil ( not sweet), particularly for the face, as it is not as heavy, and absorbs much better!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It feels light on my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use often, but from what little I have, I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>cause I used a little more than I should&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I used to have the most oily skin and as long as I was drying out my skin by using harsh products, it kept overproducing oil to try and stay balanced, but once you start using a high quality oil like sweet almond, your skin no longer needs to overproduce oil</li>
            <li>im really into natural things</li>
            <li>Very helpful with keeping hair soft and moist</li>
            <li>All confirmed that it should absolutely NOT look or smell the way that it did.  </li>
            <li>the comment about bitter vs sweet almond oil was very helpful).</li>
            <li>I have used it in a few of my recipes and have enjoyed the results.</li>
            <li>I will post more details in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Skin already feels and looks better with just a few applications.</li>
            <li>Sweet Almond Oil can be used to treat minor wounds, swelling, and inflammations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Firstly, I had been going to the dermatologist for 8 months and in those 8 months any topical and oral treatment they gave me had done absolutely nothing for my skin but make it greasier.</li>
            <li>and I would have to wash my hair before going out, but with this oil, I actually apply it to my hair right after getting out of the shower - now thats a world of difference.</li>
            <li>I dry brush my skin before showering, I apply the sweet almond oil,</li>
            <li>With continued use, Molivera Organics Sweet Almond Oil will condition and grow your hair, bringing luster and smoothness to dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil......not too greasy, nice, natural subtle scent, and my skin loves it.</li>
            <li>(I live in Florida).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>This oil is my new go-to body lotion, hair oil and lip balm.</li>
            <li>New to almond oil,</li>
            <li>but this is a new brand for me</li>
            <li>This oil has become my new go-to beauty product.  </li>
            <li>I am considering getting some for myself when I need a new carrier oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to new products by them.</li>
            <li>My new staple in my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m noticing diminished fine lines, dark circles and improved texture.  </li>
            <li>I also apply it under and around my eyes at night to minimize fine lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li>I am a 25 year old with very picky, sensitive skin and oily T-zone.</li>
            <li>The condition of my skin improved drastically, and I would have never believed it would be possible with such cheap products.</li>
            <li>Bitter almond oil is darker, smells more like almonds, and is considered an essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for my natural hair for moister.  </li>
            <li>thanks so much, and a really big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>I had a few friends look at it for me as this was my first time using sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>The smell is very subtle but good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week, but it seems very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>my baby&#x27;s skin is very soft</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft after using.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It make my skin so soft !</li>
            <li>it will make whatever surface you apply this to feel baby soft!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny my skin soft!</li>
            <li>In the last month I have had significantly fewer break-outs, even despite the regular hormonal fluctuations that women endure.  </li>
            <li>Now that Molivera wrote me on some of the tips of using it for other purposes,  I am excited.</li>
            <li>My skin is glowing like a 20-yr old now!  </li>
            <li>Quality product as far as I can tell!</li>
            <li>I got two emails explaining how to use the oil as well as the difference between sweet and bitter almond oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;What is the difference between Sweet Almond Oil and Bitter Almond</li>
            <li>no bad chemical or negative smell, but no sweet nice almond smell either.  </li>
            <li>Sweet Almond Oil is does not clog pores, but is actually nourishing to the skin, while acting as an anti-bacterial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although more expensive, I find Aura Cacia - Certified Organic Skin Care Oil Sweet Almond - 4 oz.</li>
            <li>I am about a year and a half new to the community of essential oils and many natural and/or organic products.  </li>
            <li>Sweet Almond gently and naturally dissolves makeup, dirt, oil, and dead skin.</li>
            <li>I used the Sweet Almond oil in stead of other oils you can use and O my God</li>
            <li>I received my sweet almond oil the other day</li>
            <li>It did arrive with a cracked screw top making it impossible to use the flip top pour mechanism.</li>
            <li>Same for me with pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I used this to make lotion (along with coconut oil, beeswax, and a little bit of shea butter) and it turned out so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Not too sure why the invitation to leave a review suddenly started calling it shea butter; I guess someone got a little carried away with copy &amp; paste functions.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying this product again and recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li>Mix 1 cup of Molivera Organics Raw African Ivory Shea Butter with 1/3 cup Molivera Organics Sweet Almond Oil mixed with 6 drops of each of your favorite essential oils.</li>
            <li>my skin feels amazing, and i LOVE the concept of nothing bad going on it - its only one thing:  </li>
            <li>the others that are still using the clear bottles can&#x27;t start using the colored ones.</li>
            <li>No smell to the product, not too heavy or greasy and so far stretch mark free.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I used it once so far</li>
            <li>I used it as an ingredient in my natural hair and skin mixtures.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I have been using it for face and body and received a complete body massage with this oil.</li>
            <li>After using, my skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far I like the almond oil.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>I have natural kinky hair</li>
            <li>I use only the brush, not the cleanser that comes in the kit) and it has really helped minimize the size and appearance of the pores and blackheads on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>I am completely hooked.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50+ years old and strangers stop me in the grocery store to ask me what I use on my face.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use on my 2 year old (instead of lotion), who has extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Her skin is that sensitive.)  </li>
            <li>Adding 1 or 2 drops to hair while shampooing really does a big difference.</li>
            <li>However, I really like the Molivera company for shipping my order promptly and following up to check on my satisfaction.</li>
            <li>We are both very grateful to have found this oil and will continue to use it in the future!  </li>
            <li>My skin has always been soft but now it is silky.  </li>
            <li>Apply gently around eye area 1-2 times daily.</li>
            <li>It works very well as a carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li>Having Santa Ana winds this week and my skin is not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li>So far I have not.</li>
            <li>I use it after showers and on my nails for softness and to keep everything soft.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my skin and it make it glow and feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Makes the skin so soft - I use it for cleansing and to moisturize.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hair and skin - it has helped improve both so much, that I can actually see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li>My face is so soft,</li>
            <li>Even my husband noticed and commented on how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft but not oily.</li>
            <li>I use it in my homemade hair moisturizer and directly on my skin.</li>
            <li>When I noticed how soft my skin was, I began to use it as a moisturizer for my body, hair and face.  </li>
            <li>It soaks into my skin leaving it feeling soft and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it to make homemade lotion and have also applied it directly to my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>my skin is SO soft.</li>
            <li>I feel like my face is glowing and so soft that I don&#x27;t even want to put makeup on.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face in the morning and night, my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>I could use this all over my body, it just makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>This oil smelled rancid and like old cook in oil.</li>
            <li>and my skin is soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>but my skin was so soft once it did</li>
            <li>So far it is just as described.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin soft and mattte feeling.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft all over, no oily feeling on my face</li>
            <li>I use it by itself directly on my skin and mix with my DIY body butters.  </li>
            <li>and it gives it a lot of moisture and brings out her natural curls</li>
            <li>I use it after my shower and my skin is so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Using it as a massage oil and personal lubricant for intimate activities.</li>
            <li>It smelled completely rancid.</li>
            <li>I also put some in my hair and my hair was so soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft now.</li>
            <li>Also, I was surprised to see that my dark circles have decrease since I added this Sweet Almond Oil to my regime.  </li>
            <li>Light in color, slightly thick, really doesn&#x27;t seem to have a scent....</li>
            <li>perfect scent cant wait to use it in a lotion base with EO&#x27;s</li>
            <li>its working slowly but surely</li>
            <li>The plastic of the bottle is kind of thin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m obsessed with how good it made my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li>Oil is amazing,  used it in organic body scrub with raw Shea almond butter, organic San sugar and several drops of doTERRA wild orange, vetiver and lemon essential oils.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this oil on my skin right out of the shower while I was still wet.  </li>
            <li>I use it right out of shower when the skin is still wet.</li>
            <li>I also sent this to my nephew for his new baby&amp;quot;s dry skin and they all started using it they like it so much.</li>
            <li>but I think we are going to be seeing a lot of each other;) Came quickly and just as expected.</li>
            <li>Simply mix equal parts Molivera Organics Sweet Almond Oil with equal parts aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li>This is my main carrier oil for my essential oils and use it in my homemade &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34; and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>It also seems to be quite economical, as it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>Because the sweet almond oil is completely odorless and less greasy than coconut oil, I may have accidentally discovered a replacement!</li>
            <li>I had been having sensitivity issues with high end commercial moisturizers</li>
            <li>I also use it on my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin and it has really helped his dry patches.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find the right products for my skin type for years and nothing ever worked, until I was so fed up with spending hundreds of dollars on expensive cream moisturizers and various cleansers and decided if nothing really works, I might as well just buy some cheap products and stop wasting my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightened small dark spots on my face but not as much as I hope since many say almond oil helps.</li>
            <li>These are good products and the seller not only stands behind them but is committed to total customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product, and I was let down in every way possible.</li>
            <li>Does not leave a very sticky gross feeling that cheap massage oils leave on skin, and a little oil goes a long way.</li>
            <li>So far working as expected and looks really pure..</li>
            <li>Mix equal parts organic raw honey and your sweet almond oil and a few drops of your favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li>I use it for my dark circles, as a moisturizer right after a shower and as a make up remover.</li>
            <li>Dry up fast.</li>
            <li>It feels much smoother and it is not as dry as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>Costs twice as much from my local international store</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine going back to buying beauty products filled with synthetic, harsh ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This oil is 100% cold pressed, free of hexane, and a premium food grade oil that is antioxidant rich.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and does not leave you looking or feeling like a greasy mess!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a little greasy and takes awhile to be absorbed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it as a carrier oil for my Young Living essential Oils.</li>
            <li>I apply it for a preshampoo treatment and it leaves my hair soft and manageable...really like will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll come back and update this review when I wake up with my 25 year old skin.  </li>
            <li>I am using it along with my Young Living essential oils.  </li>
            <li>My skin can finally feel moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this so I could mix it with my Young Living Essential Oils.</li>
            <li>I have had no reaction to the oil especially when used on  or near my face.  </li>
            <li>Instead of moisturizer I then apply a tiny bit of this Sweet Almond oil and after a few minutes I apply [[ASIN:B001FYZAWS</li>
            <li>Jam packed full of vitamins A, B, D, and E,  magnesium and essential fatty acids.</li>
            <li>If you spent money on other skin products stop wasting your money and try sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>i hate to give a product that has received such high ratings something less than excellent, but I wonder about this oil.  </li>
            <li>Since my daughter is only 8 months old, I use this to dilute the oils before I place them on her topically.</li>
            <li>So far its mixed with my essential oils, applied to my feet, applied to my face, arms, elbows.</li>
            <li>The Sweet Almond tree has white flowers and produces the Almonds that we usually eat.</li>
            <li>Used with care (a little goes a long way), it absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I place a small amount on shoulder and rub in before getting into shower and after shower place more in area the bump when down .</li>
            <li>and I really like the way this oil is absorbed into my skin without the usual itchiness I experience after using other products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This makes for a great base to add essential oils for direct skin application, massage oils or after shower general moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have a 9 year old son whose been struggling with an extreme case of eczema since he was 2 months old.</li>
            <li>Only problem was I didn&#x27;t notice much of a smell to it like I have with other companies.</li>
            <li>I used this as a base with other ingredients and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am happily surprised as to how it helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li>My dry hair ends became soft and shiny, my hands and face felt like silk and my nail beds shine..</li>
            <li>I have used coconut and jojoba oil for years on my face, but now prefer the sweet almond oil because it actually feels like it moisturizes much better than the other two oils during our cold and dry winters of MN.</li>
            <li>I used this particular oil very little so far</li>
            <li>Then take your cloth and blot any spots that are naturally oily (I have very dry skin) and your skin looks nourished and glowing.</li>
            <li>I now add this sweet almond oil to the mix (half and half) and I get the benefits of the Castor Oil, and the SAO offsets the dryness and makes my dogs skin moist and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>complex which also made a positive difference in appearance and radiance of my skin, and finally, when I am done, I just put another small dab of Sweet Almond Oil on my face instead of a cream</li>
            <li>I started using Rodan and Fields highly sought-after eye cream thinking it would put the almond oil to shame, and it ended up being the other way around!</li>
            <li>(If I use the wrong free and clear laundry detergent, she breaks out in a whole-body rash.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Molivera Sweet Almond Oil for about a week, and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love sweet almond oil!  </li>
            <li> Molivera Sweet Almond Oil is by far one of the BEST products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great for skin but the main reason I got</li>
            <li> The Sweet Almond Oil from Molivera worked excellently on her - no rash, absorbs quickly, and moisturizes very well!  </li>
            <li> It has the perfect consistency, no over-powering smell, perfect packaging and last but not the least, good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working great so far !!</li>
            <li> Almond Oil feels great, works really good on dry skin, feet, and heals.</li>
            <li> Very clean.</li>
            <li> no breakouts and I can trust that I am going to bed with very clean skin.  </li>
            <li> As far as fragrance, there isn&#x27;t one, which in my opinion, makes it extremely versatile - perfect for adding to homemade skin care products... perfect for using with other scented products/colognes, etc... perfect for unisex</li>
            <li> Loving this Sweet Almond Oil.</li>
            <li> I have used others that cost more than twice as much and feel this is just as good as Eden&#x27;s Gardens and better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I put it a couple drops in my shampoo and conditioner for a beautiful soft shine hair.</li>
            <li> I make my own makeup remover using sweet almond oil, jojoba, and olive oil</li>
            <li> I use it after a hot shower, and it feels really good on my skin.</li>
            <li> The Sweet Almond Oil is very gentle on the skin and adds great moisture.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my sweet almond oil!</li>
            <li> It is well worth getting!!</li>
            <li> Love the Sweet Almond oil!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this sweet almond oil!</li>
            <li> I love sweet almond oil and use it for just about everything!.</li>
            <li> Love my sweet almond oil!</li>
            <li> but I need more time to give a more accurate assessment.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer for dry hair and split ends....will be a staple for my hair care regime.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use (has a flip top).</li>
            <li> the scent is not as great as expected but its a good product....</li>
            <li> nice smooth light oil that i put in my  1 year olds hair.  </li>
            <li> In my case it didn&#x27;t work, but otherwise I&#x27;m sure the product is fine.</li>
            <li> Wonderful surprise as I hadn&#x27;t researched it yet and am now really excited to start using it with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and a very good value for the amount relative to price.  </li>
            <li> They also shared some very good recipes of using almond oil for various applications.</li>
            <li> Love it....soft and smooth, not oily.</li>
            <li> They give so many helpful tips on their products and make themselves available at all times.</li>
            <li> it feels great in my skin, I have used it for my hair once to prevent hair loss and made my hair so soft to touch.  </li>
            <li> I was also surprised to learn that it works great for cleansing and have been using it for that, as well.  </li>
            <li> But what I really enjoy the most is the way my hair feels since using this oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient to be able to just pour some into my hands and smooth it on from head to toe.</li>
            <li> and it works much better than the chemical filled makeup removers at the store</li>
            <li> I apply it while still wet, after a shower, which I believe works best.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I wanted, very pleased.</li>
            <li> Fast deliery and good product.</li>
            <li> good product,  fast delivery</li>
            <li> Seller shipped fast and sent good instructions and product info.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be a great product, it certainly has a super product support team.</li>
            <li> (sweet almond oil is the best oil for my hair thus far), on my face to remove my make up, on my body and my razor before I shave (super close shave and no nicks), and in the whipped shea body butter I make.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face so soft and feels very nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent product,  large, priced right, delivered quickly, product is great on my skin I will be purchasing this product again in the future!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Almond Oil and we love it!</li>
            <li> thinking that it will smell delicious as some other almonds products I have used before.  </li>
            <li> The texture is divine; much more rich and silky than coconut oil.</li>
            <li> How cool it that!</li>
            <li> I tied this oil for the first time and am in love with it!</li>
            <li> It shipped very quickly</li>
            <li> thrilled, so professional and amazing follow up and&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item received very quickly, on time as promised.</li>
            <li> created a pre shave blend with essential oils and it works great, better than products that are in the $100</li>
            <li> This allows my hands to glide across the skin easily.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received the oil, which arrived very quickly, I have been putting it on</li>
            <li> Took one star away because I wish it came in a pump dispenser since the bottle easily becomes covered in oil</li>
            <li> It Came very quickly, it is just was I wanted.</li>
            <li> Soaks into scalp very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to massage into the skin.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price, especially if you make your own skin care stuff.</li>
            <li> that is a plus in her case, she doesn&#x27;t like strong smell.</li>
            <li> It can be used on its own as a great moisturizer and for oily skinned people who are worried this will make them more oily, it is simply not true.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good product I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So far so good, the oil is very smooth and almost smell free</li>
            <li> The oil is very light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions and oils over the years but by far this is the best oil I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Interesting, it is called sweet almond oil, I tasted it and it has no flavor.  </li>
            <li> I gave been using the sweet almond oil for almost a week and am enjoying it.</li>
            <li> Have used the combo once and it was pretty effective.</li>

            <li> I am SO happy to have discovered Sweet Almond Oil---it may now be my favorite to use as a carrier oil with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Great oil, it absorbs into skin quickly and leaves a soft feeling.</li>
            <li> It is very light and easily absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> (see below) and all of the products worked great, but I wanted to find a moisturizer I could use that would fit right in with the rest of my new routine.</li>
            <li> My overly oily skin has seen a huge improvement already.</li>
            <li> and my skin stayed smooth.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> The inclusion of a rubber stopper inside the top keeps the oil fresh and prevents leaking during transport.</li>
            <li> Makes for smooth, flowing movements during massage.</li>
            <li> Great carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin smooth after massage, absorbs well, not oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, works wonderful as a carrier oil for my Young Living essential oils.</li>

            <li> Great to use with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Get creative and make your own all natural chemical free oils, body butters and lotions.</li>
            <li> Because it is food grade and hexane free, I trust it for oral consumption.</li>
            <li> of the almond oil, 2 TB lavender-scented Castile soap, and filled the rest of the way with water.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed that even after use and showering, my skin still stays smooth for days.</li>
            <li> it smells great; I use it on my hair (it definitely moisturize it ) ..</li>
            <li> Great oil and works well with all of my essential oils!  </li>
            <li> Takes some time to absorb, but it leaves my skin so smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great for use as a carrier oil with essential oils.</li>
            <li> There is almost no almond smell in it which I personally think its great since I use it liberally on my hair and body</li>
            <li> so I felt it was important to write a review.</li>
            <li> I use it as my primary and sometimes with Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;April 2017: just downgraded to one star because description does not mention hexane free.</li>
            <li> The company sent a fantastic informational email along with my shipment.</li>
            <li> Great for giving back massages with.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s scent free</li>
            <li> Felt great on the skin and mixed well with my EOs.</li>
            <li> It absorbs guickly leaving your skin smooth and hydrated with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> really fresh smell better then</li>
            <li> Great company feed back.</li>
            <li> so I give it all the credit for such a great outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> results were fantastic.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great decision on my part to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Smooth.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so smooth.</li>
            <li> Smooth; not oily, and dissolves into skin</li>
            <li> Worked great in the blends I have mixed.</li>
            <li> Fantastic....</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> Its a good almond oil, but its a bit liquid the oil, i have had others before and they have more consistency and thickness, so i use more than what i expected to use because of that</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I never realizing that baby oil just lays on the top layer of your skin and really does not have any benefits and most moisturizing lotions are made with alcohol.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m delighted.</li>
            <li> Product came w/o safety cap and oil was all over the package the little I did salvage was very nice!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a very nice personal touch.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil to use when using essential oils</li>
            <li> It is perfect, not too heavy and the smell is so clean.  </li>
            <li> Partly because of already great reviews and partly because I wanted to try something a natural for a change instead of the typical great smelling but overpriced moisturizers and creams.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even smell like almond oil which has a particular nice smell....</li>
            <li> This is great, I use it in my homemade body cream (shea butter, avocado butter, sweet almond, jojoba) as well as my facial serums.</li>
            <li> Molivera Organics Sweet Almond Oil has a light, smooth texture.</li>
            <li> Great oil not watered down feeling like most.</li>
            <li> I received it very fast and was extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m loving it so far!!</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and really helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild enough to layer with perfume, but great even on</li>
            <li> Smells very clean, very pure product.</li>
            <li> Ordered the Sweet Almond Oil by Molivera Organics and it arrived very quickly and I love that they had a plastic stopper at the top to completely prevent spills.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll see more results if I am consistent.</li>
            <li> Once again not disappointed in Molivera ..</li>
            <li> My husband has RA and has significant pain in his feet.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, it is really hydrating!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> even though I haven&#x27;t had this item long it works great on places of my scalp</li>

            <li> I use this all over my body because it not only conditions great, but it absorbs unlike so many other oils I have tried.</li>
            <li> I repurchased this oil because it is the best that I have found after trying several other brands.</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether it&#x27;ll help keep me stretch-mark free but the oil is awesome, easily absorbed through the skin and not sticky or gross at all.</li>
            <li> This is such a great quality oil with no other ingredients or fillers added to it.</li>
            <li> but I am determined to do the right thing for my body.</li>

            <li> I was petting my cat after using it the first night, and she started licking my hands and then tried to lick my face.</li>
            <li> I expected it to have a nice fragrance, but it is odorless.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> My skin feels quite soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It was very helpful!</li>
            <li> For the first time I made my our body butter.</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft and it went on so smooth.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>

            <li> It is exactly what it says it is</li>
            <li> My skin tone is better than it was ten years ago.</li>
            <li> in fact I am going to purchase a second bottle just to make sure I have it on hand at all time.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> and this oil has actually made my skin feel much better.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and had an fabulous  shine.</li>
            <li> I run hot water on a bath cloth and squeeze out the excess water.  </li>
            <li> First time using this.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I had heard about.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered different brands of Almond Oil, and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> company.&lt;br /&gt;months later , still love it .</li>
            <li> It is smooth and feels soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I asked for.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Molivera!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks in this pregnancy and only 7 weeks more to go.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly as a carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> but next time I order I will be ordering shea butter from Molivera despite it being a bit more in price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Vendor ships fast and is proactive with customer service to ensure satisfaction!</li>
            <li> Love this oil use on my face twice daily and also has a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised...</li>
            <li> Very helpful, thank you!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Almond Oil.</li>
            <li> After several uses I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have just received and only been able to use one.</li>
            <li> Molivera almond oil is a bit thicker and feels like an actual oil which leads me to believe the quality is better.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the follow up emails with useful tips and recipes.</li>
            <li> My hair has been so smooth and soft in my hands.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and smooth waiting to get results on the wrinkle on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what they say it will.</li>
            <li> Love this oil and the customer service is terrific.</li>
            <li> :) will definitely buy again.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li> You can mix it with another essential oil if you want something more fragrant.</li>
            <li> No noticeable scent, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love the customer service and extra info</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my fault because I just looked at the name and didn&#x27;t make sure the actual product was organic.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to buy this product for my baby and I.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not even funny</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant to put oil on my face, thinking it would cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> Be aware this has no scent at all</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I will probably be ordering more in the future, but it does go a long way and does such a great job.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased Molivera Organics brand</li>
            <li> My skin feels better with the Aura Cacia product to warrant the extra cost, plus it us truly organic.</li>
            <li> Will buy more when the bottle runs low.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on at first</li>
            <li> I thought it was wet and slippery kind of feeling</li>
            <li> The smell is very little and pleasant.</li>
            <li> This oil absorbed very quickly into my skin when I applied especially on my face.</li>
            <li> No weird scent, but very slightly nutty in a really good way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m integrating it into my own beauty/ health care regimen as well - using it on my face and body in place of other moisturizers with lots of chemicals and much higher in cost.  </li>
            <li> She was using it for a month and was excited to tell me that the Sweet almond oil mixed with Lavender EO already seemed to be improving the appearance of acne and scarring on her face, as well as, making her skin softer.</li>
            <li> The tinted bottle keeps the oil away from harsh light and it comes with an awesome second, internal cap that means I can travel with the bottle without worry of leakage.</li>
            <li> They also email nice recipes for scrubs and moisturizer using almond oil and other oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it before and after flat ironing my hair and it makes my hair so smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious, it&#x27;s great for the eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product but it came with a broken top.  </li>
            <li> And as a very special facial moisturizing treatment on those days I don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and absorbs fully very fast.  </li>
            <li> Fast service and product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> At first I used this oil just on my face, but after I saw how gentle and non greasy</li>
            <li> Sweet almond oil is recommended as a natural laxative in Ayurveda the ancient Indian science of health.</li>
            <li> I stopped using all my lotions but one for sensitive skin and my sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li> This means very pure and high quality.</li>
            <li> I love it enjoy it everyday aftee my shower!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product as a carrier oil for my DIY facial moisturizer with lavender, lemon and grapefruit essential oils.</li>
            <li> I am going to try a few more of the companies suggestions for using the sweet almond oil in shower and beauty routines.</li>
            <li> She seems happy with it and uses it regularly for her skin, mainly the scalp, with the combination of other oils.</li>
            <li> The rests were very positive as our skin was so soft!</li>
            <li> Molivera for making such a fine product.</li>
            <li> It has 100% surpassed its main job!</li>
            <li> I really was looking for something organic and pure and this is it.</li>
            <li> I absorbs nicely and leaves a little shine.</li>
            <li> I can tell this is a high quality product from the first touch.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this mixed with a couple sprays of pure aloe and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> but I really like the follow-up email with additional information about use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it for face,body, hair moisturizing for our whole family.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face, I really like it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I received my order fast with helpful hints on how to use the oil.</li>
            <li> Im dealing with sinus issues, &amp; I  can&#x27;t smell much.</li>
            <li> Before this I used coconut oil for my hair, but it would leave it very greasy</li>
            <li> The difference ORGANIC, COLD PRESSED oil makes is priceless.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>

            <li> Very satisfied--shipping was prompt</li>
            <li> Really keeps the skin moisterized a refreshed.</li>
            <li> The Almond Oil has really added shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> I smooth it into my hair after my wash (or condition only wash).  </li>
            <li> It has absolutely changed my hair.</li>
            <li> Really silky.</li>
            <li> have been using coconut oil for a nighttime moisturizer for months and it words really well,</li>
            <li> Thanks  </li>
            <li> Works very well as a massage oil.</li>
            <li> I found the oil didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry/oil t-zone skin sensative skin.</li>
            <li> It has worked very well for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> The company contacted me twice, which I appreciated.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying how the oil feels on my skin and sinks in.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Your baby will really enjoy this daily massage.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels soft and smooth after using it for just a few days.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use this on so much</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for this oil.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Feels very silky on my skin</li>
            <li> I expected better.</li>
            <li> I also appreciated this company&#x27;s customer service.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Came at reasonable  time.</li>
            <li> Even better than expected.</li>
            <li> Too much hassle to try to exchange</li>
            <li> absolutely love this oil with my Young Living essential oils!</li>
            <li> Delivery was a few days, and it was a nice size bottle.  </li>
            <li> I bought this initially to thin out Castor Oil, but use it for so many more things.</li>
            <li> But it really just works as a natural moisturizer and absorbs right into my skin.</li>
            <li> I combine almond oil jojopa and seaweed and few other natural products together and the result for my skin has been the best I have ever came across for reducing or even eliminating.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to use in a recipe to make a homemade &amp;#34;vapor rub&amp;#34; with essential oils.</li>
            <li> However, only Sweet Almond Oil is not toxic to cats, make sure you DO NOT give your cats bitter almond oil because it has some sort of poisons.</li>
            <li> I originally tried a different type oil</li>
            <li> I LOVE this almond oil, i use it with other products to make body butter or just by itself.  </li>
            <li> oil was a couple dollars more than some other brands.</li>
            <li> but better than other almond oils, olive oil or coconut oils I have tried.</li>
            <li> This particular product is a very high quality product and the almond oil is pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in a dark bottle; really helpful for conserving the oil.</li>
            <li> Using Sweet Almond Oil as a gentle skin cleanser can alleviate all problems related to overproduction of oil by skin; i.e. blackheads, whiteheads, oily skin, etc.</li>
            <li> I am definitely a returning costumer and the emailed tips for natural homemade product that I can use the oil to make are right on point!!</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly, has little to no fragrance, and is light.  </li>
            <li> The Bitter Almond tree has pink flowers and its nuts produce a different kind of oil, used mostly for fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> plus it keeps the skin around eyes moisturized which means less fine lines!</li>
            <li> What could be better for you than a single, natural ingredient that is also ingestible?</li>
            <li> Usually, I soak my hands in warm water, then apply sweet almond oil, then cover my hands in plastic gloves for ten minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using you&#x27;re sweet almond oil as a carrier oil with some essential oils in a roll on.</li>
            <li> Mix equal parts ground coffee, sea salt, brown sugar, and Sweet Almond Oil together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly trying more and more essential oils.</li>
            <li> and I especially appreciate the emails from the company providing me with tips and recipes for my Sweet Almond Oil.</li>
            <li> I now only purchase body lotion made with Sweet Almond Oil too.</li>
            <li> I have been using their Sweet Almond Oil mixed with the shea butter for a couple of months now</li>
            <li> These are the same Almonds we use to get our Sweet Oil.</li>
            <li> does Sweet Almond Oil &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; my skin?&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Almond Oil has been used, dating back thousands of years by the Romans for skin care, beauty, and healing.</li>
            <li> I had never used sweet almond oil before and decided to give it a try as a carrier oil for essential oils of which I am a newbie.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from really dry skin I have only been using this for a couple of days but in love how it makes my skin feel so soft and it absorbs quickly too.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make beard oil, but it has so many other uses!</li>
            <li> Found a new product for life!</li>
            <li> My new obsession is this oil!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase, I&#x27;m currently using it with few other ingredients to make a body lotion.</li>
            <li> Although you could use this on its on to smooth your dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I had hoped it would have an almond smell as some of the reviewers claimed the smell was great.  </li>
            <li> Decent price.</li>
            <li> I already purchased second one of the same and will be buying more from this seller.</li>
            <li> thanks for the great info, we were using the wrong oil.</li>
            <li> This was the main ingredient for the lotion</li>
            <li> High quality product at a decent price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my very first essential oil to try</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very, very soft!</li>
            <li> Warm you face with a ht, wet cloth for a few seconds, then wash it with Molivera Organics Sweet Almond oil.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that I have been using for the past 2 months both &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; and in mad scientist combinations to make my own body creams that save me money and have no hidden chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It is of High quality</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I will keep using for MY intended purpose and highly recommends.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So I found this product after a search of high quality affordable almond oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Have high expectations for its performance in skincare.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will continue ordering as needed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend buying from them</li>
            <li> I am highly allergic to everything</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil and this company.</li>
            <li> I  greatly prefer it to almond oil ( not sweet), particularly for the face, as it is not as heavy, and absorbs much better!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It feels light on my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use often, but from what little I have, I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> cause I used a little more than I should&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I used to have the most oily skin and as long as I was drying out my skin by using harsh products, it kept overproducing oil to try and stay balanced, but once you start using a high quality oil like sweet almond, your skin no longer needs to overproduce oil</li>
            <li> im really into natural things</li>
            <li> Very helpful with keeping hair soft and moist</li>
            <li> All confirmed that it should absolutely NOT look or smell the way that it did.  </li>
            <li> the comment about bitter vs sweet almond oil was very helpful).</li>
            <li> I have used it in a few of my recipes and have enjoyed the results.</li>
            <li> I will post more details in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Skin already feels and looks better with just a few applications.</li>
            <li> Sweet Almond Oil can be used to treat minor wounds, swelling, and inflammations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Firstly, I had been going to the dermatologist for 8 months and in those 8 months any topical and oral treatment they gave me had done absolutely nothing for my skin but make it greasier.</li>
            <li> and I would have to wash my hair before going out, but with this oil, I actually apply it to my hair right after getting out of the shower - now thats a world of difference.</li>
            <li> I dry brush my skin before showering, I apply the sweet almond oil,</li>
            <li> With continued use, Molivera Organics Sweet Almond Oil will condition and grow your hair, bringing luster and smoothness to dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil......not too greasy, nice, natural subtle scent, and my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> (I live in Florida).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> This oil is my new go-to body lotion, hair oil and lip balm.</li>
            <li> New to almond oil,</li>
            <li> but this is a new brand for me</li>
            <li> This oil has become my new go-to beauty product.  </li>
            <li> I am considering getting some for myself when I need a new carrier oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to new products by them.</li>
            <li> My new staple in my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing diminished fine lines, dark circles and improved texture.  </li>
            <li> I also apply it under and around my eyes at night to minimize fine lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li> I am a 25 year old with very picky, sensitive skin and oily T-zone.</li>
            <li> The condition of my skin improved drastically, and I would have never believed it would be possible with such cheap products.</li>
            <li> Bitter almond oil is darker, smells more like almonds, and is considered an essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for my natural hair for moister.  </li>
            <li> thanks so much, and a really big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I had a few friends look at it for me as this was my first time using sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li> The smell is very subtle but good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week, but it seems very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> my baby&#x27;s skin is very soft</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft after using.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> It make my skin so soft !</li>
            <li> it will make whatever surface you apply this to feel baby soft!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny my skin soft!</li>
            <li> In the last month I have had significantly fewer break-outs, even despite the regular hormonal fluctuations that women endure.  </li>
            <li> Now that Molivera wrote me on some of the tips of using it for other purposes,  I am excited.</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing like a 20-yr old now!  </li>
            <li> Quality product as far as I can tell!</li>
            <li> I got two emails explaining how to use the oil as well as the difference between sweet and bitter almond oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;What is the difference between Sweet Almond Oil and Bitter Almond</li>
            <li> no bad chemical or negative smell, but no sweet nice almond smell either.  </li>
            <li> Sweet Almond Oil is does not clog pores, but is actually nourishing to the skin, while acting as an anti-bacterial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although more expensive, I find Aura Cacia - Certified Organic Skin Care Oil Sweet Almond - 4 oz.</li>
            <li> I am about a year and a half new to the community of essential oils and many natural and/or organic products.  </li>
            <li> Sweet Almond gently and naturally dissolves makeup, dirt, oil, and dead skin.</li>
            <li> I used the Sweet Almond oil in stead of other oils you can use and O my God</li>
            <li> I received my sweet almond oil the other day</li>
            <li> It did arrive with a cracked screw top making it impossible to use the flip top pour mechanism.</li>
            <li> Same for me with pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I used this to make lotion (along with coconut oil, beeswax, and a little bit of shea butter) and it turned out so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Not too sure why the invitation to leave a review suddenly started calling it shea butter; I guess someone got a little carried away with copy &amp; paste functions.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this product again and recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> Mix 1 cup of Molivera Organics Raw African Ivory Shea Butter with 1/3 cup Molivera Organics Sweet Almond Oil mixed with 6 drops of each of your favorite essential oils.</li>
            <li> my skin feels amazing, and i LOVE the concept of nothing bad going on it - its only one thing:  </li>
            <li> the others that are still using the clear bottles can&#x27;t start using the colored ones.</li>
            <li> No smell to the product, not too heavy or greasy and so far stretch mark free.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I used it once so far</li>
            <li> I used it as an ingredient in my natural hair and skin mixtures.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I have been using it for face and body and received a complete body massage with this oil.</li>
            <li> After using, my skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far I like the almond oil.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky hair</li>
            <li> I use only the brush, not the cleanser that comes in the kit) and it has really helped minimize the size and appearance of the pores and blackheads on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I am completely hooked.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50+ years old and strangers stop me in the grocery store to ask me what I use on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my 2 year old (instead of lotion), who has extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Her skin is that sensitive.)  </li>
            <li> Adding 1 or 2 drops to hair while shampooing really does a big difference.</li>
            <li> However, I really like the Molivera company for shipping my order promptly and following up to check on my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> We are both very grateful to have found this oil and will continue to use it in the future!  </li>
            <li> My skin has always been soft but now it is silky.  </li>
            <li> Apply gently around eye area 1-2 times daily.</li>
            <li> It works very well as a carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Having Santa Ana winds this week and my skin is not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li> So far I have not.</li>
            <li> I use it after showers and on my nails for softness and to keep everything soft.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my skin and it make it glow and feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin so soft - I use it for cleansing and to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair and skin - it has helped improve both so much, that I can actually see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> My face is so soft,</li>
            <li> Even my husband noticed and commented on how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft but not oily.</li>
            <li> I use it in my homemade hair moisturizer and directly on my skin.</li>
            <li> When I noticed how soft my skin was, I began to use it as a moisturizer for my body, hair and face.  </li>
            <li> It soaks into my skin leaving it feeling soft and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it to make homemade lotion and have also applied it directly to my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> my skin is SO soft.</li>
            <li> I feel like my face is glowing and so soft that I don&#x27;t even want to put makeup on.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face in the morning and night, my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> I could use this all over my body, it just makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> This oil smelled rancid and like old cook in oil.</li>
            <li> and my skin is soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> but my skin was so soft once it did</li>
            <li> So far it is just as described.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin soft and mattte feeling.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft all over, no oily feeling on my face</li>
            <li> I use it by itself directly on my skin and mix with my DIY body butters.  </li>
            <li> and it gives it a lot of moisture and brings out her natural curls</li>
            <li> I use it after my shower and my skin is so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Using it as a massage oil and personal lubricant for intimate activities.</li>
            <li> It smelled completely rancid.</li>
            <li> I also put some in my hair and my hair was so soft.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft now.</li>
            <li> Also, I was surprised to see that my dark circles have decrease since I added this Sweet Almond Oil to my regime.  </li>
            <li> Light in color, slightly thick, really doesn&#x27;t seem to have a scent....</li>
            <li> perfect scent cant wait to use it in a lotion base with EO&#x27;s</li>
            <li> its working slowly but surely</li>
            <li> The plastic of the bottle is kind of thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with how good it made my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> Oil is amazing,  used it in organic body scrub with raw Shea almond butter, organic San sugar and several drops of doTERRA wild orange, vetiver and lemon essential oils.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this oil on my skin right out of the shower while I was still wet.  </li>
            <li> I use it right out of shower when the skin is still wet.</li>
            <li> I also sent this to my nephew for his new baby&amp;quot;s dry skin and they all started using it they like it so much.</li>
            <li> but I think we are going to be seeing a lot of each other;) Came quickly and just as expected.</li>
            <li> Simply mix equal parts Molivera Organics Sweet Almond Oil with equal parts aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> This is my main carrier oil for my essential oils and use it in my homemade &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34; and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It also seems to be quite economical, as it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Because the sweet almond oil is completely odorless and less greasy than coconut oil, I may have accidentally discovered a replacement!</li>
            <li> I had been having sensitivity issues with high end commercial moisturizers</li>
            <li> I also use it on my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin and it has really helped his dry patches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find the right products for my skin type for years and nothing ever worked, until I was so fed up with spending hundreds of dollars on expensive cream moisturizers and various cleansers and decided if nothing really works, I might as well just buy some cheap products and stop wasting my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightened small dark spots on my face but not as much as I hope since many say almond oil helps.</li>
            <li> These are good products and the seller not only stands behind them but is committed to total customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product, and I was let down in every way possible.</li>
            <li> Does not leave a very sticky gross feeling that cheap massage oils leave on skin, and a little oil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So far working as expected and looks really pure..</li>
            <li> Mix equal parts organic raw honey and your sweet almond oil and a few drops of your favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li> I use it for my dark circles, as a moisturizer right after a shower and as a make up remover.</li>
            <li> Dry up fast.</li>
            <li> It feels much smoother and it is not as dry as it used to be.  </li>
            <li> Costs twice as much from my local international store</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine going back to buying beauty products filled with synthetic, harsh ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This oil is 100% cold pressed, free of hexane, and a premium food grade oil that is antioxidant rich.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and does not leave you looking or feeling like a greasy mess!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little greasy and takes awhile to be absorbed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it as a carrier oil for my Young Living essential Oils.</li>
            <li> I apply it for a preshampoo treatment and it leaves my hair soft and manageable...really like will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll come back and update this review when I wake up with my 25 year old skin.  </li>
            <li> I am using it along with my Young Living essential oils.  </li>
            <li> My skin can finally feel moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could mix it with my Young Living Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> I have had no reaction to the oil especially when used on  or near my face.  </li>
            <li> Instead of moisturizer I then apply a tiny bit of this Sweet Almond oil and after a few minutes I apply [[ASIN:B001FYZAWS</li>
            <li> Jam packed full of vitamins A, B, D, and E,  magnesium and essential fatty acids.</li>
            <li> If you spent money on other skin products stop wasting your money and try sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li> i hate to give a product that has received such high ratings something less than excellent, but I wonder about this oil.  </li>
            <li> Since my daughter is only 8 months old, I use this to dilute the oils before I place them on her topically.</li>
            <li> So far its mixed with my essential oils, applied to my feet, applied to my face, arms, elbows.</li>
            <li> The Sweet Almond tree has white flowers and produces the Almonds that we usually eat.</li>
            <li> Used with care (a little goes a long way), it absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I place a small amount on shoulder and rub in before getting into shower and after shower place more in area the bump when down .</li>
            <li> and I really like the way this oil is absorbed into my skin without the usual itchiness I experience after using other products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This makes for a great base to add essential oils for direct skin application, massage oils or after shower general moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have a 9 year old son whose been struggling with an extreme case of eczema since he was 2 months old.</li>
            <li> Only problem was I didn&#x27;t notice much of a smell to it like I have with other companies.</li>
            <li> I used this as a base with other ingredients and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am happily surprised as to how it helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li> My dry hair ends became soft and shiny, my hands and face felt like silk and my nail beds shine..</li>
            <li> I have used coconut and jojoba oil for years on my face, but now prefer the sweet almond oil because it actually feels like it moisturizes much better than the other two oils during our cold and dry winters of MN.</li>
            <li> I used this particular oil very little so far</li>
            <li> Then take your cloth and blot any spots that are naturally oily (I have very dry skin) and your skin looks nourished and glowing.</li>
            <li> I now add this sweet almond oil to the mix (half and half) and I get the benefits of the Castor Oil, and the SAO offsets the dryness and makes my dogs skin moist and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> complex which also made a positive difference in appearance and radiance of my skin, and finally, when I am done, I just put another small dab of Sweet Almond Oil on my face instead of a cream</li>
            <li> I started using Rodan and Fields highly sought-after eye cream thinking it would put the almond oil to shame, and it ended up being the other way around!</li>
            <li> (If I use the wrong free and clear laundry detergent, she breaks out in a whole-body rash.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s made my skin and hair so much healthier.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft and glowing not sticky and greasy like other products i have tried</li>
            <li> It is incredibly high in antioxidants, essential fatty acids, vitamins A, B, D, and</li>
            <li> lasting a long time, I will definitely choose this brand, and vendor again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big and you only need about 2-3 drops for your face.&lt;br /&gt;Super moisturizing yet not greasy, it helped with my dry peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, apply directly onto your baby’s skin, massaging gently into cradle cap, behind ears, and inner and outer joints.</li>
            <li> and I sometimes use a flat iron to straighten it.</li>
            <li> for dog lovers info: I add a few drops of Lavender Essential Oil and Lemongrass Essential oil to my oil mix and it really knocks down mites and repels fleas.</li>
            <li> There are just a few products I have discovered for my skincare over the years, that I cannot live without -</li>
            <li> it should last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> I put this on my dry hair slept with it on and washed the next morning.</li>
            <li> I just received this oil and am looking forward to using it, especially during the winter dry months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few days so far, but no burning, no peeling and</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use it too much on your face as it is slightly comodogenic and did not agree with mine!</li>
            <li> The price is the best and quality is as well, but waiting 18 days for anything coming from just a couple of states away, is just annoying and ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Little to no odor so works great as a carrier base for essential oils, or just as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Naturally Clear Green Tea Cleanser By St.Ives, 6.75 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped keep my skin clear as opposed to using harsh chemicals to do so.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time,  bigger bottle than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long</li>
            <li> My only concern is that it does not have any type of a tamper proof seal, and in this day and age some type of seal is expected.  </li>
            <li> , I wish I had know about it a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> In the long run you&#x27;ll save money.</li>
            <li> I use it, then wait a few minutes and wipe my face with a soft cloth.</li>
            <li> Add a few drops of oil to your baby’s bath to moisturize and soothe sensitive or irritated skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is very subtle and is not strong or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed existing blemishes are healing faster with less irritation and deep bumps are finally coming to the surface.</li>
            <li> I needed a carrier oil for my essential oils other than fractionated coconut, because I am allergic to it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why I didn&#x27;t learn this stuff from my elders long ago!  </li>
            <li> I will use this company in the future for other products that interest me.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an essential oil, due to the reviews for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment to it&#x27;s effectiveness for nourishing your hair, but I actually find that my back breaks out a bit when I use it for a massage oil, so I&#x27;m actually pretty skeptical of its helpfulness where acne is concerned.</li>
            <li> I use the almond oil as a carrier for other essential oils.  </li>
            <li> For several years I have had extremely dry skin due to estrogen-blocking cancer drugs and menopause.  </li>

            <li> Also controls dry skin for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to use on my dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my whole body and still have at least half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone, and dry skin, with scarring.</li>
            <li> Soothed my dry skin and kept it moist all day.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> It has no scent, is not greasy at all, and is a nice base oil for diluting/using essential oils.</li>
            <li> I found out the ingredients and saw it was one single ingredient, almond oil.</li>
            <li> it actually works on my dark cycles on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I replaced my normal cleanser and expensive moisturizer with this oil, and WOW!</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use it in my next batch of body cream with Molivera Organics Raw African Ivory Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m mixing some essential oils with the cream for a pain cream which is extremely helpful!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I will definitely reorder from this seller!!!</li>
            <li> It did wonders for my dry hands!</li>
            <li> Did not suit my skin, as it started making my sin rough &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I was using the Auracacia brand of sweet almond oil before I bought this brand, and the consistency was very thin - almost watery.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot because of my job and it tends to be very dry.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I added some to my shampoo because my hair is very dry.  </li>

            <li> I mix a little with essential oils when I get out of the shower and apply all over.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about any bad chemicals getting to my baby :)</li>
            <li> Perhaps I got a bad batch, but the stench of this was overwhelming.</li>
            <li> There was really no smell to this oil...</li>
            <li> His skin is scaly, rough, and itchy.</li>
            <li> Received my product sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I put it on my skin while I&#x27;m still wet in the shower.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of peppermint essential oil to the almond oil for its soothing properties.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of time researching ingredients and product formulas.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Have not really used this yet.  </li>
            <li> This oil is just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Pump and apply to wet skin before toweling off.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the oil all over when I&#x27;m still wet after a shower concentrating on areas that tend to be dryer</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> What I expected except I do not notice any scent from the oil which I did expect.  </li>

            <li> it has only been a few days of using this product, so with prolonged use</li>

            <li> Elta MD UV Shield SPF 45 Oil-Free 7 oz.]] which helps my skin stay protected from the harmful UV rays all day long without clogging my pores or running down my face when it&#x27;s humid</li>
            <li> I usually shed a lot of hair when I comb it, but when I combed my hair this morning there were no loose hairs.</li>
            <li> There is no smell and although I bought it to mix with essential oils, I use it plain without oils on my hands as a softener.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected from the listing and other reviews.</li>
            <li> No scent (as expected), quality product packaged well (no leaking like other reviewers described).</li>
            <li> Put a few drops in the bath, leaves kids skin soft without having to chase them around to put &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; (usually a Molivera Shea butter and an almond oil blend) on them afterwards.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The product is non greasy and a little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days but his skin feels smoother and he loves the way it makes his skin feel!</li>
            <li> Was looking for a sweet almond oil that it is cold pressed</li>
            <li> I ordered some other types of oil with this</li>
            <li> I think the bottle will last me a month or two if not more.</li>
            <li> Every other day I use the scrub together with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> but I think I will be using it for other things too.</li>
            <li> husband works out several days a week and usually has sore muscles, so I make an effort to massage him any chance I get.</li>
            <li> Stop using all other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Used this on my hair the other night.</li>
            <li> I use it to mix all my other oils.</li>
            <li> Like other people, I noticed this did leak all over the other stuff in my order.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair, skin and to mix with other oils.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get sticky like other things I have tried.  </li>
            <li> other almond oil ,i am going to use on skin and scalp for massage .i</li>
            <li> What sold it for me was that Molivera&#x27;s sweet almond oil is cold pressed</li>
            <li> I may try it for other uses.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I would use what the dermatologist gave me, my face would be greasy within 2 minutes of putting my makeup on in the morning and extremely greasy throughout the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, whenever I shower (be it morning or night), I apply this oil all over my body and a little on my hair afterwards and then dry off with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but my skin still felt a little dry</li>
            <li> It only took a few days to get to me with a few other things i had ordered.</li>
            <li> Often, over production on oil is caused by the use of harsh cleansers that over dry and stress out the skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have severe dark circles or puffiness but have annoying fine lines and moderate discoloration, this keeps it under control.</li>
            <li> After a bath when it is still a little wet</li>
            <li> I bought it because it claims to lighten dark undereye circles and blemishes, which I have both.</li>
            <li> This weekend I made the eye serum for crows feet and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles have gotten lighter.  </li>
            <li> Almond Oil works wonders on crow’s feet and dark circles.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the dark bottle packaging as it saves a step in finding another storage vessel.  </li>
            <li> The dark bottle will keep the oil fresher longer, and it comes with a stopper inside to keep contents from leaking out if it were to get turned over.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, my child tends to have dark circles under her eyes, and after placing this oil (no lotion dilute)  around the eye area, the dark circles have lessened.</li>
            <li> This oil will heal scars, improve your complexion leaving you with a radiant glow, moisturize, prevent split ends and repair already formed split ends, decrease dark circles and crows feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that its not organic, no seal on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Will order again because its organic cold pressed and economical.</li>
            <li> It was dark brown in color, and the bottle was not sealed.</li>
            <li> After I left my negative review, Molivera promptly commented on it (you can read it below).</li>
            <li> Using for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> My dark circles seem to have reduced a bit.</li>
            <li> one bottle should last at least 5 months.</li>
            <li> And my skin is oily and extremely sensitive, but this hasn&#x27;t broken me out.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my skin hair and add other oils!</li>
            <li> No more dry skin.</li>
            <li> it along with coconut oil and a few other ingredients in a homemade sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My skin feels a lot less taut and itchy since I started applying it</li>
            <li> I have been using if for about a week and a half now.</li>
            <li> I bought it to use on my Cocker Spaniel at the recommendation of a friend who owns a black Lab.</li>
            <li> If anything I have noticed a little less oil throughout the day.</li>
            <li> added bonus for me was opening the bottle to find it sealed with a tightly fitted &#x27;plug&#x27; vs. a foil &#x27;sticker&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I typically have combination skin with uneven sin tones.</li>
            <li> A little pricier than some of the others but the quality seems to make up for it.</li>
            <li> oil has basically no scent, and just a little goes</li>
            <li> The Bottle Is Dark To Help Preserve the Life of the oil!</li>
            <li> Used a little on my hair ends</li>
            <li> I used it after showering and my skin is like velvet with a little glow to it.</li>
            <li> I use it on my little one for massage.</li>
            <li> Oil does not works well on my face, I got little oily bumps.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> so well I decided to buy some for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot and the oil lasts few washes, instead of the &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34; washing off after one hand washing like all lotions.</li>
            <li> I put it on my hair ends to keep it from looking dried and needing a trim.</li>

            <li> Using it to make an oil infusion with dried calendula flowers.</li>
            <li> This product broke my skin out I used it on my face as well as body after a few days</li>
            <li> I even use it on my grandson for his missing hair</li>
            <li> I been using it all over my body for uneven skin tones (darker areas)</li>
            <li> I read that you should mix aloe with your oils before applying on your face if you have trouble with acne.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy or greasy..</li>
            <li> not happy- just like regular veget oil ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble getting all of the foundation off because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;24 hour&amp;#34; foundation.</li>
            <li> I feel like my time was wasted not once, but twice.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy like some oils.</li>
            <li> I wash my face every evening and apply a few drops of the oil afterwards, and I do that again in the mornings.</li>
            <li> It still does get oily a few hours into the day but</li>
            <li> My hair does seem thicker after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> but after a few seconds it went away.</li>
            <li> No strong nutty smell.</li>
            <li> I have also been using in my daughters curly hair to tame frizz.</li>
            <li> Even my husband (who is gruff and tough) wanted to put some on his hands that often dry and crack.</li>
            <li> However, I then ordered the Shea Butter- Molivera Organics Raw Shea Butter to mix with it</li>
            <li> We use it everyday for dry skin on ourselves and on our Jack Russell who suffers from dry skin.</li>
            <li> This has very little scent to it at all.</li>
            <li> except I&#x27;m not sure about the organic part since it is NOT USDA certified organic.</li>
            <li> the evening I use just a small pump of [[ASIN:B003JT4F3C</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> i dont want to open it or it will likely leak everywhere :(</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> I usually mix with a heavier oil in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I have also used small amounts of it in my hair before twisting it up and the oil adds moisture without making my hair oily.  </li>
            <li> I have even used a small amount on my hair to contain my frizz</li>
            <li> So I usually use a soap and microfiber towel.</li>
            <li> When I read the healing benefits that they provided I used that to heal a small pimple I had on my shoulder</li>
            <li> I had a small mishap with the shipping (which was amazon, not the seller) and the seller communicated with me, and replaced my damaged product.  </li>
            <li> I would have given this 5 stars, but I am not sure it is organic.</li>
            <li> Also I have allergies, blow my nose constantly, nose area can get dry and painful.</li>
            <li> Is this creamy or a hard lump that does not work well on skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be trying at least two of them</li>
            <li> It is just what you need for your delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> Not the least bit oily.</li>
            <li> i put that sucker everywhere</li>
            <li> Negative</li>
            <li> it is not greasy or oily (at least not on my skin)</li>
            <li> but it was too thick.</li>
            <li> Not too thick or too runny.</li>
            <li> I believe my oily skin will be no more!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy, but you do have to use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Seriously, you NEED to buy this oil.</li>
            <li> Has a subtle almond smell, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> but I like that this is all natural and not full of nasty stuff</li>
            <li> and then apply a thin layer of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Product arrived with broken cap.</li>
            <li> I recieved my oil with the cap completely broken so until i can find another cap for it</li>
            <li> But I was annoyed that the product is deceptively labelled.</li>
            <li> were my hair is thin.</li>
            <li> the cap was broken and a 1/3 of the contents was leaked all over the box.</li>
            <li> And I haven&#x27;t broken out at all.</li>
            <li> I have terrible cellulite and stretch mark all over my buttock my belly and my thigh, I don&#x27;t want to put my hopes high</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I had started using some other lotions and ended up with a terrible case of eczema under my right eye... and I mean it looked terrible...</li>
            <li> I bought it to make some homemade bug repellent (with lavender and eucalyptus essential oils)</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed or feel like you have wasted your money.</li>
            <li> weird smells on you</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Makes me a bit skeptical of its authenticity.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you have a cat, they will go crazy for this stuff.</li>
            <li> My son suffers from&lt;br /&gt;Exzema and since i&#x27;m using this oil it completly desapeared.</li>
            <li> I use this in my cold process soaps.</li>
            <li> Since it is cold pressed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t have any weird smell to it!</li>
            <li> This being the case, any leakage seems nearly impossible...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to bad</li>
            <li> I was completely frustrated and felt like I had no hope.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with Molivera Organics!!</li>
            <li> I am using it for a carrier base for a pre-shave oil.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It smells so good and it has done wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> Loving this Sweet Almond Oil. Very pure! Love the Bottle! And the price for the amount and quality is excellent!!!</li>
            <li> Shipping was really quick with molivera.  I can tell this is a high quality product from the first touch.  My only complaint is that I had hoped it would have an almond smell as some of the reviewers claimed the smell was great.  There was really no smell to this oil... no bad chemical or negative smell, but no sweet nice almond smell either.  Regardless, it will work great for lotions and for my face.</li>
            <li> We love this oil! I have a 9 year old son whose been struggling with an extreme case of eczema since he was 2 months old. His skin is scaly, rough, and itchy. We have tried every moisturizer we have seen/heard of and nothing seems to keep his skin moisturized. He is allergic to many things which include nuts, So I was hesitant about trying almond oil. Everything we buy has to be hypoallergenic However, he had no allergy reactions to this oil. It&#x27;s only been a few days but his skin feels smoother and he loves the way it makes his skin feel!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, promptly delivered, and carefully packaged.&lt;br /&gt;Molivera also offers helpful information regarding the history, science, and use of their oils.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great oil, it absorbs into skin quickly and leaves a soft feeling.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Good sized bottle, came very quickly, very mild smell (the comment about bitter vs sweet almond oil was very helpful). I use this in combination with coconut oil to wash my face using the Oil Cleansing Method and also mix it into body and face creams with Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for, great product! Arrived quickly, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful! This is exactly the carrier oil I need - organic, no solvents used in extraction, no adulteration, and full of all that&#x27;s good for you. We use this in place of lotion and as a carrier oil and just love it!</li>
            <li> Fast, perfect conditions, excellent product</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and so many uses. Shipped in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Molivera Sweet Almond Oil is simply great!! It makes my hair so soft and shiny. I use it on my face and body after taking shower. I am not using any kind of moisturizer after  I started using this oil. The best part is the quantity and perfect for the price. I am a big fan of sweet almond oil and I am glad that i found this particular brand. I am going to repurchase this oil once I am done with it. Definitely recommend you all if you want a healthy looking skin and lustrous hair...</li>
            <li> Very good on dry skin, I used it after a bath and it worked great and I my skin felt great.</li>
            <li> Making DIY body care products and also using it as a carrier oil for my essential oils. I love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this to use as a carrier oil for my essential oils. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, very sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve only used it a few days so far, but no burning, no peeling and I&#x27;ve noticed existing blemishes are healing faster with less irritation and deep bumps are finally coming to the surface. I&#x27;m already glad I made the switch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, this oil doesn&#x27;t smell oily and it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li> I use this on my arms and legs . Sometimes I put some in my bath.Feels good ! I got this for $1.00 so can&#x27;t beat that. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Light, sweet smelling, easily absorbable natural oil.  I am very satisfied with this product; it is exactly what I expected to purchase.  By itself it&#x27;s a great product, and in other household formulations it&#x27;s excellent.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I wash my face with it and my skin looks great. Warm you face with a ht, wet cloth for a few seconds, then wash it with Molivera Organics Sweet Almond oil. Then take your cloth and blot any spots that are naturally oily (I have very dry skin) and your skin looks nourished and glowing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!! I call this oil the anti aging oil.It make my skin so soft ! I used in my hair, face and all over my body after shower! Dry up fast. The oil is very light and not sticky at all. I mixed this oil with coconut oil.since i used this for my hair i dont have to struggle with dry icthy dundruff anymore. The oild did help my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet but I really like the follow-up email with additional information about use.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to try it tonight to remove make up</li>
            <li> Arrived on time,  bigger bottle than I expected.  I used it once so far and my skin stayed smooth.  I am very happy with my purchase.  Thank you :)</li>
            <li> Great oil. For your hair and skin, wouldn&#x27;t put it on your face if you have combo/oily skin. But great. Love it</li>
            <li> I have to say that this oil is one of the best! I love it and I will buy it again. I make&lt;br /&gt;a lot of homemade personal items like facial moisturizer, lip balm, body lotion and&lt;br /&gt;so much more and I use a lot of Sweet Almond Oil in my recipes for all my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great! You get your money&#x27;s worth and so much more because its TOPS!!</li>
            <li> I use this as a carrier oil for skin cleansing and I love it! It leaves my skin smooth and refreshed. I also use it on my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin and it has really helped his dry patches. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Thank you for getting it here so quickly,  I love it!</li>
            <li> I encountered sweet almond oil in a salon. It worked so well I decided to buy some for everyday use. Usually, I soak my hands in warm water, then apply sweet almond oil, then cover my hands in plastic gloves for ten minutes. Take the gloves off, gently massage my hands and enjoy the beauty!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell that great at all...</li>
            <li> Very happy with it...</li>
            <li> Will order again - really liked this product.</li>
            <li> Very good price and received quickly and was as described.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in excellent condition. I used it as an ingredient in my natural hair and skin mixtures.The inclusion of a rubber stopper inside the top keeps the oil fresh and prevents leaking during transport.This is definitely a repurchase item for me.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it for face,body, hair moisturizing for our whole family. Cured my daughter&#x27;s cradle cap. Put a few drops in the bath, leaves kids skin soft without having to chase them around to put &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; (usually a Molivera Shea butter and an almond oil blend) on them afterwards. This is my main carrier oil for my essential oils and use it in my homemade &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34; and moisturizers. I use it help treat my eczema and psoriasis. Was looking for a sweet almond oil that it is cold pressed so I am happy I found this one. A little pricier than some of the others but the quality seems to make up for it.</li>
            <li> Good sweet almond oil. I use this for my homemade hair products and my homemade skin products and it works great. A must have to have in your home. It gives my hair and skin a naturally healthy look. I love it.</li>
            <li> Received my product sooner than expected. Read great reviews, cant wait to try it out😁</li>

            <li> Love it it leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> this is really a good quality oil. The oil is absorbed immediately and I mix it with my shea butter. I like sweet almond oil because it traps my perfume longer on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great service great oil</li>
            <li> Molivera Sweet Almond Oil is by far one of the BEST products I&#x27;ve tried. I use the oil as a carrier for essential oil application on myself and my family. The Molivera Sweet Almond Oil feels smooth and non greasy on my skin and leaves my skin soft and healthy.</li>

            <li> I love it! I have been using it for face and body and received a complete body massage with this oil. I  greatly prefer it to almond oil ( not sweet), particularly for the face, as it is not as heavy, and absorbs much better!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it a 6 star rating if it was in glass, I immediately transferred the oil to a brown glass bottle. It is well worth getting!!</li>
            <li> Love it....soft and smooth, not oily.</li>

            <li> Love this product..the company is wonderful to work.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to use in a recipe to make a homemade &amp;#34;vapor rub&amp;#34; with essential oils. I haven&#x27;t done that yet but I&#x27;ve used it as a face moisturizer and LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Sweet Almond Oil awesome on skin. If you spent money on other skin products stop wasting your money and try sweet almond oil. You won&#x27;t be disappointed or feel like you have wasted your money.</li>

            <li> Excellent quality and my skin feels soft , love the sweet almond oil !</li>
            <li> Great product. Five Stars....</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s acne prone, and I love this almond oil!! It doesn&#x27;t smell, it&#x27;s not supposed to. I love how it absorbs into my skin and how soft my skin feels. I wash my hands a lot and the oil lasts few washes, instead of the &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34; washing off after one hand washing like all lotions. I put it on my hair ends to keep it from looking dried and needing a trim. I&#x27;m gonna try making a face mask with it and honey next :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! So many uses, will definatly buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, works wonderful as a carrier oil for my Young Living essential oils.</li>
            <li> Interesting, it is called sweet almond oil, I tasted it and it has no flavor.  That is good I plan to use it as a massage oil.</li>
            <li> Love the product and great packaging. I ordered some other types of oil with this and they leaked in their packaging bag.  This bottle had an extra plug in the neck to prevent that, love it!</li>
            <li> Worder full product. Smooth, high quality.  Will buy from again!</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying this product.  I bought it thinking that it will smell delicious as some other almonds products I have used before.  Even though it has no smell at all I start using every day after my shower, I apply it directly to my skin while is still wet and its great ! !  I will definitely continue using it.</li>
            <li> So far I like the almond oil. It has a very light fragrance and really makes my face so soft. It isn&#x27;t greasy, but you do have to use a very small amount. It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Oil....I made my Violet oil with this &amp; it came out fantastic...will be buying more from this ...A+++++Seller</li>
            <li> I have used it in a few of my recipes and have enjoyed the results.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!  Great fragance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using you&#x27;re sweet almond oil as a carrier oil with some essential oils in a roll on. Its a very nice oil thank you for the information on the oil in the email as I learned a lot more about it and now want to try it on my face also! I thought it would have a stronger scent but it might be just great but Im dealing with sinus issues, &amp; I  can&#x27;t smell much.</li>
            <li> I use this as a gentle cleanser when I wake-up in the morning (after using an alpha-hydroxy cleansing system at night) - it smells terrific, is non-irritating and surprisingly non-greasy. Am loving it!</li>
            <li> I needed a carrier oil for my essential oils other than fractionated coconut, because I am allergic to it. After doing some reading, sweet almond seemed the best bed. Molivera Sweet Almond oil is wonderful! I am not allergic to it! But even beyond that, this pure oil is packaged wonderfully. The tinted bottle keeps the oil away from harsh light and it comes with an awesome second, internal cap that means I can travel with the bottle without worry of leakage.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and in perfect condition.I started using it 5 days ago. I have terrible cellulite and stretch mark all over my buttock my belly and my thigh, I don&#x27;t want to put my hopes high but I am determined to do the right thing for my body. I dry brush my skin before showering, I apply the sweet almond oil, oh my! My skin is so soft. I think the bottle will last me a month or two if not more. I started putting it on my hair as well. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and absorbs so quick. I have natural kinky hair and I sometimes use a flat iron to straighten it. After I applied it that day after having used the pool my hair was so soft and so manageable still even wet. I just want to try my best to keep this up. I know I&#x27;ll see more results if I am consistent.</li>
            <li> The oil is very nice.  It ws great in my homemade body butter</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Would def buy again!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil!!! There are just a few products I have discovered for my skincare over the years, that I cannot live without - this is one of them! Seriously, you NEED to buy this oil. I am a 25 year old with very picky, sensitive skin and oily T-zone. I&#x27;ve been trying to find the right products for my skin type for years and nothing ever worked, until I was so fed up with spending hundreds of dollars on expensive cream moisturizers and various cleansers and decided if nothing really works, I might as well just buy some cheap products and stop wasting my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was one of the products I opted to give a try to. Partly because of already great reviews and partly because I wanted to try something a natural for a change instead of the typical great smelling but overpriced moisturizers and creams. I had just recently made a change in my skin cleaning  regiment (see below) and all of the products worked great, but I wanted to find a moisturizer I could use that would fit right in with the rest of my new routine. Well, it looks like I found it! The condition of my skin improved drastically, and I would have never believed it would be possible with such cheap products. At first I used this oil just on my face, but after I saw how gentle and non greasy it was, I started using it all over my body after shower as well as the tips of my hair to moisturize it a bit. Before this I used coconut oil for my hair, but it would leave it very greasy and I would have to wash my hair before going out, but with this oil, I actually apply it to my hair right after getting out of the shower - now thats a world of difference. Best thing about this oil, is that it is considered all purpose - as in you can cook with it, put it on your face, put it on your hair, your feet, your hands - it will make whatever surface you apply this to feel baby soft! Oh, and you can also use it as a make-up remover!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil has basically no scent, and just a little goes a long way andmakes your skin feel amazing. Also, if you have a cat, they will go crazy for this stuff. I was petting my cat after using it the first night, and she started licking my hands and then tried to lick my face. I quickly went to Google the toxicity level of this oil to cats, but it turned out that sweet almond oil is just fine to them. Some people even use a drop or two of this oil in their cat&#x27;s food to make them eat it if they are picky. However, only Sweet Almond Oil is not toxic to cats, make sure you DO NOT give your cats bitter almond oil because it has some sort of poisons. Bitter almond oil is darker, smells more like almonds, and is considered an essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall regiment I made a switch to and it has worked wonders for my skin type:&lt;br /&gt;In the morning I use the [[ASIN:B00K3YFW9M St. Ives Blackhead Clearing Green Tea Scrub, 6 Oz.]]. Every other day I use the scrub together with the [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]] Brush, (I use only the brush, not the cleanser that comes in the kit) and it has really helped minimize the size and appearance of the pores and blackheads on my nose and cheeks. Instead of moisturizer I then apply a tiny bit of this Sweet Almond oil and after a few minutes I apply [[ASIN:B001FYZAWS Elta MD UV Shield SPF 45 Oil-Free 7 oz.]] which helps my skin stay protected from the harmful UV rays all day long without clogging my pores or running down my face when it&#x27;s humid (I live in Florida).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the evening I use just a small pump of [[ASIN:B003JT4F3C Naturally Clear Green Tea Cleanser By St.Ives, 6.75 Ounce]] and then apply a thin layer of [[ASIN:B00K7HVHYE HC3 - Extremely potent triple action 10% Vitamin C serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a powerful Superfruit Anti-Oxidant 1oz.]] complex which also made a positive difference in appearance and radiance of my skin, and finally, when I am done, I just put another small dab of Sweet Almond Oil on my face instead of a cream moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, whenever I shower (be it morning or night), I apply this oil all over my body and a little on my hair afterwards and then dry off with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;This regiment has done a world of difference for my face, and I hope if someone decides to give it a try - it will help you as well</li>
            <li> A blessed oil that works! I use it on my hair and it makes my skin look good and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this product from Molivera Organics! I&#x27;m using it as a carrier oil for my Young Living essential Oils. I use it on my face with lavender or purification, and it&#x27;s excellent. It&#x27;s helped keep my skin clear as opposed to using harsh chemicals to do so.</li>
            <li> Love this product! A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s made my skin and hair so much healthier.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. The difference ORGANIC, COLD PRESSED oil makes is priceless. I received my package expeditiously and packaged with the utmost care. Definitely repurchasing from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product, and am just now learning all the different uses.  I have super sensitive skin and I really like the way this oil is absorbed into my skin without the usual itchiness I experience after using other products.  Now, don&#x27;t take this to the bank, but I accidentally spilled a bit of this oil on my wooden coffee table, wiped it up with an old t-shirt, and it looked so great, I used it on the whole top.  mmmmm, could this be another use??</li>
            <li> Nice oil, absorbs easily into skin. Great to use with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!  This is the second bottle I have purchased from Molivera Organics and I will continue to purchase from them.</li>
            <li> it feels great in my skin, I have used it for my hair once to prevent hair loss and made my hair so soft to touch.  Also applied this oil to my skin irritation in my hand. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Once again not disappointed in Molivera .. perfect scent cant wait to use it in a lotion base with EO&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Product arrived with broken cap. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very awesome stuff and great quality! I was very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> Received my almond oil quickly and it was just what I wanted, Am very happy with the product!! Thanks</li>
            <li> I am mighty pleased with the Sweet Almond Oil from Molivera Organics. It is of High quality and I used it to make sugar scrub. I already purchased second one of the same and will be buying more from this seller. They also shared some very good recipes of using almond oil for various applications.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into making my own products.  Good product.</li>
            <li> The order arrived on time and I used the sweet almond oil to make lotion bars.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love what this does for my skin and hair!</li>
            <li> Love this oil...and the great suggestions they send about how to use it!</li>
            <li> Ive just bought this oil,  &amp; I already love it.  Its very light, &amp; moisturizes very well. I love it!!😍💋💋💋</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it on my skin and on my baby&#x27;s skin. Also a great hair oil. Light and great for so many things.</li>
            <li> Love the Sweet Almond oil! It makes my hair shiny my skin soft! It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t have any weird smell to it! It comes in a nice big bottle too! I&#x27;ll be ordering more before my bottle is finished.</li>
            <li> Very nice fresh almond oil.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, as advertised!</li>
            <li> Excellent!  I use it on my hair and skin.  I think I can actually see my skin tone evening out after using it for a couple of weeks.  And my skin is oily and extremely sensitive, but this hasn&#x27;t broken me out.  Same for me with pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Only thing I would change is ditch the plastic and put it in glass</li>
            <li> This is a great value for this oil.  I have used others that cost more than twice as much and feel this is just as good as Eden&#x27;s Gardens and better than any others I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s not overly oily and it is virtually odorless.  It mixes well with essential oils or can be used as is for massages, baths, make-up remover, or skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great oil, plus molivera include  tips for usage  i really enjoy this thanks so much...</li>
            <li> Lovely product. No smell. Great for nails too.</li>
            <li> Order fulfillment was prompt. The oil is a new experience, but so far I&#x27;m very pleased. I&#x27;m using it for facial cleansing, which is awesome, and moisturizing all over, which seems as good as any moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;The Company has been very attentive with some good information and hints. They&#x27;ve made it feel like it&#x27;s more than just a purchase, they want customers to be satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil. It&#x27;s a great value and leaves my dry skin so soft and smooth. Really helps fine lines too. I use this by itself but I also use it in my own natural body butter blend. It works great  and just what my dry skin needed. Forget all those chemicals manufacturers put into lotions, body butters etc. Get creative and make your own all natural chemical free oils, body butters and lotions. Your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li> On time and good quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner for the hair</li>
            <li> I expected it to have a nice fragrance, but it is odorless.  So, I mixed some sandlewood and vanilla oil in and made an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying the almond oil.  It arrived on time and in great condition. It is easy to use (has a flip top). No more dry skin.</li>
            <li> Tried it&lt;br /&gt; Liked it. Works great iny product!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love the almond oil. Put it a skin cream I make</li>
            <li> I used this oil in combination with cocoa butter and shea butter to make my homemade body butter. Such a nice combination with all three. Although you could use this on its on to smooth your dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> I am about a year and a half new to the community of essential oils and many natural and/or organic products.  I can&#x27;t understand why I didn&#x27;t learn this stuff from my elders long ago!  What a life changer!  Of all the butters and oils and such, my number one favorite is SWEET ALMOND OIL.  It does so much more than all the lotions, creams and moisturizers I used before.  It is so gentle, amazingly versatile and very effective alone or whipped into a moisturizing recipe.  I won&#x27;t do without it- I keep back-ups so I never run out.  This oil has replaced a LOT of my old products and saved me a ton of money AND does a better job than what I once purchased off the store shelves.  I am completely hooked.  And thank you to Molivera Organics for sending tips and recipes for use!  I&#x27;ll be trying at least two of them this very evening.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great service including pre-shipping introduction and follow-up tips for usage. That&#x27;s super customer service and belief in their product! I gave been using the sweet almond oil for almost a week and am enjoying it. I&#x27;m not noticing and remarkable effects at this point, but I like it.</li>
            <li> Got my order the very next day. Great job thank you.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve added it to my recipes for homemade body butters --and I use it on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Got this for use on my dog. I use Castor Oil to eliminate mites, and stop itch and infection. The Castor Oil works great for that, but it is drying to the skin. I now add this sweet almond oil to the mix (half and half) and I get the benefits of the Castor Oil, and the SAO offsets the dryness and makes my dogs skin moist and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for dog lovers info: I add a few drops of Lavender Essential Oil and Lemongrass Essential oil to my oil mix and it really knocks down mites and repels fleas. Also super relaxes my dog when she has been stressed by being under attack by critters.</li>
            <li> Works great. I put it on my skin while I&#x27;m still wet in the shower. It soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
            <li> Rewceived ahead of schedule. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this oil!! thank you so much for the great products! I would definitely recommend this to all my friends!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Great price for quality and quantity.</li>
            <li> Bought to make organic, homemade body wash.... It has 100% surpassed its main job! I have used it in my hair, on my skin, in my food - it is fantastic! Plan to continue making more homemade items with it.</li>
            <li> I apply it for a preshampoo treatment and it leaves my hair soft and manageable...really like will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> very light oil. no real smell to it which is great because I use it with EO&#x27;s. It was priced right. Item arrived in record time. It was as described. I have ordered it before and really like it.</li>
            <li> wow, i really do love this.  my skin feels amazing, and i LOVE the concept of nothing bad going on it - its only one thing:  almond oil.  It absorbs quickly and while i wish it smelled like patchouli or sandlewood,  it occurs to me i could probably mix my own oils in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week, but it seems very gentle on my skin.  The company is very proactive in sharing information and tips about how to use and store their products. I would definitely purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Will definitely order on a regular basis.  I use it on my face every day and I get so many compliments on my complexion it&#x27;s amazing.  I&#x27;m 50+ years old and strangers stop me in the grocery store to ask me what I use on my face.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed! Massage oil mixed with EO&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase, I&#x27;m currently using it with few other ingredients to make a body lotion. It&#x27;s working great so far !!</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Received my order in a timely manner and it was exactly how the company describes it! Look forward to purchasing this brand of almond oil again!</li>
            <li> Great for skin but the main reason I got it was to mix with caster oil and sesame oil for scalp and hair. Have used the combo once and it was pretty effective. Will try to use every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a little while.  It is moisturizing and absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;ll come back and update this review when I wake up with my 25 year old skin.  Lol</li>
            <li> I love this Sweet Almond Oil. I use it everyday! I put it in my DIY lotions, salves, and hair treatments. Wonderful! Will definitely be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> Product was purchased to use in oil mixture for my hair.  It was delivered as scheduled.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product</li>
            <li> Very nice product at a great price.</li>
            <li> When you order this, make sure you don&#x27;t order ANYTHING that can be ruined by oil spillage.  My almond oil came with some baby onesies I was gifting and 3&amp;#34; transfer tape, everything got soiled with oil.. took a photo wven for proof</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my 2 year old (instead of lotion), who has extremely sensitive skin.  (If I use the wrong free and clear laundry detergent, she breaks out in a whole-body rash.  Her skin is that sensitive.)  The Sweet Almond Oil from Molivera worked excellently on her - no rash, absorbs quickly, and moisturizes very well!  I&#x27;m integrating it into my own beauty/ health care regimen as well - using it on my face and body in place of other moisturizers with lots of chemicals and much higher in cost.  Great product!</li>

            <li> I love this oil it good for my hair and skin,love the results</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!!!!!  I combine almond oil jojopa and seaweed and few other natural products together and the result for my skin has been the best I have ever came across for reducing or even eliminating. Thank you so much!!!! Very healing going to use on rest of my skin.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I love this organic oil! I bought it to help with growing my hair. And the smell is not overy powering. Wish the bottle was BPA free!</li>
            <li> The oil arrived quickly and I am enjoying using the easy-opening bottle.  It feels smooth and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> Product arrived packaged so that it would not spill.  Great product.</li>
            <li> great product great price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Wonderful carrier oil for essential oils. Softens and moisturizes skin without greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Great product! Adding 1 or 2 drops to hair while shampooing really does a big difference. Leaves hair beautiful, soft and shiny! Great quality product and loved the excellent customer service. Would definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I used this particular oil very little so far but it appears to be what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have not used this oil yet. I purchased this to ensure keeping the right ingredients on hand to make lotions and potions for myself and others. However, I really like the Molivera company for shipping my order promptly and following up to check on my satisfaction. They also sent an email with usage recipes. Lovely. However, this is not organic almond oil to my knowledge.  Update: I repurchased this oil because it is the best that I have found after trying several other brands. It absorbs as well as jojoba oil. Will continue to repurchase.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much, received my Oil today,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow!  thats quick.&lt;br /&gt;Im thrilled, so professional and amazing follow up and&lt;br /&gt;care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again, I will be looking through your site for more things,&lt;br /&gt;and more oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Gratitude,&lt;br /&gt;Deb</li>
            <li> It was as described and working well in my own formula for lotion! I used this as a base with other ingredients and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> Best multi-purpose oil on Amazon (to date.)  Does everything - from cosmetic removal to total after shower body moisturizer.  A little goes a long way.  Great price and value.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I use it for my hair, face and body, i also like the ivory shea butter.</li>
            <li> This oil is my new go-to body lotion, hair oil and lip balm. Also use it as a mild, natural but effective laxative for my toddler who has chronic constipation, and it really works. Sweet almond oil is recommended as a natural laxative in Ayurveda the ancient Indian science of health. Because it is food grade and hexane free, I trust it for oral consumption.</li>
            <li> Great price, arrive on time and safely packaged.  The oil is perfect to use as a carrier with my essential oils or alone for massage and as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! It absorbs well, I use it fresh out of the shower... a little goes a long way. I also love using it on my face at night♡</li>
            <li> Product came w/o safety cap and oil was all over the package the little I did salvage was very nice! Returned</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil bc I read it is what French women use for stretch marks. In my case it didn&#x27;t work, but otherwise I&#x27;m sure the product is fine.</li>
            <li> Great products.  Soaks in quickly</li>
            <li> I am happily surprised as to how it helps my dry skin. I have tried so many products in the past and this really works the best. and one of the best parts is that a little bit of it goes a long way.I highly recommend it.....</li>
            <li> I recieved my oil with the cap completely broken so until i can find another cap for it i dont want to open it or it will likely leak everywhere :( looks like it will be a great oil though!</li>
            <li> Molivera Organics&#x27; Sweet Almond Oil is absolutely perfect for massage. My husband has RA and has significant pain in his feet. I originally tried a different type oil but it was too thick. We did some research and found that Molivera&#x27;s Sweet Almond Oil was recommended by massage therapists. Its consistency for massage is wonderful and very easy to work with which means its also easy for the masseuse. I add a few drops of peppermint essential oil to the almond oil for its soothing properties.  We are both very grateful to have found this oil and will continue to use it in the future!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it and will buy again!  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to make body and facial cream.  It blended well with shea butter and coconut oil.  I just started using the cream and it is too soon to tell if it will replace my current beauty products.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast in the mail and is a great size for the price I love using it I use it in my hair great for any scalp problems and smells good</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful product! Great company</li>
            <li> I am enjoying using the almond oil.I used for my hair as a pre-poo with peppermint oil every week before I wash my hair.I also used the oil for hair oil for my hair and for my body.The company has made contact with me to see if I like the product and gives additional information on the uses of the oil.That means a lot to me.</li>
            <li> Product is great. The lid was cracked and some of the oil leaked into the rest of the package.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be on the dry side.  I wanted to try this oil on my skin right out of the shower while I was still wet.  My skin feels quite soft and smooth.  I&#x27;d recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> Received intact.  Well packaged.  The more I read about this product, the more I like it, not just as a carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I immediately applied to hands, skin, hair and face and noticed a remarkable difference. My dry hair ends became soft and shiny, my hands and face felt like silk and my nail beds shine.. The product is non greasy and a little goes a long way...try it you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I was going to give this 3 stars because it took forever to arrive.  However, I&#x27;ve been using it as a moisturizer after cleansing my face and I love it.  In the last month I have had significantly fewer break-outs, even despite the regular hormonal fluctuations that women endure.  My skin has always been soft but now it is silky.  I have recently purchased organic shea butter, which I mix with the almond oil and use on my entire body and hair.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Not only did I receive a great product,  but also wonderful information on the benefits and uses for this product! From the onset of the order to the follow-up after receipt, this company shows concern for my satisfaction.  Rare these days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for about 2wks and so far I am pleased. I bought it because it claims to lighten dark undereye circles and blemishes, which I have both. I haven&#x27;t noticed any lightening, but I have noticed softer skin. I use it at night so my skin can soak it up. I have oily facial skin and have no excess oil from using this on my face. If anything I have noticed a little less oil throughout the day. I will keep using for MY intended purpose and highly recommends.</li>
            <li> This is great oil and at a reasonable price.  I also got an Email from Molivera explaining what the oil can be used for.  It was very helpful!</li>
            <li> My skin loves this product! I use it all over. I arrived quickly. All good.</li>
            <li> Just got it and used it last night on hands and face.  Much better than coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I love this Sweet Almond Oil by Molivera Organics.There is no smell and although I bought it to mix with essential oils, I use it plain without oils on my hands as a softener.</li>
            <li> Very good. my baby&#x27;s skin is very soft</li>
            <li> love the oil, I use it mainly for my arms, legs and hands. I wash my hands a lot because of my job and it tends to be very dry. The almond oil  keeps it from drying out, and its not greasy. Also I have allergies, blow my nose constantly, nose area can get dry and painful. Almond oil to the rescue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almond oil for years. I have very dry skin so use the oil for cleansing and moisturizing. This product is great from the product to the oil contained in the bottle. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. My skin feels very soft after using.</li>
            <li> I have use the Sweet Almond oil in many things. For the first time I made my our body butter. I used the Sweet Almond oil in stead of other oils you can use and O my God my skin is so soft and it went on so smooth. The oil just soaked in and left no sticky feeling.  Molivera Organics sent me an email and gave me many suggestions on how you can us the sweet almond oil. This weekend I made the eye serum for crows feet and dark circles.  My dark circles have gotten lighter.  I included some ways you can use the Sweet Almond oil. You need to try their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavish Sweet Almond Oil Body Butter&lt;br /&gt;Homemade body butter is widely known as the best skin moisturizer. Mix 1 cup of Molivera Organics Raw African Ivory Shea Butter with 1/3 cup Molivera Organics Sweet Almond Oil mixed with 6 drops of each of your favorite essential oils. Whip together. Shea Butter is very moisturizing, anti-aging, and is great for healing scars and reducing stretch marks. After your shower, gently massage your butter into your face and body daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honey Sweet Almond Oil Hair Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Almond Oil is excellent on a variety of hair styles. With continued use, Molivera Organics Sweet Almond Oil will condition and grow your hair, bringing luster and smoothness to dry damaged hair. Mix equal parts organic raw honey and your sweet almond oil and a few drops of your favorite essential oil. Leave on hair for 30 mins. Rinse thoroughly and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Almond Oil Cellulite Scrub&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Almond Oil is great for body scrubs. Mix equal parts ground coffee, sea salt, brown sugar, and Sweet Almond Oil together. Caffeine firms the skin, reducing the look of Cellulite, while the sea salt and brown sugar exfoliate, and the Oil moisturizes. While in the shower, gently massage skin with this mix twice a week on desired areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almond Eye Serum&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Almond Oil works wonders on crow’s feet and dark circles. It is just what you need for your delicate eye area. Simply mix equal parts Molivera Organics Sweet Almond Oil with equal parts aloe vera gel. Apply gently around eye area 1-2 times daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Molivera Sweet Almond Oil for about a week, and I absolutely love it!  It has simplified my beauty routine tremendously: I apply in the morning as my moisturizer and my skin stays hydrated all day.  Although, this is called an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t be put off from trying it!  It absorbs quickly and does not leave you looking or feeling like a greasy mess!  I&#x27;m noticing diminished fine lines, dark circles and improved texture.  I appreciate the dark bottle packaging as it saves a step in finding another storage vessel.  I&#x27;m sold on this product and will be reordering for my daughters!  I work in chemical sales with my largest customers among the &amp;#34;who&#x27;s who&amp;#34; of premium skin care, so I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of time researching ingredients and product formulas.  Let&#x27;s just say I won&#x27;t be forking over $100+ on &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; elixir restorative products any more!  What could be better for you than a single, natural ingredient that is also ingestible?</li>

            <li> We used this for our new found love of creating bath bombs. The rests were very positive as our skin was so soft!</li>
            <li> These are good products and the seller not only stands behind them but is committed to total customer satisfaction. They even offer tips to extend the shelf life of the products. They also follow up on the shipment.</li>
            <li> I love love love this oil. I use it for an all over body lotion as well as for a carrier lotion for my doTera oils . My skin is glowing. Not the least bit oily.

            <li> Made an organic cream - love this oil!</li>
            <li> very great oil, smells neutral but nice, is soft and light so great for massages. Use it for hair, scars, and as a makeup remover and love how soft I am!</li>
            <li> tutto bene, alla prossima</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for. It works very well as a carrier oil for my essential oils. I have found several uses for it. I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this oil with my Young Living essential oils!</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot! I use it mainly for my natural hair for moister.  I received the shipment promptly and enjoy shipper&#x27;s extensive emails on additional product usage tips.</li>
            <li> I recently received it. I am just starting to use it. So far so good. I will post more details in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Great product! I bought this to make beard oil, but it has so many other uses! Fast delivery and great customer service from this company!</li>
            <li> The product was great and delivered very fast. Thanks Molivera!</li>
            <li> This oil is fabulous!  It has a very light scent. I absorbs nicely and leaves a little shine. It conditions wonderfully.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Nice oil, makes for a great carrier oil or a good all around body oil, many applications.  The dark bottle will keep the oil fresher longer, and it comes with a stopper inside to keep contents from leaking out if it were to get turned over.</li>
            <li> Excellent sweet almond oil. I have seen an improvement in my dry crusty feet in just three days of using this oil. It is very light and easily absorbed into my skin. I also like that the bottle has a plug in the top so I don&#x27;t need to worry about accidental spills while I travel.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long but so far so good.  I Use it for hair by itself and on skin in a mixture.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Use this on my face daily! I use this as a carrier oil with my essential oils. No longer use moisturizer on my face. I typically have combination skin with uneven sin tones. Almond oil has changed the look and feel of my face. Love it, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Item received very quickly, on time as promised. High quality, actually, excellent quality oil! It feels amazing and has no scent I can tell.  A little goes a long way, I will definitely reorder from this seller!!!</li>
            <li> I have only praise for this oil. I discovered it accidently and I&#x27;m glad I did. Just love, love, love this oil</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the information on Sweet almond oil.  I wondered if it was an essential oil in such a big bottle.  I am putting it on my nails to see if it will help because my nails are splitting vertically and I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> Great oil. Not too thick or too runny. Having Santa Ana winds this week and my skin is not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and is a great product.  I use a couple times a day on my hands and nails. Noticed the difference in a couple days</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this sweet almond oil! I have used coconut and jojoba oil for years on my face, but now prefer the sweet almond oil because it actually feels like it moisturizes much better than the other two oils during our cold and dry winters of MN.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this oil because I had just removed my eyelash extensions. They recommended I apply almond oil to my eyelashes to promote growth. This product has been a pleasant surprise. I have also started using it on my hair and skin. It leaves my hair shiny and silky. It also serves as a nice night time moisturizer, especially during these winter months. I highly recommend it. Plus, the company has been super sweet. Very fast delivery, the oil was packaged perfectly and all was perfect!</li>
            <li> Amazing oil.!&lt;br /&gt;Have seen amazing results on several people with this brand!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m loving it so far!!</li>
            <li> A staple in my home beauty products.</li>
            <li> My son suffers from&lt;br /&gt;Exzema and since i&#x27;m using this oil it completly desapeared. Could not be happier!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and great customer service!!!!</li>
            <li> Love for this product. I am using it for a carrier base for a pre-shave oil.  Now that Molivera wrote me on some of the tips of using it for other purposes,  I am excited.</li>
            <li> This oil absorbed very quickly into my skin when I applied especially on my face. It gave my skin a natural glow and hide all of my fine wrinkles. I will be purchasing more when I run out. This company has emailed my twice so far with helpful tips which I thought was awesome.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Will definitely purchase again. I love that I received emails making sure I was satisfied and was given recipes and tips for use. Great customer care.</li>
            <li> Great skin oil. I am using it for cleansing my face and dab a bit under my eyes and have noticed that I am losing some puffiness below the eyes. So I think I will try it on my eyelids to see if I can see some changes.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I used it to make organic sunscreen and  body lotion.  Thanks Molivera Organics!  I give this product a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! I use it as a massage oil and also as a total body moisturizer, works great on my hair too! My husband and son use it as well. Will definitely purchase again from this supplier!</li>
            <li> VERY NICE, AND IT GOT HERE QICKLY!</li>
            <li> Just received my oil today and made my first homemade foaming soap.  I used just 2 tsp. of the almond oil, 2 TB lavender-scented Castile soap, and filled the rest of the way with water.  Great stuff! Can&#x27;t wait to try the almond oil with my essential oils as well.</li>
            <li> Great product delivered fast</li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions and oils over the years but by far this is the best oil I have tried so far. The scent is very subtle and is not strong or overwhelming. The glide is probably one of the best as a little drop of this oil goes a long way and with the amount of oil you get in this bottle it should last you a very long time. I have also noticed that even after use and showering, my skin still stays smooth for days. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great oil at a fair price. Has a subtle almond smell, not too overpowering. I use this in my cold process soaps. I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Just what I was expecting. All bottled, no leak. Even a follow up email about the oils benefits.</li>
            <li> I love this - it feels so good on my skin and absorbs nicely. I bought it to make some homemade bug repellent (with lavender and eucalyptus essential oils) but I think I will be using it for other things too. Also, great price!</li>
            <li> Love it! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I do not know what to compare it to, but I really like the product.</li>
            <li> This oil is just as it looks.  My only concern is that it does not have any type of a tamper proof seal, and in this day and age some type of seal is expected.  It does have a thimble inside to prevent leaking but that is not tamper proof.</li>
            <li> I love it! Definitely going to be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;Used it along with coconut oil and a few other ingredients in a homemade sunscreen. Smells amazing</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Soaks in and is not oily on my face. Is not causing acne or blackheads.  Love it all over.  Skin is so soft.  No fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is it... I am sticking with this miracle oil for The Rest of My Life!!!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered the Sweet Almond Oil by Molivera Organics and it arrived very quickly and I love that they had a plastic stopper at the top to completely prevent spills. The oil is very good quality and I use it in my hair (sweet almond oil is the best oil for my hair thus far), on my face to remove my make up, on my body and my razor before I shave (super close shave and no nicks), and in the whipped shea body butter I make. Very please with the price, the size and the oil it&#x27;s self. Will continue to buy unless I find another oil that is as good, organic and cheaper. So far I have not. I do like this company though and will keep them as a trusted go to.</li>
            <li> Great product, prompt delivery. Using it to make an oil infusion with dried calendula flowers.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after looking up a very well reviewed organic eye make up remover. I found out the ingredients and saw it was one single ingredient, almond oil. So I found this product after a search of high quality affordable almond oil. I did not want to review until after I have used it for a while. I absolutely love it. It must be very pure oil with no distillate because there is no residue. This means very pure and high quality. The smell is very subtle but good. The seller was very helpful and sent some great ideas on how to use the product. I am very happy with the product and service.</li>
            <li> A great additive to my home made skin care products!</li>
            <li> Order went perfectly.</li>
            <li> Sweet almond oil has really done wonders for my skin, I use it as a face cleanser (OCM). My skin feels soft, moisturized, clean, and healthy! This has really calmed my rosacea! Definitely going to continue to use and purchase again in the future</li>
            <li> Love this almond oil. I use it after showers and on my nails for softness and to keep everything soft.</li>
            <li> I use this product with standard Jergens lotion to add a luxurious feel and longevity to my husband&#x27;s back massages.&lt;br /&gt;My husband works out several days a week and usually has sore muscles, so I make an effort to massage him any chance I get. One evening,  unbeknownst to him, I added this the Sweet Almond Oil to our standard lotion, and VIOLA -- he was instantly transported into another realm and wondered how I managed to provide the best massage ever. My husband was absolutely thrilled with this product addition to our massage routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, my child tends to have dark circles under her eyes, and after placing this oil (no lotion dilute)  around the eye area, the dark circles have lessened. I&#x27;m sure it will be just a matter of weeks until they completely diminish. The Sweet Almond Oil is very gentle on the skin and adds great moisture. I&#x27;m very pleased and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Great Sellers! Good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  It is exactly what it says it is and I&#x27;m using it as a face and body moisturizer.  Customer service also followed up with some tips and even answered a question I had.  If I were to make one improvement it would be to use a glass container but i expect some people don&#x27;t want glass bottles in the bathroom and it would also make shipping more expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful oil. We use it everyday for dry skin on ourselves and on our Jack Russell who suffers from dry skin. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My daughter selected this item. She seems happy with it and uses it regularly for her skin, mainly the scalp, with the combination of other oils.</li>
            <li> It got here right on time. I suffer from really dry skin I have only been using this for a couple of days but in love how it makes my skin feel so soft and it absorbs quickly too. Love this oil.</li>
            <li> I am using this oil for face moisturizer.  It is great! I had been having sensitivity issues with high end commercial moisturizers so I thought I would try a basic oil.  My skin looks wonderful with no irritation.  It soaks in quickly.  I am quite happy with the oil.</li>
            <li> This oil is a perfect carrier oil for my essential oils.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I received it very fast and was extremely satisfied. five stars. I shared the oil with my sister</li>
            <li> I bought this a carrier oil for making natural insect repellent for myself and my dog, and it is working great. I am going to try a few more of the companies suggestions for using the sweet almond oil in shower and beauty routines. They placed a red stopper in the top of the bottle under the cap to help prevent leaking; I thought this was really thoughtful. I will use this company in the future for other products that interest me.</li>
            <li> I use this to massage my legs before bedtime in order to reduce my restless legs syndrome. Any kind of lotion or oil would work but I like that this is all natural and not full of nasty stuff and it&#x27;s great for moisturizing too. If your looking for the almond smell you won&#x27;t get it with the sweet oil as this is. I really don&#x27;t notice any smell at all so some people might like that.</li>
            <li> I use almond oil on my legs every night  before putting on aloe. My skin tone is better than it was ten years ago.</li>
            <li> Stop using all other moisturizers. I even mix it with my foundation.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  Making my own cuticle oils and used this as one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This oil is simply amazing!  My skin has reacted very well to it and rewards me with softer better hydrated skin all over.  I will definitely be buying this product again and recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, it is really hydrating!</li>
            <li> Good quality - will buy again.</li>
            <li> I just received this oil and have used it for two days, I love it!  My skin is so much softer.  I have little bumps, like goosebumps on my upper arm and I tried a cream they was specifically for that problem, it did not smell very good, plus did not work, after two uses of the sweet almond oil, I can feel a difference in my skin, the bumps are a lot smaller.  This oil soaks in fast so that you don&#x27;t walk around feeling oily, and like you cannot touch anything.  I would definitely recommend this oil, in fact I am going to purchase a second bottle just to make sure I have it on hand at all time.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this Sweet Almond Oil because I loved my experience the first time. I use it on my hair, face, body, and my homemade body scrubs and moisturizing butters. So far I love it and the way it softens my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but i thought I would take the time to do it for the sweet almond oil, I did alot of research before deciding to purchase the oil for my skin and hair im really into natural things and this oil is really awesome for everything i need for my skin i received my order fairly quick and i started using it asap! My skin feels so soft and smooth i put that sucker everywhere im in love thanks so much, and a really big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil and feels great on my skin.  I have very sensitive skin and this oil has actually made my skin feel much better.</li>
            <li> it actually works on my dark cycles on my eyes. its working slowly but surely</li>
            <li> Used this on my hair the other night. I put this on my dry hair slept with it on and washed the next morning. My hair was soft and had an fabulous  shine. This  is amazing!</li>
            <li> Great item!  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and I am very satisfied with this Almond Oil. This oil does not have a noticeable scent. It goes on smoothly and coats my hair very well. I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> excellent !..I am using for hair and really makes hair shine and look healthy.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and when I eat tomatoes or acidic food my face breaks out with what looks like acne.  The eruptions are itchy, red, and form a scalb.  I have tried everything.  After doing some research I decided to try Sweet Almond Oil.  The way I have been using it is; first wash my face, then apply sweet almond oil.  I run hot water on a bath cloth and squeeze out the excess water.  Then I lay the cloth on my face until it has cooled.  I use the cloth to wipe off the excess sweet almond oil.  After two days the allergic rash started disappearing and my fine lines on my face aren&#x27;t as noticable.  After a week my face has taken on a healthy more youthful glow.  I love this stuff, I wish I had know about it a long time ago.  I highly recommend everyone try this, it is one of the best kept secrets!</li>
            <li> Love this oil. High quality product and priced r8!</li>
            <li> The oil is fine. But I was annoyed that the product is deceptively labelled. I was specifically looking for an organic oil and, despite being called Molivera Organics, this oil is not organic!</li>
            <li> I love this almond oil. I have been using cocoa butter for years and nothing changed. Cocoa butter just doesnt work. As soon as I started using this almond oil my stretch marks diminished. Im on my second bottle and will order again</li>
            <li> Oil arrived promptly. We have been using it for everything from oil cleansing to scalp massage to hand lotion. We are very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Received the package in a timely manner.  Have high expectations for its performance in skincare.</li>
            <li> First time using this. Item came quickly and the bottle is huge. Been wearing the oil on my face to work each day since my skin is sooo dry and everyone has been complimenting my complexion.  Plan to use it in my hair next</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this stuff. It has taken the place of my night time moisturizer! I&#x27;m looking forward to continue to use it to moisturize and lighten up my acne spots.</li>
            <li> I love this Oil.. it smells great; I use it on my hair (it definitely moisturize it ) ..I also use it on my skin and it make it glow and feel so soft.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I had heard about.  A great carrier oil and absorbs so quickly.</li>
            <li> I love Molivera sweet almond oil, it keeps skin soft and smooth. Thank you for sharing the wonderful recipes for a healthier me. I recommend this oil to everyone. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Received order on time. Have been using this oil in my homemade hair  products and I love it, my hair is shinner and softer.  After reading your tips and info on this oil I will be trying it in my lotions and cremes for my skin all over.  Thanks for the info on this oil and your prompt service in delivering this oil.</li>
            <li> I have ordered different brands of Almond Oil, and this one is my favorite. It has a consistency that goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. There is no greasy feel with this oil. I love to make body butters, shampoos and body lotions with this oil. This has very little scent to it at all. Very clean. I would recommend this oil to anyone. Great for the skin! My skin is sensitive, but this oil work great on my face!</li>
            <li> Just what I was after</li>
            <li> I am excited to use this in my many upcoming projects!  Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I love it i&#x27;d much rather use use sweet almond oil over lotions any day im so glad i oreder it . And i will definitely order it again. It leaves your skin soft and glowing not sticky and greasy like other products i have tried</li>
            <li> Incredibly dense and smooth, it FEELS like it&#x27;s wonderful for you! New to almond oil, but I think we are going to be seeing a lot of each other;) Came quickly and just as expected.</li>
            <li> I love, Molivera Sweet Almond Oil. It smells wonderful and really helps my dry skin. I chose this brand  because it was organic, I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Have used Sweet Almond Oil for years now...but this is a new brand for me and I love it! Makes the skin so soft - I use it for cleansing and to moisturize. Amazing undereye treatment. Great stuff...couldn&#x27;t do without it!</li>
            <li> Sweer Almond Oil is a very light but moisturizing and calming oil. This oil is a good product , some seem to be tampered with or watered down , so they do not seem pure. I also sent this to my nephew for his new baby&amp;quot;s dry skin and they all started using it they like it so much. These sellers sent us some great recipes for it for the body. Their bottle is good for dispensing  and the darker bottle protects from light damage.&lt;br /&gt;The body seems to relax when you apply this oil.  Good company.&lt;br /&gt;months later , still love it . Great quality</li>
            <li> Great oil and works well with all of my essential oils!  Fast shipping too!!</li>
            <li> This oil is great! It is smooth and feels soft on my skin. I use it to mix all my other oils. It is a bit thinner than some other sweet almond oils, which I feel makes it easier to use, more comfortable to apply.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!!! Must buy!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. We started seeing good results once we started using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly trying more and more essential oils. Recently read in Woman&#x27;s Day about this concoction we can make with sweet almond oil, rose hips oil and a scented oil of your choice. So, I ordered some and did that. I&#x27;m already loving it. It&#x27;s a light, gentle mixture that doesn&#x27;t leave a person&#x27;s pores feeling clogged. I apply it all over my face and my decolletage. It&#x27;s lovely! My skin already feels softer and seems to have more of a younger glow.--So far, I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I use it as a carrier oil when cleansing my face. It has no scent and has done wonder for my skin.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing! Light, smooth and blends beautifully with cocoa or Shea butter. It us perfect for DIY skin care products. Have already  purchased a second bottle!</li>
            <li> Have not really used this yet.  It did arrive with a cracked screw top making it impossible to use the flip top pour mechanism.</li>
            <li> Great addition to my skin moisturizing recipe.</li>
            <li> This almond oil is by far the best one I&#x27;ve tried yet!  Seeing great results on my skin.... And will continue to order!</li>
            <li> After reading lots of reviews I decided to try this brand and I have to say I am impressed. I used this as a carrier oil for my essential oils.  I also have found this to work very well on dark circles under the eyes and it makes an excellent moisturizing hair mask.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s big and you only need about 2-3 drops for your face.&lt;br /&gt;Super moisturizing yet not greasy, it helped with my dry peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Fast deliery and good product.</li>
            <li> Great product. I added some to my Shea Butter to make lotion and I use it on my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this!! Very generous size and good quality! I use it on my toddler daily for her Excema! Nice soft natural feel! Very very pleased!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> We all use this in the house, my wife loves using on her face as a facial scrub, I would highly recommend,  great product and at a great price, Great job Molivera.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It has the perfect consistency, no over-powering smell, perfect packaging and last but not the least, good price. I use it on my hair and skin - it has helped improve both so much, that I can actually see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent... Wonderful product.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I am a clinical pharmacist and almond oil is a great carrier oil that is excellent for your skin. This particular product is a very high quality product and the almond oil is pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I created a pre shave blend with essential oils and it works great, better than products that are in the $100+ retail range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes for a great base to add essential oils for direct skin application, massage oils or after shower general moisturizer. Almond oil also gives you that great &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; effect after a shower and really brings out a luxury, moisturizing feel.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite oils. Takes some time to absorb, but it leaves my skin so smooth afterwards. I use it on my son also. His skin has never felt so healthy.</li>
            <li> Great for use as a carrier oil with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have been rubbing it on my belly as I am 23 weeks pregnant and I hope it can prevent stretch marks... I am not sure whether it&#x27;ll help keep me stretch-mark free but the oil is awesome, easily absorbed through the skin and not sticky or gross at all. My skin feels a lot less taut and itchy since I started applying it and I don&#x27;t have to worry about any bad chemicals getting to my baby :)</li>
            <li> I am SO happy to have discovered Sweet Almond Oil---it may now be my favorite to use as a carrier oil with essential oils.  I was also surprised to learn that it works great for cleansing and have been using it for that, as well.  The service and delivery from Molivera Organics was prompt and excellent.  I will be ordering more and encourage others to try it, too!</li>
            <li> Great! Very good follow up from the store :)</li>
            <li> This oil has been great for my dry skin and Ali around my eyes. I have also been using in my daughters curly hair to tame frizz. There is no detectable scent.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this almond oil, i use it with other products to make body butter or just by itself.  its so nice and makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I asked for.  The smell is very little and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Yes I have received  the almond oil, but no I haven&#x27;t used it yet. I did get it when I was told and it was packaged well. I&#x27;ll have to get back with reviewing it for use. I will however give a three star for it coming as quickly  as it did and for it being packaged in a brown bottle...that is great, I do like the idea of you using the brown color bottle. It&#x27;s to bad the others that are still using the clear bottles can&#x27;t start using the colored ones. Everyone knows that uses oils they last longer in darker color bottles.  5/24/2015 {UP DATE} I do like the Sweet Almond Oil, it mixes great with the other oils I use with it and is great by itself.</li>
            <li> Its a good almond oil, but its a bit liquid the oil, i have had others before and they have more consistency and thickness, so i use more than what i expected to use because of that, it doesn&#x27;t has any smell, so thats something good if you dont like weird smells on you, i will keep trying other marks until i find the almond oil that fits me more, this one just i can say it was good.</li>
            <li> This is awesome oil.  Great quality, pure and natural.  LOVE IT SOOO MUCH!!!!</li>
            <li> Very helpful with keeping hair soft and moist</li>
            <li> This is such a great quality oil with no other ingredients or fillers added to it. There is almost no almond smell in it which I personally think its great since I use it liberally on my hair and body and I dont have to worry about it clashing with my perfume. Definitely will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I received my bottle of sweet almond oil and was more than happy with the quality of the oil in comparison to the size and price of the bottle. I am using it with essential oils for various things and will purchase again when the need arises. Thanks Molivera!</li>
            <li> Just what my skin has been craving!! I&#x27;ve been using cocunut oil for some time on my skin but my skin still felt a little dry so I heard about Almond oil and how it penatrates deep into the skin and decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the packaging, the smell of this oil and I noticed smoother skin after day one. I mix this with cocunut and it&#x27;s amazing!! I also use it to remove my makeup.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this product and I especially appreciate the emails from the company providing me with tips and recipes for my Sweet Almond Oil.</li>
            <li> Great service and good product</li>
            <li> Fabulous!  I used infused this oil with my homegrown lavender.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and have been using it every day.  Very happy with the quality of the oil and will re-order when I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> Lovely product. Speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> This Sweet Almond Oil was a great purchase.  In fact, I am on my second bottle of this amazing oil.  I know there are so many uses for Almond Oil but I solely use it as a make up remover.  I literally can wash and scrub my face, then squirt this on my washcloth and the amount of makeup that I cannot physically see on my face and this removes is amazing!  My face is so soft, no breakouts and I can trust that I am going to bed with very clean skin.  I highly recommend this product and will continue ordering as needed.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and quick delivery. Great follow up service too. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil. I use after I shower and my skin feels great. It absorbs well. I usually mix with a heavier oil in the winter.  Update: I have not received anything for reviewing.  Most of my purchases are made based on reviews so I felt it was important to write a review. I love this oil. It makes my skin very soft. I use it as my primary and sometimes with Shea Butter. I try not to run out so I am always purchasing a bottle.  Negative - my son is allergic to almonds and is also allergic to this oil.</li>
            <li> Like other people, I noticed this did leak all over the other stuff in my order. But it is a great product and I will order again.</li>
            <li> No smell to it at all, which was surprising. Haven&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks in this pregnancy and only 7 weeks more to go.</li>
            <li> This oil is just as I expected. Great feel, great quality and overall happy with my purchase. I use this mostly as a carrier oil for my essential oils. Goes great in roller bottles! I will be buying again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I tried differents brands of Almond oil and I have to say is one of the best I tried.</li>
            <li> I bought the sweet almond oil to use on my hair. I am also using it on my skin. So far, I&#x27;m pleased with results but I need more time to give a more accurate assessment.</li>
            <li> Using as a carrier oil for essential oil application</li>
            <li> good product,  fast delivery</li>
            <li> Love it. Very light and nourishing to mix in with the organic body butters I make.</li>
            <li> As depicted, fast ship.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and amazing quality and customer service. I will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> This oil is 100% cold pressed, free of hexane, and a premium food grade oil that is antioxidant rich. Jam packed full of vitamins A, B, D, and E,  magnesium and essential fatty acids. This oil will heal scars, improve your complexion leaving you with a radiant glow, moisturize, prevent split ends and repair already formed split ends, decrease dark circles and crows feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to use for a Diy body Butter. I also apply it under and around my eyes at night to minimize fine lines and dark circles. It&#x27;s been great for the ends of my hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil was a couple dollars more than some other brands. I chose this company because I like the way they market their oil. I also am very impressed with the level of care they have for their customers. I have received two follow up emails wanting to ensure I am pleased with their product. They also included some diy recipes for body butters, hair conditioners,  and eye cream. I think that&#x27;s super cool!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered shea  butter from a different company(it was cheaper) but next time I order I will be ordering shea butter from Molivera despite it being a bit more in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Molivera for offering wonderful products so that I can rid my families skincare products of toxins you typically find in store bought pre-made items. Homemade is the way for me!  In the long run you&#x27;ll save money.</li>
            <li> This product broke my skin out I used it on my face as well as body after a few days I saw little red bumps on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! This is the only brand I will buy. I use it on my hair, skin and to mix with other oils. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I bought this as an essential oil, due to the reviews for my hair.  I am white, 52 with a thyroid problem and my hair is thinning.  I was using coconut oil but heard some good reviews about almond oil.  Delivery was a few days, and it was a nice size bottle.  Without being an oily mess, I dont use it daily on my hair, and I am going to give it some more time on my hair but its great for your skin and hands.  I have gotten away from hand and body cremes and trying to use the oil only.  I will buy again, and would like to put in a spray bottle for when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Love it. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Great quality product and helpful recipes.</li>
            <li> Great price for 16 oz! I love sweet almond oil and use it for just about everything!. I use it for my dark circles, as a moisturizer right after a shower and as a make up remover. Its very gentle on the eyes.  Even my husband noticed and commented on how soft my skin feels. Shipping was fast and customer service is helpful. My only complaint is that its not organic, no seal on the bottle.</li>
            <li> even though I haven&#x27;t had this item long it works great on places of my scalp were my hair is thin. I even use it on my grandson for his missing hair</li>
            <li> Awesome had issues with my order but the company contacted me and fixed everything love the oil!!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and absorbs fully very fast.  Seller shipped fast and sent good instructions and product info.  Very thoughtful</li>
            <li> I added a pump to the bottle and keep it in the shower.  Pump and apply to wet skin before toweling off.  Leaves skin soft but not oily.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful oil.  My son and I have oily acne prone skin and he has eczema, I have never used oil on my face, it is contrary to everything I have ever used.  I am so glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> I just received this oil and am looking forward to using it, especially during the winter dry months</li>
            <li> Very nice oil ! Thank you.</li>

            <li> Great product! Fast Shipping!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Vendor ships fast and is proactive with customer service to ensure satisfaction! Almond Oil feels great, works really good on dry skin, feet, and heals. I use this with my essential oils and also alone by itself. Has a light feel and texture, absorbs quickly, not greasy, and is simply amazing! I love this product and vendor. Highly recommend buying from them and I will again!</li>
            <li> I love this!  I bought it for a reed diffuser, but discovered I can also use it on my skin.  I says it doesn&#x27;t clog pores, but I&#x27;ve noticed I need to stay away from the the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone as I&#x27;ve had some unusual breakouts. I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars, though!  I use it on the rest of my face, and will use it as a carrier oil for some essential oil mixtures I make.  Feels great!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and quality. Company actually contacts you to see if your product arrived and give you tips on using and storing. Love the customer service. I use it as my nighttime moisturizer for face. Use it daily on body and at the ends of my hair. Will reorder this and also their Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Love this oil use on my face twice daily and also has a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it in my DIY moisturizer recipes. The packaging was as expected. I recommend this distributer for this product.</li>
            <li> Works  gret; use after shaving</li>
            <li> No surprises here. Just what I expected from the listing and other reviews.</li>
            <li> I have added this to my own recipe for natural hair products. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I really love this oil. I bought it as a carrier oil but also use it as a night facial moisturizer. My face is looking healthier and feels softer. The oil is nicely absorbed by morning.</li>
            <li> love this product! thank you. So amazed by the variety of uses for it. It is especially nice mixed with a few drops of peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> This oil smells nice and goes on smooth. Good product for the price, especially if you make your own skin care stuff. Be careful not to use it too much on your face as it is slightly comodogenic and did not agree with mine! Good oil for someone with dry skin looking for a lighter moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil..great for dry skin..does not absorb that quickly though but better than other almond oils, olive oil or coconut oils I have tried.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality sweet almond oil.  This oil is lighter than coconut oil and absorbs quicker. Perfect for moisturizing after a shower and great for preventing stretch marks during pregnancy. Will definitely be ordering more from Molivera Organics!</li>
            <li> will be using with shea butter to make skin cream...smells nice...looking forward to using it...</li>
            <li> Really satisfied with this product and all the customer service they provide . Keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister for Christmas. She has been using it since then and loves it. She thinks it has made a difference in the look &amp; feel of her skin already.</li>
            <li> Great product and service!</li>
            <li> This is a good quality almond oil.  I use it in my homemade hair moisturizer and directly on my skin.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised... Beautiful product!  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not almond oil. It doesn&#x27;t even smell like almond oil which has a particular nice smell....</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly! Has a very light almond scent. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used my Sweet Almond oil yet. I am waiting for my oils to come in but know I am going to love it.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil. It does as the company says it does. Very moisturizing and not sticky. I use it, then wait a few minutes and wipe my face with a soft cloth. It leaves my face so soft and feels very nice. This will be my go to moisturizer. I understand it also can be used as a cleanser and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. I will try that at some point. This oil either doesn&#x27;t have a scent or I can&#x27;t smell it so it will work wonderfully as a carrier oil for personal use.</li>
            <li> This oil has become my new go-to beauty product.  For several years I have had extremely dry skin due to estrogen-blocking cancer drugs and menopause.  I initially bought this oil to make salt scrubs for my skin.  When I noticed how soft my skin was, I began to use it as a moisturizer for my body, hair and face.  My skin is glowing like a 20-yr old now!  It softens, cleanses and heals.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for making lotions</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I added some to my shampoo because my hair is very dry.  I have also used small amounts of it in my hair before twisting it up and the oil adds moisture without making my hair oily.  I also love the way it feels on my hands.</li>
            <li> This oil feels great on my skin.  It feels like my skin is drinking it up. It feels much smoother and it is not as dry as it used to be.  I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use often, but from what little I have, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It is also good to use when giving massages.  It doesn&#x27;t get sticky like other things I have tried.  This allows my hands to glide across the skin easily.</li>
            <li> Their description of product seems correct. Much better than KTC brand of oil I have used before. It&#x27;s expensive but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;April 2017: just downgraded to one star because description does not mention hexane free.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Sweet Almond Oil alone and combined with their Castor Oil for cleansing my face and I love it. My face had a short adjustment period but I was expecting that. I have even used a small amount on my hair to contain my frizz and it helps as well.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Would definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I really like sweet almond oil and I also appreciate the email follow ups with tips on using it! Very helpful, thank you! I will definitely buy again when this one is all gone.</li>
            <li> Love my sweet almond oil! I slather it on my body and use it on  my hair will be ordering again soon! Great price too</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Almond Oil. After several uses I am pleased. My skin appears and feels softer than when I use a lotion and it also seems to be helping my KP which has been flaring up this winter. It&#x27;s not greasy, has no scent and is reasonably priced. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> LOVE this oil! It soaks into my skin leaving it feeling soft and non-greasy. Will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product. Arrived in perfect conditions without spills. The plastic of the bottle is kind of thin. Have been using it for a couple of weeks and no bad reactions. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really like it, specially for my skin. I like to alternate the coconut and almond oil for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes me feel! Have made lotion bars and have added Essential oils for a variety of mixtures.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It was a good product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use it for my skin and hair!</li>
            <li> This oil absorbed in my skin almost immediately and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.  I bought this initially to thin out Castor Oil, but use it for so many more things.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving And it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks I been using it all over my body for uneven skin tones (darker areas)</li>
            <li> Love it! They also email nice recipes for scrubs and moisturizer using almond oil and other oils.</li>
            <li> I absolute love this product, the oil is so pure and it feels wonderful on the skin, and the package spectacular. Love it. I will order again from your company. Thanks you very much!..  Great Services....A+++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid baby oil and moisturizing lotion user for probably 20 years thinking that I was going to win the war on my aging skin. I never realizing that baby oil just lays on the top layer of your skin and really does not have any benefits and most moisturizing lotions are made with alcohol.  Having just turned 51, I decided it was time to get really serious about my skin care and began doing research into what&#x27;s best.  All my research pointed towards Sweet Almond oil.  I use the oil all over when I&#x27;m still wet after a shower concentrating on areas that tend to be dryer and/or could have sun damage, also as a night time moisturizer under my eyes and crows feet and also on my forehead (where most of my wrinkles are). This oil absorbs quickly so you&#x27;re not left feeling greasy.  I may begin using it to take off my makeup.  I now only purchase body lotion made with Sweet Almond Oil too.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister. She was using it for a month and was excited to tell me that the Sweet almond oil mixed with Lavender EO already seemed to be improving the appearance of acne and scarring on her face, as well as, making her skin softer. She is very happy with this product. I am considering getting some for myself when I need a new carrier oil.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected. Sweet Almond oil is great for the skin. I use it in many of the lotions I make. I also use it on my face &amp; it helps shrink pores!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this product. I&#x27;ve used it to make homemade lotion and have also applied it directly to my skin and hair. The sweet almond oil smells very fresh and made my hair and skin feel soft and silky. I would have loved it if this oil were organic, however, to my knowledge there are no genetically modified almonds, which is a relief. I would definitely recommend this product to others and will continue to use it for my homemade lotions and skin care needs.</li>
            <li> smooth and great for pregnancy stretch marks</li>
            <li> The company sent a fantastic informational email along with my shipment. And I love the oil. Great, easy to use bottle and the product is consistent with other oils I have tried.</li>
            <li> thanks for the great info, we were using the wrong oil.</li>
            <li> Great for giving back massages with.</li>
            <li> Great presentation! Love the product.</li>
            <li> Love this as a nighttime application on my face.  Skin already feels and looks better with just a few applications.</li>
            <li> very good product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love the sweet almond oil- my skin is SO soft. My order arrived very quickly and customer service and information from seller is excellent. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Great for skin and hair.  Found a new product for life!</li>
            <li> As soon as I received the oil, which arrived very quickly, I have been putting it on and I love it! I am highly allergic to everything so it was a great discovery. I can put it from head to toe with no reactions. My skin can finally feel moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, love the oil!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mixed with a couple sprays of pure aloe and it works fantastic. I read that you should mix aloe with your oils before applying on your face if you have trouble with acne. It has been working for wrinkles around my eyes so well that my husband asked me to start putting it on his wrinkles too. I gave some to my mom and she loves it. I tend to break out when I use any lotion and although I put it all over my face, it does not seem to cause problems. I do pat excess off where I tend to break out so I don&#x27;t leave too much on my skin. Fantastic product and I feel like my face is glowing and so soft that I don&#x27;t even want to put makeup on.</li>
            <li> Great service and a high quality product!I loved the email with information and tips for usage.  That&#x27;s a very nice personal touch.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could mix it with my Young Living Essential Oils. Since my daughter is only 8 months old, I use this to dilute the oils before I place them on her topically. It works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s scent free so I don&#x27;t have a clashing of scenting lingering around.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly, which I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a nice size bottle so it&#x27;ll last me for a while. When I do need to get more, I&#x27;ll be sure to buy this item again.</li>
            <li> Awesome experience! Product is as described. I&#x27;m using this in my head to toe grease and my skin loves me</li>
            <li> Not too heavy or greasy.. I have just received and only been able to use one. I have used Almond oil once before, not from Molivera however; looking forwared to continued use of this product. Smells very clean, very pure product.</li>
            <li> Yay! Beautiful and smooth - love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> not happy- just like regular veget oil ...very dissapointed I think its NOT almond oil at all in that bottle</li>
            <li> This was kind of a gift, im starting to use it and my skin already feels smoother</li>
            <li> Very satisfied--shipping was prompt</li>
            <li> I got this delivered about a week ago. I have been using it to remove my makeup at night before washing my face and it seems to take the makeup off well. I&#x27;ve always had trouble getting all of the foundation off because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;24 hour&amp;#34; foundation. So I usually use a soap and microfiber towel. The soap can be drying so I&#x27;m excited to see if this oil will do the job without stripping my skin. So far so good!</li>
            <li> Well is nice, I stared making soaps etc eat, and almost everybody recommended this one, I was expecting more aroma, but I thing is for cosmetics is perfect. Today was my first day I used, is so soft and beautiful clear, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this almond oil! I&#x27;ve used sweet almond oil for many things, but mostly I use it as an under eye moisturizer and to combat my dark circles. It does wonders! I started using Rodan and Fields highly sought-after eye cream thinking it would put the almond oil to shame, and it ended up being the other way around! I&#x27;m serious, it&#x27;s great for the eyes. Anyway, I was using the Auracacia brand of sweet almond oil before I bought this brand, and the consistency was very thin - almost watery. Molivera almond oil is a bit thicker and feels like an actual oil which leads me to believe the quality is better. Over all I&#x27;m very happy with it and I would purchase it again. One more thing - the customer service is awesome! Just another reason to keep giving them my business.</li>
            <li> Was a nice bottle of carrier oil, especially for the price. Felt great on the skin and mixed well with my EOs. Only problem was I didn&#x27;t notice much of a smell to it like I have with other companies. Normally sweet almond oil has a very nice and inviting smell. Would still buy again for some recipes and blends, but for others I think I&#x27;d go with a more potent aroma.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil! It&#x27;s odorless and colorless which makes it perfect to use as a carrier. It feels light and pleasant when you are applying it. It absorbs guickly leaving your skin smooth and hydrated with no greasy feeling. This oil doesn&#x27;t  stain your clothes or sheets. It also seems to be quite economical, as it will last for a long time. The product arrived prompty, the packaging was great. I will definitely buy this oil again!</li>
            <li> Good quality, fair amount of oil and organic. Little to no odor so works great as a carrier base for essential oils, or just as a moisturizer. Great as an aftershave.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product back in June of this year, I waited before writing a review, to see results. I haven&#x27;t see any result yet for myself, but I definitely see good results for my daughter&#x27;s, she had some scalp problem and had it for a while until I used this product on her, I rub the oil on her scalp after her bath or shower, it works wonder! Now, her scalp is back to normal, healthy! Glad I found this product, definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. I use it after a shower and it has been helping my sun damaged forearms. It is absorbed into the skin nicely and leaves a natural looking healthy skin.  The scent is so mild that I don&#x27;t even notice it.... which I like. Wish I could find more information on the company. I&#x27;m looking forward to new products by them.</li>
            <li> I use this as a body moisturizer instead of lotion.  It soaks in quickly, has little to no fragrance, and is light.  The bottle is easy to pour from without getting too much.  If you&#x27;re tired of putting products on your skin with a ton of ingredients you can&#x27;t pronounce, then this wonderful oil is for you.  Thank you Molivera Organics!</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m new to this product it has been surprisingly wonderful.  I am mixing it with shea butter to make a luscious cream for moisturizing my skin that is so nice!  Also I&#x27;m mixing some essential oils with the cream for a pain cream which is extremely helpful!  This company has included so many good uses for the sweet almond oil that I had no clue for when I ordered I had one intention now I have a variety of uses.</li>
            <li> Really keeps the skin moisterized a refreshed.</li>
            <li> I found Molivera Organics Shea Butter about a year ago and I really love this company. First of all they have the best shea butter I have ever used. So creamy and fresh. I have been using their Sweet Almond Oil mixed with the shea butter for a couple of months now and I love it. The Almond Oil has really added shine to my hair. Also, I was surprised to see that my dark circles have decrease since I added this Sweet Almond Oil to my regime.  I will always buy from Molivera Organics. I really appreciate the follow up emails with useful tips and recipes. They have the best customer service and they seem to go out of their way to ensure that you are satisfied and taken care of.  Their quality is above the bar. Great company. Great product. I will always recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Used a little on my hair ends and it wasn&#x27;t greasy. Added ahine and smoothed them  out.</li>
            <li> Amazing for curly hair and as a natural means to anti frizz</li>
            <li> After reading the information provided by this seller, I decided to try their sweet almond oil.  It arrived quickly, was securely packaged, and appears to be of very good quality.  I used some to make a wonderful body butter combined with coconut oil and Shea butter for night use and I use the sweet almond oil by itself in the morning after washing my face when getting ready for the day.</li>
            <li> The Best customer service, ever awesome products!!</li>
            <li> Very nice for use after showering. Will order again because its organic cold pressed and economical.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Sweet Almond Oil.  I have loosely curly hair. I love my hair but, the frizz has always been a struggle for me.  I have been using if for about a week and a half now. I smooth it into my hair after my wash (or condition only wash).  It has absolutely changed my hair. My hair has never been this shinny. And it has tamed my curls. It makes them smoother and gives them better definition. But what I really enjoy the most is the way my hair feels since using this oil. My hair has been so smooth and soft in my hands. Really silky. I love this oil. Can’t wait to try it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this! I did receive this as a promotion, but I am an honest person and wouldn&#x27;t give a good review if I didn&#x27;t like the product. I love this stuff... I use it on my face in the morning and night, my skin is so soft. I was using a diff type of oil and it was making me break out, this does not make me break out. I could use this all over my body, it just makes my skin so soft. I will def. be purchasing more of this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I had started using some other lotions and ended up with a terrible case of eczema under my right eye... and I mean it looked terrible... red, swollen, itchy. I stopped using all my lotions but one for sensitive skin and my sweet almond oil. After a week, it is almost cleared up.. why did I stop using this? I won&#x27;t do that again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2016: still using, just bought another bottle. I am 52 now and my skin looks awesome... it is not greasy or oily (at least not on my skin) and I use it on my face, neck and body... I don&#x27;t use any store bought cosmetics. Between this and an organic lotion, I am set and look better than woman 10 years younger :)</li>
            <li> This oil smelled rancid and like old cook in oil. I sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> I received this product as part of a promotion, so I had no plans as to what I would do with it.&lt;br /&gt;Since receiving it, I have used it around my eyes and on my hands at night as a moisturizer. I may start using it as a makeup remover and/or face wash.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using coconut oil for a nighttime moisturizer for months and it words really well, but it&#x27;s a little greasy and takes awhile to be absorbed. Because the sweet almond oil is completely odorless and less greasy than coconut oil, I may have accidentally discovered a replacement!</li>
            <li> Amazing almond oil. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love my alions oil! It leaves my hair and skin looking great! I put it a couple drops in my shampoo and conditioner for a beautiful soft shine hair.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I use it on both my face and hair but mostly for my face.  My daughter use it on her hair.  My face feels soft and smooth waiting to get results on the wrinkle on my forehead.  My daughter loves it for her hair.  Happy to recommend this productl</li>
            <li> Received quickly and product is good quality....</li>
            <li> Using this to prevent stretch marks in pregnancy. No smell to the product, not too heavy or greasy and so far stretch mark free. Took one star away because I wish it came in a pump dispenser since the bottle easily becomes covered in oil but the product is great!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my sweet almond oil purchase. I use it for under the eyes and will try it as a cleanser as well. I also put it into my Shea butter face cream and absolutely love the almond oil instead of the coconut oil because it isn&#x27;t greasy and it doesn&#x27;t clog pores. I will be using the almond oil in my lotion bars as well. You can&#x27;t go wrong. It is great!  And Molivera  is so good to explain the usage for almond oil as well as following up on your order.</li>
            <li> It Came very quickly, it is just was I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as described</li>
            <li> My wife is using this oil on her belly because she is pregnant and wants to avoid stretching mark. So far so good, the oil is very smooth and almost smell free that is a plus in her case, she doesn&#x27;t like strong smell. We are very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Love this oil - very good product!</li>
            <li> really fresh smell better then other almond oil ,i am going to use on skin and scalp for massage .i would like to buy again.</li>
            <li> This oil has the perfect consistency and it makes my hair soft. It smells good too. I love that it comes in a dark bottle; really helpful for conserving the oil. Will update soon. So far, love it :)</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month as an after shower oil and my skin is soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping (thanks Amazon!), &amp; great customer support. Molivera sent a follow-up e-mail after I had received everything to ensure it had been delivered. Some people might not like to be bothered with extra e-mail, but I thought it was nice.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have been looking into body oils recently since lotions were not doing it for me anymore. I came across sweet almond oil since it did not have as much of a smell like coconut oil and wouldn&#x27;t clash with my perfume. It was between Molivera and another brand. What sold it for me was that Molivera&#x27;s sweet almond oil is cold pressed which means the nutrients are better preserved and better for your skin. I used it after showering and my skin is like velvet with a little glow to it. It took a while to soak it cause I used a little more than I should&#x27;ve but my skin was so soft once it did, I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my arms. It is also great for shaving and I recommend combining this with dry brushing, your skin will thank you. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is great, I use it in my homemade body cream (shea butter, avocado butter, sweet almond, jojoba) as well as my facial serums.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for a massage with your sweetheart and as an indulgent after bath moisturizer. And as a very special facial moisturizing treatment on those days I don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
            <li> It seems fine.  What I expected except I do not notice any scent from the oil which I did expect.  I like unscented products so that is a plus for me.  The company sent me some recipes for body lotions, etc that one can make from their oil.</li>
            <li> This group of Enthusiast people are phenomenal!  They are so informative, fast and kind!!!  I will definitely re order from them!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Does not feel greasy and absorbs well.  Also controls dry skin for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> Great oil. Great company feed back.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what they say it will. Good Buy...</li>
            <li> Best sweet almond oil I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Very satisfied with product, will buy again!</li>
            <li> I used this to make lotion (along with coconut oil, beeswax, and a little bit of shea butter) and it turned out so silky and smooth. This was the main ingredient for the lotion so I give it all the credit for such a great outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Check out wellnessmama.com for diy beauty products!)</li>
            <li> I love this oil. This was my first experience making my own lotion, and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Another fabulous product from Molivera Organics! The texture is divine; much more rich and silky than coconut oil. The scent is mild enough to layer with perfume, but great even on it&#x27;s own. I keep the bottle on my bed-side-table and use it every night (and during the day). It&#x27;s so convenient to be able to just pour some into my hands and smooth it on from head to toe. I can&#x27;t wait to use it in my next batch of body cream with Molivera Organics Raw African Ivory Shea Butter! I also will be trying their two ingredient recipe for eye serum. I can&#x27;t imagine going back to buying beauty products filled with synthetic, harsh ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with Molivera Organics!!</li>
            <li> Love the sweet almond oil..........fast fast fast delivery :)</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.  Use it as a carrier oil.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I received my sweet almond oil the other day and I love it. It only took a few days to get to me with a few other things i had ordered. I have used sweet almond oil before but every day I am learning more uses of this wonderful product. I will be using  and ordering from Molivera Organics again.</li>
            <li> I use this as a carrier oil with essential oils.  It soaks into the skin nicely.  Better than another brand I tried.  Will likely buy it again!</li>
            <li> So far working as expected and looks really pure..</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!  I use it on my little one for massage. Its not greasy  and sticky at all. Will buy it again after it runs out. Well priced.</li>
            <li> Very light and great quality!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, only used it less than a week and can already see the great affects it has had on my skin, my elbows are no longer ruff. Also my hair likes it as well. Thanks  Molivera for making such a fine product.</li>
            <li> This oil is perfect for what I need!!  I am using it as a carrier oil for making my skin care products!!</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped quickly and wonderful communication from Molivera Organics. Will do business with again!</li>
            <li> The Sweet Almond Oil arrived quickly and is exactly as described. I plan to use this oil with an essential oil mixture for a face serum. I have not done that as of yet but I assume this oil  will be perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my very first essential oil to try and I have been using it for almost a month now non stop. It has the right size non greasy just perfect...and it goes with every oil....</li>
            <li> This oil is fantastic, I use it for massage oil and it works amazing. Does not leave a very sticky gross feeling that cheap massage oils leave on skin, and a little oil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This Sweet Almond Oil goes on my skin easily and is quickly absorbed.  I&#x27;ve also used it as a facial cleanser/eye makeup remover and it works well.  So far, I&#x27;m delighted.</li>
            <li> Oil is amazing,  used it in organic body scrub with raw Shea almond butter, organic San sugar and several drops of doTERRA wild orange, vetiver and lemon essential oils.</li>
            <li> Love this oil and the customer service is terrific. My new staple in my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Great product and value.  I use as pre-shave and it does protect skin against nicks</li>
            <li> Works very well as a massage oil. However, the impression that I get from the description is that they&#x27;re trying to sell it as a miracle cure for everything from malnourished hair to acne. I can&#x27;t comment to it&#x27;s effectiveness for nourishing your hair, but I actually find that my back breaks out a bit when I use it for a massage oil, so I&#x27;m actually pretty skeptical of its helpfulness where acne is concerned.</li>
            <li> Finding many uses for this.  I&#x27;m sure to find many more uses.  So far its mixed with my essential oils, applied to my feet, applied to my face, arms, elbows.</li>
            <li> So far it is just as described. A lot of follow up from the company with tips and suggested uses.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I use it in my DIY products..</li>
            <li> I found out about sweet almond oil through a massage client. This stuff is amazing!! Coconut oil is too heavy for my skin, almond oil is amazing!! It has even helped my super oily t-zone. I mix a little with essential oils when I get out of the shower and apply all over. It leaves skin soft and mattte feeling. :) will definitely buy again.  Update:  I replaced my normal cleanser and expensive moisturizer with this oil, and WOW! My overly oily skin has seen a huge improvement already. I&#x27;m hooked! 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I found the oil didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin as much as I would like. However, I then ordered the Shea Butter- Molivera Organics Raw Shea Butter to mix with it and I like the combination very much.  The product is more easily absorbed by my skin and does relieve dryness that I haven&#x27;t experienced with other products.</li>
            <li> Like the product from this company (Molivera) I like the fact also that they send info on the great uses on there product. When I read the healing benefits that they provided I used that to heal a small pimple I had on my shoulder I place a small amount on shoulder and rub in before getting into shower and after shower place more in area the bump when down .</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that it took 18 days to arrive with prime. The oil itself is amazing and the product and seller is a 5 star rating. The price is the best and quality is as well, but waiting 18 days for anything coming from just a couple of states away, is just annoying and ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I was using avocado oil, but the sweet almond soaks in quicker and feels smoother.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion.  I&#x27;ve been using it as a face wash, and a carrier oil.  Quality product as far as I can tell!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I will be ordering this again. It helps with moisturizing your body, and is great to use with shea butter.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Awesome service. Kind follow up email. Will definitely purchase again. Would recommend!!</li>
            <li> I love sweet almond oil because this and jojoba are 2 of the few oils that make my skin look better and better everytime I use them. I make my own makeup remover using sweet almond oil, jojoba, and olive oil and it works much better than the chemical filled makeup removers at the store plus it keeps the skin around eyes moisturized which means less fine lines! It can be used on its own as a great moisturizer and for oily skinned people who are worried this will make them more oily, it is simply not true. I used to have the most oily skin and as long as I was drying out my skin by using harsh products, it kept overproducing oil to try and stay balanced, but once you start using a high quality oil like sweet almond, your skin no longer needs to overproduce oil so it balances itself out.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry/oil t-zone skin sensative skin. After I applied this I was honestly scared putting oil on my face but heard good reviews and glade I tried it. My skin is soft all over, no oily feeling on my face and you don&#x27;t need much! Plus its good for sensative skin. I also use it on my body as a moisturizer. I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about this sooner. I also use jojobo oil, that stuff is also amazing! Thank you. Will reorder!</li>
            <li> The oil is lovely!  I use it by itself directly on my skin and mix with my DIY body butters.  So far I really love it!  I had a small mishap with the shipping (which was amazon, not the seller) and the seller communicated with me, and replaced my damaged product.  Awesome customer service!  I am completely satisfied with the product and seller.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to use on my dry itchy skin.  It has worked very well for that purpose.  I may try it for other uses.  However, I am happy with the product as it is effective for the use for which it was purchased.  To me, the smell is barely noticeable which is  perfect for my needs.  You can mix it with another essential oil if you want something more fragrant.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed!  Used it to make homemade sugar body scrubs!</li>
            <li> the scent is not as great as expected but its a good product....</li>
            <li> love it- right away soothed my skin --i have rosacea-</li>
            <li> Excellent product,  large, priced right, delivered quickly, product is great on my skin I will be purchasing this product again in the future!</li>
            <li> Will buy again! I use this for my homemade body butter and it&#x27;s amazing! The company contacted me twice, which I appreciated.</li>
            <li> No noticeable scent, which is exactly what I wanted. The sweet almond oil does not feel sticky or oily on the skin; it just moisturizes beautifully. I apply it while still wet, after a shower, which I believe works best. Shipping was slower than I&#x27;m used to, but arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Great transaction! Quality product!</li>
            <li> I cannot even begin to tell you how amazing this oil is I used it on my skin hair and add other oils! It&#x27;s simply amazing I will repurchase oily skin women like myself can use this without breaking out! Love love love</li>
            <li> Seems to be a great product, it certainly has a super product support team. I got two emails explaining how to use the oil as well as the difference between sweet and bitter almond oil. How cool it that! I would buy from them again. I used it to make a hand lotion.</li>
            <li> nice smooth light oil that i put in my  1 year olds hair.  After a bath when it is still a little wet i put some of this oil in it and it gives it a lot of moisture and brings out her natural curls</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Great for skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I had been using coconut oil on my face and my esthetician told me to try sweet almond and jojoba oil as it wouldn&#x27;t leave my face as oily. I love this sweet almond oil. I use it after my shower and my skin is so soft and supple. I also put it on my nails. After taking my toenail polish off I decided to give the nail beds a rest and put the oil on them. It&#x27;s done a great job keeping the bed smooth. I have also used it on my face and it does absorb better than the coconut. I would much rather put natural products on my body, and I&#x27;m glad I purchased this oil.</li>
            <li> So many uses, but my favorite is massage!</li>
            <li> i use this for massage and it&#x27;s a good product I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying how the oil feels on my skin and sinks in. I like the shiny look on my legs after rubbing it in. Good product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> i put this on every night! love it!</li>
            <li> Love the oil!! Love the customer service and extra info</li>
            <li> Love this sweet almond oil. I use it with my essential oils on my face. My complexion has been amazing since I started using it!</li>
            <li> Using it as a massage oil and personal lubricant for intimate activities. Whatever that means. No weird scent, but very slightly nutty in a really good way. Packaging also says it&#x27;s food grade, so that can only be good.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  I mix this oil with my body lotion.  Oil does not works well on my face, I got little oily bumps.&lt;br /&gt;Love to try the Shea Butter but have a mix feeling of this product after some review posted.  Is this creamy or a hard lump that does not work well on skin.  Hope they could have send some sample to try out.&lt;br /&gt;Will by from Molivera Organics. Good customer service.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I got a bad batch, but the stench of this was overwhelming. It was dark brown in color, and the bottle was not sealed. It smelled completely rancid. I had a few friends look at it for me as this was my first time using sweet almond oil. All confirmed that it should absolutely NOT look or smell the way that it did.  Update: My next issue was how Molivera handled the situation. After I left my negative review, Molivera promptly commented on it (you can read it below). I believe this was all for show. I contacted them per their instructions and to this day have yet to hear a response. I feel like my time was wasted not once, but twice. I was really excited to try this product, and I was let down in every way possible.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping! A++</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my fault because I just looked at the name and didn&#x27;t make sure the actual product was organic. Since it is cold pressed I kept it and use it in my hair</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Loved the informative follow up email from the seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EMAIL:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;What is the difference between Sweet Almond Oil and Bitter Almond Oil?&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Almond Oil is a fixed oil, while Bitter Almond Oil is an essential oil. These two oils actually come from two different kinds of Almond Trees. The Sweet Almond tree has white flowers and produces the Almonds that we usually eat. These are the same Almonds we use to get our Sweet Oil. When emulsified, the Sweet Almond produces much more of beneficial oil that is great for beauty and healing. The Bitter Almond tree has pink flowers and its nuts produce a different kind of oil, used mostly for fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does Sweet Almond Oil &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; my skin?&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Almond Oil has been used, dating back thousands of years by the Romans for skin care, beauty, and healing. It is incredibly high in antioxidants, essential fatty acids, vitamins A, B, D, and E. It heals by penetrating the skin deeper, helping to balance skin moisture levels. It amazingly, continually renews skin cells, revealing younger fresher skin and increasing glow. Sweet Almond Oil can be used to treat minor wounds, swelling, and inflammations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Sweet Almond Oil be used as a cleansing oil?&lt;br /&gt;Oil cleansing is absolutely awesome for skin, especially sensitive skin and skin that is prone to acne and breakouts. Using Sweet Almond Oil as a gentle skin cleanser can alleviate all problems related to overproduction of oil by skin; i.e. blackheads, whiteheads, oily skin, etc. Often, over production on oil is caused by the use of harsh cleansers that over dry and stress out the skin. Sweet Almond gently and naturally dissolves makeup, dirt, oil, and dead skin. Sweet Almond Oil is does not clog pores, but is actually nourishing to the skin, while acting as an anti-bacterial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I use Sweet Almond Oil on my newborn baby?&lt;br /&gt;Yes!! Sweet Almond Oil is perfect to gently protect and nourish your baby’s skin. Add a few drops of oil to your baby’s bath to moisturize and soothe sensitive or irritated skin. Also, apply directly onto your baby’s skin, massaging gently into cradle cap, behind ears, and inner and outer joints. Your baby will really enjoy this daily massage. :) &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It did wonders for my dry hands!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful....I use this all over my body because it not only conditions great, but it absorbs unlike so many other oils I have tried.</li>
            <li> Great oil not watered down feeling like most. No real scent which my customers prefer. I give massages for a living.This product is a top of the line oil. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Like the product.  I am trying it in a mixture of four oils to use on my scalp and hair.  Avocado, Jojoba and Coconut.  Rogaine can cause dandruff and irritation.  This stuff seems to help.  Soaks into scalp very quickly.  Supposedly, useful in reducing DHT in scalp.  We will see.&lt;br /&gt;Mixture has a fairly pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Great service, fast shipping. Smells great and feels great. I haven&#x27;t used it in anything as yet, but just by itself is amazing!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and undamaged.  Very pleased with this product as a carrier oil for my DIY facial moisturizer with lavender, lemon and grapefruit essential oils.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in a lotion recipe and love it!  It has no scent, is not greasy at all, and is a nice base oil for diluting/using essential oils.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and awesome company. I love that they have so much knowledge on everything they sell</li>
            <li> Shipping fast and replied to my email fast!!  I will purchase again, thank you!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works great!</li>
            <li> the cap was broken and a 1/3 of the contents was leaked all over the box.</li>
            <li> This is becoming my favorite carrier oil for essential oils. Love the way my skin feels soft and smooth after using it for just a few days. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy like some oils.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful oil. It absorbs quickly into your skin. I used it when making body butter... results were fantastic. The seller was great ... shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SWEET ALMOND OIL THE BEST</li>
            <li> Love love love it!  Bought it to use as an addition to my essential oils, but use it by itself as well.  Molivera sent me an email with information about it and how to use it.  A perfect customer service strategy.</li>
            <li> I tied this oil for the first time and am in love with it! I&#x27;ve used it as a facial moisturizer, hair conditioner, and essential oil carrier oils. Item arrived quickly and well-packaged. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Item received VERY quickly and I already enjoy working with this oil.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.I used it after every shower. Does not make my skin break out.I used it as a body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love it and it was package nicely.</li>
            <li> So wonderful for your skin</li>
            <li> I use it for oil cleansing as almond oil was recommended by HeyFranHey. Love her. And I haven&#x27;t broken out at all. It&#x27;s lightened small dark spots on my face but not as much as I hope since many say almond oil helps. But that&#x27;s besides the point. I use it for my whole body and still have at least half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> I received my order on time and in good condition. I bought it to use on my Cocker Spaniel at the recommendation of a friend who owns a black Lab. He was always being complimented on his dog&#x27;s beautiful coat. I mix 1 tbs of  the almond oil to 4 cups of water in a spray bottle and use it when grooming her. It keeps her silky coat shiny and healthy looking between her professional grooming appointments. I now use it as a moisturizer for myself as well. I love it!</li>
            <li> Arrived as scheduled from vendor. I was hesitant at first to buy this product for my baby and I. My daughter has mild outbreaks of eczema, and I use the oil on her skin along with jojoba.  Her skin is responding well to both oils. I use it after a hot shower, and it feels really good on my skin. Overall, a great decision on my part to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing oil I love it!</li>
            <li> Ordering, shipping and receiving. It was all great. I am loving the oil so far. Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! The shipping was very fast, and the product is great! It soaks in well, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily at all. I have oily skin and hair, and this seems to have made my situation better. I wash my face every evening and apply a few drops of the oil afterwards, and I do that again in the mornings. I&#x27;ve also used it before and after flat ironing my hair and it makes my hair so smooth! After a week of using it, my face is softer, and my complexion seems smoother. Even my husband (who is gruff and tough) wanted to put some on his hands that often dry and crack. It&#x27;s worked wonders for him, as well!</li>
            <li> Worth every drop.  High quality.</li>
            <li> Great, light oil..awaiting results!</li>
            <li> I do like this. Light in color, slightly thick, really doesn&#x27;t seem to have a scent.... Someone asked about does the bottle show country of origin- my bottle did not show country of origin</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner.  Works well.  Smooth.  relaxing feel.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, good quality.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time. The oil is very light and absorbs quickly. It has a pleasant smell too!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil and this company. It&#x27;s a staple for body care recipes.</li>
            <li> It is what I expected. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this 10 stars! Please never stop creating this amazing organic all natural oil. I could not be happier with this purchase. I will continue to buy this liquid gold. I never want to run out. I use this on so much it&#x27;s not even funny how truly amazing this oil is. I wish I would have used this waay sooner. One of the best oils and its my favorite. Thanks so much for this oil. One extremely happy customer!!</li>
            <li> i will use this oil for moisturizing my skin daily. The price is reasonable. Molivera Organics gave me adequate tips &amp; health benefits of their products.I will buy their products again.</li>
            <li> This oil is simply amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this Sweet Almond oil I just wish it came with a spray pump but the oil itself is so great that I have suggested it to my mother for her skin. I have very dry skin and after using nothing but this oil for a week I have noticed a difference. I am definitely a returning costumer and the emailed tips for natural homemade product that I can use the oil to make are right on point!!</li>
            <li> Very nice oil to use when using essential oils</li>
            <li> Very nice quality oil, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> worked wonderful as a carrier oil for my peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> Love this oil on my hair the most , because of how it soften my hair almost instantly , that&#x27;s what hooked me on this oil.</li>
            <li> Love this on skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Great product and great seller support!  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this oil.</li>
            <li> My new obsession is this oil! I put it on my face and in only one day, you can see a difference. I woke up and my complexion was glowing and it looked like I was wearing foundation. I&#x27;m obsessed with how good it made my skin look and feel. I know ur not supposed to touch ur face but I cant help it coz it&#x27;s so smooth. I also put some in my hair and my hair was so soft. I usually shed a lot of hair when I comb it, but when I combed my hair this morning there were no loose hairs.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite carrier oil now! There&#x27;s no scent which I like because I use it on my face,  and add essential oils to it. It&#x27;s helped to my skin so much!! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again!! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to friends.</li>
            <li> Very high quality Sweet Almond Oil.  Feels very silky on my skin (I&#x27;ve only tested it, I haven&#x27;t made anything with it yet).  It was a nice touch that the seller sent the oil in an amber bottle (to help keep the oil fresh, longer), and the seller also sent a follow-up email with some nice tips for stretching the life of the product.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a better Sweet Almond Oil in a different brand.  Molivera&#x27;s is the one I&#x27;ll be ordering when it&#x27;s time to replenish my supplies.</li>
            <li> love it really great for hair and body !</li>
            <li> Excellent oil. Excellent service.</li>
            <li> i hate to give a product that has received such high ratings something less than excellent, but I wonder about this oil.  There is absolutely no trace of almond fragrance.  Makes me a bit skeptical of its authenticity.  I expected better.</li>
            <li> Great product. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> The oil arrived quickly and was securely packaged. I use the almond oil as a carrier for other essential oils.  It is perfect, not too heavy and the smell is so clean.  Great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I received my order quickly and was pleasantly surprised by what a nice large bottle of oil it was. I also appreciated this company&#x27;s customer service. I love sweet almond oil, and I can tell I will like this brand. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast. Love the product. Doesn&#x27;t take much/</li>
            <li> This is a quality product. The product is not sticky.</li>
            <li> I love the sweet almond oil!&lt;br /&gt;I received the oil quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I will most certainly order again.</li>
            <li> Smooth; not oily, and dissolves into skin</li>
            <li> Love this product!! True to description. Just started using this.  Smells wonderful. Just started applying it to my hair and skin. Love how it feels not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. The value is great.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing! Firstly, I had been going to the dermatologist for 8 months and in those 8 months any topical and oral treatment they gave me had done absolutely nothing for my skin but make it greasier. I have oily, acne-prone, and dry skin, with scarring. Whenever I would use what the dermatologist gave me, my face would be greasy within 2 minutes of putting my makeup on in the morning and extremely greasy throughout the day. I was completely frustrated and felt like I had no hope. But I did research and came across the benefits of sweet almond oil for skin problems and decided I had nothing else to lose. I am SO glad I tried this product because within just 4 days my face is not oily like it used to be. It still does get oily a few hours into the day but it has only been a few days of using this product, so with prolonged use I believe my oily skin will be no more! At first I was hesitant to put oil on my face, thinking it would cause breakouts. But it really just works as a natural moisturizer and absorbs right into my skin. I massage it onto my face right after my shower at night. My face feels hydrated, healthy, and softer. I love this product, it&#x27;s better than the dermatologist!</li>
            <li> Very Nice Company to deal. Sent lot&#x27;s of helpful hints.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that I have been using for the past 2 months both &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; and in mad scientist combinations to make my own body creams that save me money and have no hidden chemicals.  I have had no reaction to the oil especially when used on  or near my face.  Have also used to calm the frizz in my hair with the summer humidity.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil to make home made lotion for my son and I as we have problem skin and needed an alternative.  I decided to try the oil on its own for a few days to make sure it was worth using and BOY was it! Our skin hasn&#x27;t looked or felt this good in ages, the oil itself has no smell and absorbs quickly so you won&#x27;t have to worry about it staining your clothes or feeling greasy. It&#x27;s been working so well in fact I haven&#x27;t gotten around to making the lotion,  it also leaves your hair silky! All in all, great product and price!</li>
            <li> Did not suit my skin, as it started making my sin rough &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It feels light on my very dry skin. It helps soothe my eczema. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> No scent (as expected), quality product packaged well (no leaking like other reviewers described). Product is exactly what I wanted, very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product. Came at reasonable  time. Has a good pour top. Everything  I  expected plus.</li>
            <li> Molivera Organics Sweet Almond Oil has a light, smooth texture. Used with care (a little goes a long way), it absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy. As far as fragrance, there isn&#x27;t one, which in my opinion, makes it extremely versatile - perfect for adding to homemade skin care products... perfect for using with other scented products/colognes, etc... perfect for unisex use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus for me was opening the bottle to find it sealed with a tightly fitted &#x27;plug&#x27; vs. a foil &#x27;sticker&#x27;. This being the case, any leakage seems nearly impossible... a concern whenever I order anything liquid-y online. Although I foresee 16 oz. lasting a long time, I will definitely choose this brand, and vendor again. It was a very happy purchase all around.</li>
            <li> Got shipment quickly. No issues with product.</li>
            <li> Even better than expected. Also appreciate the additional information about benefits of Almond Oil provided by you.</li>
            <li> Use this in my home made lotion!</li>
            <li> Very nice oil. I really was looking for something organic and pure and this is it. Be aware this has no scent at all so if you&#x27;re looking for that wonderful almond smell, this doesnt have it. I add a bit of scented oil to it and then it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Its an excellent product, i noticed changes to my skin almost instantly. Soothed my dry skin and kept it moist all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this oil! Definitely going to order it again!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  Using it with my essential oils. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Excellent, fast delivery , well packaged. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent, came very well packaged and as promised.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I received an email from Molivera Organics giving me all the virtues of Sweet Almond Oil.  Wonderful surprise as I hadn&#x27;t researched it yet and am now really excited to start using it with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil......not too greasy, nice, natural subtle scent, and my skin loves it. Not too sure why the invitation to leave a review suddenly started calling it shea butter; I guess someone got a little carried away with copy &amp; paste functions. I would have given this 5 stars, but I am not sure it is organic. The company name says organic, but I did not see that in the ingredients or elsewhere on the label. Is everything they make organic? I have no idea. I received it in a timely manner, it was well packaged.</li>
            <li> I love this amonld oil all organic light and perfect for my skin care. Fast shipping and great service.</li>
            <li> I had never used sweet almond oil before and decided to give it a try as a carrier oil for essential oils of which I am a newbie.  I have to say that I absolutely LOVE the almond oil!!  I will probably be ordering more in the future, but it does go a long way and does such a great job.  It&#x27;s so easy to massage into the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product but it came with a broken top.  Too much hassle to try to exchange but I have to put it in another container.</li>
            <li> Using for my dark circles. I can say i have been seeing improvement</li>
            <li> Great product, great customer support.</li>
            <li> I have been using sweet almond oil for years as a moisturizer. This is the first time I have purchased Molivera Organics brand and I love it.  I will definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> Good product. I also apply a bit to my hair before I go to bed and massage into scalp. Ive heard almond oil has great benefits for hair.  My hair does seem thicker after a few weeks of use. Either the almond oil or the magnesium supplement is contributing to hair growth. My dark circles seem to have reduced a bit. I will continue to use. one bottle should last at least 5 months. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Worked great in the blends I have mixed.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and the overall buying experience.  I&#x27;m not only very happy with the quality oil, but very impressed with the customer service and follow up.  I will definitely be buying again</li>
            <li> Almond oil makes my skin soft, smooth and comfortable!</li>
            <li> The company is called &#x27;Molivera Organics&#x27;. Yet, the almond oil is, in reality, NOT ORGANIC. If this is not deceptive advertising, I don&#x27;t know what is. Thankful for the Amazon return policy for inaccurate website descriptions, I am returning it for a full refund. Although more expensive, I find Aura Cacia - Certified Organic Skin Care Oil Sweet Almond - 4 oz. to be a superior product. My skin feels better with the Aura Cacia product to warrant the extra cost, plus it us truly organic.</li>
            <li> I like it! Makes my skin very, very soft!</li>
            <li> Fantastic.... I have extremely dry skin. I use it right out of shower when the skin is still wet. My skin stays moisturized for 24 hrs.... very happy with it. Use it on my kids as well. Will buy more when the bottle runs low.</li>
            <li> This is very good oil. When I first put it on at first I thought it was wet and slippery kind of feeling but after a few seconds it went away. My skin is so soft now. I will be using this oil for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> specific uses well described.</li>
            <li> You get a lot of oil for your money plus the bottle is a great design since it works much like a dropper thus preventing waste. I use this under my eyes and as a makeup remover and I love it. I don&#x27;t have severe dark circles or puffiness but have annoying fine lines and moderate discoloration, this keeps it under control.</li>
            <li> Great price and company</li>
