            <li>This is an excellent product!</li>
            <li>I think this will be perfect for blending into the body products I make.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>really great to put on stressed clients to relax!</li>
            <li>Perfect in my aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>I believe from what I read are wonderful.</li>
            <li>i had already put some of the sri-lanka oil in a face mask to wear, delightful.  </li>
            <li>the NOW price is excellent, whereas what i purchased from Nature&#x27;s Gift was $30 for 1/2 ounce.</li>
            <li>What great service here!</li>
            <li>Smells awesome</li>
            <li>I used this to make bath bombs and melts and the scent was perfect.</li>
            <li>I will reiterate: grapeseed is one of the best choices for a carrier oil and works beautifully in this blend.    </li>
            <li>is very good.</li>
            <li>very good quality sandlewood for the price</li>
            <li>good price, nice smell, did the job it was intended for (home made shave oil) and NO allergic reaction!!  </li>
            <li>GREAT FOR MASAGGING MY MOTHERS FEET</li>
            <li>Intelligently, Now chose grapeseed oil as the carrier.</li>
            <li>However, apply this to the skin and it blooms into the wonderful, warm scent you would expect of Sandalwood that lasts &amp; lasts.</li>
            <li>Yay for the elephants &amp; Boo for the great woods.  </li>

            <li>Great scent and price.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bring me joy.</li>
            <li>always a great price.</li>
            <li>I use this for aromatherapy- great in the bathtub or a bit with carrier oil on the skin before bed.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Works great in making my soaps and creams.</li>
            <li>I have an great sense of smell</li>
            <li>I blend this up with coconut oil, Shea butter, and Argan oil to make a great.</li>
            <li>Like lavender, sandalwood is a great balancer when it comes to skin.  </li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
            <li>very warm and woodsy and earthy smell.</li>
            <li>It borders on being downright delicious to those who know and love it.</li>
            <li>Very nice and a good price too.</li>
            <li>They all smelled so strong and delicious, no matter which brand.  </li>
            <li>It would be good to have some sort of description on the page itself that says this oil shouldn&#x27;t be used unless it&#x27;s for those who want to wear it or something.</li>
            <li>The scent warms up well when applied to the skin and it does good things for my beard.  </li>
            <li>The price and quality are fair.</li>
            <li>this oil, at 14% dilution, doesn&#x27;t smell as good.  </li>
            <li>Smells good if you can get the liquid to come out of the container with the necessity to remove  the plastic piece inside.  </li>
            <li>Smell good.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy that I chose to purchase this oil, rather than fall prey to the notion that \\&quot;what costs more must be better.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I do not buy oils on the basis of a more attractive bottle or prettier label.</li>
            <li>I just received this Sandalwood blend and I&#x27;m very pleased with the scent.</li>
            <li>This is one of my very favorite scents.</li>
            <li>am a very satisfied Amazon customer.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and is nice to have</li>
            <li>Good price, nice aroma.</li>
            <li>Yummy, sexy, man-magnet!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering this product again, and LOVE the price point!</li>
            <li>Love this scent!  </li>
            <li>Love this Sandalwood oil!</li>
            <li>This blend is perfect for most uses: wonderful for wearing on the skin, equally great for perking up the scent of sandalwood beads that have lost their fragrance over time, fabulous for meditation, great in a scent ring or your choice of aromatherapy device, lovely to apply before bedtime and drift off into peaceful (and sometimes extraordinary) dreams.    </li>
            <li>Very rich and hearty aroma!</li>
            <li>I am particular about sandalwood scents and this one is very nice and a good value for the price!</li>
            <li>I create my own products and there was no way I could use this oil for them.  </li>
            <li>before you purchase do your own research.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s not supposed to , I don&#x27;t like a lot of scent, but some would be nice.</li>
            <li>I have/am using many NOW EOs and most are great - 5 star, but not this one.</li>
            <li>kind of smells diluted.</li>
            <li>Not as pungent as I would have liked, but it does have a very mild good smell.</li>
            <li>lovely sandalwood- nice quality</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that sandalwood scent is good for the brain; maybe it&#x27;s true; anyway, it can&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great scent and good for general use.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a very mild smell, but it&#x27;s nice to rub on my face after a shave.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this oil.</li>
            <li>This is ok.</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting it to smell more like the incense scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure the bottle has anything in it -</li>
            <li>I expect the scent to be more prominent after the bottle comes to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Sandalwood Oil does have interesting properties &amp; the price</li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>The alcohol smell was more pungent than the sandalwood.</li>
            <li>This really is the most attractive scent I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li>wonderful scent and last a couple of days</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the fragrance and the concentration strength.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed receiving this oil.</li>
            <li>and I love the Now brand.</li>
            <li>I use this as a beard oil and love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this with the intention of using it in cosmetic formulas, lotions etc, but it wont even hold for more than five minutes undiluted on the body as a fragrance oil.  </li>
            <li>This smelled more like grapeseed oil than sandalwood...</li>
            <li>love the oils from NOW.</li>
            <li>so I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The NOW sandalwood is one of their best quality of essential oils and the scent is heavenly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I added a star because as time passes, I am liking the product more.</li>
            <li>If you want a stronger scent, it&#x27;s probably better to splurge on the all-sandalwood variety (this is a blend with a carrier oil).</li>
            <li>smells ok.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>and I usually love the smell of anything sandalwood.</li>
            <li>Sure hope Now dosen&#x27;t keep this one.</li>
            <li>Great stuff very fragrant</li>
            <li>I love  Now brand</li>
            <li>and I love them...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love sandalwood; I also put drops in the tub when I take a bath.</li>
            <li>The blend from Piping Rock is better.</li>
            <li>I have had sandlewood aroma therapy before and love the smell.  </li>
            <li>So soothing to the nerves, and lovely on the skin.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite oils.</li>
            <li>I just need better quality.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love the scent as sometimes I don&#x27;t feel like smelling all flower-y.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy sandalwood, this scent is right on the mark, and works great.</li>
            <li>Now has been pretty good with everything else.</li>
            <li>They arrive safely packaged, in good time, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>You can pay more for a higher-end competitor&#x27;s blend and receive precisely what you will from Now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this instead of spending $60+ on a bottle of undiluted sandalwood oil from another brand, it&#x27;s well worth the savings!</li>
            <li>So it doesn&#x27;t appear that \\&quot;PURE\\&quot; Sandalwood is accessible from many places.  </li>
            <li>Very, very mild smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many from different places and they are always great.</li>
            <li>I love NOW essential oil products and this is a great price</li>
            <li>The body shop perfume oil is brownish, &amp; fragrant &amp; strong but I think that it can poss.</li>
            <li>I thought sandalwood was a strong scent..</li>
            <li>NOW mixes it with Grapeseed oil which is also a wonderful choice as it does not have a fragrance &amp; it does not go rancid quickly, like most other carrier oils.</li>
            <li>As many reviewers noted, there isn&#x27;t much of a smell when you smell it in the bottle, but when you put it on skin, it&#x27;s a very strong sandalwood smell.</li>
            <li>This was fine for my purpose as I was using in cologne and beauty products.</li>
            <li>The smell is not as strong as the straight essential oil but works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>cheap cheap cheap</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of this company and their products.</li>
            <li>NOW has always been a reputable company that offers not only value but excellent quality products.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of oil for different things and these are great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely rare, and becoming more rare.</li>
            <li>I love Now brand and have purchased many of their oils, extracts, and supplements and have found them to be a great value, this on the other hand sadly is not useable.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell very strong, but smells good and significantly cheaper than other sandalwood oils.</li>
            <li>Now is straightforward in their presentation.</li>
            <li>The sandalwood oil has a rich smell.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled to learn more, starting with this sandalwood.</li>
            <li>And yes, I was looking for a cheap, quick fix here as it was pre-</li>
            <li>right to the great value (from someone who purchases LOTS of essential oils, even from wholesalers).  </li>
            <li>I really like all of the other things from the Now brand that I have tried, their supplements are great!</li>
            <li>The grapeseed oil that is used to dilute this is an extremely wise choice, since it doesn&#x27;t go rancid quickly like many other oils, and has no detectable</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable using this oil in my products as no artificial ingredients are included.</li>
            <li>What can be said about true, finest sandalwood that isn&#x27;t known?</li>
            <li>one full ounce</li>
            <li>of all it is reasonable and most people can afford it.  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact I have not been able to use the 100% for quite some time for this very reason.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good for topical use.  </li>
            <li>I really want to see more of a percentage.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say for sure that this stuff is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>This is the scent of true Indian sandalwood.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice, natural tone to it.  </li>
            <li>For a blend it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>all high quality food/ cosmetic grade products and I always feel safe using them.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact this is the very first time I have ever written a product review</li>
            <li>This one had barely any smell and at and it smelled kind of rancid.  </li>
            <li>Strong aromas are problematic as I have a very keen sense of smell.  </li>
            <li>When fresh, it smells (to me) like a mild version of 100% sandalwood oil.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s best not to use this long lasting scent.  </li>
            <li>but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>If sandalwood trees have become rare, they shouldn&#x27;t make this oil at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go ahead and buy another one on here that actually has a good amount of the real oil in it.</li>
            <li>, so I figured it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>Nice overall sandalwood fragrance.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s many more benefits to Sandalwood, so it&#x27;s a highly recommended essential oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good experience with other Now products though</li>
            <li>if the right amount is put on, which I consider a lot compared to some body oils, compared to others (like spearmmint oil)</li>
            <li>Just the right sandalwood fragrance.</li>
            <li>This time I plan to use it right away in lotions and keep any remainder refrigerated.</li>
            <li>I make my own line of facial products, and while I find straight sandalwood oil to be too strong scented and not gentle enough to be put directly on the skin, this blend is perfect to add to my products.</li>
            <li>This is a nice sandalwood oil: pure essential oil diluted in a 14% mix.</li>
            <li>it seems good to early to write an review as its been only 2 days</li>
            <li>I usually have a very acute sense of smell.</li>
            <li>I read several reviews, and was aware of the strong unique smell.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It is very light, warm, and subtle.</li>
            <li>I like this very much and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product, from it&#x27;s amazing scent, it&#x27;s healing properties (physical, mental, spiritual)</li>
            <li>If you already have a preferred brand and price is no object, you will doubtless continue to buy that brand ~ but if, like me, you are seeking high quality and must carefully consider each purchase before making it, you will be congratulating yourself for making the wise choice.     </li>
            <li>Being diluted in a carrier oil, it&#x27;s more subtle, but it&#x27;s the most reasonable product available now.</li>
            <li>I use it first thing in the morning on my skin.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t last on skin more than two or three minutes.</li>
            <li>It has a lasting quality and does not fade for many hours.    </li>
            <li>Will probably purchase a better brand next time.</li>
            <li>very dissapointed and will NEVER buy from them again!  </li>
            <li>I went to Amazon first to check the price.  </li>
            <li>I call it my hot sause</li>
            <li>the more i get into Essential Oils</li>
            <li>the more i get into essential oils.</li>
            <li>Although this is a blended oil, don&#x27;t be fooled:  What you&#x27;ll smell is real sandalwood!</li>
            <li>Great quality, long lasting;)</li>
            <li>and I needed sandalwood fast!</li>
            <li>I said I&#x27;d never use again, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve considered asking for a refund.</li>
            <li>I sometime wonder if NOW essential oils are a potent as others.</li>
            <li>I wish the concentration percentage was higher.</li>
            <li>It serves its purpose very well!</li>
            <li>but if I am right, then the smell of this particular brand should be stronger than it is.</li>
            <li>NOW Foods’ seem to come with the best reviews and so far all the oils are oils of substance and as I test them, they seem to be actual natural oils with limited or no fillers.</li>
            <li>Its just not worth the price for the lack of effective smell.</li>
            <li>True white sandalwood is rapidly becoming an endangered rarity, which is why the pure, unadulterated Essential Oil is so highly priced.</li>
            <li>Just a few drops of the Now Sandalwood oil, spread out over 108 Sandalwood beads, completely revived the beautiful Sandalwood scent of my very old mala.</li>
            <li>If you have been getting their other fine oils, then you know how strong they normally are.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t a pure oil</li>
            <li>I have a bottle of pure sandlewood oil in my purse that costs $100.00 wholesale.  </li>
            <li>You probably can&#x27;t afford pure sandlewood though.</li>
            <li>Now Foods makes some decent oils at very reasonable prices but this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li>I have found Now products to be comparable in quality to many more expensive brands and this is true of their sandalwood blend, as well.</li>
            <li>The dispenser, which is the typical style designed for essential oils, works great for that purpose, however when oil is added to the mix it is a real struggle to get anything out.  </li>
            <li>I was additionally able to purchase some terrific components at a deep discount which were ideal to complete a project I&#x27;ve been working on bit by bit for the past two months.    </li>
            <li>I also knew that some of the Now Foods EOs are of a fairly low quality but that others work just fine for their purpose.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I found it very effective in relaxing and calming me down, which is what I use it for.  </li>
            <li>I feel as though their was way to much jojoba.</li>
            <li>I do like Now Foods oils, however this Sandalwood is diluted too much for what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>It is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>This sandalwood is the Real Deal.</li>
            <li>I find it interesting that, having used many different Sandalwood oils, both in Essential and dilute form and in high-end colognes, this is the only one that does not acquire a bit of \\&quot;fishy\\&quot; quality on my skin.</li>
            <li>Non-dilute sandalwood essence is quite intense.</li>
            <li>PLEASE use this sacred oil appropriately &amp; responsibly given it&#x27;s rarity.</li>
            <li>up very close over a longer time span woody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the real thing . . .</li>
            <li>A product with this much carrier oil is going to need some sort of preservative.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an absolute outrage.</li>
            <li>This is a 14% blend with grape seed oil which is VERY greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin very well.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a shortage worlwide of Sandalwood oil, but they should never cut the product this much.</li>
            <li>Really have to shake the bottle (a la ketchup</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a real sandalwood fragrance</li>
            <li>These all perfume up the clothes in the dryer really well.  </li>
            <li>From the bottle I and my husband didn&#x27;t smell much.</li>
            <li>For the price I&#x27;d expect a much stronger Sandalwood smell, even at 14%.</li>
            <li>I am a regular essential oil user as I have my own business making body products and wellness formulas.</li>
            <li>I used a few drops blended with sea salt as a scented scrub, and am thrilled with the result.</li>
            <li>product is seemingly not as strong scent quality sandlewood/grapeseed mix body perfume oil, nor lasts as long as,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pure oil is priced much too high to be affordable.</li>
            <li>If pure Sandalwood isn&#x27;t in your budget, this is a decent alternative.</li>
            <li>I have ordered other products from this company and was satisfied.</li>
            <li>I usually love sandlewood essential oil, but this one barely smells of sandlewood.</li>
            <li>It is true sandlewood and smells as such.</li>
            <li>Also the dropper didn&#x27;t work at all I had to use up a older oil to switch out the droppers.</li>
            <li>The added bonus of Super Saver shipping was, for me, one more serious consideration.</li>
            <li>That being said, you get what you pay for with this particular product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK for external uses but since it is not USDA approved, I wouldn&#x27;t use internally.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this particular oil.</li>
            <li>For my particular uses, this was a bust.</li>
            <li>I recommend the sandalwood highly.  </li>
            <li>For me, it is what the bottle contains, that is is natural and made with pure, quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>Pure 100% (undiluted) Sandalwood essential oil can be found, at a higher cost.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been expanding my oil collection for a little while now and very glad to finally have some sandalwood oil, has helped with my skin and hair dryness by mixing it in with my shampoo and body wash.</li>
            <li>I do not seem to find the Pachouli to have a strong longevity but the wearer may become immune to scents, and the scent may be knocking other people over?</li>
            <li>the autonomic nervous system associated with the physical body and changes the brain side of things to a state of calm and serenity.  </li>
            <li>Would not recommend purchasing if you love a long lasting scent of sandalwood.</li>
            <li>i purchased this because it was inexpensive enough to take a risk, and i am not entirely unhappy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a little weak, but it is still wonderful.</li>
            <li>Yes, right in the product description it say that it is only a 14% (or about 1/7 strength) blend.</li>
            <li>, it is about the same amount 3 or 4 or 5 drops, it does work, at first smells woody when first applied, then sometime later perhaps musky, than w time it appears to get lite &amp; sweet &amp; perhaps vanillish &amp; femine, from a moderate distance, but</li>
            <li>I smell like a new wood shelf.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found oil at half the price that smell twice as strong as this brand.</li>
            <li>If you are new to Sandalwood oil, I would highly recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Three months later I am still deeply appreciating and enjoying the heavenly scent from the same bottle.</li>
            <li>Much of the so-called pure Sandalwood oil sold in India is anything but pure, and is often adulterated with low quality oils such as cottonseed oil.  </li>
            <li>The oil ratio must be much higher in this Now essential oils.</li>
            <li>Not overwhelming but still still lasts longer than most perfumes</li>
            <li>I used to love sandalwood oil in the past.</li>
            <li>No usually the case with anything sandalwood.  </li>
            <li>Being brand new to essential oils and holistic aromatherapy, I started by buying oils that I felt would benefit me by scent (old familiar scents)to bring back memories or to use as holistic therapy.  </li>
            <li>This IS the real deal, highly sought after \\&quot;Santalum album\\&quot; which can only be found in India.  </li>
            <li>I have other essential oils that are pure and they last alot longer and are more stronger.</li>
            <li>A lot of sandalwood products are blended with citrus, vanilla and other scents, so be aware that what you may think of as &amp;#34;sandalwood&amp;#34; may in fact be a blend of scents, whereas this product is pure sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice, but just too weak.</li>
            <li>but if you are used to 100% pure sandalwood this will probably fall short of your expectations.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had stronger and others I like a little better (I&#x27;d have given it 4 stars but felt I owed an extra to offset my 1.</li>
            <li>The bottle and review link clearly states that it is 14% Sandalwood Oil.</li>
            <li>I put a ton on, and I smelled like sandalwood from very close for only about five minutes before the practically nonexistant smell wore off completely.</li>
            <li>and the oil is big enough to carry top and middle note essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance is dim -</li>
            <li>That means I must use seven times as much to get the same odor density.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;just was not for me, as I am sensitive to smells, will stick with my argan and maracuja oils</li>
            <li>I believe it should be marked .14%.  </li>
            <li>After rubbing some on, I definitely smell it and really like it.</li>
            <li>The carrier oil has no scent and a nice, thin, silky texture.</li>
            <li>Essential Oils are usually almost too strong to use as perfume, and they certainly linger.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to using pure, undiluted sandalwood essential oil, please understand that this is a dilution and the scent is probably going to be more subtle than you&#x27;re used to.</li>
            <li>I have tried both the more expensive brands and the cheaper ones, but NOW strikes the right balance between price and quality.  </li>
            <li>but now it is on the internet for about double to triple the original price, prob because world wide sandalwood is overused &amp; depleated, in some instances it is advertized as the discontinued body shop body perfume oil, in some cases that is not mentioned.</li>
            <li>The rich sandalwood smell is missing.  </li>
            <li>It should also be noted that this particular Indian Sandalwood tree that produces &#x27;Santalum album&#x27; is currently under protection by the Indian government in an attempt to stop endangerment.  </li>
            <li>The oil is a little thick for the dropper top (I have to sling it firmly and carefully to dispense it), but I find the scent very nice.</li>
            <li>Also, Sandalwood is one of the very few essential oils whose scent gets BETTER with age.  </li>
            <li>I am normally happy with NOW Foods products, but this oil is a little weak.  </li>
            <li>I promptly ordered several bottles, duely noting that it was only 14% sandlewood oil (most are only 10%).  </li>
            <li>now I am tolerating a game of basketball that is being played outside my bedroom window with a lot more patience than before I took this sandlewood oil!</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell by itself (though I have no doubt it&#x27;s true to how sandalwood should smell).</li>
            <li>I guess I was just hoping that the pure stuff was so strong that even at this weak dilution there would be enough fragrance.</li>
            <li>Essential oils have their place secured in a natural beauty routine; they are natural, chemical-free alternatives.</li>
            <li>It certainly is not as aromatic as pure sandlewood oil, but that also suits me find.</li>
            <li>and I could barely make out any scent with the open bottle directly under my nose.  </li>
            <li>Barely has hint of sandal wood.</li>
            <li>The oil barely smells like anything-</li>
            <li>that information I turned to others that I wholesale with and was presently surprised to find that NOW carried essential oils, including sandlewood oil.  </li>
            <li>barely sandalwood scent at all.</li>
            <li>I can barely smell the sandalwood.</li>
            <li>I knew this was a blend before I purchased it, but I can barely smell any Sandalwood at all.  </li>
            <li>This oil was overly diluted and I could barely make out the scent of sandalwood at all.</li>
            <li>Even when applied directly to skin in multiple places, smell fades after a couple hours.</li>
            <li>I bought this a few months ago, and it was not the same as the one of the exact same brand and size that I had purchased in a whole foods store.</li>
            <li>Can barely smell the sandalwood.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s in a solution and not pure, the scent is no super strong and the nozzle is extremely tricky to get much oil out of.</li>
            <li>So I am aware that a diluted product will be less fragrant, hence the lower cost.</li>
            <li>Judging from some of the other reviews, people don&#x27;t have much experience with Sandalwood oil.</li>
            <li>grapeseed does not \\&quot;go rancid\\&quot; as many other carriers will and does not modify the sandalwood fragrance in any way (other than the expected dilution).    </li>
            <li>The scent is simply smell and offers no further benefit.  </li>
            <li>I used this in my batch of cold processed soap and it gave it a nice soft woody smell.</li>
            <li>far more expensive</li>
            <li>some people can not tell the diff between the Woody Sandalwood &amp; the Pachouli, but I dont think the Pachouli is as woody or lasts near as long.</li>
            <li>If you will add a few drops of Rescue remedy (A Bach Flower Remedy-Homeopahtic-which can be found at any health food store) under the tongue you will find a very quiet peaceful place within you in which to deal with stressful situations.&lt;br /&gt;Right</li>
            <li>I was really dissapointed to find this had little or no frangrence to it.</li>

            <li> What great service here!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome</li>
            <li> I used this to make bath bombs and melts and the scent was perfect.</li>
            <li> I will reiterate: grapeseed is one of the best choices for a carrier oil and works beautifully in this blend.    </li>
            <li> is very good.</li>
            <li> very good quality sandlewood for the price</li>
            <li> good price, nice smell, did the job it was intended for (home made shave oil) and NO allergic reaction!!  </li>
            <li> GREAT FOR MASAGGING MY MOTHERS FEET</li>
            <li> Intelligently, Now chose grapeseed oil as the carrier.</li>
            <li> However, apply this to the skin and it blooms into the wonderful, warm scent you would expect of Sandalwood that lasts &amp; lasts.</li>
            <li> Yay for the elephants &amp; Boo for the great woods.  </li>

            <li> always a great price.</li>
            <li> I use this for aromatherapy- great in the bathtub or a bit with carrier oil on the skin before bed.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> Works great in making my soaps and creams.</li>
            <li> I have an great sense of smell</li>
            <li> I blend this up with coconut oil, Shea butter, and Argan oil to make a great.</li>
            <li> Like lavender, sandalwood is a great balancer when it comes to skin.  </li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
            <li> very warm and woodsy and earthy smell.</li>
            <li> It borders on being downright delicious to those who know and love it.</li>
            <li> Very nice and a good price too.</li>
            <li> They all smelled so strong and delicious, no matter which brand.  </li>
            <li> It would be good to have some sort of description on the page itself that says this oil shouldn&#x27;t be used unless it&#x27;s for those who want to wear it or something.</li>
            <li> The scent warms up well when applied to the skin and it does good things for my beard.  </li>
            <li> The price and quality are fair.</li>
            <li> this oil, at 14% dilution, doesn&#x27;t smell as good.  </li>
            <li> Smells good if you can get the liquid to come out of the container with the necessity to remove  the plastic piece inside.  </li>
            <li> Smell good.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy that I chose to purchase this oil, rather than fall prey to the notion that \\&quot;what costs more must be better.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I do not buy oils on the basis of a more attractive bottle or prettier label.</li>
            <li> I just received this Sandalwood blend and I&#x27;m very pleased with the scent.</li>
            <li> This is one of my very favorite scents.</li>
            <li> am a very satisfied Amazon customer.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and is nice to have</li>
            <li> Good price, nice aroma.</li>
            <li> Yummy, sexy, man-magnet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering this product again, and LOVE the price point!</li>
            <li> Love this scent!  </li>
            <li> Love this Sandalwood oil!</li>
            <li> This blend is perfect for most uses: wonderful for wearing on the skin, equally great for perking up the scent of sandalwood beads that have lost their fragrance over time, fabulous for meditation, great in a scent ring or your choice of aromatherapy device, lovely to apply before bedtime and drift off into peaceful (and sometimes extraordinary) dreams.    </li>
            <li> Very rich and hearty aroma!</li>
            <li> I am particular about sandalwood scents and this one is very nice and a good value for the price!</li>
            <li> I create my own products and there was no way I could use this oil for them.  </li>
            <li> before you purchase do your own research.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s not supposed to , I don&#x27;t like a lot of scent, but some would be nice.</li>
            <li> I have/am using many NOW EOs and most are great - 5 star, but not this one.</li>
            <li> kind of smells diluted.</li>
            <li> Not as pungent as I would have liked, but it does have a very mild good smell.</li>
            <li> lovely sandalwood- nice quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that sandalwood scent is good for the brain; maybe it&#x27;s true; anyway, it can&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great scent and good for general use.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a very mild smell, but it&#x27;s nice to rub on my face after a shave.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this oil.</li>
            <li> This is ok.</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting it to smell more like the incense scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure the bottle has anything in it -</li>
            <li> I expect the scent to be more prominent after the bottle comes to room temperature.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood Oil does have interesting properties &amp; the price</li>
            <li> This product is ok.</li>
            <li> The alcohol smell was more pungent than the sandalwood.</li>
            <li> This really is the most attractive scent I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li> wonderful scent and last a couple of days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the fragrance and the concentration strength.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed receiving this oil.</li>
            <li> and I love the Now brand.</li>
            <li> I use this as a beard oil and love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the intention of using it in cosmetic formulas, lotions etc, but it wont even hold for more than five minutes undiluted on the body as a fragrance oil.  </li>
            <li> This smelled more like grapeseed oil than sandalwood...</li>
            <li> love the oils from NOW.</li>
            <li> so I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The NOW sandalwood is one of their best quality of essential oils and the scent is heavenly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I added a star because as time passes, I am liking the product more.</li>
            <li> If you want a stronger scent, it&#x27;s probably better to splurge on the all-sandalwood variety (this is a blend with a carrier oil).</li>
            <li> smells ok.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> and I usually love the smell of anything sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Sure hope Now dosen&#x27;t keep this one.</li>
            <li> Great stuff very fragrant</li>
            <li> I love  Now brand</li>
            <li> and I love them...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love sandalwood; I also put drops in the tub when I take a bath.</li>
            <li> The blend from Piping Rock is better.</li>
            <li> I have had sandlewood aroma therapy before and love the smell.  </li>
            <li> So soothing to the nerves, and lovely on the skin.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite oils.</li>
            <li> I just need better quality.</li>
            <li> Plus, I love the scent as sometimes I don&#x27;t feel like smelling all flower-y.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy sandalwood, this scent is right on the mark, and works great.</li>
            <li> Now has been pretty good with everything else.</li>
            <li> They arrive safely packaged, in good time, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> You can pay more for a higher-end competitor&#x27;s blend and receive precisely what you will from Now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this instead of spending $60+ on a bottle of undiluted sandalwood oil from another brand, it&#x27;s well worth the savings!</li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t appear that \\&quot;PURE\\&quot; Sandalwood is accessible from many places.  </li>
            <li> Very, very mild smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many from different places and they are always great.</li>
            <li> I love NOW essential oil products and this is a great price</li>
            <li> The body shop perfume oil is brownish, &amp; fragrant &amp; strong but I think that it can poss.</li>
            <li> I thought sandalwood was a strong scent..</li>
            <li> NOW mixes it with Grapeseed oil which is also a wonderful choice as it does not have a fragrance &amp; it does not go rancid quickly, like most other carrier oils.</li>
            <li> As many reviewers noted, there isn&#x27;t much of a smell when you smell it in the bottle, but when you put it on skin, it&#x27;s a very strong sandalwood smell.</li>
            <li> This was fine for my purpose as I was using in cologne and beauty products.</li>
            <li> The smell is not as strong as the straight essential oil but works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> cheap cheap cheap</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of this company and their products.</li>
            <li> NOW has always been a reputable company that offers not only value but excellent quality products.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of oil for different things and these are great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely rare, and becoming more rare.</li>
            <li> I love Now brand and have purchased many of their oils, extracts, and supplements and have found them to be a great value, this on the other hand sadly is not useable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very strong, but smells good and significantly cheaper than other sandalwood oils.</li>
            <li> Now is straightforward in their presentation.</li>
            <li> The sandalwood oil has a rich smell.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled to learn more, starting with this sandalwood.</li>
            <li> And yes, I was looking for a cheap, quick fix here as it was pre-</li>
            <li> right to the great value (from someone who purchases LOTS of essential oils, even from wholesalers).  </li>
            <li> I really like all of the other things from the Now brand that I have tried, their supplements are great!</li>
            <li> The grapeseed oil that is used to dilute this is an extremely wise choice, since it doesn&#x27;t go rancid quickly like many other oils, and has no detectable</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable using this oil in my products as no artificial ingredients are included.</li>
            <li> What can be said about true, finest sandalwood that isn&#x27;t known?</li>
            <li> one full ounce</li>
            <li> of all it is reasonable and most people can afford it.  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact I have not been able to use the 100% for quite some time for this very reason.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good for topical use.  </li>
            <li> I really want to see more of a percentage.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say for sure that this stuff is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> This is the scent of true Indian sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice, natural tone to it.  </li>
            <li> For a blend it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> all high quality food/ cosmetic grade products and I always feel safe using them.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact this is the very first time I have ever written a product review</li>
            <li> This one had barely any smell and at and it smelled kind of rancid.  </li>
            <li> Strong aromas are problematic as I have a very keen sense of smell.  </li>
            <li> When fresh, it smells (to me) like a mild version of 100% sandalwood oil.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s best not to use this long lasting scent.  </li>
            <li> but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> If sandalwood trees have become rare, they shouldn&#x27;t make this oil at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go ahead and buy another one on here that actually has a good amount of the real oil in it.</li>
            <li> , so I figured it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> Nice overall sandalwood fragrance.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s many more benefits to Sandalwood, so it&#x27;s a highly recommended essential oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good experience with other Now products though</li>
            <li> if the right amount is put on, which I consider a lot compared to some body oils, compared to others (like spearmmint oil)</li>
            <li> Just the right sandalwood fragrance.</li>
            <li> This time I plan to use it right away in lotions and keep any remainder refrigerated.</li>
            <li> I make my own line of facial products, and while I find straight sandalwood oil to be too strong scented and not gentle enough to be put directly on the skin, this blend is perfect to add to my products.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sandalwood oil: pure essential oil diluted in a 14% mix.</li>
            <li> it seems good to early to write an review as its been only 2 days</li>
            <li> I usually have a very acute sense of smell.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews, and was aware of the strong unique smell.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It is very light, warm, and subtle.</li>
            <li> I like this very much and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product, from it&#x27;s amazing scent, it&#x27;s healing properties (physical, mental, spiritual)</li>
            <li> If you already have a preferred brand and price is no object, you will doubtless continue to buy that brand ~ but if, like me, you are seeking high quality and must carefully consider each purchase before making it, you will be congratulating yourself for making the wise choice.     </li>
            <li> Being diluted in a carrier oil, it&#x27;s more subtle, but it&#x27;s the most reasonable product available now.</li>
            <li> I use it first thing in the morning on my skin.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last on skin more than two or three minutes.</li>
            <li> It has a lasting quality and does not fade for many hours.    </li>
            <li> Will probably purchase a better brand next time.</li>
            <li> very dissapointed and will NEVER buy from them again!  </li>
            <li> I went to Amazon first to check the price.  </li>
            <li> I call it my hot sause</li>
            <li> the more i get into Essential Oils</li>
            <li> the more i get into essential oils.</li>
            <li> Although this is a blended oil, don&#x27;t be fooled:  What you&#x27;ll smell is real sandalwood!</li>
            <li> Great quality, long lasting;)</li>
            <li> and I needed sandalwood fast!</li>
            <li> I said I&#x27;d never use again, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve considered asking for a refund.</li>
            <li> I sometime wonder if NOW essential oils are a potent as others.</li>
            <li> I wish the concentration percentage was higher.</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose very well!</li>
            <li> but if I am right, then the smell of this particular brand should be stronger than it is.</li>
            <li> NOW Foods’ seem to come with the best reviews and so far all the oils are oils of substance and as I test them, they seem to be actual natural oils with limited or no fillers.</li>
            <li> Its just not worth the price for the lack of effective smell.</li>
            <li> True white sandalwood is rapidly becoming an endangered rarity, which is why the pure, unadulterated Essential Oil is so highly priced.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops of the Now Sandalwood oil, spread out over 108 Sandalwood beads, completely revived the beautiful Sandalwood scent of my very old mala.</li>
            <li> If you have been getting their other fine oils, then you know how strong they normally are.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t a pure oil</li>
            <li> I have a bottle of pure sandlewood oil in my purse that costs $100.00 wholesale.  </li>
            <li> You probably can&#x27;t afford pure sandlewood though.</li>
            <li> Now Foods makes some decent oils at very reasonable prices but this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> I have found Now products to be comparable in quality to many more expensive brands and this is true of their sandalwood blend, as well.</li>
            <li> The dispenser, which is the typical style designed for essential oils, works great for that purpose, however when oil is added to the mix it is a real struggle to get anything out.  </li>
            <li> I was additionally able to purchase some terrific components at a deep discount which were ideal to complete a project I&#x27;ve been working on bit by bit for the past two months.    </li>
            <li> I also knew that some of the Now Foods EOs are of a fairly low quality but that others work just fine for their purpose.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I found it very effective in relaxing and calming me down, which is what I use it for.  </li>
            <li> I feel as though their was way to much jojoba.</li>
            <li> I do like Now Foods oils, however this Sandalwood is diluted too much for what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> It is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> This sandalwood is the Real Deal.</li>
            <li> I find it interesting that, having used many different Sandalwood oils, both in Essential and dilute form and in high-end colognes, this is the only one that does not acquire a bit of \\&quot;fishy\\&quot; quality on my skin.</li>
            <li> Non-dilute sandalwood essence is quite intense.</li>
            <li> PLEASE use this sacred oil appropriately &amp; responsibly given it&#x27;s rarity.</li>
            <li> up very close over a longer time span woody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the real thing . . .</li>
            <li> A product with this much carrier oil is going to need some sort of preservative.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an absolute outrage.</li>
            <li> This is a 14% blend with grape seed oil which is VERY greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin very well.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a shortage worlwide of Sandalwood oil, but they should never cut the product this much.</li>
            <li> Really have to shake the bottle (a la ketchup</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a real sandalwood fragrance</li>
            <li> These all perfume up the clothes in the dryer really well.  </li>
            <li> From the bottle I and my husband didn&#x27;t smell much.</li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;d expect a much stronger Sandalwood smell, even at 14%.</li>
            <li> I am a regular essential oil user as I have my own business making body products and wellness formulas.</li>
            <li> I used a few drops blended with sea salt as a scented scrub, and am thrilled with the result.</li>
            <li> product is seemingly not as strong scent quality sandlewood/grapeseed mix body perfume oil, nor lasts as long as,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pure oil is priced much too high to be affordable.</li>
            <li> If pure Sandalwood isn&#x27;t in your budget, this is a decent alternative.</li>
            <li> I have ordered other products from this company and was satisfied.</li>
            <li> I usually love sandlewood essential oil, but this one barely smells of sandlewood.</li>
            <li> It is true sandlewood and smells as such.</li>
            <li> Also the dropper didn&#x27;t work at all I had to use up a older oil to switch out the droppers.</li>
            <li> The added bonus of Super Saver shipping was, for me, one more serious consideration.</li>
            <li> That being said, you get what you pay for with this particular product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK for external uses but since it is not USDA approved, I wouldn&#x27;t use internally.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this particular oil.</li>
            <li> For my particular uses, this was a bust.</li>
            <li> I recommend the sandalwood highly.  </li>
            <li> For me, it is what the bottle contains, that is is natural and made with pure, quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> Pure 100% (undiluted) Sandalwood essential oil can be found, at a higher cost.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been expanding my oil collection for a little while now and very glad to finally have some sandalwood oil, has helped with my skin and hair dryness by mixing it in with my shampoo and body wash.</li>
            <li> I do not seem to find the Pachouli to have a strong longevity but the wearer may become immune to scents, and the scent may be knocking other people over?</li>
            <li> the autonomic nervous system associated with the physical body and changes the brain side of things to a state of calm and serenity.  </li>
            <li> Would not recommend purchasing if you love a long lasting scent of sandalwood.</li>
            <li> i purchased this because it was inexpensive enough to take a risk, and i am not entirely unhappy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a little weak, but it is still wonderful.</li>
            <li> Yes, right in the product description it say that it is only a 14% (or about 1/7 strength) blend.</li>
            <li> , it is about the same amount 3 or 4 or 5 drops, it does work, at first smells woody when first applied, then sometime later perhaps musky, than w time it appears to get lite &amp; sweet &amp; perhaps vanillish &amp; femine, from a moderate distance, but</li>
            <li> I smell like a new wood shelf.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found oil at half the price that smell twice as strong as this brand.</li>
            <li> If you are new to Sandalwood oil, I would highly recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Three months later I am still deeply appreciating and enjoying the heavenly scent from the same bottle.</li>
            <li> Much of the so-called pure Sandalwood oil sold in India is anything but pure, and is often adulterated with low quality oils such as cottonseed oil.  </li>
            <li> The oil ratio must be much higher in this Now essential oils.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming but still still lasts longer than most perfumes</li>
            <li> I used to love sandalwood oil in the past.</li>
            <li> No usually the case with anything sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> Being brand new to essential oils and holistic aromatherapy, I started by buying oils that I felt would benefit me by scent (old familiar scents)to bring back memories or to use as holistic therapy.  </li>
            <li> This IS the real deal, highly sought after \\&quot;Santalum album\\&quot; which can only be found in India.  </li>
            <li> I have other essential oils that are pure and they last alot longer and are more stronger.</li>
            <li> A lot of sandalwood products are blended with citrus, vanilla and other scents, so be aware that what you may think of as &amp;#34;sandalwood&amp;#34; may in fact be a blend of scents, whereas this product is pure sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice, but just too weak.</li>
            <li> but if you are used to 100% pure sandalwood this will probably fall short of your expectations.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had stronger and others I like a little better (I&#x27;d have given it 4 stars but felt I owed an extra to offset my 1.</li>
            <li> The bottle and review link clearly states that it is 14% Sandalwood Oil.</li>
            <li> I put a ton on, and I smelled like sandalwood from very close for only about five minutes before the practically nonexistant smell wore off completely.</li>
            <li> and the oil is big enough to carry top and middle note essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance is dim -</li>
            <li> That means I must use seven times as much to get the same odor density.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;just was not for me, as I am sensitive to smells, will stick with my argan and maracuja oils</li>
            <li> I believe it should be marked .14%.  </li>
            <li> After rubbing some on, I definitely smell it and really like it.</li>
            <li> The carrier oil has no scent and a nice, thin, silky texture.</li>
            <li> Essential Oils are usually almost too strong to use as perfume, and they certainly linger.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to using pure, undiluted sandalwood essential oil, please understand that this is a dilution and the scent is probably going to be more subtle than you&#x27;re used to.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the more expensive brands and the cheaper ones, but NOW strikes the right balance between price and quality.  </li>
            <li> but now it is on the internet for about double to triple the original price, prob because world wide sandalwood is overused &amp; depleated, in some instances it is advertized as the discontinued body shop body perfume oil, in some cases that is not mentioned.</li>
            <li> The rich sandalwood smell is missing.  </li>
            <li> It should also be noted that this particular Indian Sandalwood tree that produces &#x27;Santalum album&#x27; is currently under protection by the Indian government in an attempt to stop endangerment.  </li>
            <li> The oil is a little thick for the dropper top (I have to sling it firmly and carefully to dispense it), but I find the scent very nice.</li>
            <li> Also, Sandalwood is one of the very few essential oils whose scent gets BETTER with age.  </li>
            <li> I am normally happy with NOW Foods products, but this oil is a little weak.  </li>
            <li> I promptly ordered several bottles, duely noting that it was only 14% sandlewood oil (most are only 10%).  </li>
            <li> now I am tolerating a game of basketball that is being played outside my bedroom window with a lot more patience than before I took this sandlewood oil!</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell by itself (though I have no doubt it&#x27;s true to how sandalwood should smell).</li>
            <li> I guess I was just hoping that the pure stuff was so strong that even at this weak dilution there would be enough fragrance.</li>
            <li> Essential oils have their place secured in a natural beauty routine; they are natural, chemical-free alternatives.</li>
            <li> It certainly is not as aromatic as pure sandlewood oil, but that also suits me find.</li>
            <li> and I could barely make out any scent with the open bottle directly under my nose.  </li>
            <li> Barely has hint of sandal wood.</li>
            <li> The oil barely smells like anything-</li>
            <li> that information I turned to others that I wholesale with and was presently surprised to find that NOW carried essential oils, including sandlewood oil.  </li>
            <li> barely sandalwood scent at all.</li>
            <li> I can barely smell the sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I knew this was a blend before I purchased it, but I can barely smell any Sandalwood at all.  </li>
            <li> This oil was overly diluted and I could barely make out the scent of sandalwood at all.</li>
            <li> Even when applied directly to skin in multiple places, smell fades after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago, and it was not the same as the one of the exact same brand and size that I had purchased in a whole foods store.</li>
            <li> Can barely smell the sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s in a solution and not pure, the scent is no super strong and the nozzle is extremely tricky to get much oil out of.</li>
            <li> So I am aware that a diluted product will be less fragrant, hence the lower cost.</li>
            <li> Judging from some of the other reviews, people don&#x27;t have much experience with Sandalwood oil.</li>
            <li> grapeseed does not \\&quot;go rancid\\&quot; as many other carriers will and does not modify the sandalwood fragrance in any way (other than the expected dilution).    </li>
            <li> The scent is simply smell and offers no further benefit.  </li>
            <li> I used this in my batch of cold processed soap and it gave it a nice soft woody smell.</li>
            <li> far more expensive</li>
            <li> some people can not tell the diff between the Woody Sandalwood &amp; the Pachouli, but I dont think the Pachouli is as woody or lasts near as long.</li>
            <li> If you will add a few drops of Rescue remedy (A Bach Flower Remedy-Homeopahtic-which can be found at any health food store) under the tongue you will find a very quiet peaceful place within you in which to deal with stressful situations.&lt;br /&gt;Right</li>
            <li> I was really dissapointed to find this had little or no frangrence to it.</li>
            <li> I tried adding to my bath and even shaking it directly over my hand, almost nothing came out and there was certainly no scent.  </li>
            <li> It takes nearly 100 years for the Sandalwood trees to reach maturity for the oil to be taken from it&#x27;s roots and today&#x27;s black market trade has caused poachers to drop ivory trade &amp; go hacking down young Sandalwood trees, ravishing the supply now &amp; completely endangering their future.</li>
            <li> I would not spend nearly $100 for 1oz of pure extract but this dilution is simply too weak.</li>
            <li> It claims to be pure sandalwood, but read the small print (and smell it)and it has another oil with &amp;#34;pure sandalwood&amp;#34; added to it.  </li>
            <li> so you can respond to them without becoming emotionally vulnerable.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I was hoping a few drops in my hot bath would do the trick as other extracts do.</li>
            <li> The sent does not last very long, but I like the sent and everybody else in the office likes the sent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to use the entire bottle in a single batch to get the desired outcome.  </li>
            <li> I have to agree with several other reviewers that this just doesn&#x27;t have enough scent or staying power.  </li>
            <li> The smell lasts a long time but doesn&#x27;t have a lot of projection.</li>
            <li> The scent does not linger long, unless a certian amount suiting the mixture is applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it simply wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> I waited too long to return it.  </li>
            <li> The end user could squeeze the contents of a gelcap of vitamin E into a freshly opened bottle of this in order to slow down the rancidity.</li>
            <li> so you can take that to mean that I am very satified with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> This particular oil was not very fragrant however and I was not pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is clear, the scent is very, very faint, &amp; the scent is not as evident once applied topically to the body.</li>
            <li> and I already have a big bottle of that that I paid less for.  </li>
            <li> Smell was not as strong as I needed it to be for my cold press soap.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the aroma not like any sandalwood I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, whatever type of oil they put in that little bottle, it definitely was NOT sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like I expected.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.  </li>
            <li> This just... doesn&#x27;t smell the way I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Not much of a smell.  </li>
            <li> it is just now, in the last few days, that i have considered it for its scent.  </li>
            <li> I like it a lot,but it is not real fragrant.</li>
            <li> Perfume was there only for 2 weeks, but after that no sandalwood smell just plain oil smell.</li>
            <li> I knew it was not pure sandalwood oil when I bought it</li>
            <li> Sandalwood scent is not strong enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faint enough that I can rub this directly onto my hands and forget less than an hour later.</li>
            <li> Two of them being \\&quot;rare and subsequently expensive\\&quot;; while the third is almost extinct and therefore expensive when found.  </li>
            <li> Other sites to consider - http://www.youngliving.com/en_US/products/essential-oils/singles/royal-hawaiian-sandalwood-5ml ;</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a more fragrant oil and am disappointed.</li>
            <li> product itself and its other uses</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d read them again before leaving my other review.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find an edit or delete button on the other and don&#x27;t see it posted here</li>
            <li> So, while for other users and their purposes it may have worked, using it in body products does not.</li>
            <li> Has hardly any smell..guess I should&#x27;ve expected that with it only being 14% sandalwood...</li>
            <li> Pure sandalwood oil is a bit too expensive, so I like this blend option.</li>
            <li> I expected the scent of this sandalwood essential oil would be subtle, but I could not detect any scent whatsoever.</li>
            <li> once an approiate scent is applied both the Now Sandalwood oil &amp; the Pachouli Oil may have about the same longevity it is hard to tell, but neither have the longevity of body shop WOODY SANDALWOOD.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really hard to actually get any of it to come out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Then after it sat on my shelf for a few months, which is really not that long for a bottle this size at all, the oil stopped smelling like anything but old stale vegetable oil.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have to stick my nose into the bottle to get the scent.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have to dump so much into my bath</li>
            <li> I have to agree with those that give this one a thumbs down.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely keen sense of smell and it tells me I was ripped off!</li>
            <li> I opened the bottle right from the package, which was cold</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a perfume and it is not very strong.  </li>
            <li> Not very strong-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very strong scent,</li>
            <li> is somewhat odd.    </li>
            <li> It seems that less Pachouli oil is needed than Now Sandalwood oil for a lingering sent, but</li>
            <li> And not in the typical Mysore way.</li>
            <li> I smell slight sandalwood from it.  </li>
            <li> After using nearly half the bottle in 8 oz of scrub and still not smelling anything, I had to toss it out.</li>
            <li> I was literally FORCED to write a review after seeing the negative comments about this product that I&#x27;ve been buying directly from NOW Foods for years.  </li>
            <li> It has become rare, very expensive, and counterfeit sandlewood is everywhere.  </li>
            <li> This type of sandalwood is from India and has a less harsh note that the one from Australia.  </li>
            <li> I agree with others that the scent is a bit weak but what scent there is does seem to last</li>
            <li> There was little to no smell at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m astounded at how little fragrance there is, or should I say, isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> If anything this smells like there was a little sandalwood</li>
            <li> so I have not been in the market to buy any sandlewood oil in a few years.</li>
            <li> No smell, a waste of your money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of sandalwood in liquid starch to iron sheets (a sickness of mine, but don&#x27;t sneer if you have never slipped into ironed, starched, and scented sheets.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> For those with combination skin, try adding a few drops to your toner or moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> really just poor communication on their part and poor education on my part.</li>
            <li> So to compare this with a store scented \\&quot;Sandalwood\\&quot; is not accurately comparing apples to apples, sort to speak.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not strong and it blended in a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this to wear instead of the patchouli oil I usually wear to change it up a little.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;There is a very faint scent of something, but not like any sandalwood I have ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few lower quality oils in the past</li>
            <li> however the scent of sandalwood in this blend is so faint that it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Very, very little aroma...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately we had to send this back</li>
            <li> There is only a faint odor of sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with now essential oils.</li>
            <li> The scent in this is so faint, and might last 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I usually use the Now brand of cinnamon, cedar, lemongrass, ect.  </li>
            <li> So-so smell, not top grade.</li>
            <li> but when I use this sandalwood it&#x27;s so diluted it hardly lasts.</li>
            <li> Hardly smell anything</li>
            <li> Can I give this product negative stars?</li>
            <li> diluted in grape seed so is thick, I remove stopper because it will get clogged.</li>
            <li> This one has been watered down to the point that it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> I hate leaving a negative review and that made me come back and look again at what others have said</li>
            <li> Really weak smelling.  </li>
            <li> It was difficult to pour because the spout was too small.</li>
            <li> I am no longer disappointed in my purchase and my apologies for the earlier review!</li>
            <li> It comes out very slowly</li>
            <li> just poor communication.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a bogus, falsely advertised product.  </li>
            <li> Sandalwood is a base note in fragrances due to its staying power, while it&#x27;s scent can be subtle in a blend.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for very subtle scent</li>
            <li> Disappointed a little.  </li>
            <li> The oil had a very weak smell.</li>
            <li> It had a very weak smell if any at times.</li>
            <li> Very weak and smells off.</li>
            <li> I am wrong about how it should smell</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> This one has a faint smell but it is an oil blend</li>
            <li> Sandalwood is typically extremely expensive and therefore often sold in a diluted form.</li>
            <li> and if it were it would have been outrageously expensive</li>
            <li> Very poor scent.</li>
            <li> Some corporate suit at Now Foods deserves a Dirty Sanchez for putting this pathetic blend on the market.</li>
            <li> Unhappy with quality.</li>
            <li> This is extremely disappointing and not at all what I have come to expect from Now.</li>
            <li> In the defense of Sandalwood, it is VERY difficult to obtain as a 100% oil.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is there, but VERY faint.  </li>
            <li> Really bad in a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> a novice, buying sandlewood for soap making, will be extremely disappointed because there is almost no scent discernible when the bottle is opened.</li>
            <li> Disappointing!</li>
            <li> I buy couple of products from Now, but with this one I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this oil.</li>
            <li> :-((</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> So if you do however want to mix it with a moisturizer I learned also read up on it, before ordering, so it won;t interfear with your moisturizer and you may want to read up on what base oils are as it is often recommended to mix sandlewood with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now has never sold me any oils that were this diluted and worthless.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Affordable. Love the smell of this oil. I use it first thing in the morning on my skin.</li>
            <li> I usually love sandlewood essential oil, but this one barely smells of sandlewood. I feel as though their was way to much jojoba.</li>
            <li> I do like Now Foods oils, however this Sandalwood is diluted too much for what I paid for it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is ok. Didn&#x27;t smell like I expected. I guess I was expecting it to smell more like the incense scent.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last on skin more than two or three minutes. Unhappy with quality. Would not recommend purchasing if you love a long lasting scent of sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Excellent, as NOW products always are.</li>
            <li> There is literally no scent to this oil. Very disappointed.  Essential Oils are usually almost too strong to use as perfume, and they certainly linger.  This one smells like it is cut with 99.9% water.  I tried adding to my bath and even shaking it directly over my hand, almost nothing came out and there was certainly no scent.  I&#x27;m not even sure the bottle has anything in it - when I shake it I hear nothing.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s in a solution and not pure, the scent is no super strong and the nozzle is extremely tricky to get much oil out of.</li>
            <li> Deceptive. Purchased to use in a diffuser. Only 14% is sandalwood oil. Rest is grape seed.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR MASAGGING MY MOTHERS FEET</li>
            <li> This smells just like the sandalwood that my mom used to have.  It is the real deal.  This type of sandalwood is from India and has a less harsh note that the one from Australia.  The smell lasts a long time but doesn&#x27;t have a lot of projection. It may become stronger over time?  I know that when making perfume the smells tend to intensify and change.  I like this very much and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not as pungent as I would have liked, but it does have a very mild good smell.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sandalwood oil: pure essential oil diluted in a 14% mix. I feel comfortable using this oil in my products as no artificial ingredients are included.</li>
            <li> I agree with others that the scent is a bit weak but what scent there is does seem to last and the oil is big enough to carry top and middle note essential oils.  For a blend it&#x27;s not bad but if you are used to 100% pure sandalwood this will probably fall short of your expectations.  If pure Sandalwood isn&#x27;t in your budget, this is a decent alternative.</li>
            <li> Barely has hint of sandal wood. I work in a store in which we sell sandalwood scented products and they smell nothing as week as this. Also the dropper didn&#x27;t work at all I had to use up a older oil to switch out the droppers. DO NOT RECOMMEND. You get what you pay for it isn&#x27;t a pure oil it is mixed.</li>
            <li> This sandalwood is the Real Deal. The bottle and review link clearly states that it is 14% Sandalwood Oil. Why there is a reference to 15% is somewhat odd.    I have found Now products to be comparable in quality to many more expensive brands and this is true of their sandalwood blend, as well. Intelligently, Now chose grapeseed oil as the carrier. Rationale: grapeseed does not \\&quot;go rancid\\&quot; as many other carriers will and does not modify the sandalwood fragrance in any way (other than the expected dilution).    I find it interesting that, having used many different Sandalwood oils, both in Essential and dilute form and in high-end colognes, this is the only one that does not acquire a bit of \\&quot;fishy\\&quot; quality on my skin. It smells wonderful when applied and continues to smell wonderful. It has a lasting quality and does not fade for many hours.    What can be said about true, finest sandalwood that isn&#x27;t known? The nose cannot be fooled, nor can the senses. There is an immediate warmth and comfort that arises from smelling the fragrance. It borders on being downright delicious to those who know and love it. This is the signature that cannot be synthesized.    True white sandalwood is rapidly becoming an endangered rarity, which is why the pure, unadulterated Essential Oil is so highly priced. Non-dilute sandalwood essence is quite intense. This blend is perfect for most uses: wonderful for wearing on the skin, equally great for perking up the scent of sandalwood beads that have lost their fragrance over time, fabulous for meditation, great in a scent ring or your choice of aromatherapy device, lovely to apply before bedtime and drift off into peaceful (and sometimes extraordinary) dreams.    For the price, you receive *one full ounce* of this oil. You can pay more for a higher-end competitor&#x27;s blend and receive precisely what you will from Now. The sole differences will be in the packaging and, in some instances, the carrier oil. I will reiterate: grapeseed is one of the best choices for a carrier oil and works beautifully in this blend.    I am extremely happy that I chose to purchase this oil, rather than fall prey to the notion that \\&quot;what costs more must be better.\\&quot; If you already have a preferred brand and price is no object, you will doubtless continue to buy that brand ~ but if, like me, you are seeking high quality and must carefully consider each purchase before making it, you will be congratulating yourself for making the wise choice.     Admittedly, I do not buy oils on the basis of a more attractive bottle or prettier label. Now is straightforward in their presentation. For me, it is what the bottle contains, that is is natural and made with pure, quality ingredients. The added bonus of Super Saver shipping was, for me, one more serious consideration. I was additionally able to purchase some terrific components at a deep discount which were ideal to complete a project I&#x27;ve been working on bit by bit for the past two months.    This is an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I bought this to wear instead of the patchouli oil I usually wear to change it up a little. The oil barely smells like anything- I put a ton on, and I smelled like sandalwood from very close for only about five minutes before the practically nonexistant smell wore off completely. Then after it sat on my shelf for a few months, which is really not that long for a bottle this size at all, the oil stopped smelling like anything but old stale vegetable oil. I had to throw it away. It was a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> The scent is a little weak, but it is still wonderful. I blend it with fractionated coconut oil and apply to my face to help with tightening &amp;  anti aging. There&#x27;s many more benefits to Sandalwood, so it&#x27;s a highly recommended essential oil.</li>
            <li> I just received this Sandalwood blend and I&#x27;m very pleased with the scent. I opened the bottle right from the package, which was cold (it&#x27;s 25 degrees out here) and I could definitely smell sandalwood. I expect the scent to be more prominent after the bottle comes to room temperature. I think this will be perfect for blending into the body products I make. If you&#x27;re used to using pure, undiluted sandalwood essential oil, please understand that this is a dilution and the scent is probably going to be more subtle than you&#x27;re used to. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this instead of spending $60+ on a bottle of undiluted sandalwood oil from another brand, it&#x27;s well worth the savings!</li>
            <li> I was literally FORCED to write a review after seeing the negative comments about this product that I&#x27;ve been buying directly from NOW Foods for years.  This IS the real deal, highly sought after \\&quot;Santalum album\\&quot; which can only be found in India.  Sandalwood is a base note in fragrances due to its staying power, while it&#x27;s scent can be subtle in a blend.  If you are expecting a 14% concentration of Sandalwood to saturate the senses from smelling out of the bottle, you are mistaken.  However, apply this to the skin and it blooms into the wonderful, warm scent you would expect of Sandalwood that lasts &amp; lasts. NOW mixes it with Grapeseed oil which is also a wonderful choice as it does not have a fragrance &amp; it does not go rancid quickly, like most other carrier oils. Honestly, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product, from it&#x27;s amazing scent, it&#x27;s healing properties (physical, mental, spiritual) right to the great value (from someone who purchases LOTS of essential oils, even from wholesalers).  Also, Sandalwood is one of the very few essential oils whose scent gets BETTER with age.  *** It should also be noted that this particular Indian Sandalwood tree that produces &#x27;Santalum album&#x27; is currently under protection by the Indian government in an attempt to stop endangerment.  It takes nearly 100 years for the Sandalwood trees to reach maturity for the oil to be taken from it&#x27;s roots and today&#x27;s black market trade has caused poachers to drop ivory trade &amp; go hacking down young Sandalwood trees, ravishing the supply now &amp; completely endangering their future. Yay for the elephants &amp; Boo for the great woods.  PLEASE use this sacred oil appropriately &amp; responsibly given it&#x27;s rarity.</li>
            <li> No smell at all. Very poor scent. Dissspointef</li>
            <li> I have a bottle of pure sandlewood oil in my purse that costs $100.00 wholesale.  It comes out very slowly so I have not been in the market to buy any sandlewood oil in a few years. Recently I let a group of people at a health retreat try some and it became an instant hit!  When I tried to get some from my longterm wholesaler they told me that the Indian Government has put sandlewood oil trees on the endangered species list.  (It takes 100 years for one to grow).&lt;br /&gt;With that information I turned to others that I wholesale with and was presently surprised to find that NOW carried essential oils, including sandlewood oil.  I promptly ordered several bottles, duely noting that it was only 14% sandlewood oil (most are only 10%).  NOW has always been a reputable company that offers not only value but excellent quality products. It suited my needs and purpose just fine.&lt;br /&gt;First of all it is reasonable and most people can afford it.  Secondly, I found it very effective in relaxing and calming me down, which is what I use it for.  It certainly is not as aromatic as pure sandlewood oil, but that also suits me find. Strong aromas are problematic as I have a very keen sense of smell.  As a matter of fact I have not been able to use the 100% for quite some time for this very reason.&lt;br /&gt;I apply the sandlewood oil on the third eye in the middle of the forehead between the eyes and on the nape of the neck in the back where the bump can be felt that joins the spinal cord to the trunk of the brain.  Applying it to the forehead seals the auras of others away from you so you can respond to them without becoming emotionally vulnerable.  Applied to the back of the neck calms downs the autonomic nervous system associated with the physical body and changes the brain side of things to a state of calm and serenity.  If you will add a few drops of Rescue remedy (A Bach Flower Remedy-Homeopahtic-which can be found at any health food store) under the tongue you will find a very quiet peaceful place within you in which to deal with stressful situations.&lt;br /&gt;Right now I am tolerating a game of basketball that is being played outside my bedroom window with a lot more patience than before I took this sandlewood oil! As a matter of fact this is the very first time I have ever written a product review so you can take that to mean that I am very satified with this purchase.  Healthfully yours, Billye Graham</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for body oil, Can&#x27;t Smell it!?&lt;br /&gt;CORRECTION if the right amount is put on, which I consider a lot compared to some body oils, compared to others (like spearmmint oil), it is about the same amount 3 or 4 or 5 drops, it does work, at first smells woody when first applied, then sometime later perhaps musky, than w time it appears to get lite &amp; sweet &amp; perhaps vanillish &amp; femine, from a moderate distance, but up very close over a longer time span woody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is clear, the scent is very, very faint, &amp; the scent is not as evident once applied topically to the body. The scent does not linger long, unless a certian amount suiting the mixture is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is seemingly not as strong scent quality sandlewood/grapeseed mix body perfume oil, nor lasts as long as,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The body shop PERFUME OIL - WOODY SANDALWOOD 15 ML\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;that I prevously got from The Body Shoppee (The Body Shop), Harvard Sq., Cambridge, Ma, &amp; on line, but it was alledged to be discontinued several years ago, but now it is on the internet for about double to triple the original price, prob because world wide sandalwood is overused &amp; depleated, in some instances it is advertized as the discontinued body shop body perfume oil, in some cases that is not mentioned. The body shop perfume oil is brownish, &amp; fragrant &amp; strong but I think that it can poss. stain white tee shirts, this I wonder?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but then the longevity of the scent of the body shop WOODY SANDALWOOD 15 ML is not always flattering&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Body Shop in Harvard Sq, Cambridge, Ma, may still be The Body Shoppee or spelled something like that, it can be googled from street view.(The internet brand name is Body Shop)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A similar product is Pachouli Oil (Body Shop) some people can not tell the diff between the Woody Sandalwood &amp; the Pachouli, but I dont think the Pachouli is as woody or lasts near as long. It seems that less Pachouli oil is needed than Now Sandalwood oil for a lingering sent, but once an approiate scent is applied both the Now Sandalwood oil &amp; the Pachouli Oil may have about the same longevity it is hard to tell, but neither have the longevity of body shop WOODY SANDALWOOD. I do not seem to find the Pachouli to have a strong longevity but the wearer may become immune to scents, and the scent may be knocking other people over? I bought these for wearing during and after sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Sandalwood Oil does have interesting properties &amp; the price is very good.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful. Just the right sandalwood fragrance. But I wish it lasted longer as you need to keep applying it.</li>
            <li> Will probably purchase a better brand next time. The scent is not strong and it blended in a carrier oil. This product is ok.</li>
            <li> The oil had a very weak smell. The alcohol smell was more pungent than the sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately we had to send this back it simply wasn&#x27;t what I expected. There was little to no smell at all.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal...a novice, buying sandlewood for soap making, will be extremely disappointed because there is almost no scent discernible when the bottle is opened. It would be good to have some sort of description on the page itself that says this oil shouldn&#x27;t be used unless it&#x27;s for those who want to wear it or something. really just poor communication on their part and poor education on my part. I don&#x27;t claim and malfeasance on their end just poor communication.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned a lesson.</li>
            <li> Judging from some of the other reviews, people don&#x27;t have much experience with Sandalwood oil. It&#x27;s extremely rare, and becoming more rare. The pure oil is priced much too high to be affordable. Much of the so-called pure Sandalwood oil sold in India is anything but pure, and is often adulterated with low quality oils such as cottonseed oil.  The grapeseed oil that is used to dilute this is an extremely wise choice, since it doesn&#x27;t go rancid quickly like many other oils, and has no detectable scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regularly use Sandalwood powder, Sandalwood paste, Sandalwood incense, and have a Sandalwood mala. Just a few drops of the Now Sandalwood oil, spread out over 108 Sandalwood beads, completely revived the beautiful Sandalwood scent of my very old mala. If you are new to Sandalwood oil, I would highly recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Three months later I am still deeply appreciating and enjoying the heavenly scent from the same bottle. This really is the most attractive scent I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li> wonderful scent and last a couple of days</li>
            <li> smells like water or close to it.  terrible.  very dissapointed and will NEVER buy from them again!  I create my own products and there was no way I could use this oil for them.  I couldnt even smell it when I put it in a candle burner!  cheap cheap cheap</li>
            <li> In the defense of Sandalwood, it is VERY difficult to obtain as a 100% oil.  My sister suggested I use Sandalwood in a couple of products I make at home so I began research because I want to make items that appeal to the male variety.  I went to Amazon first to check the price.  When I saw the oil was diluted that was already was a flag.  I too, desire for my essential oils to be 100% (undiluted).  And yes, you must read the bottle of every essential oil because the labels can sometimes be intentionally misleading.  I ended up on this website - https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils/sandalwood-essential-oil.html.  The site speaks to three different types of Sandalwood.  Two of them being \\&quot;rare and subsequently expensive\\&quot;; while the third is almost extinct and therefore expensive when found.  So it doesn&#x27;t appear that \\&quot;PURE\\&quot; Sandalwood is accessible from many places.  The differences between essential oils and a \\&quot;scent\\&quot; is that essential oils offer health benefits.  The scent is simply smell and offers no further benefit.  So to compare this with a store scented \\&quot;Sandalwood\\&quot; is not accurately comparing apples to apples, sort to speak.  However, if you are making body oils, soaps, etc. perhaps this will work but may require an increased number of drops.  Other sites to consider - http://www.youngliving.com/en_US/products/essential-oils/singles/royal-hawaiian-sandalwood-5ml ; https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/cart ; https://www.auracacia.com/dspCmnPrd.php?p&#x3D;t&amp;cn&#x3D;Sandalwood&amp;ct&#x3D;anpceoeo&amp;i&#x3D;y.  Just look at this prices for the size of the bottle.  Another site that you can depend on is http://www.newdirectionsaromatics.com/sandalwood-organic-essential-oil-p-1709.html.  Look at their prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I write this review to say this...before you purchase do your own research.  By reading the reviews, the scent varies by customer.  Pure 100% (undiluted) Sandalwood essential oil can be found, at a higher cost.  I gave it 3 stars to give an objective opinion.  I am going to try it.I am going to try it.</li>
            <li> I bought sandalwood to put on my sore, achy back. It works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> does not smell anything like sandalwood</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the fragrance and the concentration strength. I&#x27;ve read that sandalwood scent is good for the brain; maybe it&#x27;s true; anyway, it can&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that the carrier oil (grapeseed oil) will spoil if you leave it out of the frig. I have to throw part of my unused bottle away because all I can smell of it now is rancid carrier oil. When fresh, it smells (to me) like a mild version of 100% sandalwood oil. This time I plan to use it right away in lotions and keep any remainder refrigerated.</li>
            <li> The oil ratio must be much higher in this Now essential oils. The sent does not last very long, but I like the sent and everybody else in the office likes the sent. I use it in lotion or burn it I warmer.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.  Fragrance is dim - I only smell the &amp;#34;bitter&amp;#34; notes. The rich sandalwood smell is missing.  This is a case of you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I was really dissapointed to find this had little or no frangrence to it. Maybe it&#x27;s not supposed to , I don&#x27;t like a lot of scent, but some would be nice. I really like all of the other things from the Now brand that I have tried, their supplements are great!</li>
            <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
            <li> It claims to be pure sandalwood, but read the small print (and smell it)and it has another oil with &amp;#34;pure sandalwood&amp;#34; added to it.  The result:  I smell like a new wood shelf.  Ugh.</li>
            <li> Yummy, sexy, man-magnet! I call it my hot sause</li>
            <li> Nice size for price and smells great! Not overwhelming but still still lasts longer than most perfumes</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t as sandalwood like as I thought it would be.  It is very possible I am wrong about how it should smell but if I am right, then the smell of this particular brand should be stronger than it is.</li>
            <li> The smell is faint and not like most of the sandalwood oils I&#x27;ve come across</li>
            <li> This is the real thing . . .</li>
            <li> This is a bogus, falsely advertised product.  The product description says, &amp;#34;100% pure.&amp;#34;  Once the product arrives, the label says that it contains only 14% sandalwood oil.  There is only a faint odor of sandalwood.  That means I must use seven times as much to get the same odor density.  The diluent, grapeseed oil is totally unacceptable in the cosmetics I make.&lt;br /&gt;This will be returned immediately.</li>
            <li> good price, nice smell, did the job it was intended for (home made shave oil) and NO allergic reaction!!  WINNER!!</li>
            <li> I expected the scent of this sandalwood essential oil would be subtle, but I could not detect any scent whatsoever.</li>
            <li> the more i get into Essential Oils the more i get into essential oils. After a trying day at work, I may have to look up the properties of which one i need but it makes a difference. There are some that are called &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34; so there&#x27;s not a lot to look up. They arrive safely packaged, in good time, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This is one of my very favorite scents. Being diluted in a carrier oil, it&#x27;s more subtle, but it&#x27;s the most reasonable product available now.</li>
            <li> No scent!!!!!! No joke!!!!!</li>
            <li> No smell, a waste of your money.  I&#x27;ve found oil at half the price that smell twice as strong as this brand.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and is nice to have</li>
            <li> Good for topical use.  Really bad in a diffuser.  Really weak smelling.  And not in the typical Mysore way.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed receiving this oil. It&#x27;s so great and I love the Now brand. I&#x27;ll buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Sandalwood scent is not strong enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> I thought sandalwood was a strong scent.. If it is this is not for you. If it isn&#x27;t then never mind my observation.</li>
            <li> Although this is a blended oil, don&#x27;t be fooled:  What you&#x27;ll smell is real sandalwood! A lot of sandalwood products are blended with citrus, vanilla and other scents, so be aware that what you may think of as &amp;#34;sandalwood&amp;#34; may in fact be a blend of scents, whereas this product is pure sandalwood scent. The carrier oil has no scent and a nice, thin, silky texture. I use this as a beard oil and love it. The scent warms up well when applied to the skin and it does good things for my beard.  I&#x27;ll be ordering this product again, and LOVE the price point! Now if only it were Prime eligible....</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a perfume and it is not very strong.  If you are looking for very subtle scent this is great but I was looking for something stronger.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with several other reviewers that this just doesn&#x27;t have enough scent or staying power.  The dispenser, which is the typical style designed for essential oils, works great for that purpose, however when oil is added to the mix it is a real struggle to get anything out.  I bought this with the intention of using it in cosmetic formulas, lotions etc, but it wont even hold for more than five minutes undiluted on the body as a fragrance oil.  I love Now brand and have purchased many of their oils, extracts, and supplements and have found them to be a great value, this on the other hand sadly is not useable.</li>
            <li> Very rich and hearty aroma!</li>
            <li> I am learning about the therapeutic uses for essential oils. When I worked as a hospice nurse I did see the efficacy of Lavender, geranium, and eucalyptus oils. I am thrilled to learn more, starting with this sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this thing was diluted. It had a very weak smell if any at times. It was difficult to pour because the spout was too small. Maybe it was just my bottle. Who knows.</li>
            <li> Great scent and price.  Used in making homemade soap.</li>
            <li> Not very strong- I knew it was diluted but barely sandalwood scent at all.</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to what I read, in this instance. Very, very little aroma... On skin or off. Disappointing! I have/am using many NOW EOs and most are great - 5 star, but not this one.</li>
            <li> Not 100% it&#x27;s diluted</li>
            <li> I just received my order of Now Foods 14% sandalwood oil blend. I can barely smell the sandalwood. Very disappointing. Throughout the day I kept opening the bottle and smelling it again in case my senses were playing a trick on me. I usually have a very acute sense of smell. I even had my daughter smell it and her reaction was the same. Sad.</li>
            <li> This just... doesn&#x27;t smell the way I expected it to. Yes, I understand that it&#x27;s a 14% blend, but the sandalwood scent just doesn&#x27;t come through. It&#x27;s faint enough that I can rub this directly onto my hands and forget less than an hour later.</li>
            <li> This smelled more like grapeseed oil than sandalwood... which isn&#x27;t what I was looking for. Sent it back. It didn&#x27;t bring me joy.</li>
            <li> love the oils from NOW. always a great price. this is just one of the NOW products i use on clients.  really great to put on stressed clients to relax!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have to stick my nose into the bottle to get the scent. Very, very mild smell.</li>
            <li> Great quality, long lasting;)</li>
            <li> Very weak and smells off. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with now essential oils. I&#x27;ve purchased many from different places and they are always great. This one has a faint smell but it is an oil blend so I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t beat the price and quality of NOW essential oils.  The sandalwood oil has a rich smell.  We have used it in both our diffusers and it works like a charm.  I have tried both the more expensive brands and the cheaper ones, but NOW strikes the right balance between price and quality.  I recommend the sandalwood highly.  Good price, nice aroma.</li>
            <li> The NOW sandalwood is one of their best quality of essential oils and the scent is heavenly. I use this for aromatherapy- great in the bathtub or a bit with carrier oil on the skin before bed. I also blend it into a face serum which I use daily. The price and quality are fair.</li>
            <li> I knew this was a blend before I purchased it, but I can barely smell any Sandalwood at all.  It&#x27;s also really hard to actually get any of it to come out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am particular about sandalwood scents and this one is very nice and a good value for the price!</li>
            <li> Love this scent!  Perfect in my aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> Perfume was there only for 2 weeks, but after that no sandalwood smell just plain oil smell. I buy couple of products from Now, but with this one I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> As many reviewers noted, there isn&#x27;t much of a smell when you smell it in the bottle, but when you put it on skin, it&#x27;s a very strong sandalwood smell. I put it on then went out to a movie, and washed my hands several times. And the smell was still there. It definitely has staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use essential oils for making homemade products, room sprays, deodorant, perfume, etc. I purchased sandalwood for the qualities of the oil, not the smell. And I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell by itself (though I have no doubt it&#x27;s true to how sandalwood should smell). However, I&#x27;ll be using it for blends so it&#x27;ll meet my needs.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a more fragrant oil and am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this Sandalwood oil!</li>
            <li> At 14% actual sandlewood oil (approx. one part in seven), it&#x27;s not concentrated enough for some uses. You probably can&#x27;t afford pure sandlewood though. It has become rare, very expensive, and counterfeit sandlewood is everywhere.  This product is smelly enough if you&#x27;re just slapping it on your skin though. It is true sandlewood and smells as such. 6 months after opening, the carrier oil (grapeseed) turned rancid and ruined the fragrance of this oil. A product with this much carrier oil is going to need some sort of preservative. The end user could squeeze the contents of a gelcap of vitamin E into a freshly opened bottle of this in order to slow down the rancidity.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very strong, but smells good and significantly cheaper than other sandalwood oils.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews, and was aware of the strong unique smell.&lt;br /&gt;For me it did not work as i wanted to use it as part of my facial skin rouitine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself and its other uses I believe from what I read are wonderful. So if you do however want to mix it with a moisturizer I learned also read up on it, before ordering, so it won;t interfear with your moisturizer and you may want to read up on what base oils are as it is often recommended to mix sandlewood with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend to purchase a book about essential oils and their uses before you order&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just was not for me, as I am sensitive to smells, will stick with my argan and maracuja oils</li>
            <li> Seems too low of a concentration.  Not much of a smell.  I don&#x27;t think it is therapeutic at all.</li>
            <li> i purchased this because it was inexpensive enough to take a risk, and i am not entirely unhappy with the purchase.  having said that, it doesn&#x27;t stand up to the sandalwood Santalum album 10% dilution in jojoba oil purchased from Nature&#x27;s Gift.  the two oils do not smell even close to the same.  i had already put some of the sri-lanka oil in a face mask to wear, delightful.  this oil, at 14% dilution, doesn&#x27;t smell as good.  the NOW price is excellent, whereas what i purchased from Nature&#x27;s Gift was $30 for 1/2 ounce. far more expensive but it is worth it.  i&#x27;ve used sandalwood for years, but never alone, and never for its scent, rather, for its healing properties.  it is just now, in the last few days, that i have considered it for its scent.  the NOW sandalwood product does not stand up to what i have been using, although, it may be medicinally equivalent, i don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I added a star because as time passes, I am liking the product more.</li>
            <li> I can not smell any sandalwood. Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;There is a very faint scent of something, but not like any sandalwood I have ever smelled.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon gave me an instant refund and I immediately ordered another brand that is 100% sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;I am a very satisfied Amazon customer.</li>
            <li> Has hardly any smell..guess I should&#x27;ve expected that with it only being 14% sandalwood...</li>
            <li> The oil is a little thick for the dropper top (I have to sling it firmly and carefully to dispense it), but I find the scent very nice. It is very light, warm, and subtle. If you want a stronger scent, it&#x27;s probably better to splurge on the all-sandalwood variety (this is a blend with a carrier oil).</li>
            <li> Can I give this product negative stars? There is no sandalwood fragrance AT ALL!!! I am a regular essential oil user as I have my own business making body products and wellness formulas. I also use them in my personal life daily. So I am aware that a diluted product will be less fragrant, hence the lower cost. And yes, I was looking for a cheap, quick fix here as it was pre- pay day and I needed sandalwood fast! I also knew that some of the Now Foods EOs are of a fairly low quality but that others work just fine for their purpose. This &amp;#34;sandalwood&amp;#34; diluted in grapeseed oil smells just like...grapeseed oil. That is the only fragrance I can detect at all! It&#x27;s an absolute outrage. I&#x27;ve gotten a few lower quality oils in the past I said I&#x27;d never use again, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve considered asking for a refund. I&#x27;m astounded at how little fragrance there is, or should I say, isn&#x27;t. I can detect nothing above the grapeseed oil and I&#x27;m using my superpowers, here. I have an extremely keen sense of smell and it tells me I was ripped off!</li>
            <li> This oil was overly diluted and I could barely make out the scent of sandalwood at all. Sandalwood is typically extremely expensive and therefore often sold in a diluted form. I purchased this blend because it was affordable. That being said, you get what you pay for with this particular product.</li>
            <li> smells ok. doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works great in making my soaps and creams.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy sandalwood, this scent is right on the mark, and works great. I used a few drops blended with sea salt as a scented scrub, and am thrilled with the result. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Great scent and good for general use.  I use a lot of oil for different things and these are great.</li>
            <li> lovely sandalwood- nice quality</li>
            <li> I do like this; I wish I had realized it&#x27;s only a 14% blend but what can you do. I didn&#x27;t pay attention I guess! I use it to scent my hubby&#x27;s DIY shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I used to love sandalwood oil in the past. They all smelled so strong and delicious, no matter which brand.  The scent in this is so faint, and might last 20 minutes.  If sandalwood trees have become rare, they shouldn&#x27;t make this oil at all.</li>
            <li> If anything this smells like there was a little sandalwood but then it was mixed with something earthy. I do not like the smell at all and I usually love the smell of anything sandalwood.</li>
            <li> This is a 14% blend with grape seed oil which is VERY greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin very well.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with those that give this one a thumbs down. Now has never sold me any oils that were this diluted and worthless. This one has been watered down to the point that it&#x27;s useless.If you have been getting their other fine oils, then you know how strong they normally are. Not this one. I told Amazon about this, and they gave me an instant refund. What great service here! I&#x27;ll go ahead and buy another one on here that actually has a good amount of the real oil in it.Sure hope Now dosen&#x27;t keep this one. There&#x27;s a shortage worlwide of Sandalwood oil, but they should never cut the product this much.</li>
            <li> Great stuff very fragrant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very strong scent, kind of smells diluted. Maybe that&#x27;s just how sandalwood is. Really have to shake the bottle (a la ketchup, I even bang on it) to get even a couple drops out. Even when applied directly to skin in multiple places, smell fades after a couple hours. I won&#x27;t buy it again; YMMV.</li>
            <li> I make my own line of facial products, and while I find straight sandalwood oil to be too strong scented and not gentle enough to be put directly on the skin, this blend is perfect to add to my products.</li>
            <li> Being brand new to essential oils and holistic aromatherapy, I started by buying oils that I felt would benefit me by scent (old familiar scents)to bring back memories or to use as holistic therapy.  Essential oils have their place secured in a natural beauty routine; they are natural, chemical-free alternatives. ‘NOW Foods’ seem to come with the best reviews and so far all the oils are oils of substance and as I test them, they seem to be actual natural oils with limited or no fillers.</li>
            <li> The smell is just too diluted. The bottle even says its a oil blend. I have other essential oils that are pure and they last alot longer and are more stronger. Its just not worth the price for the lack of effective smell.</li>
            <li> I realized, before I purchased, that this was a blend.  It&#x27;s only 14% sandalwood (the rest is grapeseed oil).  I&#x27;ve had good experience with other Now products though, so I figured it was worth a shot.  The fragrance is there, but VERY faint.  I bought this to use as in homemade soap and candles.  I&#x27;m going to have to use the entire bottle in a single batch to get the desired outcome.  Giving it 3 stars because it is as it was presented - a blend.  If you&#x27;re looking for a real sandalwood fragrance though... keep looking.  14% just isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> Use it in my bath.  Smells awesome</li>
            <li> I love  Now brand but when I use this sandalwood it&#x27;s so diluted it hardly lasts. I&#x27;ll be buying a different brand next time. Now has been pretty good with everything else.</li>
            <li> I knew going in that this was a blend. This was fine for my purpose as I was using in cologne and beauty products. The smell is not as strong as the straight essential oil but works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago, and it was not the same as the one of the exact same brand and size that I had purchased in a whole foods store. Buyer beware! Seems like it was 100% grapeseed oil and 0% sandalwood. Regardless, whatever type of oil they put in that little bottle, it definitely was NOT sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I think they forgot a decimal point. There is no way this mixture contains 14% Sandalwood Oil. I believe it should be marked .14%.  Now Foods makes some decent oils at very reasonable prices but this isn&#x27;t one of them. I payed $15 for grapeseed oil and promptly returned it. Some corporate suit at Now Foods deserves a Dirty Sanchez for putting this pathetic blend on the market.</li>
            <li> I really want to see more of a percentage.  I smell slight sandalwood from it.  I guess as it is diluted for massage.</li>
            <li> I realize this is a blend, but it should have SOME scent to it.  I have an great sense of smell and I could barely make out any scent with the open bottle directly under my nose.  This is extremely disappointing and not at all what I have come to expect from Now.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this oil. 90% of my oils are Now brand and I love them...however the scent of sandalwood in this blend is so faint that it&#x27;s barely noticeable. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say for sure that this stuff is the real deal.  Purchased it to use in laundry.  I usually use the Now brand of cinnamon, cedar, lemongrass, ect.  These all perfume up the clothes in the dryer really well.  Sandalwood is not a knock-you-over scent, it has to be used cautiously because it holds  &amp; lingers on cloth.  So if you don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s smell, it&#x27;s best not to use this long lasting scent.  HOWEVER, this had almost no odor AT ALL.  Not in the bottle, not in the dryer.  Nothing lingering on the clothes.  No usually the case with anything sandalwood.  Maybe it&#x27;s been so diluted that the scent is absent?  What would be the purpose of an essential oil that has been diluted to the point of no scent?</li>
            <li> I used this in my batch of cold processed soap and it gave it a nice soft woody smell. I absolutely love sandalwood; I also put drops in the tub when I take a bath. It makesy skin smell glorious! Will purchase again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product earlier this evening and gave it a 1. I hate leaving a negative review and that made me come back and look again at what others have said (I always look at reviews before purchasing and didn&#x27;t recall what I&#x27;d read). I wish I&#x27;d read them again before leaving my other review. From the bottle I and my husband didn&#x27;t smell much. After rubbing some on, I definitely smell it and really like it. I&#x27;ve had stronger and others I like a little better (I&#x27;d have given it 4 stars but felt I owed an extra to offset my 1. I couldn&#x27;t find an edit or delete button on the other and don&#x27;t see it posted here so maybe there will be one later). I am no longer disappointed in my purchase and my apologies for the earlier review!</li>
            <li> I sometime wonder if NOW essential oils are a potent as others. The strength seems to dissipate over time. It&#x27;s OK for external uses but since it is not USDA approved, I wouldn&#x27;t use internally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been expanding my oil collection for a little while now and very glad to finally have some sandalwood oil, has helped with my skin and hair dryness by mixing it in with my shampoo and body wash.</li>
            <li> Definitely a very mild smell, but it&#x27;s nice to rub on my face after a shave.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot,but it is not real fragrant.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the aroma not like any sandalwood I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  Would not recommend or purchase again and I don&#x27;t use it because of this.</li>
            <li> Hardly smell anything :-((</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of sandalwood in liquid starch to iron sheets (a sickness of mine, but don&#x27;t sneer if you have never slipped into ironed, starched, and scented sheets.  The blend from Piping Rock is better.</li>
            <li> I knew it was not pure sandalwood oil when I bought it and if it were it would have been outrageously expensive but it has no smell whatsoever.  I threw the bottle away because it was just a bottle of grapeseed oil to me and I already have a big bottle of that that I paid less for.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Smells good if you can get the liquid to come out of the container with the necessity to remove  the plastic piece inside.  This is another oil tha the scent is short lived.  I add it to my roll on perfume containers.  Disappointed a little.  I wish the concentration percentage was higher.</li>
            <li> it seems good to early to write an review as its been only 2 days I have started using  this.Smell good.</li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;d expect a much stronger Sandalwood smell, even at 14%.</li>
            <li> I love NOW essential oil products and this is a great price</li>
            <li> I have had sandlewood aroma therapy before and love the smell.  This one had barely any smell and at and it smelled kind of rancid.  I waited too long to return it.  Just had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> This is the scent of true Indian sandalwood.  So soothing to the nerves, and lovely on the skin.  I blend this up with coconut oil, Shea butter, and Argan oil to make a great. Skin food Mix for massage therapy.</li>
            <li> Smell was not as strong as I needed it to be for my cold press soap.</li>
            <li> Yes, right in the product description it say that it is only a 14% (or about 1/7 strength) blend. I guess I was just hoping that the pure stuff was so strong that even at this weak dilution there would be enough fragrance. For me, there is not enough. I would not spend nearly $100 for 1oz of pure extract but this dilution is simply too weak. I was hoping a few drops in my hot bath would do the trick as other extracts do. Unfortunately I have to dump so much into my bath that I see the level change each time. I&#x27;m using over $1 of this oil per bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice, but just too weak.</li>
            <li> I have ordered other products from this company and was satisfied. This particular oil was not very fragrant however and I was not pleased with my purchase. I would not recommend this particular oil.</li>
            <li> I used this to make bath bombs and melts and the scent was perfect.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite oils.</li>
            <li> I am normally happy with NOW Foods products, but this oil is a little weak.  If one is looking for sandalwood, this might disappoint.</li>
            <li> very good quality sandlewood for the price very warm and woodsy and earthy smell. diluted in grape seed so is thick, I remove stopper because it will get clogged.</li>
            <li> Very nice and a good price too.</li>
            <li> So-so smell, not top grade. Some people will like it. I just need better quality.</li>
            <li> Smells like olive oil to me.  There is no fragrance when I burn it.</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose very well! 😊</li>
            <li> Nice overall sandalwood fragrance.  Since it is a blend, the scent is not overpowering.  It has a nice, natural tone to it.  I&#x27;ll be using it in making several different product.  Pure sandalwood oil is a bit too expensive, so I like this blend option.</li>
            <li> Can barely smell the sandalwood.  Too dilute.</li>
            <li> For my particular uses, this was a bust. I tried using it in coconut oil sugar scrubs. After using nearly half the bottle in 8 oz of scrub and still not smelling anything, I had to toss it out. So, while for other users and their purposes it may have worked, using it in body products does not.</li>
            <li> I used to be really big on lavender, until I discovered the benefits of sandalwood.  Like lavender, sandalwood is a great balancer when it comes to skin.  For those with combination skin, try adding a few drops to your toner or moisturizer.  Have oily skin? Then sandalwood is your friend!  Plus, I love the scent as sometimes I don&#x27;t feel like smelling all flower-y. lol</li>
            <li> NOW Foods is my go-to brand for oils of all sorts, but NutriPlusTea will never again receive my business. The fact that I was sent Elmer&#x27;s Carpenter&#x27;s Wood Glue instead of the Sandalwood Oil Blend I paid for is totally tacky and unprofessional. This item has honestly only gotten one start because I can&#x27;t give it no stars.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of this company and their products. all high quality food/ cosmetic grade products and I always feel safe using them.</li>
