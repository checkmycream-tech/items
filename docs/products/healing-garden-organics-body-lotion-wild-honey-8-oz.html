    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>I really am impressed by the healing garden organic products.  </li>
            <li>This is a great lotion!</li>
            <li>Great moisturizing lotion without a lot of oil.</li>
            <li>it also smells great</li>
            <li>It smells great</li>
            <li>smells good and a great lotion, great with the matching body lotion, I have tried the olive oil and aloe vera scent too</li>
            <li>IT IS REALLY GOOD...</li>
            <li>bought as a gift and they loved it.</li>
            <li>I feel naturally sweet and attractive.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have as strong a scent as some of their line, but is emollient and feels good on skin.</li>
            <li>Most organic/natural products would exclude paraben as one of the leading harmful substances.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to find it again.</li>
            <li>Another reason why I bought it was that I love honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I do have it on, people love the smell.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite organic body product at this time.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Not only does it help my skin but is smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>and I love using it as a hand lotion.</li>
            <li>Again, this product is the best smelling lotion, Wild Honey has a sweet fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product ever for dry skin</li>
            <li>Looking for organic ingredients to use for body products has been a bit overwhelming as there are many products available and since making this transition, it is a process, trial-and-error basically.  </li>
            <li>Just like the body wash, but even better because I can moisture with the lotion at any time during the day, the wild honey lotion is absolutely one of the best organic body producs.  </li>
            <li>She really likes it &amp; it smells really good.</li>
            <li>It has a cheap perfume smell, which is way too strong.</li>
            <li>For sensitive people with particular smells, this is a great purchase.</li>
            <li>When I first used this product, it was so good, but just a tiny bit strong.  </li>
            <li>This brand makes the organic transition so much easier as the producs are high in quality and so appealing to the senses.  </li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I would have never purchased this item if I am aware upfront.</li>
            <li>Non greasy yet does not have the exact smell of the mist.</li>
            <li>First of all I didn&#x27;t realize this product contained parabens</li>
            <li>So, after having a great experience with the fig and lavender lotion, then the wild honey body wash, amazon finally had the wild honey lotion for prime members.  </li>
            <li>The wild honey body wash is so yummy, refreshing, and has such a sweet scent.  </li>
            <li>but it is also very greasy.</li>
            <li>Cost was reasonable for an item that is hard to find; love the scent and the product!</li>
            <li>If you smell it just once, it might be ok, but if you put it on a few times a day and smell it quite often, it will give you a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, i have promoted this newly purchased product with my colleagues and they lovvvvvvvvvve the smell.  </li>
            <li>THE SMELL IS SO SUBTLE AND NICE....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m down to using the last of my Wild Honey body mist and had about given up hope of finding any more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on the nose, just enough to make you noticeable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even Natural.  </li>
            <li>I bought it mainly because it was cheap, only 2 dollars and with shipping it was a little under 7 dollars.</li>
            <li>This is just basic deception for the purpose of getting a niche of the organic conscious market.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Ok so other than the pointless purpose of portraying itself as \\&quot;Organic\\</li>
            <li>It feels exactly like a cheap hand lotion I once bought for 1 dollar -- both very thin and don&#x27;t last at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>product is the equivalent of ordering for yourself to eat a whole regular thick crust Pizza from Pizza Hut and then asking for a small side of gluten free pasta.  </li>

            <li> Anyone who wants to buy an organic product is also not the same person who would purchase a lotion that has a few organic ingredients that is then mixed up with a lot of parabens and other chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for my wife for a long time now.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT Natural nor Organic.</li>
            <li> However, this lotion is the other extreme -- not hydrating enough!</li>
            <li> &quot;, it&#x27;s no different than any other watery runny greasy messy</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this lotion has absolutely no honey smell whatsoever!</li>
            <li> Obviously, no one likes a cream or lotion that&#x27;s too greasy that leaves residue or that is hard to absorb.</li>
            <li> lotion itself is too thin and running; 5 minutes after applying it, your hands feel dry again!</li>
            <li> My mom has a bottle that she uses on her face and she swears it made her crows feet lessen in just a few uses!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion anyway despite all the negative reviews...</li>
            <li> Way less expensive then the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> -- I will not buy this crap again.</li>
            <li> You will be appalled.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Item exactly as described.  Cost was reasonable for an item that is hard to find; love the scent and the product!</li>
            <li> this item contains paraben which is known to cause cancer.  Most organic/natural products would exclude paraben as one of the leading harmful substances.  The seller does not disclose this in the description or ingredient sections which is misleading.  I would have never purchased this item if I am aware upfront.</li>
            <li> Non greasy yet does not have the exact smell of the mist. Close yet not quite the same</li>
            <li> What can i say, it is a lotion. Not as creamy or fragrant as i hoped it would be period.</li>
            <li> First of all I didn&#x27;t realize this product contained parabens but it is also very greasy. It doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into your skin but just leaves a greasy look and feel. I don&#x27;t like it and will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I VE  LOOK EVERYWHERE FOR THIS PRODUCT...UNTIL I FOUND IT  IN AMAZON....IT IS REALLY GOOD...THE SMELL IS SO SUBTLE AND NICE....I CAN WERE IT EVERY DAY....PEOPLE WOULD ASK ME WHAT I HAVE ON....THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing lotion without a lot of oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for my wife for a long time now. She really likes it &amp; it smells really good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down to using the last of my Wild Honey body mist and had about given up hope of finding any more.  While this is lotion, not the spray, it smells the same and I love it.</li>
            <li> Again, this product is the best smelling lotion, Wild Honey has a sweet fragrance.  I feel naturally sweet and attractive.  I am often ask, what are you wearing?  I get plenty of compliments. It&#x27;s gentle on the nose, just enough to make you noticeable.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have as strong a scent as some of their line, but is emollient and feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> smells good and a great lotion, great with the matching body lotion, I have tried the olive oil and aloe vera scent too it also smells great</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I have a skin condition and it has helped lighten it and stopped the itching.  Way less expensive then the dermatologist. So glad I was able to find it again.</li>
            <li> bought as a gift and they loved it.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion anyway despite all the negative reviews... I bought it mainly because it was cheap, only 2 dollars and with shipping it was a little under 7 dollars. Another reason why I bought it was that I love honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this lotion has absolutely no honey smell whatsoever! It has a cheap perfume smell, which is way too strong. If you smell it just once, it might be ok, but if you put it on a few times a day and smell it quite often, it will give you a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself is too thin and running; 5 minutes after applying it, your hands feel dry again! Obviously, no one likes a cream or lotion that&#x27;s too greasy that leaves residue or that is hard to absorb. However, this lotion is the other extreme -- not hydrating enough! It feels exactly like a cheap hand lotion I once bought for 1 dollar -- both very thin and don&#x27;t last at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap smell and cheap thin watery lotion -- I will not buy this crap again. Now I just want to use it up as quickly as possible; I don&#x27;t want to just toss it into garbage because I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Looking for organic ingredients to use for body products has been a bit overwhelming as there are many products available and since making this transition, it is a process, trial-and-error basically.  I purchased another product from the healing garden, the fig and lavender.  When I first used this product, it was so good, but just a tiny bit strong.  I still use the fig and lavender but sometimes, not daily.  When I do have it on, people love the smell.  So, after having a great experience with the fig and lavender lotion, then the wild honey body wash, amazon finally had the wild honey lotion for prime members.  When I noticed that this became a prime product and I reaped the benefits of being a prime member, I immediately ordered it.  The wild honey body wash is so yummy, refreshing, and has such a sweet scent.  So, like I said, I waited for this to go prime, and when it did,I I took advantage of this order.  Just like the body wash, but even better because I can moisture with the lotion at any time during the day, the wild honey lotion is absolutely one of the best organic body producs.  I really am impressed by the healing garden organic products.  This brand makes the organic transition so much easier as the producs are high in quality and so appealing to the senses.  This is my favorite organic body product at this time.  Also, i have promoted this newly purchased product with my colleagues and they lovvvvvvvvvve the smell.  For sensitive people with particular smells, this is a great purchase.</li>
            <li> If you want an Organic product this is NOT it!!  It&#x27;s not even Natural.  IT IS NOT Natural nor Organic. Anyone who wants to buy an organic product is also not the same person who would purchase a lotion that has a few organic ingredients that is then mixed up with a lot of parabens and other chemicals.  It defeats the purpose.  This is just basic deception for the purpose of getting a niche of the organic conscious market.&lt;br /&gt;This product is the equivalent of ordering for yourself to eat a whole regular thick crust Pizza from Pizza Hut and then asking for a small side of gluten free pasta.  Ok so other than the pointless purpose of portraying itself as \\&quot;Organic\\&quot;, it&#x27;s no different than any other watery runny greasy messy lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the ingrediants of your \\&quot;Healing Gardens\\&quot; product and then google/bing all those chemicals in this product.  You will be appalled.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Not only does it help my skin but is smells wonderful. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever for dry skin it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that truly works</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion! It smells great and I love using it as a hand lotion. My mom has a bottle that she uses on her face and she swears it made her crows feet lessen in just a few uses!</li>
