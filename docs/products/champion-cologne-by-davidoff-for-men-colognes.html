            <li>Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It is a great scent that I like more with each time wearing.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My FAVORITE!</li>
            <li>and I have been impressed since I first smelled the bottle.  </li>
            <li>it is amazing perfume</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Davidoff Champion has a nice scent am always buying for my husband.</li>
            <li>I receive nice compliments each time I wear it.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised, almost to the point of being impressed.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for a good cedar smelling cologne and this fit what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not what I turn to when I&#x27;m hitting the bar, but it&#x27;s a safe option that I like having around, and it does hold its own.</li>
            <li>and I love to smell it on him even more.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cologne, and so does my wife.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with the sent of this cologne and so is my husband.</li>
            <li>Outstanding...</li>
            <li>He love says it makes him feel like a sexy man...</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Good value for money, smells decent, but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>Distinct and sexy!</li>
            <li>It becomes very sweet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Champion offers great flexibility/versatility with notes of both citrus and woods that will work well with any season, occasion, or time of day.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the woodier types of scents, and Champion is a great compromise that offers you something that you can, in my opinion, wear any time and anywhere while still keeping that fern type scent.</li>
            <li>:) many many thanks!</li>
            <li>Also, feel free to ask me any questions about the product you may have.</li>
            <li>Being that the price was right of course I purchased more than one.</li>
            <li>It has a light and clean scent that&#x27;s not too overpowering or musky.</li>
            <li>Comes in original packing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Champion comes out of the gates with citrus lemony notes that settles into a unique spicy fragrance with notes of outdoors.  </li>
            <li>If it were more citrus that woodsy, the scoring would be higher.  </li>
            <li>So Is that original one or not ??</li>
            <li>It is strong at first but mellows out to a nice steady scent.</li>
            <li>and I will certainly get more when I need it.</li>
            <li>Davidoff Cool Water for example --</li>
            <li>I own several of Davidoff fragrances and turning into a huge fan...</li>
            <li>as a good consumer for davidoff perfumes , this one goes away quickly , even it gives a good sport smell fit with casual clothes .&lt;br</li>
            <li>All things considered - this fragrance is a best kept secret and under rated.  </li>
            <li>I will highly recommend this perfume and its cool for the prize</li>
            <li>Got it the first time in Dubai Arab Emirates overseas.</li>
            <li>First time I bought this from a mall and paid more than double the price compared to what Amazon is selling it for.</li>
            <li>You guys know that I am most critical of the longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>I always get positive comments from others when I wear this as well.</li>
            <li>Also thought the bottle was a very clever</li>
            <li>He says he loves that its a strong fragrance and last all day.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my hubby as a christmas gift and he absolutely loves it</li>
            <li>Simply a classy night out for fun scent</li>
            <li>It lasts the whole day for me</li>
            <li>I bought the same cologne in the Bahamas and it smelt so fantastic on my boyfriend that people always asked him what he was wearing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a modern change-of-pace to some of those.</li>
            <li>The fantastic thing about it is that it lasts so long (for the whole day)...</li>
            <li>(several of the Cool Water renditions..).  </li>
            <li>sillage is average, but the longevity is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but the scent is not as strong as their brand they sell to foreign countries.</li>
            <li>I purchsed my first bottle (at twice the price) on vacation last year.</li>
            <li>but it is a masculine one if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>The Wow Factor is there..</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that promiscuous depth (Drakkar Noir), and instead offers a bit of freshness</li>
            <li>Now for the price/value - Champion is currently listing for under $20.00 for the small bottle and just over $20.00 for the next size up - plus free shipping..!!  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected from this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 25yr old male and everytime I wear this I get complimented on it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s any better or worse than some of the classics --</li>
            <li>Regarding the Wow Factor - Sweetie got to the neck area shortly after I arrived home following a day of work and gave me the thumbs up and asked what it was...</li>
            <li>he did not get the same reaction and the scent was a much lighter version like it was watered down or something.</li>

            <li> Good. Nice. No problem. Perfect product !</li>
            <li> I purchsed my first bottle (at twice the price) on vacation last year. I could not find it at the local department stores, but that turned out to be a blessing as this was half the price.</li>
            <li> Great smell like the way it wear&#x27;s</li>
            <li> great smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25yr old male and everytime I wear this I get complimented on it. Just two sprays to the neck and I&#x27;m good for the day/night. I like the smell as well and I don&#x27;t smell like a teenage kid that wears axe. Grow up and smell like a man.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby as a christmas gift and he absolutely loves it and I love to smell it on him even more.  It&#x27;s definitely a win/win situation</li>
            <li> My wife loves me wearing this. I always get positive comments from others when I wear this as well. Its all good!</li>
            <li> Got it the first time in Dubai Arab Emirates overseas. Now it&#x27;s smells still very good. Has the Davidoff Champion Men been changed.?</li>
            <li> Smells great on my husband! It has a light and clean scent that&#x27;s not too overpowering or musky. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne, and so does my wife.  I am very impressed with Davidoff fragrances, and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the sent of this cologne and so is my husband. I got it for him a few years back and when I went to buy it again I found out it was discontinued. Being that the price was right of course I purchased more than one.</li>
            <li> It becomes very sweet. PH does not fit any of those</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE! I finished one already and I had to buy another one. First time I bought this from a mall and paid more than double the price compared to what Amazon is selling it for. Smell lasts for days. Comes in original packing. Very pleased with my purchase. I highly recommend it. Also makes a great gift for a guy</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne about 6 months ago for my husband. It is from now on his go to cologne if he wants to mix it up from his usual ie: Ed Hardy, Polo and a few others. It has a flowery scent to it but it is a masculine one if that makes sense. It is strong at first but mellows out to a nice steady scent. Simply a classy night out for fun scent I highly recommend it. Also thought the bottle was a very clever design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my review was helpful please let me know by clicking &amp;#34;YES&amp;#34; below. Also, feel free to ask me any questions about the product you may have. Thank You.</li>
            <li> I own several of Davidoff fragrances and turning into a huge fan...(several of the Cool Water renditions..).  Sweetie hooked me up with Champion as a Christmas present and I have been impressed since I first smelled the bottle.  Outstanding...!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Champion comes out of the gates with citrus lemony notes that settles into a unique spicy fragrance with notes of outdoors.  It is a great scent that I like more with each time wearing.  The projection/sillage is average, but the longevity is outstanding.  Some 10 hours later, the fragrance is still detectable on the skin and clothing.  You guys know that I am most critical of the longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Champion offers great flexibility/versatility with notes of both citrus and woods that will work well with any season, occasion, or time of day.  I am pleasantly surprised, almost to the point of being impressed.  Regarding the Wow Factor - Sweetie got to the neck area shortly after I arrived home following a day of work and gave me the thumbs up and asked what it was... She was \\&quot;tickled\\&quot; (yes, I am a Southerner) to find that she bought it for me.. She smiled..!!  The Wow Factor is there..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The review gets better - the bottle and the value..!!  Awesome..!!  While I have the small bottle, it resembles a barbell from the gym equipped with clamp to keep the plates in place - you workout guys know what I am talking about..!!  Now for the price/value - Champion is currently listing for under $20.00 for the small bottle and just over $20.00 for the next size up - plus free shipping..!!  Definitely add to your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally for Champion is 4.5 stars out of 5 stars.  If it were more citrus that woodsy, the scoring would be higher.  All things considered - this fragrance is a best kept secret and under rated.  Play like a Champion today...</li>
            <li> Good value for money, smells decent, but nothing spectacular. It does&#x27;t offend me to sit in my +50 bottle of cologne collection.</li>
            <li> I found this while waiting in an airport terminal and was happy I did. I had been looking for a good cedar smelling cologne and this fit what I was looking for. It lasts the whole day for me and I will certainly get more when I need it.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great. Bought it for my brother for christmas. I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere because it is last seasons cologne. I&#x27;m happy I found it here!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected from this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing exceptional&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be a buyer of this product again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why but the scent is not as strong as their brand they sell to foreign countries. I bought the same cologne in the Bahamas and it smelt so fantastic on my boyfriend that people always asked him what he was wearing. When I bought this one online he did not get the same reaction and the scent was a much lighter version like it was watered down or something.</li>
            <li> this perfume is just perfect as a gift , and about sale i got it very soon from ordered time , shiping was great and everythin as i wanted thank u , and i suggest  it to everyone</li>
            <li> My dad loves it. He says he loves that its a strong fragrance and last all day. He love says it makes him feel like a sexy man...I dont know about that but I&#x27;m just giving his views on it.</li>
            <li> This is a BADASS Cologne. Screw that overrated Agua di Gio. This is the best. Distinct and sexy!</li>
            <li> My fiance loved it! Thanks a lot! The smell is awesome! I loved it on him! :) many many thanks!</li>
            <li> Davidoff Champion has a nice scent am always buying for my husband. Could not beat the price of this cologne</li>
            <li> as a good consumer for davidoff perfumes , this one goes away quickly , even it gives a good sport smell fit with casual clothes .&lt;br /&gt;But the strange thing it goes away , which is not tolerated feature from davidoff perfumes. So Is that original one or not ??&lt;br /&gt;actually I don&#x27;t know !!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne. My wife won&#x27;t let me go LOL. All my friends and people just passing by ask me what am I wearing. I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> when I was introduced to this cologne it came as a gift. I receive nice compliments each time I wear it. The fantastic thing about it is that it lasts so long (for the whole day)... I will highly recommend this perfume and its cool for the prize</li>
            <li> it is amazing perfume</li>
            <li> Often overlooked. I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s any better or worse than some of the classics -- Davidoff Cool Water for example -- but it&#x27;s a modern change-of-pace to some of those. I prefer the woodier types of scents, and Champion is a great compromise that offers you something that you can, in my opinion, wear any time and anywhere while still keeping that fern type scent. It doesn&#x27;t have that promiscuous depth (Drakkar Noir), and instead offers a bit of freshness that&#x27;s easier to accept for those around you in a close office setting. It&#x27;s not my go-to and it&#x27;s not what I turn to when I&#x27;m hitting the bar, but it&#x27;s a safe option that I like having around, and it does hold its own.</li>
