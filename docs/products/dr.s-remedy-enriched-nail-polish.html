            <li>However, if this is in your cosmetics budget, this polish is really very nice.</li>
            <li>very nice.</li>
            <li>they look gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>The nail polish is a good product and it is something that you can wear that helps your nails as well as</li>
            <li>Good variety of color to choose from.</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Love the color, helping my toes too!</li>
            <li>Try it and your hooked, I own 6 colors already.</li>
            <li>Its okay, I thought it would be better</li>
            <li>I also liked the feel of the polish, it is so smooth</li>
            <li>For the price, the applicator could have been much better</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>This polish helps kill the fungus and keep my nails healthy.</li>
            <li>My nails were healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this polish.  </li>
            <li>I do plan on ordering more of it though.</li>
            <li>The best part was that this polish lasted on my nails much longer than the normal 99 cent polish I buy.</li>
            <li>colors are rich and luxurious and the polish goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>However, it does chip easily.</li>
            <li>The color was streaky and didn&#x27;t apply that easily.</li>
            <li>Chemical free this can even be used if your pregnant!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie, $17 for one bottle of nail polish is a HUGE splurge.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it for healthy nails.</li>
            <li>but it was a bit light for my toes</li>
            <li>I use it all year long and the top coat stays nice and shiny!</li>
            <li>I really thought this would be the right polish and looked good the first day then started chipping off the top of my nails.  </li>
            <li>A bit of the red added to the pink gave me a beautiful rose color, with which I am entirely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I attempted to clean and use a brush from another bottle of polish and it got the job done</li>
            <li>so I would have to clean the brush every time I wanted to use this polish.  </li>
            <li>I did purchase Positive Pink, a lighter shade, and with many polishes it isn&#x27;t uncommon for lighter shades to streak.</li>
            <li>amazing - get rid of the chemicals and go natural.</li>
            <li>I was able to wear it for a whole week with not one chip.</li>
            <li>It also stays on very well and doesn&#x27;t need a top coat because its soo shiny.</li>
            <li>This polish is a great color for me - not real bold but not faded out.  </li>
            <li>I have a mild toenail fungal infection and it&#x27;s been 6 months</li>
            <li>I am only glad I didn&#x27;t buy more than one bottle.</li>
            <li>I live in a warm climate where I have to use nail polish for 8 months straight, so a fungus can result from having your nails covered for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Eventually, the nail grew out completely, and I have a healthy nail now.</li>
            <li>loved the pink color on my finger nails</li>
            <li>This polish (in red) was really nice</li>
            <li>Well worth the $12 they charge me for a polish change.</li>
            <li>I just kept adding it until I got the right color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>considering it wears off so quickly I doubt it will do much.</li>
            <li>I think Im gonna order more in a different color.</li>
            <li>GET REAL!  </li>
            <li>have never paid this much for nail polish, but this polish was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It chipped before the end of the first day</li>
            <li>It was easy enough to paint my finger nails with it</li>
            <li>The odor was really strong even after drying and several hours.  </li>
            <li>the top is so large it was difficult to see around and the results on my nails was less than perfect.  </li>
            <li>really?</li>
            <li>It looked fresh for nearly 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>When I removed the polish on my fingernails, I was really pleased to see the white damage marks from the Gel Nails were nearly completely gone.  </li>
            <li>Polish has a different texture than I was used to, need 3 coats to cover nails properly but all if good so far.</li>
            <li>Seriously as much as I love the fashion colors of other brands</li>
            <li>and I find this  polish to come off better than any other.  </li>
            <li>love both Gold and Dark Ruby.</li>
            <li>b/c I live in a humid climate where toenail fungus infection can be a real problem.  </li>
            <li>Though I used an anti-fungal medicine twice daily, I also wanted to hide it, so I used a regular nail polish on top of it.</li>
            <li>Lot of money to pay for a product advertised so highly.</li>
            <li>so you have to put the polish on very thick to keep it looking good.</li>
            <li>and I get nail fungus very easily from constant wet hands.</li>
            <li>I am not hard on my nails either.  </li>
            <li>I first ordered the Positive Pink and gave it a try on my finger and toe nails.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily, stays on with no chipping and comes off with little or no stains.</li>
            <li>I developed a nail fungus on one toe 2 summers ago.</li>
            <li>Think of the consistency of a really old nail polish you haven&#x27;t used in like 4 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This color is much prettier than the photo, especially on your nails.  </li>
            <li>Unless someone else is making this,  I&#x27;ve found no other alternatives.</li>
            <li>I would say it actually lasts better than some of the regular brands I used in the past.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this in pink for a dinner party event, but it took nearly two weeks to arrive (Foot Smart), and didn&#x27;t get here in time.</li>
            <li>I had it on and my nails are a complete disaster 3 days later.....</li>
            <li>The stuff really lasts a long time and when I took it off my toes a couple of weeks later, to my surprise, NO WHITE!  </li>
            <li>Considering that there hasn&#x27;t been any change for better or worse I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;ll be likely wearing it from now on as I restart topical treatment.</li>
            <li>I actually think the polish has started to help them as they are much sturdier and peel less when I&#x27;m wearing the polish.</li>

            <li> don&#x27;t know if it will actually improve the health of my nails since I haven&#x27;t had it long enough but</li>
            <li> I believe because I had it done at the salon, with a proper base coat and top coat, it lasted much longer than if I had done it at home.</li>
            <li> Not sure how effective it will be for eliminating the nail fungus, however, the brush is extremey narrow which makes smooth application next to impossible!</li>
            <li> For the darker colors I only needed one coat, for the lighter pink I needed two.</li>
            <li> $17.95 FOR A SINGLE NAIL POLISH ?  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Rescue Red, and found it to be much to dark for me, to I started mixing the colors.  </li>
            <li> polish goes on super thick and blotchy needing 3 coats to make up for the lighter patches because its too thick to spread evenly on the nail.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how I will be able to use the polish in order to test results- looks very sloppy, with lots of lines.</li>
            <li> All that I expected.</li>
            <li> Too pink for my taste.</li>
            <li> I know that this polish isn&#x27;t supposed to treat anything, I was just curious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take the pink to the salon and have them apply it.  </li>
            <li> Purchased the pink color.</li>
            <li> other customers rated it 5 stars</li>
            <li> and I did not care for the other colors.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; way to polish nails.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it streaks.</li>
            <li> but you must use the base coat and top coat.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on previous reviews.</li>
            <li> The first thing to note about this nail polish is that it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li> but it did not fit the bottle (would not screw on)</li>
            <li> What a waste of money....</li>
            <li> For the ridiculous amount of money this costs it should last at least a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t understand what the other reviewer said about it being thick.</li>
            <li> This one streaks pretty bad</li>
            <li> know it&#x27;s terribly expensive, but this is this only nail polish I&#x27;ve found with anti-fungal properties, and it treats and prevents fungus from growing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a specialty polish, it&#x27;s designed to combat the problem of dull, brittle, cracking nails.</li>
            <li> Like the color, but the nail polish goes on a little too thin and too streaky.  </li>
            <li> I have 3 bottles and have not had a thick one yet.</li>
            <li> My nails are still weak from the damaging Gel Nails, but I believe the Dr Remedy polish made a difference and will continue to use it.    </li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with not only the way it goes on, but the way it looks after it dries, and the duribiliy of the wear.</li>
            <li> This method didn&#x27;t work, the fungus got worse, and continued as the nail grew out.</li>
            <li> The polish is so thin it takes 3 coats to cover the discolored nail.</li>
            <li> I purchased this polish in a different shade after my nails suffered damage from Gel Nail polish that I had a very bad reaction to.  </li>
            <li> all in all, it&#x27;s not worth it as it looks horribly on the nails being too thick.  </li>
            <li> the rapid heart beat was too scary.</li>
            <li> but I do have very thin nails.</li>
            <li> That was very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this nail polish.  </li>

            <li> Its okay, I thought it would be better</li>
            <li> amazing - get rid of the chemicals and go natural. my nails are 150x healthier with just one use- they look gorgeous.  Seriously as much as I love the fashion colors of other brands I will never use them again.  Chemical free this can even be used if your pregnant!</li>
            <li> The first thing to note about this nail polish is that it&#x27;s very expensive. I&#x27;m not going to lie, $17 for one bottle of nail polish is a HUGE splurge. However, if this is in your cosmetics budget, this polish is really very nice. You also have to consider, it&#x27;s supposed to be healing for your nails, not just cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are rich and luxurious and the polish goes on very smooth. For the darker colors I only needed one coat, for the lighter pink I needed two. The best part was that this polish lasted on my nails much longer than the normal 99 cent polish I buy. I was able to wear it for a whole week with not one chip. Even when I get a manicure at the salon, I have a chip or two after only one day. I also liked the feel of the polish, it is so smooth, I think it must be the tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a specialty polish, it&#x27;s designed to combat the problem of dull, brittle, cracking nails. I don&#x27;t have cracking nails but I do have very thin nails. I actually think the polish has started to help them as they are much sturdier and peel less when I&#x27;m wearing the polish.</li>
            <li> This polish is a great color for me - not real bold but not faded out.  It was easy enough to paint my finger nails with it but when I got to my toe nails the top is so large it was difficult to see around and the results on my nails was less than perfect.  I attempted to clean and use a brush from another bottle of polish and it got the job done but it did not fit the bottle (would not screw on) so I would have to clean the brush every time I wanted to use this polish.  Probably won&#x27;t order it again simply because of the design of the lid/brush.</li>
            <li> I really thought this would be the right polish and looked good the first day then started chipping off the top of my nails.  Lot of money to pay for a product advertised so highly. I tried a second time and same thing happened so I gave it to my neice.  Should have returned it.   Happy other customers rated it 5 stars but I will not order this again.  Hoping this would be different.  I am not hard on my nails either.  Btw I did some research and this nail polish does NOT TREAT FUNGUS. The ONLY FDA approved nail polish that kills fungus is DEEP COVER NAIL SYSTEM. Trust me this is coming from someone who tryed everything. Save your $$$$</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on previous reviews.Not sure how effective it will be for eliminating the nail fungus, however, the brush is extremey narrow which makes smooth application next to impossible! Not sure how I will be able to use the polish in order to test results- looks very sloppy, with lots of lines. For the price, the applicator could have been much better</li>
            <li> I developed a nail fungus on one toe 2 summers ago. Though I used an anti-fungal medicine twice daily, I also wanted to hide it, so I used a regular nail polish on top of it. This method didn&#x27;t work, the fungus got worse, and continued as the nail grew out. Last summer I used my anti-fungal medicine along with Dr. Remedy&#x27;s polish, and it not only hid the problem, it allowed my nail to grow out without spreading the fungus. Eventually, the nail grew out completely, and I have a healthy nail now. I am only going to use this polish on my toes from now on. I live in a warm climate where I have to use nail polish for 8 months straight, so a fungus can result from having your nails covered for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s terribly expensive, but this is this only nail polish I&#x27;ve found with anti-fungal properties, and it treats and prevents fungus from growing. Unless someone else is making this,  I&#x27;ve found no other alternatives. I also don&#x27;t understand what the other reviewer said about it being thick. I have 3 bottles and have not had a thick one yet.</li>
            <li> Nice polish - great color!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this nail polish.  I got it because I have fungus on 2 toe nails.  The polish is so thin it takes 3 coats to cover the discolored nail. I won&#x27;t be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> All that I expected. My nails already show improvement.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference after one use on my nails. The only thing I didnt like was the color. Too pink for my taste. I think Im gonna order more in a different color.</li>
            <li> I have a mild toenail fungal infection and it&#x27;s been 6 months and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my nail texture. I went 6 months without additional treatment to see what would happen with the polish alone. I know that this polish isn&#x27;t supposed to treat anything, I was just curious. Considering that there hasn&#x27;t been any change for better or worse I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;ll be likely wearing it from now on as I restart topical treatment. My only complaint is that it streaks. I did purchase Positive Pink, a lighter shade, and with many polishes it isn&#x27;t uncommon for lighter shades to streak. This one streaks pretty bad so you have to put the polish on very thick to keep it looking good. I&#x27;ll be trying a darker shade this fall to compare this to.</li>
            <li> My podiatrist recommended this, bought two colors- love both Gold and Dark Ruby. Goes on easily, stays on with no chipping and comes off with little or no stains. I use it all year long and the top coat stays nice and shiny! Pricey but worth it for healthy nails.</li>
            <li> This is the only nail polish I will ever use. I work as a bartender and I get nail fungus very easily from constant wet hands. This polish helps kill the fungus and keep my nails healthy. It also stays on very well and doesn&#x27;t need a top coat because its soo shiny. Try it and your hooked, I own 6 colors already.</li>
            <li> HAS ALL OF THE U.S. GOTTEN SO GREEDY?  GET REAL!  $17.95 FOR A SINGLE NAIL POLISH ?  I COULDN&#x27;T AFFORD THIS IN MULTIPLE SHADES.</li>
            <li> Goes on great! Beautiful color!</li>
            <li> Love the color, helping my toes too!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the item!</li>
            <li> My problem was that I could not wear toe nail polish for any length of time without my nails starting to turn white underneath.  In the summer time I was was constantly painting, taking it off off for a day or two then repainting.  What a pain!  I first ordered the Positive Pink and gave it a try on my finger and toe nails.  The stuff really lasts a long time and when I took it off my toes a couple of weeks later, to my surprise, NO WHITE!  My nails were healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the pink color on my finger nails but it was a bit light for my toes and I did not care for the other colors.  I purchased the Rescue Red, and found it to be much to dark for me, to I started mixing the colors.  A bit of the red added to the pink gave me a beautiful rose color, with which I am entirely satisfied.  I just kept adding it until I got the right color.&lt;br /&gt;I have never paid this much for nail polish, but this polish was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Actually had a reaction to it once I used it on my fingernails (not on my toenails since I can&#x27;t breathe the fumes).  The odor was really strong even after drying and several hours.  Experienced swollen lips, eye irritation and pounding heart.  I am allergic to the &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; nail polish&#x27;s fumes?!?  I had to remove it within 24 hours...the rapid heart beat was too scary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this brand nail polish for several months now.  I chose it b/c I live in a humid climate where toenail fungus infection can be a real problem.  I love this polish.  I don&#x27;t find it to chip at all but you must use the base coat and top coat.  I would say it actually lasts better than some of the regular brands I used in the past. I also bought the Dr&#x27;s Remedy polish remover and I find this  polish to come off better than any other.  My nails look great and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish goes on super thick and blotchy needing 3 coats to make up for the lighter patches because its too thick to spread evenly on the nail.  Think of the consistency of a really old nail polish you haven&#x27;t used in like 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It chipped before the end of the first day I had it on and my nails are a complete disaster 3 days later.....really? For the ridiculous amount of money this costs it should last at least a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it will actually improve the health of my nails since I haven&#x27;t had it long enough but considering it wears off so quickly I doubt it will do much. Save your money and just buy a bottle of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I purchased this polish in a different shade after my nails suffered damage from Gel Nail polish that I had a very bad reaction to.  I took the polish to the nail salon and had just a polish change for both my fingers and toes.  This polish (in red) was really nice and I was very pleased with the results.  I believe because I had it done at the salon, with a proper base coat and top coat, it lasted much longer than if I had done it at home. It looked fresh for nearly 2 weeks. When I removed the polish on my fingernails, I was really pleased to see the white damage marks from the Gel Nails were nearly completely gone.  My nails are still weak from the damaging Gel Nails, but I believe the Dr Remedy polish made a difference and will continue to use it.    I recently purchased this in pink for a dinner party event, but it took nearly two weeks to arrive (Foot Smart), and didn&#x27;t get here in time. That was very disappointing.  I&#x27;ll take the pink to the salon and have them apply it.  Well worth the $12 they charge me for a polish change.</li>
            <li> It worked well for my needs.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; way to polish nails. I was extremely disappointed with not only the way it goes on, but the way it looks after it dries, and the duribiliy of the wear. In fact it started chipping by the next day. I am only glad I didn&#x27;t buy more than one bottle.</li>
            <li> This color is much prettier than the photo, especially on your nails.  It goes on smoothly and dries fast.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is a good product and it is something that you can wear that helps your nails as well as help you fight fungus because it has tea tree oil in it. However, it does chip easily. I do plan on ordering more of it though.</li>
            <li> Like the color, but the nail polish goes on a little too thin and too streaky.  Good variety of color to choose from.</li>
            <li> Purchased the pink color. very nice. Polish has a different texture than I was used to, need 3 coats to cover nails properly but all if good so far. Hoping to see improvement</li>
            <li> The color was streaky and didn&#x27;t apply that easily.</li>
            <li> Does not cure toenail fungus- just hides temporarily like any nail polish</li>
            <li> i did buy this via Amazon, it was around $20 as shipping is $5. all in all, it&#x27;s not worth it as it looks horribly on the nails being too thick.  don&#x27;t buy it, i don&#x27;t know if has any therapeutic effect but it doesn&#x27;t change the look.</li>
