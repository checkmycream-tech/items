    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This one was perfect.  </li>
            <li>I thought these would be excellent quality</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s held up wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful hair claw!</li>
            <li>Excellent quality and looks</li>
            <li>Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li>so this clip is perfect!!</li>
            <li>It is beautiful and sturdily constructed.</li>
            <li>Am very pleased with this!  </li>
            <li>They stay put all day and very stylish as well!</li>
            <li>This one feels nice and sturdy, although we&#x27;ll see if I end up breaking it over time!</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t see the bright silver metal spring mechanism.</li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>The plastic was a good quality and it worked well.  </li>
            <li>I figured this would be some cheapo clip that would hold until we could find a good one.</li>
            <li>This one has a more attractive spring, since it is covered over</li>
            <li>I am lost when one breaks, so I am very glad to have found replacements on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Strong, beautiful, and reliable.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;ve had it a while now and use it a lot, and it is m favorite go-to clip!</li>
            <li>Recommended to look stylish and chic!</li>
            <li>I love these clips!  </li>
            <li>and it is indeed a nice jumbo size.</li>
            <li>The plastic held up nicely, but on both clips the spring snapped.  </li>
            <li>If they were cheaper, I might reorder them, but at this kind of price, I cannot afford to.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best clip ever, if you want to pull all your hair up.</li>
            <li>after a couple of days the prongs don&#x27;t itch any more, I don&#x27;t know why, but this happens with any brand of hair clip that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>How many words can a guy say about this?</li>
            <li>There are so many imitations out there, trying to copy the &amp;#34;real thing!&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>They sent smaller claws, with exposed springs, made from brittle plastic, which would get one star at best.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I ordered this product.  </li>
            <li>When my favorite hair clip broke after years of loyal service, I was dismayed at not being able to locate a replacement.  </li>
            <li>I have mid-length fine, medium-thickness hair â€“ probably wore this clip 10 times</li>
            <li>If you have massive amounts of hair, this would be great.  </li>
            <li>You can tell when you actually hold it that the plastic is sturdier, not brittle like some claw clips and it has a good, strong spring mech.</li>
            <li>The CARAVAN hair products are lightweight, yet sturdy, very shiny and pretty to look at and most of all, very comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right here!  </li>
            <li>one a cheaper model with good reviews, and this one, which was double the price.</li>
            <li>It is a good investment if they last, because I have clips I have had for years and the springs eventually</li>
            <li>I think they are a decent clip and am okay paying the price for them</li>
            <li>It seems to function more smoothly, clicking open and shut with a nice action.</li>
            <li>I had a beautiful clip that broke, and I was hoping this product could tame my tresses.  </li>
            <li>so couldn&#x27;t use it for a whole day comfortably.</li>
            <li>I really liked this hair clip, then it broke for no reason at all after only 2 months of use.</li>
            <li>I do ask these clips to do a huge job of holding all this heavy hair and looking good, even holding the hair</li>
            <li>Well worth my money.</li>
            <li>Right where the spring is attached.  </li>
            <li>I paid $10 for them, which to me is a little steep, but I guess worth it when you can&#x27;t find clips this good.</li>
            <li>My search for a large, durable hair clip continues!</li>
            <li>I love these giant size claw clips!</li>
            <li>great product for thick hair as it holds all the hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;item</li>
            <li>and they seemed to be at first.  </li>
            <li>Smaller pin and more plastic on the pivot seems to be the direction they took on these..We&#x27;ll see....</li>
            <li>However when this arrived, it was exactly what we had been looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so true that the Caravan brand is made of much better material that won&#x27;t break as fast as other brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much better quality hair claw than what you would find in a drugstore, but not nearly as high quality as others I&#x27;ve ordered online.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge, it&#x27;s sturdy, and when/if this breaks, I will definitely order this product again.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li>but it absolutely does NOT.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my lion-maned sister, and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>I will not be spending so much on these again.  </li>
            <li>I will use these as long as Caravan makes them because no other clip works and stays and makes my do look fabulous!</li>
            <li>Also the spring is hidden, which is more aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li>These clips allow me to quickly get my hair off my neck and they don&#x27;t leave a big dent like a pony tail would.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered two more from MayaBeauty (which is where this comment appears) and what they sent was NOT THE SAME.</li>
            <li>I have to say, initially I was leery of the higher price-tag for what looked just like any other claw clip on Amazon, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to go ahead and make the purchase.</li>
            <li>These seem a little more durable.</li>
            <li>Great quality, a little heavy, but you could not get this quality in a lighter weight.</li>
            <li>this clip will hold up super long hair!</li>
            <li>I go 4 starts right now for the action of the spring and the solid heft of the piece.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, after a few days, the hair clip works perfectly &amp; holds up all my thick long hair.  </li>
            <li>For years I have used this type of large clip since it is the only clip that fits my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li>They refunded my money and actually told me to keep the clips they sent, which speaks highly of their customer service ethic!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this lasted another 10-20 years.</li>
            <li>I give it two stars because it does hold long hair well but with too much tension for comfort.</li>
            <li>i could n0ot find this size of these clips anywhere locally and really wanted a couple of this size since all others that i have found are smaller.</li>
            <li>I have looked and looked for a high quality Jumbo Hair Claw that is 5 or 6 inches long for over two years.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and they were completely unapologetic since the return policy only lasted for 14 days.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, and it is long, so finding a jumbo claw clip that is strong enough to handle my hair without breaking after a few uses is a challenge.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t curve around enough for my head either, but that is probably fine if I had truly thick hair.  </li>
            <li>The size of this clip was decent - enough to put my mid-back length fine hair up for a brief time and not have it fall out, but the poor durability makes this product unworthy of a repurchase.</li>
            <li>this is bigger than I expected and works really well to pull my hair up and out of the way</li>
            <li>The first few days the prongs felt itchy, but</li>
            <li>I have very thick, long hair and was looking for something more substantial.</li>
            <li>It is too large to only pull half of it up.</li>
            <li>For average long hair, I like the Vidal Sassoon Large Barrel Claw Clips.  </li>

            <li> It is too large to only pull half of it up.</li>
            <li> For average long hair, I like the Vidal Sassoon Large Barrel Claw Clips.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased to see they weren&#x27;t kidding, and thus it holds all my hair whether I braid it and wrap it up in the comb, or just casually grab and twist my hair up.</li>
            <li> before they break, that is usually due to accidental breakage, so am so surprised.</li>
            <li> will see how long the middle mechanism last..</li>
            <li> The picture misrepresents the product.&lt;br /&gt;The clip I received was only 9 prongs long not 11 like the picture shows.</li>
            <li> A lot of money to spend on an item that will not last for very long.</li>
            <li> Not my fault that I expected it to last for a lot longer than 2 months!</li>
            <li> I have long hair and the clip held wll</li>
            <li> I expected years of use from this, especially since I can&#x27;t wear it as often as I had hoped, because of the heaviness.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, so sometimes they tend to snap and break when I open it too wide and shove all my hair in.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long before they break.</li>
            <li> I have several clipped around the house ready for when I can&#x27;t take my down past my waist hair anymore.</li>
            <li> ; It is not large enough to hold my hair.</li>
            <li> My other clip was uniquely long, curved around the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the price since I had been looking for so long!  </li>
            <li> This jumbo clip is really large &amp; long and holds up tons of long, thick hair all day!  </li>
            <li> It slips out constantly so I can&#x27;t wear it to the gym and doesn&#x27;t even work as well as the smaller one I had that has worn out and lost a few teeth.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that I braid and then fold up and down 3X to get it off my back and neck.</li>
            <li> The clip is long - yes, but skinny and holds maybe half my hair and only if I have it contained in a pony tail before I twist it up.</li>
            <li> I have hair past the middle of my back and it medium in thickness and this clip holds it like a champ.</li>
            <li> The first ones I had lasted a few years, but lately they do break after about a year.  </li>
            <li> The other disappointment is that the claws are sharp, which doesn&#x27;t provide better function - they just hurt your scalp.</li>
            <li> I used this clip to put up my hair after showering a few times a week for about four months, and a short time ago the plastic on the hinge broke.</li>
            <li> It is very big but doesn&#x27;t have strength for heavy duty.</li>
            <li> are very well made and they DO hold thick, heavy hair!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> they last longer and are less than half the price.</li>
            <li> My old Goody ones that I was trying to replace lasted at least 10 years if not 20!  </li>
            <li> I am brunette with thick hair that ends half-way down my back, and will wear the claw all day (and even, accidentally, all night!)</li>
            <li> But after less than 6 months, both of them broke (the spring).  </li>
            <li> However, in less than one year both of the clips I ordered broke at the spring point.  </li>
            <li> With this claw, as soon as I moved my head just a little, it loosened, and everything came down.</li>
            <li> is a little high priced, but unable to find anything comparable&lt;br /&gt;in stores.</li>
            <li> but it held so tightly it hurt my head</li>
            <li> 5 months and today, it broke in half!  </li>
            <li> I have long very thick hair</li>
            <li> This hair claw is just what you need if you have very thick and/or very long hair.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who seriously has thick (and long) hair needs to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Because I have thick hair down to my waist.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not super thick, so this was overkill.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s really not that expensive, just when you compare it to other clips).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this based on reviews that it holds thick hair but it absolutely does NOT. The clip is long - yes, but skinny and holds maybe half my hair and only if I have it contained in a pony tail before I twist it up. It slips out constantly so I can&#x27;t wear it to the gym and doesn&#x27;t even work as well as the smaller one I had that has worn out and lost a few teeth. Anyone who seriously has thick (and long) hair needs to look elsewhere. This works the same as the basic ones you find at Target and Walmart even if it looks larger. I will have to go to a specialty shop.</li>
            <li> This jumbo clip is really large &amp; long and holds up tons of long, thick hair all day!  The first few days the prongs felt itchy, but after a couple of days the prongs don&#x27;t itch any more, I don&#x27;t know why, but this happens with any brand of hair clip that I have tried.  Anyhow, after a few days, the hair clip works perfectly &amp; holds up all my thick long hair.  This is the biggest &amp; sturdiest hair clip I have ever found.  It&#x27;s so true that the Caravan brand is made of much better material that won&#x27;t break as fast as other brands.</li>
            <li> Great quality, a little heavy, but you could not get this quality in a lighter weight.</li>
            <li> I ordered two different claws- one a cheaper model with good reviews, and this one, which was double the price. This one has a more attractive spring, since it is covered over and you don&#x27;t see the bright silver metal spring mechanism. It seems to function more smoothly, clicking open and shut with a nice action. I like the color and it is indeed a nice jumbo size. Since I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week (to keep my waist length hair up) I can&#x27;t say yet about the durability. I go 4 starts right now for the action of the spring and the solid heft of the piece. I&#x27;ll update if I have problems with breakage!</li>
            <li> I really liked this hair clip, then it broke for no reason at all after only 2 months of use. I contacted the seller and they were completely unapologetic since the return policy only lasted for 14 days. Not my fault that I expected it to last for a lot longer than 2 months! A lot of money to spend on an item that will not last for very long.</li>
            <li> Am very pleased with this!  Will end up buying another one at some point.  The reviews do help to make a decision.  So I thank the people who take the time to post the reviews.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, and it is long, so finding a jumbo claw clip that is strong enough to handle my hair without breaking after a few uses is a challenge. I have to say, initially I was leery of the higher price-tag for what looked just like any other claw clip on Amazon, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to go ahead and make the purchase. (it&#x27;s really not that expensive, just when you compare it to other clips). You can tell when you actually hold it that the plastic is sturdier, not brittle like some claw clips and it has a good, strong spring mech. Anyway, I&#x27;ve had it a while now and use it a lot, and it is m favorite go-to clip!</li>
            <li> i could n0ot find this size of these clips anywhere locally and really wanted a couple of this size since all others that i have found are smaller. I think they are a decent clip and am okay paying the price for them but i still think they shouldn&#x27;t cost $12.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time lately finding Jumbo Claw Clips like these. I have hair past the middle of my back and it medium in thickness and this clip holds it like a champ. It is by far the best clip ever, if you want to pull all your hair up. It is too large to only pull half of it up. I wish it was cheaper. I paid $10 for them, which to me is a little steep, but I guess worth it when you can&#x27;t find clips this good. It is a good investment if they last, because I have clips I have had for years and the springs eventually and so do the claws. These seem a little more durable.</li>
            <li> I love these giant size claw clips! I have several clipped around the house ready for when I can&#x27;t take my down past my waist hair anymore. These clips allow me to quickly get my hair off my neck and they don&#x27;t leave a big dent like a pony tail would.</li>
            <li> How many words can a guy say about this? I bought it for my wife , so , ask her. She does like it</li>
            <li> Strong, beautiful, and reliable.  Why no 5 stars? Because I have thick hair down to my waist. I had a beautiful clip that broke, and I was hoping this product could tame my tresses.  My other clip was uniquely long, curved around the back of my head.  This product, while being the longest clip I could find on Amazon, is inadequate for my needs. The weight of my hair causes it to sag after a few hours, and it sits uncomfortably on my head.  If  you are not devoted to growing your hair to ren-faire lenghts, this could be for you!  It is beautiful and sturdily constructed.</li>
            <li> I have mid-length fine, medium-thickness hair â€“ probably wore this clip 10 times and then it broke. Really disappointing since it&#x27;s pretty expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  Works with a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> I used this clip to put up my hair after showering a few times a week for about four months, and a short time ago the plastic on the hinge broke. The size of this clip was decent - enough to put my mid-back length fine hair up for a brief time and not have it fall out, but the poor durability makes this product unworthy of a repurchase. My search for a large, durable hair clip continues!</li>
            <li> This hair clip is a cut above the rest. Solid, sturdy construction. Also the spring is hidden, which is more aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and the clip held wll but it held so tightly it hurt my head so couldn&#x27;t use it for a whole day comfortably. The other night it snapped and now it is useless. I have had clips for, literally, years and years before they break, that is usually due to accidental breakage, so am so surprised. I paid $12.00 for this clip since they are so hard to find but am thoroughly disappointed. I give it two stars because it does hold long hair well but with too much tension for comfort. I expected years of use from this, especially since I can&#x27;t wear it as often as I had hoped, because of the heaviness.</li>
            <li> If you have massive amounts of hair, this would be great.  I have pretty long hair but it&#x27;s not super thick, so this was overkill. It didn&#x27;t curve around enough for my head either, but that is probably fine if I had truly thick hair.  For average long hair, I like the Vidal Sassoon Large Barrel Claw Clips.  They are bigger than what you find at the drug store, but not ginormous.</li>
            <li> It is very big but doesn&#x27;t have strength for heavy duty. I just have lots of hair and It broke after one month.</li>
            <li> great product for thick hair as it holds all the hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;item is a little high priced, but unable to find anything comparable&lt;br /&gt;in stores.</li>
            <li> This hair claw is just what you need if you have very thick and/or very long hair.  It can firmly hold both!</li>
            <li> I have looked and looked for a high quality Jumbo Hair Claw that is 5 or 6 inches long for over two years.  This one was perfect.  I didn&#x27;t mind the price since I had been looking for so long!  I have owned this for approx. 5 months and today, it broke in half!  Right where the spring is attached.  Not the spring itself but the plastic hinge holding the spring and the two sides together.  I am SO DISAPPOINTED!!  :-(</li>
            <li> The clips made by Caravan are the nicest clips I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;They are very well made and they DO hold thick, heavy hair!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love them.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my lion-maned sister, and she really likes it. Recommended to look stylish and chic!</li>
            <li> I thought these would be excellent quality and they seemed to be at first.  But after less than 6 months, both of them broke (the spring).  The plastic held up nicely, but on both clips the spring snapped.  For the hefty price of $12.00 a piece, these are not a good buy.  Stick with Goody brand hair claws......they last longer and are less than half the price.</li>
            <li> For years I have used this type of large clip since it is the only clip that fits my hair.  I am lost when one breaks, so I am very glad to have found replacements on Amazon.  The first ones I had lasted a few years, but lately they do break after about a year.  I do ask these clips to do a huge job of holding all this heavy hair and looking good, even holding the hair well when the hair is damp.  I will use these as long as Caravan makes them because no other clip works and stays and makes my do look fabulous!</li>
            <li> There are so many imitations out there, trying to copy the &amp;#34;real thing!&amp;#34;.  The CARAVAN hair products are lightweight, yet sturdy, very shiny and pretty to look at and most of all, very comfortable to wear.  I love these clips!  They stay put all day and very stylish as well!</li>
            <li> this is bigger than I expected and works really well to pull my hair up and out of the way</li>
            <li> i have had to turn to amazon to find one of these clips seeing as drugs stores, etc. do not carry them anymore. my hair is hip length, and there is no way one of the smaller clips will hold it. this clip will hold up super long hair! even when my hair was a bit shorter (mid-back), i used one like it since the smaller ones wouldn&#x27;t work. yes, i have had one of these break on me, but it&#x27;s not the end of the world, i just have another clip sent with my next amazon order. i recommend getting two of these- one to wear daily and one to use in the shower or keep as a spare. i&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars because it&#x27;s the only clip i&#x27;ve found that holds all my hair up.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but ordered based on the described size (jumbo). I was pleased to see they weren&#x27;t kidding, and thus it holds all my hair whether I braid it and wrap it up in the comb, or just casually grab and twist my hair up. I am brunette with thick hair that ends half-way down my back, and will wear the claw all day (and even, accidentally, all night!) and it&#x27;s held up wonderfully. It&#x27;s huge, it&#x27;s sturdy, and when/if this breaks, I will definitely order this product again.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This review was based on the Jumbo Claw sold by Amazon.com. I recently ordered two more from MayaBeauty (which is where this comment appears) and what they sent was NOT THE SAME. They sent smaller claws, with exposed springs, made from brittle plastic, which would get one star at best. I have written to MayaBeauty for replacement with the correct product. They refunded my money and actually told me to keep the clips they sent, which speaks highly of their customer service ethic!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  Impossible for me to find locally - and I have searched every drug store in my area.  I have a lot of hair, so sometimes they tend to snap and break when I open it too wide and shove all my hair in.  This one feels nice and sturdy, although we&#x27;ll see if I end up breaking it over time!</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I ordered this product.  The plastic was a good quality and it worked well.  However, in less than one year both of the clips I ordered broke at the spring point.  My old Goody ones that I was trying to replace lasted at least 10 years if not 20!  I will not be spending so much on these again.  If they were cheaper, I might reorder them, but at this kind of price, I cannot afford to.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long before they break. Smaller pin and more plastic on the pivot seems to be the direction they took on these..We&#x27;ll see....</li>
            <li> Wonderful hair claw! Not easy to find at this size and price!  Excellent quality and looks so great.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy another .</li>
            <li> The picture misrepresents the product.&lt;br /&gt;The clip I received was only 9 prongs long not 11 like the picture shows. So I would call it &amp;#34;medium sized.&amp;#34; It is not large enough to hold my hair. Unfortunately I missed the return window so I&#x27;m stuck with a useless clip that cost a whopping $12</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair and was looking for something more substantial. It&#x27;s a much better quality hair claw than what you would find in a drugstore, but not nearly as high quality as others I&#x27;ve ordered online. The other disappointment is that the claws are sharp, which doesn&#x27;t provide better function - they just hurt your scalp.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and could never find in the stores.  I use these to tie my hair up in the shower.</li>
            <li> The teeth of this claw are not curved enough to wrap around and under your hair to hold it snugly. I have long hair that I braid and then fold up and down 3X to get it off my back and neck. I like to use a claw to hold everything in place. With this claw, as soon as I moved my head just a little, it loosened, and everything came down.</li>
            <li> When my favorite hair clip broke after years of loyal service, I was dismayed at not being able to locate a replacement.  Then I found it:  It&#x27;s right here!  This is the one!  The difference between this clip and the ones sold in stores is not only the size, but the type of plastic it&#x27;s made from.  Well worth my money.</li>
            <li> met my expectations, but had only 2 weeks.. will see how long the middle mechanism last..</li>
            <li> As usual it arrived on time. Got this for my mother, she has had a clip like this for years and hers finally died. I figured this would be some cheapo clip that would hold until we could find a good one. However when this arrived, it was exactly what we had been looking for. The color is just like in the picture, the spring and plastic are quality. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this lasted another 10-20 years.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! I have long very thick hair so this clip is perfect!!</li>
