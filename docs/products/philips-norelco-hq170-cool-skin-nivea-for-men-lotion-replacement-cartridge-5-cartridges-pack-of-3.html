            <li>Really great for my husbands skin.  </li>
            <li>great price for these items.  </li>
            <li>Great shave gel and lotion</li>
            <li>A great product at a good price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good step up for a razor blade users face, I recommend both the razor and the lotion.</li>
            <li>so we were delighted to find them.</li>
            <li>good flow of lotion during shave.</li>
            <li>I have always liked this product for its great smell and the feel after its applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with product and service.  </li>
            <li>Glad to find a supplier for this because the stores don&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
            <li>I believe this razor is now discontinued, and many stores have stopped stocking the lotion cartridges, so I turned to the internet to get my supply.  </li>
            <li>The lotion works better than the gel.</li>
            <li>so every man could have the experience of healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>glad you had them</li>
            <li>this product is very needed and very nice.  </li>
            <li>Great product from prior use and even better now!</li>
            <li>I would advise Philips to make a more user friendly dispenser that did not require &amp;#34;Philips&amp;#34; shaver</li>
            <li>Been using my norelco cool skin shaver for about 6 years and wish they kept selling them!</li>
            <li>From my experience the lotion is better than the gel and more economical too.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and easy to store</li>
            <li>on the whole very satisfying.</li>
            <li>I have had this Norelco razor for a number of years and get my supplies from Amazon, who seem to get them directly from Norelco cheaper than on Norelco&#x27;s own site!  </li>
            <li>I found it to work great with the Norelco, and I finally have a travel razer that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.</li>
            <li>gives smooth shaving.</li>
            <li>irritation free.</li>
            <li>Cool comfortable shaves is what you will get.</li>
            <li>Cool Skin Nivea was the answer.  </li>
            <li>not least, this product smells 100 times better than pre and aftershave fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Still, worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I was interested by the lotion dispensing Norelco Cool Skin.</li>
            <li>It makes dry shaving faster and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Not only is it better for his skin, not causing the ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>but it left his face feeling so much better.  </li>
            <li>This absolutely reduces irritation while shaving with the electric shaver.</li>
            <li>The product arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I have been using these cartridges for about 4 years and it really helps with my shave.</li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>Thanks AMAZON</li>
            <li>After learning to shave with a safety razor, and using it for 12 years until it broke, I wandered in the shaving realm for several years, never finding an adequate razor.  </li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t even find it in stores anymore because the razor that it&#x27;s used in is an older model norelco.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly from the seller as I really didn&#x27;t wait long at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I bought the product for my young grandson and he&#x27;s ever so grateful.  </li>
            <li>but I am not going to argue as my order always arrives early</li>
            <li>No Clogging and no mess.  </li>
            <li>Will expect automatic reordering in the near future.</li>
            <li>Eventually I decided to try an electric again - having had a bad experience before - and purchased a Norelco 6705X, which really works well for my sensitive skin (particularly on my neck) as it integrates the Nivea Cool Skin lotion while I shave.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> From my experience the lotion is better than the gel and more economical too. You ned less lotion than the gel for a shaving session. I highly recommend. The price here in Israel for one box with five sachets is around US$ 20.00. For me it is also a bargain.</li>
            <li> Glad to find a supplier for this because the stores don&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
            <li> After learning to shave with a safety razor, and using it for 12 years until it broke, I wandered in the shaving realm for several years, never finding an adequate razor.  Eventually I decided to try an electric again - having had a bad experience before - and purchased a Norelco 6705X, which really works well for my sensitive skin (particularly on my neck) as it integrates the Nivea Cool Skin lotion while I shave.  I believe this razor is now discontinued, and many stores have stopped stocking the lotion cartridges, so I turned to the internet to get my supply.  The lotion always leaves my skin feeling supple and soothed as it is alcohol-free, which is a rarity in men&#x27;s shaving products.</li>
            <li> This absolutely reduces irritation while shaving with the electric shaver. I no longer have red bumps on my throat, but you I do have to use it generously when shaving. Still, worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> These can be hard to find in stores and amazon&#x27;s price was solid. Shipping time was as expected.</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast. Great product from prior use and even better now! The price beat all competitors I reviewed too. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry...I went on vacation the day they arrived then when I got back I forgot to post a note.  I bought the product for my young grandson and he&#x27;s ever so grateful.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> great value.  this is the only website that has the lowest price.  you can&#x27;t even find it in stores anymore because the razor that it&#x27;s used in is an older model norelco.</li>
            <li> I have had this Norelco razor for a number of years and get my supplies from Amazon, who seem to get them directly from Norelco cheaper than on Norelco&#x27;s own site!  I cannot figure that out but I am not going to argue as my order always arrives early and I have never had a billing problem.  I would recommended the site and product to anyone.    Kindest Regards,    BocaMustang</li>
            <li> It makes dry shaving faster and much more comfortable. It fits inside my electric razor and lets me dispense small amounts as needed and it isn&#x27;t messy like other pre-shave products.</li>
            <li> The lotion works better than the gel. I have been using these cartridges for about 4 years and it really helps with my shave.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this item in stores and finally had some luck online. My husband finally started using his electric razor again and needed these. Work great!</li>
            <li> I have trouble with electric shavers burning my neck and face, and causing me to break out. I was interested by the lotion dispensing Norelco Cool Skin. I found it to work great with the Norelco, and I finally have a travel razer that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face. The Norelco adjusts automatically from 110 to 220V for travel. The lotion is great and helps make my face feel great. It can even help with wind burn, minor scrapes and cuts. It&#x27;s a good step up for a razor blade users face, I recommend both the razor and the lotion.</li>
            <li> Really great for my husbands skin.  He used the harsh pre-shave or aftershave in the past, causing him to get occasional ingrown facial hairs that were nasty.  Cool Skin Nivea was the answer.  Not only is it better for his skin, not causing the ingrown hairs but it left his face feeling so much better.  Last but not least, this product smells 100 times better than pre and aftershave fresh and clean.  When my son started shaving, this product is what we went for.  So, we had to buy a electric razor that utilized this product for him.  It doesn&#x27;t matter what form of packaging, be it a cartridge or a pump dispenser this product is very needed and very nice.  I would advise Philips to make a more user friendly dispenser that did not require &amp;#34;Philips&amp;#34; shaver so every man could have the experience of healthy skin.  Sometimes, men are a little clueless.....hahaha</li>
            <li> These replacement cartridges are hard to get so we were delighted to find them. They are easy to use and easy to store AND they work.</li>
            <li> Been using my norelco cool skin shaver for about 6 years and wish they kept selling them! This lotion is the best!! No chafing redness or burning ever!</li>
            <li> I received my Nivea cartridges in record time.  I&#x27;m very pleased with product and service.  I would recommend this dealer to everyone.</li>
            <li> The product lives up to it&#x27;s promise.  Cool comfortable shaves is what you will get. No Clogging and no mess.  A great product at a good price.  Thanks AMAZON</li>
            <li> The shipment came in faster than expected at the price quoted! Can&#x27;t wait to reorder... Will expect automatic reordering in the near future.</li>
            <li> great price for these items.  they are almost impossible to find in the stores any longer.  glad you had them</li>
            <li> gives smooth shaving. irritation free. good flow of lotion during shave. on the whole very satisfying. after all you don&#x27;t have any alternative.</li>
            <li> Great shave gel and lotion</li>
            <li> I order this for my son every year so he doesn&#x27;t get razor rash or bumps. He insists on the 3 pack to get him through the year.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this product for its great smell and the feel after its applied. It arrived quickly from the seller as I really didn&#x27;t wait long at all. Very happy with the service.</li>
            <li> hubby loves this product</li>
