            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I would recomend Love Alpha Fibre Mascara!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, love this!</li>
            <li>YOU WILL love this mascara/fiber lashes!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll LOVE it!</li>
            <li>This is great and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I like the packaging it was really nice</li>
            <li>I really liked the product.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this mascara.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would.</li>
            <li>so I will use my own mascara brush or the transplanting gel to brush it through.</li>
            <li>Loving it.</li>
            <li>The case that comes with it is really nice to store your mascara</li>
            <li>So use to your own desecration/</li>
            <li>Great value, works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply</li>
            <li>Everything does wash off VERY easily with baby shampoo or eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I liked the way it made my lashes look, but had to stop using it because I kept getting the fibers in my eyes during the day.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>Not an every day mascara, but maybe  good for special occasions.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, looks nice, worth the price for sure!</li>
            <li>Really glad I didn&#x27;t spend 32 on the younique now</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m still satisfied.</li>
            <li>Works OKAY in comparison</li>
            <li>lOVE</li>
            <li>Makes your eyelashes pop out more than mascara would do.</li>
            <li>Love this 3D will ALWAYS use this from now on.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara...</li>
            <li>Love this product..</li>
            <li>, the price is excellent compare to Younique which I tested and this product is the same thing .&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I totally love it...</li>
            <li>I love the way my eyelashes look after I apply the Love Alpha mascara on.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use the masaca after putting on the fibers</li>
            <li>Check your face to make sure you dont have fibers.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>All in all a good product that is worth the money.</li>
            <li>We both love the product.</li>
            <li>This is much better than Younique.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li>There are better mascaras out there</li>
            <li>The case is cute.</li>
            <li>Plus, if you have access to youtube there are many videos on how to correctly apply this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>They will get in your eyes if you use to many.</li>
            <li>If I can read all the way, the result may be even better.</li>
            <li>more precision is desirable.  </li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>so I sought out a cheaper alternative and found this Love Alpha set for just $10.</li>
            <li>The Younique fibers are way more neat and they don&#x27;t fly around as much.</li>
            <li>As soon as I pulled out the Love Alpha brush the fibers were floating everywhere.</li>
            <li>I like i will buy more.....</li>
            <li>You may need to apply more fibers and keep repeating the steps if you want the glamorous \\&quot;going out\\</li>
            <li>This product helps more with the length than the volume.  </li>
            <li>, I make sure I have PLENTY of time to test and try it as like a \\&quot;trial</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Amazing mascara, fabulous price.</li>
            <li>and when you put the fibers on, you get more on your face than on your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>love it does what it says it does</li>
            <li>I LOVE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>THE CASE I NOW USE FOR MY READING GLASSES :)</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy more if I hadn&#x27;t bought 2.</li>
            <li>Its okay.</li>
            <li>I must say , this is better .</li>
            <li>I will for sure order it again.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Repeat the longer tube of Love Alpha and Fibre Mascara one more time.  </li>
            <li>Do not use the Love Alpha on your bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why so many people are bitching.</li>
            <li>While it works well, it does take more than one application.  </li>
            <li>I love the fibers though will definetly repurchase just for those</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this because I love it</li>
            <li>Want more, do it again.</li>
            <li>You have to put on the tranplant gel then the fibers, then the transplant gel, then the fibers, then more transplanting so on and so forth.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love my eyelashes now.  </li>
            <li>and i get so many compliments on how my eyelashes look.</li>
            <li>I love this product, i would buy it again and again.</li>
            <li>Will order again for sure.</li>
            <li>Read the online directions on how to put on and dont repeat so many times or you get clumpy lashes.</li>
            <li>Ordered more so that I wouldn&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li>May cost more money but it has collagen in it</li>
            <li>I tried covering with my mascara to seal it better but didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Glad for those it worked for, just not a product for me.</li>
            <li>but Younique 3D lashe mascera is 100x better.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>So I ordered the Love Alpha Magic fiber mascara.  </li>
            <li>it causes clumps and more chance to get them in your eye).</li>
            <li>The transplanting gel is okay</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok,</li>
            <li>I love the fiber lashes I tried them as soon as I got them</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use PLENTY of the gel mascara to avoid shedding.</li>
            <li>I will pay the $30 for the REAL DEAL !!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this product after reading reviews.  </li>
            <li>I am posting a picture so you can see the very clean wands</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t, but it works pretty good</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful on this product however the transplanting gel was nice but the tube of fiber was not!</li>
            <li>Then, put a good coat of the gel on my lashes first.</li>
            <li>I am SO excited about this product!</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have bought in a long time!!</li>
            <li>In fact, this is my new favorite mascara!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other fiber mascaras, this is the best.</li>
            <li>This is a great fix for natural looking eye lashes..</li>
            <li>I will admit that the name brand Younique version of this product probably applies more smoothly</li>
            <li>:) enjoy</li>
            <li>The results are good and you don&#x27;t have to worry about thinning your real lashes.</li>
            <li>Good but very flaky.</li>
            <li>Then, any mascara you want (a cheap one is just fine), then the longer tube of the Love Alpha, then the Fibre Mascara.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>If they end up on your face during application, they blow off or brush off easy as dust.</li>
            <li>It lasts along time without flaking off and it easily washes off.</li>
            <li>Removal is easy with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>it  washes off easily but does not smear.  </li>
            <li>I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply, easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li>They advertise the product comes with a nice case, and mine came in a regular mail envelope, good for the price</li>
            <li>The transplanting gel smell strong and the fiber...</li>
            <li>Just as good as its high dollar competition.</li>
            <li>do a touch of my own mascara first, then the transplanting gel, then the fiber mascara.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I do; kind of like a recipe.  </li>
            <li>I am at an age where I have fine lashes and any help in defining them and making them look fuller and longer is welcomed.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that I do LOVE this mascara, BUT, make sure you have some time to put it on at first b/c</li>
            <li>Love this product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It gave amazing results that a regular mascara doesn&#x27;t, and i&#x27;ve tried so many!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this for any girl who wants beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li>Looks fabulous .</li>
            <li>It makes your eyelashes look longer and fabulous</li>
            <li>Works great if applied properly!</li>
            <li>amazing product that really does lengthen your lash.  </li>
            <li>Price fantastic too</li>
            <li>If there was a better way to seal the fibers then I could have given this more stars but not so much.</li>
            <li>I recently bought Love Alpha fiber mascara got it in the mail today and looked up a quick tutorial on YouTube and boom I have amazing lashes!</li>
            <li>This is an okay product..can&#x27;t beat the price however..takes time to get just right..</li>
            <li>But you really cant complain for the price you get what you pay for!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply--use the gel then use the fibers.</li>
            <li>(just make sure you watch a tutorial first).</li>
            <li>suggestion is to apply your eye-liner first and then apply your favorite mascara(s) and then apply the love Alpha Transparent gel first and then apply the Fiber and finishing it up with again the Transparent Gel to seal the fibers to your lashes.</li>
            <li>I recommend a VERY light coat of your own mascara before starting.  </li>
            <li>I received mine yesterday and put a coat on right away!</li>
            <li>the actual mascara is good tho  .</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t sold on what the product would do, so I wasn&#x27;t about to shell out top dollar until I knew this was a real thing.</li>
            <li>Ok the shipping was fast so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li>Ok, so this mascara is really inexpensive and that is a plus.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only thing I wish the products improve to make the fiber stick to your lashes good until you wash it off.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to love this product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I didn&#x27;t spend whole alot of money</li>
            <li>My sister loved it, second time purchasing!</li>
            <li>I figured for the price of the Love Alpha, if I didn&#x27;t like it, I wasn&#x27;t out much.</li>
            <li>and I still had enough mascara on my lashes that it looked good</li>
            <li>With this product, no damage to natural lashes and really nice after application.</li>
            <li>Love how my lashes look, very lengthy.</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly, packaged as shown.</li>
            <li>There are TONS of Youtube videos that will quickly show you how to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For a more obvious, look at my eyes, I&#x27;m not a mom running errands look, I do more</li>
            <li>Its worth paying the extra pounds for a good, quality product.</li>
            <li>It works better than I thought it would, though I didn&#x27;t have high expectations to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took forever though...</li>
            <li>I have tiny eyelashes that you can barely see without mascara, so I have honestly tried them all!!</li>
            <li>This did not work for me at all the first time, but I tried it again and while it was a pain going over and over my eyelashes eventually it made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This mascara works great if your real careful putting on the fibers.</li>
            <li>and I am always trying to find good mascara to make them long and</li>
            <li>Honestly, you can get close to the same look with just good regular maskara.</li>
            <li>My instructions were also in Chinese, but knowing so many people that have used it, I was able to figure it out pretty well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first day using this and already got compliments on my eyelashes!</li>
            <li>If you just let it dry then lightly go over it again with the mascara, the fibers stay put nicely</li>
            <li>Therefore, if you are consider buying this product just buy the transplanting gel instead to make your eyelashes look more beautiful and dramatic.</li>
            <li>but I have to constantly checking myself image by looking at the mirror 3-4 time during the day to make sure that none of the fine fiber falls on my face or just right below my lower lashes.  </li>
            <li>Your lashes will look amazing if you use it properly.  </li>
            <li>this mascara worth the money</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly worried about the damage it does to my own eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The mascara with its natural fibers are neat to play around with, but it&#x27;s not as grand as others seem to make it out to be.</li>
            <li>It was worth it just to try it out.</li>
            <li>For the price it is a fun product to use.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>Although it took a while to receive, it was worth the wait and price.</li>
            <li>but I get some nice extra length</li>
            <li>it was worth trying.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the clumpy upclose stunning far away</li>
            <li>Believe it worth the $6 bucks.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the 20ish day</li>
            <li>Like I said, this is the tricky part just until you get used to it and find the right routine that works for you.  </li>
            <li>They wiped right off</li>
            <li>It does take some practice to get it right though.</li>
            <li>$6.00 lesson, going right in the garbage.  </li>
            <li>On my right, I used the system twice (gel-fibers-gel-fibers).  </li>
            <li>so I added mascara to the right eye</li>
            <li>The instruction are in Chinese, so do your own research first on Youtube before buying and applying on your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>These are as good as false eyelashes and so much easier and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Maybe, i am just not lucky enough to get the best leopard case.</li>
            <li>The only thing magic was how quickly my money disappeared.</li>
            <li>Pay a little more and get a lot more</li>
            <li>when it dried out it doesn&#x27;t spread out your lashes as good as the fresh new tube does, i couldn&#x27;t get mine last 3 months like most of my favorite mascara, but I love the fiber which instantly added volume and thickness to my lashes</li>
            <li>My eyelashes did not get very long,they were a bit longer than my own but not enough anyone noticed.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long and full lashes, but this made them MEGA HUGE!</li>
            <li>I have blond hair and blue eyes, therefore, I have very light eyelashes</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I ordered another set in the pink shiny tubes!</li>
            <li>Even though the fibers tend to flake off a little, the product does a good job staying on all day.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you seal the fibers really good with the gel and even apply a little mascara after, because if you don&#x27;t these tiny fibers will be all over the place.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Very thankful to have found them for an affordable price!</li>
            <li>Go with a higher end fiber lash.</li>
            <li>Glad the price was low.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied the fiber it does get all over the places when applying toward your lashes.</li>
            <li>If you need lash boosts for volume as well as length like I do, you will probably want to use your volumizing mascara first.  </li>
            <li>They are the real deal and worth the 2 week wait.</li>
            <li>If my directions were in english i would LOVE this product...</li>
            <li>I am almost sure you will feel the same .</li>
            <li>I was really amazed when I heard about this two step fiber mascara, I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it before!</li>
            <li>I first use a coat of an eye lash primer.  </li>
            <li>Separate the lashes with a tooth pick or something of that type if they are clumped together and they most likely will be.  </li>
            <li>Only used a couple times but when I did the fibres got into my eyes and didn&#x27;t make my eyelashes look any better.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this stuff to work!</li>
            <li>and it is better than regular drug store mascera</li>
            <li>This was my first mascara like this.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I was interested in getting the YOUnique fiber lashes, but wanted something cheaper...</li>
            <li>Back to my review, there are better Fiber mascara for the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Tried this product for a burlesque show and it didn&#x27;t make my sparse eyelashes any bigger or better than drugstore mascara.  </li>
            <li>I tried youtube and did exactly what it said but nothing at all but flakes everywhere.</li>
            <li>Watch a youtube video first on &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; and you should have no problems.</li>
            <li>For longer lashes after the first coat , re-apply your favorite mascara and repeat the process with the gel and fiber for a 2nd coat (repeat if needed).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does not effect your real lashes!</li>
            <li>Product is amazing and really does leave your eyelashes long and separated!  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to buy this product and the excitement did not last.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m utterly dumbfounded by how many positive reviews this product is getting.</li>
            <li>I too used the other popular brand listed here</li>
            <li>A YouTube tutorial is handy to make up for the foreign instructions.</li>
            <li>The instructions are written in chinese which was ok, you can pretty much figure it out yourself.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would use it everyday, but ladies for the price and for those occasions where you really want your lashes to stand out, it works good.</li>
            <li>but I must say my naturally long lashes has that much more added with the fibre mascara</li>
            <li>the mascara (they call it transfer gel but is pretty much just mascara) then swipe on the fibres.</li>
            <li>After u get the technique down, your eyelashes will look amazing.</li>
            <li>Came right off with my normal evening face cleaning.  </li>
            <li>My instructions were in English and as I had been using the younique brand for a while it was extremely easy.</li>
            <li>please please dont get any in your eye, pure torture</li>
            <li>you get glamor, movie star, perfect, LONG long long lashes with fibre?</li>
            <li>Anyway, i received this product a week ago and because of the packaging, i wasn&#x27;t too thrilled to try (little scared).</li>
            <li>I am super happy with this little set and would tell anyone who is curious about it to try it!</li>
            <li>Better than expected</li>
            <li>Absolutely makes lashes longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>keep closed until you get the top coat of gel on.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>So I have been reading online that this type of mascara really works...</li>
            <li>The mascara did seem like it would get goopy if you try to put to much on or</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product and believe it to be similar to the more expensive brands that go for around $30.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t personally tried those products, but only because I was happy enough with this one.  </li>
            <li>Well the gel does absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>this stuff really works thanks</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Have the tubes unscrewed and ready to go.</li>
            <li>Really can see a difference with this product..,</li>
            <li>Works very well for the price</li>
            <li>I was going to get the Younique brand but decided to try out something inexpensive to see if I would like the look of the fiber mascara before spending that much on mascara.</li>
            <li>For a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; day where I&#x27;m not wearing a whole face of makeup or don&#x27;t want to look too made-up for the situation, I just apply this once.</li>
            <li>This product really made them &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>but I expected more results than it producted.</li>
            <li>The gel was really smelly and it irritated my eyes so much</li>
            <li>It does add alot of length to your lashes but not too much volume.</li>
            <li>The thing I really didn&#x27;t like about it was that the fibers got into my eyes.</li>
            <li>It was priced much cheaper than anywhere else</li>
            <li>HAHAHA</li>
            <li>who knows what is it really.</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>Buy the real deal</li>
            <li>Movie star lashes in an instant for so cheap.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is good for at least 5 months in my opinion</li>
            <li>Need a few coats but really nice and NOT spidery like others.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to reapply so make sure you put it on right the first time.</li>
            <li>But does anyone eles have the same problem my gel tube drys out super fast...</li>
            <li>First you apply the transplanting gel, then apply the natural fibers, then reapply the transplanting gel.</li>
            <li>Transparent gel tube will get dry pretty quick,</li>
            <li>really wanted to make it work because I love the results I get with it but within an hour of application, you&#x27;ll start to see the little fibers on your undereye area.</li>
            <li>CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT IT NOW!</li>
            <li>I only had enough fiber for the top lashes and one application.</li>
            <li>This is something I LOVE about this stuff b/c I can use the same product to achieve totally different looks.</li>
            <li>What you will get is longER and thickER lashes but be realistic if you have stubby lashes.</li>
            <li>Only buy products that i personally tried and/or if my favorite store run out of stock.</li>
            <li>Not the soft fluffy magazine kind of look.</li>
            <li>Overall,  its the best thing since false eye lashes!</li>
            <li>I love the fact you can choose how long and how thick just by how many times you do the steps.  </li>
            <li>eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall is worth to have it for special day and not for everyday use</li>
            <li>It does not work like it says it should, and the fibers do fall off into your eyes, even if you use mascara over the top.... be careful!!!</li>
            <li>very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; as in, no difference to your natural lashes.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the tiny purchase price to try it out.</li>
            <li>found that after a few applications the mascara formula seemed more clumpy.</li>
            <li>Also, if you are having trouble with fibers falling onto your face, you may need to use more sealing gel and also use a hair dryer to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>All they said was it was normal</li>
            <li>This is okay - not a huge fan.</li>
            <li>Also a fiber piece must have gotten in my eye or something because my right eye is red and sore in the corner.</li>
            <li>This fibre mascara is fabulous and it doesn&#x27;t cost $29 like other companies.  </li>
            <li>Anytime I buy a new product though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for 2 weeks and have got the application down to a fine art.</li>
            <li>I wear contacts and have VERY sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>Finally I have long, full eyelashes!</li>
            <li>it does the Exact same thing.</li>
            <li>I would definately recommend this product if you are interested in making your eyelashes bigger.</li>
            <li>They do not stick well even when applied immediately after the first coat of mascara...nor the second coat...</li>
            <li>and really I could barely feel anything.  </li>
            <li>First off, yes the instructions are in Chinese.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Exactly the same as Younique mascara</li>
            <li>all natural and dont cause itching or burning !</li>
            <li>I apply my eyeliner and shadow first, but NOT my facial foundation.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to buy if price stays the same;)</li>
            <li>Completely WORKS!  </li>
            <li>Watching the numerous YouTube videos and tutorials were very helpful!</li>
            <li>This product did not come with English directions, but watching a youtube video made it pretty self-explanatory.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I did 2 coats of the large tube (the &amp;#34;mascara) and then put the fibers on, followed about 5 minutes later with another coat of the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little time consuming depending on how many coats you want to apply, but for the results I&#x27;ll take that extra time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is old</li>
            <li>cons: There is fallout fibers if you wear it for a extended period and the product can irritate if you have sensitive</li>
            <li>Does what it says it does, is very affordable, and had good/reasonable shipping time for an international item.</li>
            <li>did give me some pretty long lashes.</li>
            <li>-2 coats of fibers (Only to the ends of my lashes, NOT the whole</li>
            <li>and I really did not need the fiber to make my eyelashes to look bigger and longer because the transplanting gel itself is already making that happen.</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t notice a difference and the instructions were in a different language.</li>
            <li>I will try the real 3D mascara next to see if it was just this one.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this stuff.</li>
            <li>It makes the lashes no where near as spidery while achieving length.</li>
            <li>I use it frequently.</li>
            <li>and I finally had a chance to use the real stuff at a vendor event</li>
            <li>I am concerned that this is a Chinese knock off product and not the real thing.  </li>
            <li>The fiber doesn&#x27;t really stay after you put the second set of mascara...</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>Many people in reviews complained that this product flaked into the eyes.  </li>
            <li>The only 2 downfalls about this product is that 1: It is very time consuming; the longer you wan the lashes, the more time it takes to actually make</li>
            <li>It does extend very well, there is just some bittersweet things about the overall finish look.</li>
            <li>its not even noticeable a few coats of my regular mascara  would&#x27;ve better then this.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after trying &amp;#34;Better than false lashes&amp;#34;  which I really liked.  </li>
            <li>It nice looks like I have false eye lashes on</li>
            <li>the one on the right has some fiber on it and only has been used twice and the one on the left has been used maybe 6 times</li>
            <li>I mean, I love makeup</li>
            <li>but it works better actually than the more expensive stuff!</li>
            <li>Only thing is that the tubes seem to dry up relatively quick.</li>
            <li>There is only one fiber mascara out there that even comes close to this one, but with the other fiber mascara&#x27;s price Love Alpha, in my opinion, wins hands down!!</li>
            <li>I went out and forgot to wash my face before going to bed and woke up with still pretty long lashes!!  </li>
            <li>Also, when applying you may have some of the lash fibers that drop off of the brush onto your face, but I used a q-tip, got one side barely damp and left the other side dry and between the two, the fibers comeoff very easily without removing the rest of my make-up.  </li>
            <li>It gives the exact same effect and I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li>and although some of the fibers did get into my eyes a little, it was not painful</li>
            <li>This really does make your lashes really LONG and glamorous</li>
            <li>Instructions are not written in English, I just applied one coat of my normal mascara then the transplanting gel followed by the fibers.</li>
            <li>coat of the mascara from the Love alpha set which I then let dry for at least 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Another coat of my normal Mascara</li>
            <li>Really after the $10 I paid for this, and the $8 I paid for the Maybelline, I almost could have just bought the real deal Younique and not had to go to so much trouble.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to put at least one coat of your regular mascara on after you&#x27;re ALL done applying the fibre mascara :-)</li>
            <li>Works nearly as well as the expensive kind.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to get this one down right.</li>
            <li>I could barely see any on the wand and nothing was happening to my lashes!</li>
            <li>And these don&#x27;t destroy your own lashes like the super glued fake ones.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re in a real hurry, you&#x27;re VERY likely to mess this up and just look like straight clumps.  </li>
            <li>I suggest spending a little more money for piece of mind, it is not worth the risk.</li>
            <li>I did not care for the product because there were barely any fibers in the fiber container.</li>
            <li>I was hoping they would send out 2 new tubes of fiber with some actually in the tube but no such luck!!</li>
            <li>but the mascara doesnt dry fast enough and through out the day</li>
            <li>There was nothing in the &amp;#34;Fiber&amp;#34; tube and the other tube left my eyelashes VERY crusty!</li>
            <li>Much like the other reviews you don&#x27;t need to spend $60 on the brand name product</li>
            <li>It is just as good as the expensive fiber mascara!</li>
            <li>Makes your lashes noticeably longer/thicker, more so than regular mascara, but not quite like false lashes.</li>
            <li>It begins to be a little clumpy after even the first pass thru.</li>
            <li>I am a nursing student &amp; a mom to a lot of kids--I have long, busy days.</li>
            <li>The little fibers do seem to get EVERYWHERE on your face, the transplanting gel is kind of runny, so this is a little messy and will have to be cleaned up.</li>
            <li>The outcome didn&#x27;t look super fake but very long and pretty lashes came out of it.</li>
            <li>I bought this to try it out, because there were good and bad reviews...</li>

            <li> I was looking for a great mascara as an alternative and instead came upon the fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> and I am extremely happy I did.</li>
            <li> This product is great for the evening and day.</li>
            <li> I am definitely happy with it.</li>
            <li> but I had heard great things about these fiber fillers</li>
            <li> Which I thought was great.  </li>

            <li> I have not tried the others but I think this works great for a fraction of the price of others.</li>
            <li> But it is great and works just like they say.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to applying my eyelashes.</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I would recomend Love Alpha Fibre Mascara!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, love this!</li>
            <li> YOU WILL love this mascara/fiber lashes!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This is great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like the packaging it was really nice</li>
            <li> I really liked the product.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this mascara.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would.</li>
            <li> so I will use my own mascara brush or the transplanting gel to brush it through.</li>
            <li> Loving it.</li>
            <li> The case that comes with it is really nice to store your mascara</li>
            <li> So use to your own desecration/</li>
            <li> Great value, works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply</li>
            <li> Everything does wash off VERY easily with baby shampoo or eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I liked the way it made my lashes look, but had to stop using it because I kept getting the fibers in my eyes during the day.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> Not an every day mascara, but maybe  good for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, looks nice, worth the price for sure!</li>
            <li> Really glad I didn&#x27;t spend 32 on the younique now</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m still satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works OKAY in comparison</li>
            <li> lOVE</li>
            <li> Makes your eyelashes pop out more than mascara would do.</li>
            <li> Love this 3D will ALWAYS use this from now on.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara...</li>
            <li> Love this product..</li>
            <li> , the price is excellent compare to Younique which I tested and this product is the same thing .&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I totally love it...</li>
            <li> I love the way my eyelashes look after I apply the Love Alpha mascara on.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use the masaca after putting on the fibers</li>
            <li> Check your face to make sure you dont have fibers.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> All in all a good product that is worth the money.</li>
            <li> We both love the product.</li>
            <li> This is much better than Younique.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li> There are better mascaras out there</li>
            <li> The case is cute.</li>
            <li> Plus, if you have access to youtube there are many videos on how to correctly apply this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> They will get in your eyes if you use to many.</li>
            <li> If I can read all the way, the result may be even better.</li>
            <li> more precision is desirable.  </li>
            <li> Just ok.</li>
            <li> so I sought out a cheaper alternative and found this Love Alpha set for just $10.</li>
            <li> The Younique fibers are way more neat and they don&#x27;t fly around as much.</li>
            <li> As soon as I pulled out the Love Alpha brush the fibers were floating everywhere.</li>
            <li> I like i will buy more.....</li>
            <li> You may need to apply more fibers and keep repeating the steps if you want the glamorous \\&quot;going out\\</li>
            <li> This product helps more with the length than the volume.  </li>
            <li> , I make sure I have PLENTY of time to test and try it as like a \\&quot;trial</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Amazing mascara, fabulous price.</li>
            <li> and when you put the fibers on, you get more on your face than on your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> love it does what it says it does</li>
            <li> I LOVE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> THE CASE I NOW USE FOR MY READING GLASSES :)</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy more if I hadn&#x27;t bought 2.</li>
            <li> Its okay.</li>
            <li> I must say , this is better .</li>
            <li> I will for sure order it again.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Repeat the longer tube of Love Alpha and Fibre Mascara one more time.  </li>
            <li> Do not use the Love Alpha on your bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why so many people are bitching.</li>
            <li> While it works well, it does take more than one application.  </li>
            <li> I love the fibers though will definetly repurchase just for those</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this because I love it</li>
            <li> Want more, do it again.</li>
            <li> You have to put on the tranplant gel then the fibers, then the transplant gel, then the fibers, then more transplanting so on and so forth.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love my eyelashes now.  </li>
            <li> and i get so many compliments on how my eyelashes look.</li>
            <li> I love this product, i would buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> Will order again for sure.</li>
            <li> Read the online directions on how to put on and dont repeat so many times or you get clumpy lashes.</li>
            <li> Ordered more so that I wouldn&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li> May cost more money but it has collagen in it</li>
            <li> I tried covering with my mascara to seal it better but didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Glad for those it worked for, just not a product for me.</li>
            <li> but Younique 3D lashe mascera is 100x better.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> So I ordered the Love Alpha Magic fiber mascara.  </li>
            <li> it causes clumps and more chance to get them in your eye).</li>
            <li> The transplanting gel is okay</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok,</li>
            <li> I love the fiber lashes I tried them as soon as I got them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use PLENTY of the gel mascara to avoid shedding.</li>
            <li> I will pay the $30 for the REAL DEAL !!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product after reading reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am posting a picture so you can see the very clean wands</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t, but it works pretty good</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful on this product however the transplanting gel was nice but the tube of fiber was not!</li>
            <li> Then, put a good coat of the gel on my lashes first.</li>
            <li> I am SO excited about this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have bought in a long time!!</li>
            <li> In fact, this is my new favorite mascara!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other fiber mascaras, this is the best.</li>
            <li> This is a great fix for natural looking eye lashes..</li>
            <li> I will admit that the name brand Younique version of this product probably applies more smoothly</li>
            <li> :) enjoy</li>
            <li> The results are good and you don&#x27;t have to worry about thinning your real lashes.</li>
            <li> Good but very flaky.</li>
            <li> Then, any mascara you want (a cheap one is just fine), then the longer tube of the Love Alpha, then the Fibre Mascara.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> If they end up on your face during application, they blow off or brush off easy as dust.</li>
            <li> It lasts along time without flaking off and it easily washes off.</li>
            <li> Removal is easy with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> it  washes off easily but does not smear.  </li>
            <li> I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply, easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li> They advertise the product comes with a nice case, and mine came in a regular mail envelope, good for the price</li>
            <li> The transplanting gel smell strong and the fiber...</li>
            <li> Just as good as its high dollar competition.</li>
            <li> do a touch of my own mascara first, then the transplanting gel, then the fiber mascara.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I do; kind of like a recipe.  </li>
            <li> I am at an age where I have fine lashes and any help in defining them and making them look fuller and longer is welcomed.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I do LOVE this mascara, BUT, make sure you have some time to put it on at first b/c</li>
            <li> Love this product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It gave amazing results that a regular mascara doesn&#x27;t, and i&#x27;ve tried so many!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this for any girl who wants beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> Looks fabulous .</li>
            <li> It makes your eyelashes look longer and fabulous</li>
            <li> Works great if applied properly!</li>
            <li> amazing product that really does lengthen your lash.  </li>
            <li> Price fantastic too</li>
            <li> If there was a better way to seal the fibers then I could have given this more stars but not so much.</li>
            <li> I recently bought Love Alpha fiber mascara got it in the mail today and looked up a quick tutorial on YouTube and boom I have amazing lashes!</li>
            <li> This is an okay product..can&#x27;t beat the price however..takes time to get just right..</li>
            <li> But you really cant complain for the price you get what you pay for!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to apply--use the gel then use the fibers.</li>
            <li> (just make sure you watch a tutorial first).</li>
            <li> suggestion is to apply your eye-liner first and then apply your favorite mascara(s) and then apply the love Alpha Transparent gel first and then apply the Fiber and finishing it up with again the Transparent Gel to seal the fibers to your lashes.</li>
            <li> I recommend a VERY light coat of your own mascara before starting.  </li>
            <li> I received mine yesterday and put a coat on right away!</li>
            <li> the actual mascara is good tho  .</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t sold on what the product would do, so I wasn&#x27;t about to shell out top dollar until I knew this was a real thing.</li>
            <li> Ok the shipping was fast so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Ok, so this mascara is really inexpensive and that is a plus.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only thing I wish the products improve to make the fiber stick to your lashes good until you wash it off.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to love this product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I didn&#x27;t spend whole alot of money</li>
            <li> My sister loved it, second time purchasing!</li>
            <li> I figured for the price of the Love Alpha, if I didn&#x27;t like it, I wasn&#x27;t out much.</li>
            <li> and I still had enough mascara on my lashes that it looked good</li>
            <li> With this product, no damage to natural lashes and really nice after application.</li>
            <li> Love how my lashes look, very lengthy.</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly, packaged as shown.</li>
            <li> There are TONS of Youtube videos that will quickly show you how to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a more obvious, look at my eyes, I&#x27;m not a mom running errands look, I do more</li>
            <li> Its worth paying the extra pounds for a good, quality product.</li>
            <li> It works better than I thought it would, though I didn&#x27;t have high expectations to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took forever though...</li>
            <li> I have tiny eyelashes that you can barely see without mascara, so I have honestly tried them all!!</li>
            <li> This did not work for me at all the first time, but I tried it again and while it was a pain going over and over my eyelashes eventually it made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This mascara works great if your real careful putting on the fibers.</li>
            <li> and I am always trying to find good mascara to make them long and</li>
            <li> Honestly, you can get close to the same look with just good regular maskara.</li>
            <li> My instructions were also in Chinese, but knowing so many people that have used it, I was able to figure it out pretty well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first day using this and already got compliments on my eyelashes!</li>
            <li> If you just let it dry then lightly go over it again with the mascara, the fibers stay put nicely</li>
            <li> Therefore, if you are consider buying this product just buy the transplanting gel instead to make your eyelashes look more beautiful and dramatic.</li>
            <li> but I have to constantly checking myself image by looking at the mirror 3-4 time during the day to make sure that none of the fine fiber falls on my face or just right below my lower lashes.  </li>
            <li> Your lashes will look amazing if you use it properly.  </li>
            <li> this mascara worth the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly worried about the damage it does to my own eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The mascara with its natural fibers are neat to play around with, but it&#x27;s not as grand as others seem to make it out to be.</li>
            <li> It was worth it just to try it out.</li>
            <li> For the price it is a fun product to use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> Although it took a while to receive, it was worth the wait and price.</li>
            <li> but I get some nice extra length</li>
            <li> it was worth trying.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the clumpy upclose stunning far away</li>
            <li> Believe it worth the $6 bucks.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the 20ish day</li>
            <li> Like I said, this is the tricky part just until you get used to it and find the right routine that works for you.  </li>
            <li> They wiped right off</li>
            <li> It does take some practice to get it right though.</li>
            <li> $6.00 lesson, going right in the garbage.  </li>
            <li> On my right, I used the system twice (gel-fibers-gel-fibers).  </li>
            <li> so I added mascara to the right eye</li>
            <li> The instruction are in Chinese, so do your own research first on Youtube before buying and applying on your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> These are as good as false eyelashes and so much easier and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Maybe, i am just not lucky enough to get the best leopard case.</li>
            <li> The only thing magic was how quickly my money disappeared.</li>
            <li> Pay a little more and get a lot more</li>
            <li> when it dried out it doesn&#x27;t spread out your lashes as good as the fresh new tube does, i couldn&#x27;t get mine last 3 months like most of my favorite mascara, but I love the fiber which instantly added volume and thickness to my lashes</li>
            <li> My eyelashes did not get very long,they were a bit longer than my own but not enough anyone noticed.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long and full lashes, but this made them MEGA HUGE!</li>
            <li> I have blond hair and blue eyes, therefore, I have very light eyelashes</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I ordered another set in the pink shiny tubes!</li>
            <li> Even though the fibers tend to flake off a little, the product does a good job staying on all day.</li>
            <li> Make sure that you seal the fibers really good with the gel and even apply a little mascara after, because if you don&#x27;t these tiny fibers will be all over the place.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Very thankful to have found them for an affordable price!</li>
            <li> Go with a higher end fiber lash.</li>
            <li> Glad the price was low.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied the fiber it does get all over the places when applying toward your lashes.</li>
            <li> If you need lash boosts for volume as well as length like I do, you will probably want to use your volumizing mascara first.  </li>
            <li> They are the real deal and worth the 2 week wait.</li>
            <li> If my directions were in english i would LOVE this product...</li>
            <li> I am almost sure you will feel the same .</li>
            <li> I was really amazed when I heard about this two step fiber mascara, I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it before!</li>
            <li> I first use a coat of an eye lash primer.  </li>
            <li> Separate the lashes with a tooth pick or something of that type if they are clumped together and they most likely will be.  </li>
            <li> Only used a couple times but when I did the fibres got into my eyes and didn&#x27;t make my eyelashes look any better.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this stuff to work!</li>
            <li> and it is better than regular drug store mascera</li>
            <li> This was my first mascara like this.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I was interested in getting the YOUnique fiber lashes, but wanted something cheaper...</li>
            <li> Back to my review, there are better Fiber mascara for the price.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Tried this product for a burlesque show and it didn&#x27;t make my sparse eyelashes any bigger or better than drugstore mascara.  </li>
            <li> I tried youtube and did exactly what it said but nothing at all but flakes everywhere.</li>
            <li> Watch a youtube video first on &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; and you should have no problems.</li>
            <li> For longer lashes after the first coat , re-apply your favorite mascara and repeat the process with the gel and fiber for a 2nd coat (repeat if needed).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does not effect your real lashes!</li>
            <li> Product is amazing and really does leave your eyelashes long and separated!  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to buy this product and the excitement did not last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m utterly dumbfounded by how many positive reviews this product is getting.</li>
            <li> I too used the other popular brand listed here</li>
            <li> A YouTube tutorial is handy to make up for the foreign instructions.</li>
            <li> The instructions are written in chinese which was ok, you can pretty much figure it out yourself.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would use it everyday, but ladies for the price and for those occasions where you really want your lashes to stand out, it works good.</li>
            <li> but I must say my naturally long lashes has that much more added with the fibre mascara</li>
            <li> the mascara (they call it transfer gel but is pretty much just mascara) then swipe on the fibres.</li>
            <li> After u get the technique down, your eyelashes will look amazing.</li>
            <li> Came right off with my normal evening face cleaning.  </li>
            <li> My instructions were in English and as I had been using the younique brand for a while it was extremely easy.</li>
            <li> please please dont get any in your eye, pure torture</li>
            <li> you get glamor, movie star, perfect, LONG long long lashes with fibre?</li>
            <li> Anyway, i received this product a week ago and because of the packaging, i wasn&#x27;t too thrilled to try (little scared).</li>
            <li> I am super happy with this little set and would tell anyone who is curious about it to try it!</li>
            <li> Better than expected</li>
            <li> Absolutely makes lashes longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> keep closed until you get the top coat of gel on.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> So I have been reading online that this type of mascara really works...</li>
            <li> The mascara did seem like it would get goopy if you try to put to much on or</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product and believe it to be similar to the more expensive brands that go for around $30.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t personally tried those products, but only because I was happy enough with this one.  </li>
            <li> Well the gel does absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> this stuff really works thanks</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Have the tubes unscrewed and ready to go.</li>
            <li> Really can see a difference with this product..,</li>
            <li> Works very well for the price</li>
            <li> I was going to get the Younique brand but decided to try out something inexpensive to see if I would like the look of the fiber mascara before spending that much on mascara.</li>
            <li> For a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; day where I&#x27;m not wearing a whole face of makeup or don&#x27;t want to look too made-up for the situation, I just apply this once.</li>
            <li> This product really made them &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> but I expected more results than it producted.</li>
            <li> The gel was really smelly and it irritated my eyes so much</li>
            <li> It does add alot of length to your lashes but not too much volume.</li>
            <li> The thing I really didn&#x27;t like about it was that the fibers got into my eyes.</li>
            <li> It was priced much cheaper than anywhere else</li>
            <li> HAHAHA</li>
            <li> who knows what is it really.</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> Buy the real deal</li>
            <li> Movie star lashes in an instant for so cheap.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is good for at least 5 months in my opinion</li>
            <li> Need a few coats but really nice and NOT spidery like others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to reapply so make sure you put it on right the first time.</li>
            <li> But does anyone eles have the same problem my gel tube drys out super fast...</li>
            <li> First you apply the transplanting gel, then apply the natural fibers, then reapply the transplanting gel.</li>
            <li> Transparent gel tube will get dry pretty quick,</li>
            <li> really wanted to make it work because I love the results I get with it but within an hour of application, you&#x27;ll start to see the little fibers on your undereye area.</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT IT NOW!</li>
            <li> I only had enough fiber for the top lashes and one application.</li>
            <li> This is something I LOVE about this stuff b/c I can use the same product to achieve totally different looks.</li>
            <li> What you will get is longER and thickER lashes but be realistic if you have stubby lashes.</li>
            <li> Only buy products that i personally tried and/or if my favorite store run out of stock.</li>
            <li> Not the soft fluffy magazine kind of look.</li>
            <li> Overall,  its the best thing since false eye lashes!</li>
            <li> I love the fact you can choose how long and how thick just by how many times you do the steps.  </li>
            <li> eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall is worth to have it for special day and not for everyday use</li>
            <li> It does not work like it says it should, and the fibers do fall off into your eyes, even if you use mascara over the top.... be careful!!!</li>
            <li> very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; as in, no difference to your natural lashes.</li>
            <li> It was well worth the tiny purchase price to try it out.</li>
            <li> found that after a few applications the mascara formula seemed more clumpy.</li>
            <li> Also, if you are having trouble with fibers falling onto your face, you may need to use more sealing gel and also use a hair dryer to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> All they said was it was normal</li>
            <li> This is okay - not a huge fan.</li>
            <li> Also a fiber piece must have gotten in my eye or something because my right eye is red and sore in the corner.</li>
            <li> This fibre mascara is fabulous and it doesn&#x27;t cost $29 like other companies.  </li>
            <li> Anytime I buy a new product though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for 2 weeks and have got the application down to a fine art.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and have VERY sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li> Finally I have long, full eyelashes!</li>
            <li> it does the Exact same thing.</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend this product if you are interested in making your eyelashes bigger.</li>
            <li> They do not stick well even when applied immediately after the first coat of mascara...nor the second coat...</li>
            <li> and really I could barely feel anything.  </li>
            <li> First off, yes the instructions are in Chinese.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Exactly the same as Younique mascara</li>
            <li> all natural and dont cause itching or burning !</li>
            <li> I apply my eyeliner and shadow first, but NOT my facial foundation.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy if price stays the same;)</li>
            <li> Completely WORKS!  </li>
            <li> Watching the numerous YouTube videos and tutorials were very helpful!</li>
            <li> This product did not come with English directions, but watching a youtube video made it pretty self-explanatory.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I did 2 coats of the large tube (the &amp;#34;mascara) and then put the fibers on, followed about 5 minutes later with another coat of the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little time consuming depending on how many coats you want to apply, but for the results I&#x27;ll take that extra time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is old</li>
            <li> cons: There is fallout fibers if you wear it for a extended period and the product can irritate if you have sensitive</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does, is very affordable, and had good/reasonable shipping time for an international item.</li>
            <li> did give me some pretty long lashes.</li>
            <li> -2 coats of fibers (Only to the ends of my lashes, NOT the whole</li>
            <li> and I really did not need the fiber to make my eyelashes to look bigger and longer because the transplanting gel itself is already making that happen.</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t notice a difference and the instructions were in a different language.</li>
            <li> I will try the real 3D mascara next to see if it was just this one.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this stuff.</li>
            <li> It makes the lashes no where near as spidery while achieving length.</li>
            <li> I use it frequently.</li>
            <li> and I finally had a chance to use the real stuff at a vendor event</li>
            <li> I am concerned that this is a Chinese knock off product and not the real thing.  </li>
            <li> The fiber doesn&#x27;t really stay after you put the second set of mascara...</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> Many people in reviews complained that this product flaked into the eyes.  </li>
            <li> The only 2 downfalls about this product is that 1: It is very time consuming; the longer you wan the lashes, the more time it takes to actually make</li>
            <li> It does extend very well, there is just some bittersweet things about the overall finish look.</li>
            <li> its not even noticeable a few coats of my regular mascara  would&#x27;ve better then this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after trying &amp;#34;Better than false lashes&amp;#34;  which I really liked.  </li>
            <li> It nice looks like I have false eye lashes on</li>
            <li> the one on the right has some fiber on it and only has been used twice and the one on the left has been used maybe 6 times</li>
            <li> I mean, I love makeup</li>
            <li> but it works better actually than the more expensive stuff!</li>
            <li> Only thing is that the tubes seem to dry up relatively quick.</li>
            <li> There is only one fiber mascara out there that even comes close to this one, but with the other fiber mascara&#x27;s price Love Alpha, in my opinion, wins hands down!!</li>
            <li> I went out and forgot to wash my face before going to bed and woke up with still pretty long lashes!!  </li>
            <li> Also, when applying you may have some of the lash fibers that drop off of the brush onto your face, but I used a q-tip, got one side barely damp and left the other side dry and between the two, the fibers comeoff very easily without removing the rest of my make-up.  </li>
            <li> It gives the exact same effect and I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> and although some of the fibers did get into my eyes a little, it was not painful</li>
            <li> This really does make your lashes really LONG and glamorous</li>
            <li> Instructions are not written in English, I just applied one coat of my normal mascara then the transplanting gel followed by the fibers.</li>
            <li> coat of the mascara from the Love alpha set which I then let dry for at least 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Another coat of my normal Mascara</li>
            <li> Really after the $10 I paid for this, and the $8 I paid for the Maybelline, I almost could have just bought the real deal Younique and not had to go to so much trouble.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to put at least one coat of your regular mascara on after you&#x27;re ALL done applying the fibre mascara :-)</li>
            <li> Works nearly as well as the expensive kind.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get this one down right.</li>
            <li> I could barely see any on the wand and nothing was happening to my lashes!</li>
            <li> And these don&#x27;t destroy your own lashes like the super glued fake ones.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re in a real hurry, you&#x27;re VERY likely to mess this up and just look like straight clumps.  </li>
            <li> I suggest spending a little more money for piece of mind, it is not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> I did not care for the product because there were barely any fibers in the fiber container.</li>
            <li> I was hoping they would send out 2 new tubes of fiber with some actually in the tube but no such luck!!</li>
            <li> but the mascara doesnt dry fast enough and through out the day</li>
            <li> There was nothing in the &amp;#34;Fiber&amp;#34; tube and the other tube left my eyelashes VERY crusty!</li>
            <li> Much like the other reviews you don&#x27;t need to spend $60 on the brand name product</li>
            <li> It is just as good as the expensive fiber mascara!</li>
            <li> Makes your lashes noticeably longer/thicker, more so than regular mascara, but not quite like false lashes.</li>
            <li> It begins to be a little clumpy after even the first pass thru.</li>
            <li> I am a nursing student &amp; a mom to a lot of kids--I have long, busy days.</li>
            <li> The little fibers do seem to get EVERYWHERE on your face, the transplanting gel is kind of runny, so this is a little messy and will have to be cleaned up.</li>
            <li> The outcome didn&#x27;t look super fake but very long and pretty lashes came out of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try it out, because there were good and bad reviews...</li>
            <li> It works, it make my eyelashes really big, but it also make a lot mess, u can&#x27;t make up ur face because the mascara ruin it, and is really hard to clean it!</li>
            <li> Honestly, the product itself is not half as bad as I thought the only issue is the fiber mascara.</li>
            <li> lashes super long and thick</li>
            <li> The fibers in this product are large fairly loose fibers that end up everywhere other than on your lashes!  </li>
            <li> For true comparison, I used this system on eye (followed up with mascara) and my usual system on the other.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it may not be perfect, but, if you want long glamorous lashes without having to super-glue fake ones on you need THIS!!!  </li>
            <li> Plus, my eyes are too sensitive that is why I rather use the gel other than the fiber.</li>
            <li> I really like these and would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants longer lashes without making them look fake.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with the fibers falling as long as you put on enough gel the fibers should stick.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for women who eyelashes are a bit long because if your eyelashes aren&#x27;t than its not really a BIG difference</li>
            <li> I researched and found that a complaint with a lot of these type products (even high end) is that when you put the mascara brush back in the tube after applying the second coat to set your fibers, you are introducing fibers back into the mascara pot, which thickens up the mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The package arrived early, well padded in bubble wrap, followed by a complete seal of the case, followed by a decorative sealed band over a hard glasses-like case.  </li>
            <li> I used other similar; but more expensive products before and they all ended up in the trash.  </li>
            <li> this Love Alpha is cheap CRAP!!!!!</li>
            <li> Hate the fibers fly all into your eyes and stays for hours, i just spent my money on the 3d mascars.</li>
            <li> I have found no difference in these lashes to the other more expensive brand (except the price).</li>
            <li> You will have to apply it correctly in two steps, and then often sweep excess fibers from the undereye area, but that&#x27;s to be expected I would think for a product such as this.  </li>
            <li> Wait from china is long</li>
            <li> Works well but every time I use it, the fibers get into my eyes and irritates them making me look like I have pink eye for the next week.</li>
            <li> and the fibers are not natural</li>
            <li> Even after a long, sweaty day I don&#x27;t have any shedding of fibers onto my face.</li>
            <li> Took a really long time to receive, maybe a month.</li>
            <li> Let me just say, i need to be extra careful buying online.</li>
            <li> 2:with that, the longer extension of your lashes, it looks like spider legs not a natural look.</li>
            <li> The process to get the long lashes is cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> I could not get natural looking lashes and the fluffy stuff got everywhere on my face.</li>
            <li> If you want a lot of volume and long lashes you have to apply it over and over and OVER again</li>
            <li> First, do a base coat of your favorite black mascara.  </li>
            <li> I had some obvious fibers under my eyes, but it just looked like tiny black flecks, not like hairs all over the place</li>
            <li> It dose not work at all tried it with regular mascara on one eye and the fiber mascara on the other</li>
            <li> The end result, long luscious lashes!</li>
            <li> They touch my eyebrows, they&#x27;re so long!</li>
            <li> Takes a very long time to deliver.  </li>
            <li> Let dry a minute then apply the gel then the fibers and the gel again.</li>
            <li> It will give you AMAZING length, it will look like your wearing false lashes without it looking like your wearing false lashes, if that makes any since.</li>
            <li> But anyways, when i opened the package, i see the natural gel, when i open it only dusty hair like thing comes out, the gel was dry</li>
            <li> This product claims to use the same concept of elongating natural lashes with very small fibers.  </li>
            <li> Suuuuuper cool alternative to fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The fibers are loose but they stick to the brush somewhat like dust sticks to a Swiffer.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is you have to look down while appling it or fibers could get in your eyes.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t adhere to your lashes but just linger there like you just had a pillow fight and the down feathers are smaller and black.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only time that I got fibers on my face was after a massage where I was face down on the table.</li>
            <li> Only down side is that by the end of the day my eyes itch</li>
            <li> I could only followed half way through.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad, but Younique is much better.</li>
            <li> If you want thicker, longer, crazy huge lashes that won&#x27;t harm your lashes or lids...get this.</li>
            <li> It leaves fibers on your face, so be careful throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on the big name 3D fiber lashes!!</li>
            <li> Take your fibers brush and generously apply the fibers to the still wet transplanting</li>
            <li> roughly 20 days ( I am used to amazon prime 2 day shipping</li>
            <li> no what i expected..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do as much as I expected.</li>
            <li> There was not much difference between my two eyes</li>
            <li> My lashes actually felt softer after I applied....not firm and crusty like some mascaras do.  </li>
            <li> Careful putting it on though i got some fibers in my eyenand</li>
            <li> This takes a few tries to apply the proper way.  </li>
            <li> It does look comparable length and thickness to false lashes altough it doesnt show up very well in pictures.</li>
            <li> or I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it was possible with my little lashes!</li>
            <li> Pros: Makes my little lashes look fuller and long.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging and the mascara, but disappointed in results.</li>
            <li> If you have been wanting to try this product but cannot afford a brand name, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with Love Alpha.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when this one came in because I made sure I ordered the one that said the case came with it</li>
            <li> If you want lashes that reach past your brows, you will have to use falsies if you have short stubby lashes</li>
            <li> The instructions were in a foreign language, and I never got the case.</li>
            <li> It lasts longer on my lashes and yet is easier to take off than other products I have used.</li>
            <li> so if you want longer, the fibers will cling to each other to create a longer, thicker effect without looking like clumps or like you stuck hairy spider legs to your eyeballs.</li>
            <li> I put mascara on one eye and this on the other and saw no difference.</li>
            <li> other then that it does work.</li>
            <li> but other than the fact</li>
            <li> On the left, my usual products.  </li>
            <li> I did not use any other makeup products on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> did was let that dry a little but and then use a METAL (not plastic</li>
            <li> My eye burned for three days was red and irritated and also the fibers fell out throughout the day , my face looked like fibers and black mess even though I sealed and sealed it in with the gel !</li>
            <li> The case is nice, but the product itself smells terrible; the instructions are in Chinese, which is where it&#x27;s from.</li>
            <li> For lightly daily use, it will last approximately 2 months.  </li>
            <li> Then, while your mascara is still wet, put on the transplanting gel (which is black</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it is not worth anymore than I paid for it.</li>
            <li> The flakes come out of the tube in large clumps and are difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Yes, it will irritate your eyes a little bit just be careful using around your lashes.</li>
            <li> After you spent all the time concealing the area you now have BLACK mess all on it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the try.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the savings.</li>
            <li> Not worth the time flaky and gets all over your face.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> it will work 10x better than this crap</li>
            <li> Came slow and only lasted 3 uses</li>
            <li> run\\&quot; but once you get a routine down, there won&#x27;t be anything else to it.</li>
            <li> The mascara run down on your face.</li>
            <li> The letters on the shining black paper background are fading.</li>
            <li> leaves black smudges under your eyes.</li>
            <li> Although it can add length it would just drop black spots all day.  </li>
            <li> when I use it on my bottom lashes sometimes I get black under my eyes.</li>
            <li> the smell is a bit odd?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit odd smelling and it didn&#x27;t come with the box</li>
            <li> OMG they look like cotton fibers dyed in black (literally).</li>
            <li> I had this for a little over a week</li>
            <li> it may take a little practice.  </li>
            <li> At this point if I have some stubbies, I will apply a little mascara on just that spot, then fibres on just that</li>
            <li> At the end of the day it does flake off a little bit and sometimes gets in my eyes</li>
            <li> You will probably see a bunch of the little fibre pieces under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> When they did, I made my eyes water a little bit and blink them away.</li>
            <li> A little experimenting and experience, then</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t bother til today, and now i can totally say, I WASTED MY MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> but I found that it tends to be a bit messy.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when I put it on</li>
            <li> The fibers fall over your face and after an hour or so your eyelashes go limp.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste money on this.</li>
            <li> found this to be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> A few got in my eye while I was applying them and they did bother me.</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara a few times.  </li>
            <li> Gotta practice a few times.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t all dried out</li>
            <li> when I recived item it was dried (mascara)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted money on this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ugh, what a waste.</li>
            <li> It arrived a few days ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money as I did.</li>
            <li> Dried out and doesn&#x27;t work............</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to be extremely messy and flicking them off of the wand to purposely get fibers on your face.</li>
            <li> Definitely a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday</li>
            <li> That would be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money....</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear it after a few days.</li>
            <li> but the fiber is all dried out and</li>
            <li> I wear contact lenses and haven&#x27;t had any trouble with them flaking into my eyes.</li>
            <li> I use a heavy duty sealer to avoid this.</li>
            <li> It enhanced my very short lashes as promised and has even been a replacement for my false lashes, no one knows the difference.</li>
            <li> I am Filipina-Italian mix and my lashes are super short and thin :(.</li>
            <li> I got them for $5.90 a set &amp; they came with a tracking number &amp; came in within a week and a half!</li>
            <li> /&gt;BEWARE: This product can give you stiff neck--- stiff neck either from laughing or shaking your head!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and while I&#x27;ll admit, my lashes did look very long and dramatic</li>
            <li> do not have the shedding problem with the fibers when I do this routine, and I don&#x27;t have the clumps as bad since I am only using the fiber laden Love Alpha mascara to set the fibers and not as my base mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I  use this mascara when i feel lazy putting on falsie (I got to say tho.</li>
            <li> I have sold younique in the past , and I was sold on thier 3d mascara .</li>
            <li> First of all its nasty chemicals that I can smell when I open the tube of gunk !!!</li>
            <li> I usually stop there.  </li>
            <li> No glad I read the reviews and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I have very thin blonde sparse lashes</li>
            <li> That alone is not worth a poor review.</li>
            <li> And it hardly did anything for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I did not find that the fibers fell off  or were to hard to put on,</li>
            <li> It does make my lashes alot longer and fuller, but it is hard to work with.</li>
            <li> The transplanting gel has a bad smell to it (doesn&#x27;t smell after it dries), but the natural fibers do make your eyelashes look longer.</li>
            <li> No real negatives, it worked just as well as the expensive version, just not for me.</li>
            <li> It looks clumsy if I forget to check and brush it of my face.  </li>
            <li> The fibres do kinda fall around and in your eyes, on your face etc sometimes and that sucks.</li>
            <li> This does lengthen thicken the appearance of your lashes (if you&#x27;re into the clumpy thick look).</li>
            <li> , those are too thick)  </li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a new mascara, buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like having on false eyelashes but without the mess or bother!</li>
            <li> the transplanting gel is dried - your lashes are sealed and I can tell you THEY STAY!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other name brand fiber mascara&#x27;s but wanted to get something not so expensive.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> However.. I won&#x27;t waste my $6 bucks either!!</li>
            <li> but I can see what they mean.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes don&#x27;t get crazy long to my eye brows or anything</li>
            <li> Each application makes them longer, like seriously, longer.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing serious, I do suggest that you wash this mascara off before bed.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately that is not true at all.</li>
            <li> All the fibres got into my eyes making them red and watery and itchy and painful.</li>
            <li> It does work, but is messy and complicated to work with.</li>
            <li> There was hardly anything in it!</li>
            <li> (At least for me!)</li>
            <li> Duh!  </li>
            <li> I might have been confused.</li>
            <li> What you do get on your lashes are thin fibers on your lashes.</li>
            <li> I get tired before this mascara does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Still it can&#x27;t compare to the effect of false eyelashes)</li>
            <li> Id defiantly recommend this to women wanting a break from those false lashes.</li>
            <li> Nothing gives the look of false eyelashes but false eyelashes, so if that&#x27;s what you are going for, just buy them.</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> that dramatic look you want.</li>
            <li> Horrible if you have contacts or sensitive eyes!  </li>
            <li> The little fibers drop into my eye and irritate them badly.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It has actual like cotton fiber u put on and horrible directions..</li>
            <li> Eyelashes looked like fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this</li>
            <li> Wearing false eyelashes have become so dangerous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird material in the fiber tube...like putting dryer lint on your lashes.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t unfortunately.</li>
            <li> they shouldn&#x27;t sale this at all it a fake advertise</li>
            <li> No clumping, doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> I even forgot I ordered it and thought I had received the wrong thing when I saw the eye glass case.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I bought this mascara, and was a bit skeptical because some were saying the fibers flake off the brush.</li>
            <li> Although the transplanting gel does the job, the fiber is lame.</li>
            <li> and my eyelashes just popped... and its not as expensive</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I usually use a base coat (Loreal Cils) with mascara Maybelline Mega Plush Volume.  </li>
            <li> If you wear contacts, you know even an eyelash can feel like someone is stabbing you in the eye -</li>
            <li> I buy a ton of beauty products (well over $800+/year) and this was just disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was so unhappy with this...</li>
            <li> These babys shed like crazy if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The transplanting gel smelled so bad that I was afraid to use it on my eyes</li>
            <li> I hated having to apply false lashes.</li>
            <li> The instruction how to use is very difficult to read.  </li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen alot of comments about getting this in your eyes and how badly it would burn, etc.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed, but I decided to play around with it</li>
            <li> and it drove me crazy!</li>
            <li> However I was disappointed in the product.  </li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed in this :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No good waist of money horrible horrible</li>
            <li> I would hate to run out</li>
            <li> Do not swipe the fibre from the base up.</li>
            <li> I even  forgot i ordered this crap when by the time it came.</li>
            <li> Apply the fibers to the tips of my lashes (don&#x27;t try to apply the fibers to the base of your lashes..</li>
            <li> Bad quality and horrible ship</li>
            <li> WELL IT WAS BAD!</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve completed, use your transplanting gel again to seal them or they will shed like CRAZY!!</li>
            <li> I would I have been very disappointed.</li>
            <li> very disappointed on this product</li>
            <li> This mascara is awful!</li>
            <li> THEY ARE THE WORST.</li>
            <li> It flakes terribly and gets in your eyes and irritates them.</li>
            <li> And the worst part is that it doesn&#x27;t not make my lashes and longer.</li>
            <li> Horrible- don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> so it  was dreadful)</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> but i hated it !</li>
            <li> Awful mascara!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I thought this wasn&#x27;t gonna work because of the price but I was wrong. It works wonderfully and I don&#x27;t wanna switch mascara again!!</li>
            <li> It has actual like cotton fiber u put on and horrible directions.. the actual mascara is good tho  . Really glad I didn&#x27;t spend 32 on the younique now</li>
            <li> The product come from China, so it took about a month to get delivered. After that it somehow wound up at my sisters house a hour away because she had recently moved and put in a change of address even though it was addressed to me. I did not care for the product because there were barely any fibers in the fiber container. I think I got about 5 uses out of it and that&#x27;s it. I think I will splurge and get the $30 Younique version.</li>
            <li> Love this fiber masacara!! Ive used it for a week now and its incredible! PLUS I SAVED almost $25 compared to Younique&#x27;s 3D fiber mascara at $30!!!! ALSO it did not come with the case that is pictured</li>
            <li> It dose not work at all tried it with regular mascara on one eye and the fiber mascara on the other Will never but again</li>
            <li> Thought it came with the case. It didn&#x27;t, but it works pretty good so I&#x27;m still satisfied.</li>
            <li> Fibers fall on your face as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> OMG great stuff ordered from another company but the same product great amazing and CHEAP!!!!!!!!!!! had to order for all my breakfast buddies</li>
            <li> I i love you! &amp; Will order more! Better than expected</li>
            <li> This is an okay product..can&#x27;t beat the price however..takes time to get just right..lots of eyelash curling and combing.</li>
            <li> Another knock off of the younique 3-d mascara. Works OKAY in comparison but I won&#x27;t buy again. Pay a little more and get a lot more</li>
            <li> I like the packaging it was really nice no instructions so i looked them up takes time getting used to aplying 1st time used product fell in my eye</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Product is amazing and really does leave your eyelashes long and separated!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> No good waist of money horrible horrible</li>
            <li> I really liked the product.  Eyelashes looked like fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is awful! The fibers get into your eyes and all over your face. I don&#x27;t know if it is old or it does that to everyone that wears it.</li>
            <li> lOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT IT NOW!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product! Much like the other reviews you don&#x27;t need to spend $60 on the brand name product it does the Exact same thing. Makes your eyelashes pop out more than mascara would do. You can even use mascara then use this. Or you can just use these two wands by itself. Love this 3D will ALWAYS use this from now on. Just beware that the shipping is 3-4 weeks. This mascara is good for at least 5 months in my opinion</li>
            <li> Fiber or Fibre Mascara is a neat concept but I found that it tends to be a bit messy. If there was a better way to seal the fibers then I could have given this more stars but not so much. I followed the instructions and while I&#x27;ll admit, my lashes did look very long and dramatic, I ended up with fibers all in my eyes and on my face. The transplanting gel seems great as a base for applying the fibers but not for sealing them. There needs to be a third product for that.</li>
            <li> Suuuuuper cool alternative to fake eyelashes. I really like these and would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants longer lashes without making them look fake.</li>
            <li> This product is ineffective, go to the emergency room if you get this stuff in your eyes.  Item instructions were in chineese.</li>
            <li> No real negatives, it worked just as well as the expensive version, just not for me.</li>
            <li> All the fibres got into my eyes making them red and watery and itchy and painful. And it hardly did anything for my eyelashes. very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; as in, no difference to your natural lashes. Do yourself a favor and get an $8 maybelline mascara from walmart. it will work 10x better than this crap and you dont have to wait 2 weeks for shipping like I did. Also everything was in Chinese.</li>
            <li> some fiber got into my eyes, so I gave it away.</li>
            <li> I am SO excited about this product! I received mine yesterday and put a coat on right away! I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference! I had been wanting to buy the 3D lashes from another company and then I ran across these on amazon and knew I had to try them before forking out mega bucks! So glad I did!! Now I have all my friends wanting some and have directed them to Love Alpha Eyelashes! You will love them too!!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara...But does anyone eles have the same problem my gel tube drys out super fast...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this but I must say my naturally long lashes has that much more added with the fibre mascara</li>
            <li> Great product!  It was well worth the tiny purchase price to try it out. Absolutely makes lashes longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> I really liked this mascara. The only draw back was that the instructions are in Chinese with not English translations. But I did figure it out.</li>
            <li> it works, would be a five except it clumps up , not a even look, some lashes thicker and clumpy.</li>
            <li> Works great gives length and volume! Only thing is you have to look down while appling it or fibers could get in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Fiber ran out in about a week, and I don&#x27;t put mascara every day.</li>
            <li> Love this product.. I hated having to apply false lashes. THEY ARE THE WORST. This is a great fix for natural looking eye lashes.. I will order again</li>
            <li> I love this product! I see below everyone keeps saying it hurts if it gets in your eyes! Well close your eyes when you put it on then keep closed until you get the top coat of gel on. You just have to use your head! It&#x27;s great and I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Pros: Makes my little lashes look fuller and long. I have tried it w and w/o  mascara and it works the same!, the price is excellent compare to Younique which I tested and this product is the same thing .&lt;br /&gt;The cons: There is fallout fibers if you wear it for a extended period and the product can irritate if you have sensitive eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall is worth to have it for special day and not for everyday use (At least for me!) I  use this mascara when i feel lazy putting on falsie (I got to say tho. Still it can&#x27;t compare to the effect of false eyelashes)</li>
            <li> fibers thicken lashes well but don&#x27;t stick to ends to lengthen lashes.  Love the packaging and the mascara, but disappointed in results.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes did not get very long,they were a bit longer than my own but not enough anyone noticed. I only had enough fiber for the top lashes and one application. Personally doesn&#x27;t work for me.Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> this mascara worth the money and I totally love it...it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when I put it on and I definitely see the difference.</li>
            <li> Wearing false eyelashes have become so dangerous. I&#x27;m constantly worried about the damage it does to my own eyelashes. I was looking for a great mascara as an alternative and instead came upon the fiber lashes. What a great find! I love the way my eyelashes look after I apply the Love Alpha mascara on. I would definitely continue to purchase this product. I have been using it for over six months now on a daily bases, I now oreder two at a time because it takes a bit longer to ship to me. I would hate to run out so I always have extra on hand! I have had so many great compliments. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as it was cheaper than those sold by market level company. Works very well. Make sure to use the masaca after putting on the fibers</li>
            <li> This does lengthen thicken the appearance of your lashes (if you&#x27;re into the clumpy thick look). But it feels as though something, like dust, is constantly in your eyes, it&#x27;s nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle, but that shouldn&#x27;t happen. Also a fiber piece must have gotten in my eye or something because my right eye is red and sore in the corner.</li>
            <li> For a 1/4 of the price of a name brand, this product works great!  The direction are in chinese, however you can watch a tutorial on u tube on how to apply. Make sure that you seal the fibers really good with the gel and even apply a little mascara after, because if you don&#x27;t these tiny fibers will be all over the place. The end result, long luscious lashes! If you have been wanting to try this product but cannot afford a brand name, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with Love Alpha.</li>
            <li> I too used the other popular brand listed here and I don&#x27;t notice any difference at all. This product is 1/3 of the cost.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It is just as good as the expensive fiber mascara! I will never buy from anyone else. Very easy to apply (just make sure you watch a tutorial first).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird material in the fiber tube...like putting dryer lint on your lashes. It flakes terribly and gets in your eyes and irritates them.</li>
            <li> I was debating rather to buy this or the more expensive Younique mascara. This was shipped in one day, and it works great! It leaves fibers on your face, so be careful throughout the day. Check your face to make sure you dont have fibers. Otherwise, looks nice, worth the price for sure!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. One coat of gel and fiber lashes is all I needed. Looks fabulous . I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This works just as good as the $60 cherry blooms. I have both! The price is amazing for this product!</li>
            <li> I thought this would work but it didn&#x27;t unfortunately. The fibers fall over your face and after an hour or so your eyelashes go limp. Not worth the try.</li>
            <li> So I have been reading online that this type of mascara really works... sike its not even noticeable a few coats of my regular mascara  would&#x27;ve better then this. Plus the directions weren&#x27;t even in English. like how do expect me to know what to do!!! But you really cant complain for the price you get what you pay for!!!</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does, is very affordable, and had good/reasonable shipping time for an international item. Makes your lashes noticeably longer/thicker, more so than regular mascara, but not quite like false lashes. All in all a good product that is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased two sets at the recommendation of a Cosmetology instructor -- one for my daughter and one for me. We both love the product. It&#x27;s almost like having on false eyelashes but without the mess or bother!</li>
            <li> Decided id give this product a try and I am extremely happy I did. It enhanced my very short lashes as promised and has even been a replacement for my false lashes, no one knows the difference. I don&#x27;t have a problem with the fibers falling as long as you put on enough gel the fibers should stick. It also washes off easier than mascara. Id defiantly recommend this to women wanting a break from those false lashes. This product is great for the evening and day.</li>
            <li> This is much better than Younique.I would definately recommend this product if you are interested in making your eyelashes bigger.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product. The mascara with its natural fibers are neat to play around with, but it&#x27;s not as grand as others seem to make it out to be. The transplanting gel has a bad smell to it (doesn&#x27;t smell after it dries), but the natural fibers do make your eyelashes look longer. Even though the fibers tend to flake off a little, the product does a good job staying on all day. No reapplying necessary! It was worth it just to try it out.</li>
            <li> Kept getting in my eyes. Irritated my eyes. Not worth it. There are better mascaras out there don&#x27;t waste money on this.</li>
            <li> did not give me the look as advertised. just like regular mascara. found this to be a waste of money. would not recommend</li>
            <li> Yes, the directions are in Chinese but it&#x27;s a simple process.  Duh!  Put gel on lashes, then add fiber mascara, then I put gel on again to seal the fibers.  DONE.  You can also repeat for even thicker, longer lashes.  Great stuff, lasted for hours!  I removed it with Neutrogena makeup remover wipes.  Simple.</li>
            <li> This product does work!  I don&#x27;t know if I would use it everyday, but ladies for the price and for those occasions where you really want your lashes to stand out, it works good. I am at an age where I have fine lashes and any help in defining them and making them look fuller and longer is welcomed.  I did not find that the fibers fell off  or were to hard to put on, just follow the instructions that others have posted.  For the price it is a fun product to use. The case is cute.</li>
            <li> These were awesome just ordered another box. You curl your lashes. Apply a coat of regular mascara. Let dry a minute then apply the gel then the fibers and the gel again. And for a bigger look apply the gel and lashes again. I just apply the fibers to the end of my lashes on the outside corners to make them look bigger. But over all this product meets my expectations and I can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when this one came in because I made sure I ordered the one that said the case came with it and it didn&#x27;t come with mine. I&#x27;m still trying to get this one down right. It is a challenge trying to get the fibers on your lashes and not into your eye. I still haven&#x27;t mastered it yet but I will keep trying. I do have a problem with my eyes which is causing a problem with this type of mascara. It does make my lashes alot longer and fuller, but it is hard to work with.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would. I knew this was the &#x27;China cheaper one&#x27; but I wasn&#x27;t sold on what the product would do, so I wasn&#x27;t about to shell out top dollar until I knew this was a real thing. The item arrived quickly, packaged as shown. The directions were in Chinese but the steps are in easy-to-follow pictures. Plus, if you have access to youtube there are many videos on how to correctly apply this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;I do a touch of my own mascara first, then the transplanting gel, then the fiber mascara. Each application makes them longer, like seriously, longer. The fiber one clumps just a tiny bit so I will use my own mascara brush or the transplanting gel to brush it through. I will admit that the name brand Younique version of this product probably applies more smoothly but this product does get the job done when used correctly. I am definitely happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try it out, because there were good and bad reviews... WELL IT WAS BAD! It does not work like it says it should, and the fibers do fall off into your eyes, even if you use mascara over the top.... be careful!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t know about these till now! A YouTube tutorial is handy to make up for the foreign instructions.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I bought this from eBay and received it today. I loved it so much that I ordered another set in the pink shiny tubes! I got them for $5.90 a set &amp; they came with a tracking number &amp; came in within a week and a half! I have very thin blonde sparse lashes so being able to wear mascara without fake lashes glued on... Being able to say that these are MY lashes... Makes me feel happy. I will post photos of the before &amp; after.</li>
            <li> Ok the shipping was fast so that&#x27;s a plus. I had this for a little over a week and I love it. The directions come in Chinese but it&#x27;s easy to apply. First you apply the transplanting gel, then apply the natural fibers, then reapply the transplanting gel. Lashes appear longer can be used  with or without mascara. Go for it buy it.</li>
            <li> This mascara works great if your real careful putting on the fibers. They will get in your eyes if you use to many. Also the mascara will clump if you don&#x27;t use even strokes when applying. It&#x27;s hard to reapply so make sure you put it on right the first time. That&#x27;s why I gave it four stars.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my lashes.</li>
            <li> Instructions are not written in English, I just applied one coat of my normal mascara then the transplanting gel followed by the fibers. The outcome didn&#x27;t look super fake but very long and pretty lashes came out of it. I am super happy with this little set and would tell anyone who is curious about it to try it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It really works! Very impressed! Buy it, you will love your lashes!</li>
            <li> I am Filipina-Italian mix and my lashes are super short and thin :(. SO thankful I saw the youtube video or I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it was possible with my little lashes! Now I can actually see my lashes when I blink! LOL! :) Great product and fast shipping! Very thankful to have found them for an affordable price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. The instruction how to use is very difficult to read.  The letters on the shining black paper background are fading. I could only followed half way through. If I can read all the way, the result may be even better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after trying &amp;#34;Better than false lashes&amp;#34;  which I really liked.  This product claims to use the same concept of elongating natural lashes with very small fibers.  The fibers in this product are large fairly loose fibers that end up everywhere other than on your lashes!  They do not stick well even when applied immediately after the first coat of mascara...nor the second coat...when you take the brush out to apply the &amp;#34;micro&amp;#34; fibers, they are bushy and untamed.  When applying this around the eye area...more precision is desirable.  Will notpurchase again.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to buy this product and the excitement did not last. It came with no instructions. And the worst part is that it doesn&#x27;t not make my lashes and longer.</li>
            <li> Ok, so this mascara is really inexpensive and that is a plus. On the other hand, it is not worth anymore than I paid for it. The case is nice, but the product itself smells terrible; the instructions are in Chinese, which is where it&#x27;s from. and it flakes off on your skin. Not worth the savings. Go with a higher end fiber lash. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Just ok. Didn&#x27;t get the results as others are talking about. Going back to my loreal. Glad the price was low.</li>
            <li> This product leaves flakes of the fibers all over your face.. The flakes come out of the tube in large clumps and are difficult to apply. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a dupe of Younique 3d fiber lashes. I didn&#x27;t want to spend $30 on mascara but I had heard great things about these fiber fillers so I sought out a cheaper alternative and found this Love Alpha set for just $10. It took awhile to get to me but it was coming from Korea I believe so that was expected.&lt;br /&gt;So e instructions are in Chinese. I knew how to use the Younique product so I just used this the same way, but had I not I might have been confused. I did 2 coats of the large tube (the &amp;#34;mascara) and then put the fibers on, followed about 5 minutes later with another coat of the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did give me some pretty long lashes. The mascara did seem like it would get goopy if you try to put to much on or if you don&#x27;t work the brush properly. My big issue was with the fibers. They got everywhere! The Younique fibers are way more neat and they don&#x27;t fly around as much. As soon as I pulled out the Love Alpha brush the fibers were floating everywhere. A few got in my eye while I was applying them and they did bother me. Later that day when I checked my makeup I noticed several had flaked off and were under my eye and on my cheek. I was disappointed, but I decided to play around with it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that after a few applications the mascara formula seemed more clumpy. I researched and found that a complaint with a lot of these type products (even high end) is that when you put the mascara brush back in the tube after applying the second coat to set your fibers, you are introducing fibers back into the mascara pot, which thickens up the mascara.&lt;br /&gt; So I changed my routine to this:&lt;br /&gt;2 coats of Maybelline Falsies mascara (you can probably use any mascara you like)&lt;br /&gt;1-2 coats of fibers (Only to the ends of my lashes, NOT the whole lash)&lt;br /&gt;1 coat of the mascara from the Love alpha set which I then let dry for at least 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Another coat of my normal Mascara (Maybelline falsies in my case)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have the shedding problem with the fibers when I do this routine, and I don&#x27;t have the clumps as bad since I am only using the fiber laden Love Alpha mascara to set the fibers and not as my base mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I do like this stuff now that I found a way to make it stay put and not look clumpy, but I took off 2 stars because I have to do a lot of extra steps to get it this way, because it didn&#x27;t come with readable instructions, and because I still have to use another mascara with it to get it to work. Really after the $10 I paid for this, and the $8 I paid for the Maybelline, I almost could have just bought the real deal Younique and not had to go to so much trouble.</li>
            <li> Horrible- don&#x27;t buy. Simply don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product and believe it to be similar to the more expensive brands that go for around $30.  I haven&#x27;t personally tried those products, but only because I was happy enough with this one.  You will have to apply it correctly in two steps, and then often sweep excess fibers from the undereye area, but that&#x27;s to be expected I would think for a product such as this.  It&#x27;s a good value for the price imo!</li>
            <li> Good for the price I paid.  For lightly daily use, it will last approximately 2 months.  Transparent gel tube will get dry pretty quick, when it dried out it doesn&#x27;t spread out your lashes as good as the fresh new tube does, i couldn&#x27;t get mine last 3 months like most of my favorite mascara, but I love the fiber which instantly added volume and thickness to my lashes but I have to constantly checking myself image by looking at the mirror 3-4 time during the day to make sure that none of the fine fiber falls on my face or just right below my lower lashes.  It looks clumsy if I forget to check and brush it of my face.  That&#x27;s the only thing I wish the products improve to make the fiber stick to your lashes good until you wash it off.</li>
            <li> This is great and easy to use. I like i will buy more.....</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara a few times.  The little fibers drop into my eye and irritate them badly.</li>
            <li> Loving it. Gotta practice a few times. After u get the technique down, your eyelashes will look amazing.</li>
            <li> Worked as well as the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> It works, it make my eyelashes really big, but it also make a lot mess, u can&#x27;t make up ur face because the mascara ruin it, and is really hard to clean it!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have bought in a long time!! The price is amazing and my eye lashes have never looked better!! Don&#x27;t waste money on the big name 3D fiber lashes!! These are it!! I am hooked!! It&#x27;s amazing stuff !!</li>
            <li> Honestly, the product itself is not half as bad as I thought the only issue is the fiber mascara. The first time I applied the fiber it does get all over the places when applying toward your lashes. Yes, it will irritate your eyes a little bit just be careful using around your lashes. The instruction are in Chinese, so do your own research first on Youtube before buying and applying on your eyelashes. The case that comes with it is really nice to store your mascara and I really did not need the fiber to make my eyelashes to look bigger and longer because the transplanting gel itself is already making that happen. Plus, my eyes are too sensitive that is why I rather use the gel other than the fiber. Therefore, if you are consider buying this product just buy the transplanting gel instead to make your eyelashes look more beautiful and dramatic. I would buy this product again and would not get the fiber only the gel. Alohaz!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I do LOVE this mascara, BUT, make sure you have some time to put it on at first b/c it may take a little practice.  My instructions were also in Chinese, but knowing so many people that have used it, I was able to figure it out pretty well.  I recommend a VERY light coat of your own mascara before starting.  Then, while your mascara is still wet, put on the transplanting gel (which is black so it helps work with the mascara).  BEFORE ANYTHING DRIES, pull out your fibers brush.  Like I said, this is the tricky part just until you get used to it and find the right routine that works for you.  The fibers are loose but they stick to the brush somewhat like dust sticks to a Swiffer.  Take your fibers brush and generously apply the fibers to the still wet transplanting gel - TAKE YOUR TIME!!!  Once you&#x27;ve completed, use your transplanting gel again to seal them or they will shed like CRAZY!! Keep repeating these steps until you have your desired look.  You may need to apply more fibers and keep repeating the steps if you want the glamorous \\&quot;going out\\&quot; look, whereas you may only need one coat for things like going to work.  This is something I LOVE about this stuff b/c I can use the same product to achieve totally different looks. I&#x27;ve seen alot of comments about getting this in your eyes and how badly it would burn, etc.  I wear contacts and have VERY sensitive eyes and although some of the fibers did get into my eyes a little, it was not painful and really I could barely feel anything.  If you wear contacts, you know even an eyelash can feel like someone is stabbing you in the eye - this was NOT the case with these \\&quot;lash\\&quot; fibers.  This really does make your lashes really LONG and glamorous but if you don&#x27;t take your time, it can come out clumpy.  Also, when applying you may have some of the lash fibers that drop off of the brush onto your face, but I used a q-tip, got one side barely damp and left the other side dry and between the two, the fibers comeoff very easily without removing the rest of my make-up.  If you need lash boosts for volume as well as length like I do, you will probably want to use your volumizing mascara first.  This product helps more with the length than the volume.  Once you&#x27;re done however and the transplanting gel is dried - your lashes are sealed and I can tell you THEY STAY!!  I went out and forgot to wash my face before going to bed and woke up with still pretty long lashes!!  Everything does wash off VERY easily with baby shampoo or eye makeup remover.  All in all, it may not be perfect, but, if you want long glamorous lashes without having to super-glue fake ones on you need THIS!!!  And these don&#x27;t destroy your own lashes like the super glued fake ones.  The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is b/c if you&#x27;re in a real hurry, you&#x27;re VERY likely to mess this up and just look like straight clumps.  Anytime I buy a new product though, I make sure I have PLENTY of time to test and try it as like a \\&quot;trial run\\&quot; but once you get a routine down, there won&#x27;t be anything else to it.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to love this product. It makes your eyelashes look longer and fabulous but the mascara doesnt dry fast enough and through out the day leaves black smudges under your eyes. I had to keep checking my face every so often to wipe it and then had to reapply my concealer.</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t notice a difference and the instructions were in a different language.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!!! Finally I have long, full eyelashes!</li>
            <li> it did not work like advertised.</li>
            <li> I waited month or so to receive product and when I got it didn&#x27;t meet my expectation.. I am so glad I didn&#x27;t spend whole alot of money I would I have been very disappointed. I used it 1 time and never used it again..</li>
            <li> First off, yes the instructions are in Chinese. That alone is not worth a poor review. There are TONS of Youtube videos that will quickly show you how to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply the mascara (they call it transfer gel but is pretty much just mascara) then swipe on the fibres. They will look like spider webs but that will even out when you put on the second coat of mascara. So put on the second coat and another swipe of fibre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now what *I* did was let that dry a little but and then use a METAL (not plastic, those are too thick)  lash comb to even out the fibres and straighten them out. At this point if I have some stubbies, I will apply a little mascara on just that spot, then fibres on just that spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you get glamor, movie star, perfect, LONG long long lashes with fibre? NO. What you will get is longER and thickER lashes but be realistic if you have stubby lashes. Can&#x27;t put something that isn&#x27;t there. If you want lashes that reach past your brows, you will have to use falsies if you have short stubby lashes naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last bit of advice. Do not swipe the fibre from the base up. The fibres do kinda fall around and in your eyes, on your face etc sometimes and that sucks. So go from mid lash up or just use on tips. If they end up on your face during application, they blow off or brush off easy as dust.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. Beautiful results easy to use. Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I seen reviews on this mascara before buying it. It gave amazing results that a regular mascara doesn&#x27;t, and i&#x27;ve tried so many! If you have short eyelashes then this mascara is for you! It will give you AMAZING length, it will look like your wearing false lashes without it looking like your wearing false lashes, if that makes any since. It also washes off with ease.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This is incredible.  I have blond hair and blue eyes, therefore, I have very light eyelashes and I am always trying to find good mascara to make them long and dark.&lt;br /&gt; Before, I ordered this, I was using &amp;#34;they&#x27;re Real&amp;#34;.  Which I thought was great.  Well &amp;#34;they&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; has nothing on this one. I love the fact you can choose how long and how thick just by how many times you do the steps.  Plus, removing this product is so simple.  I use regular makeup pads and have no problems.&lt;br /&gt;Oh yea, and this is like$10.00 to $20.00 cheaper than &amp;#34;they&amp;#34;re Real&amp;#34;!  You cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it was horrible😢</li>
            <li> I love it. Just as good as its high dollar competition.</li>
            <li> Amazing mascara, fabulous price. Works better than drugstore mascara, just YouTube how to apply it and its amazing! I ordered 2 more sets! Wait from china is long but it&#x27;s worth it and it wasn&#x27;t all dried out it was perfect, and the case is adorable</li>
            <li> Okay I give two stars because I am upset the fiber mascara came broken! I was looking forward to trying that one specifically compared to the transplanting gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for 2 weeks and have got the application down to a fine art. My instructions were in English and as I had been using the younique brand for a while it was extremely easy. I have found no difference in these lashes to the other more expensive brand (except the price). A excellent product!.</li>
            <li> Horrible if you have contacts or sensitive eyes!  I have used this several times properly and it still flakes off. I will try the real 3D mascara next to see if it was just this one.</li>
            <li> Revived my item&lt;br /&gt;3 months later shipping took awhile&lt;br /&gt;And when I recived item it was dried (mascara)</li>
            <li> My sister loved it, second time purchasing!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for some god lash extender but the fibers constantly fall in your eyes</li>
            <li> I have the Younique brand as well, and since it is $30, I tried this one. It isn&#x27;t bad, but Younique is much better. The wand with the fibers is not as good and can leave clumps of fiber. I still use this one occassionaly on &amp;#34;grundge&amp;#34; days that I don&#x27;t have to look as all together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m utterly dumbfounded by how many positive reviews this product is getting. I can&#x27;t believe I wasted money on this. I buy a ton of beauty products (well over $800+/year) and this was just disappointing. You&#x27;re suppose to put on a coat of gel and then a coat of fiber. Well the gel does absolutely nothing and when you put the fibers on, you get more on your face than on your eyelashes. What you do get on your lashes are thin fibers on your lashes. They don&#x27;t adhere to your lashes but just linger there like you just had a pillow fight and the down feathers are smaller and black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ugh, what a waste.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as Younique mascara</li>
            <li> love it does what it says it does</li>
            <li> The instructions were in a foreign language, and I never got the case. I am supposed to buy separately? I guess I got what I paid...</li>
            <li> I LOVE PRODUCT JUST WISHED IT LASTED LONGER THE MASCARA ALONE IS GREAT AND THE CASE I NOW USE FOR MY READING GLASSES :)</li>
            <li> Works well but every time I use it, the fibers get into my eyes and irritates them making me look like I have pink eye for the next week.</li>
            <li> Good product- no need to spend $50 bucks</li>
            <li> Love them. They are the real deal and worth the 2 week wait.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other name brand fiber mascara&#x27;s but wanted to get something not so expensive. I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this stuff. It lasts longer on my lashes and yet is easier to take off than other products I have used. It gives the exact same effect and I will definitely be ordering again. The only downside is that it does take 6 weeks to get to you, but I was expecting that, so just be prepared. Also, if you are having trouble with fibers falling onto your face, you may need to use more sealing gel and also use a hair dryer to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; your lashes. There are plenty of YouTube videos showing how to do this.</li>
            <li> Took like a month to get to me, it does work and ladies the trick to not having fibers fall into your lashes is to only put it on the tip of your lashes. I would recommend for women who eyelashes are a bit long because if your eyelashes aren&#x27;t than its not really a BIG difference</li>
            <li> If my directions were in english i would LOVE this product... however they are clearly in chinese! :)  It took forever to get to me... roughly 20 days ( I am used to amazon prime 2 day shipping so it  was dreadful) I found a youtube video on  how to apply it. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product... It is so much better then having to put on fake eyelashes. It last all day.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It lasts along time without flaking off and it easily washes off. It arrived a few days ahead of schedule. The product comes from China but didn&#x27;t come with instructions in English. I still give it 5 stars. I&#x27;d buy more if I hadn&#x27;t bought 2. I will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. Although it took a while to receive, it was worth the wait and price.</li>
            <li> Its okay. Did not meet my expectations and I only used it once...dont buy</li>
            <li> this stuff really works thanks</li>
            <li> I have sold younique in the past , and I was sold on thier 3d mascara . I must say , this is better . Both price and formula . It makes the lashes no where near as spidery while achieving length. I will definitely continue using . If your up in the air , try it . I am almost sure you will feel the same .</li>
            <li> Works great if applied properly!</li>
            <li> I was really amazed when I heard about this two step fiber mascara, I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it before! It&#x27;s a little time consuming depending on how many coats you want to apply, but for the results I&#x27;ll take that extra time. My eyelashes don&#x27;t get crazy long to my eye brows or anything but I get some nice extra length and I really like it. At the end of the day it does flake off a little bit and sometimes gets in my eyes but it&#x27;s nothing serious, I do suggest that you wash this mascara off before bed.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  Read the reviews and thought for the price it was worth trying.  Instructions are not in English so I just went to youtube and looked up a video on how it works.  Apply your regular mascara then apply a coat of the gel then a coat of fibers and then a coat of the the gel again. The last coat of gel keeps the fibers from falling into your eyes.  If you apply it correctly you shouldn&#x27;t have any issues.  Wore it all afternoon and had no problems.  Came right off with my normal evening face cleaning.  I will for sure order it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff don&#x27;t work at all I was so unhappy with this... they shouldn&#x27;t sale this at all it a fake advertise</li>
            <li> Bought this to see if it compaed to Younique 3D Fiber Lash Mascara , IT DOES NOT COMPARE AT ALL !!!! First of all its nasty chemicals that I can smell when I open the tube of gunk !!! It applys goopy not even and the fibers are not natural and so when one dropped into my eye I thought it was on fire !!!!! My eye burned for three days was red and irritated and also the fibers fell out throughout the day , my face looked like fibers and black mess even though I sealed and sealed it in with the gel ! I got this for $5 and I would NEVER even use it again let alone buy it !!!! I will pay the $30 for the REAL DEAL !!!! I got Younique Fiber Lashes and they are AMAZING!!!!!!! all natural and dont cause itching or burning ! its amazing the difference ! the fact is YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR and this Love Alpha is cheap CRAP!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not worth the time flaky and gets all over your face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best thing I don&#x27;t know why I hadn&#x27;t found this sooner .makes lashes super long and thick</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I love it.  Your lashes will look amazing if you use it properly.  This is exactly what I do; kind of like a recipe.  I apply my eyeliner and shadow first, but NOT my facial foundation.  I first use a coat of an eye lash primer.  I like the Lancomb CLS.  Then, any mascara you want (a cheap one is just fine), then the longer tube of the Love Alpha, then the Fibre Mascara.  Separate the lashes with a tooth pick or something of that type if they are clumped together and they most likely will be.  Repeat the longer tube of Love Alpha and Fibre Mascara one more time.  Finish off with a regular mascara and separate again if necessary.  Now, go do some stuff around the house or whatever.  Come back and look in the mirror.  You will probably see a bunch of the little fibre pieces under your eyes.  Remove them with water on a Q-Tip or a non oily eye make up remover.  Then, use your under eye concealer if you wear one and the lash primer and mascara on your bottom lashes.  Do not use the Love Alpha on your bottom lashes.  Do all these steps as quickly as possible.  Have the tubes unscrewed and ready to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first day using this and already got compliments on my eyelashes! They are longer and fuller! But beware, fibers will get in your eyes when applying! When they did, I made my eyes water a little bit and blink them away. Hopefully that wont degrade my eye health. I do not recommend wearing contacts when applying. Overall,  its the best thing since false eye lashes!</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome product proven to work.</li>
            <li> Awful. Did not yield the results as claimed. Please don&#x27;t waste your money as I did. The only thing magic was how quickly my money disappeared.</li>
            <li> I even  forgot i ordered this crap when by the time it came. But anyways, when i opened the package, i see the natural gel, when i open it only dusty hair like thing comes out, the gel was dry and i thought it was the mascara wand that was like that, but its the mascara gel</li>
            <li> For the price you&#x27;re paying this stuff is good! Don&#x27;t know why so many people are bitching. You&#x27;re gonna get what you payed for, not some miracle million dollar product!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works better than I thought it would, though I didn&#x27;t have high expectations to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took forever though...in fact, by the time I received the product it was quite a surprise, because I&#x27;d forgotten that I ordered it!&lt;br /&gt;I will order again though, with plenty of time for shipping.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful, but it took a lot of time to reach me&lt;br /&gt;حلوه مره لكني حصلتها في طيبه في كل مكان</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that fibers fall off my flashes onto my face.</li>
            <li> While it works well, it does take more than one application.  If you are not in a hurry, then you can have great results.</li>
            <li> Dried out and doesn&#x27;t work............what a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Really can see a difference with this product..,</li>
            <li> Works very well for the price I was  really impressed. I would have given it 5 stars but the fibers fall off on to your face so you do have to wipe them off.</li>
            <li> The transplanting gel smelled so bad that I was afraid to use it on my eyes so I threw it away and layered the fibers between mascara. I love the fibers though will definetly repurchase just for those</li>
            <li> I was going to get the Younique brand but decided to try out something inexpensive to see if I would like the look of the fiber mascara before spending that much on mascara. I mean, I love makeup but that&#x27;s a lot of money to spend on something before you try it. I figured for the price of the Love Alpha, if I didn&#x27;t like it, I wasn&#x27;t out much. I am so glad I bought this because I love it,I saved a lot over the name brand, and I will definitely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about fibers shedding throughout the day. I am a nursing student &amp; a mom to a lot of kids--I have long, busy days. There are days that I have this mascara on for 16 hours. Even after a long, sweaty day I don&#x27;t have any shedding of fibers onto my face. I get tired before this mascara does.&lt;br /&gt;I had read some reviewers say that they get fibers all over their face when putting it on. I haven&#x27;t had that problem at all and I don&#x27;t know how someone unintentionally could. You&#x27;d have to be extremely messy and flicking them off of the wand to purposely get fibers on your face. I&#x27;ve also read that people had the fibers all over their sink/counter while putting them on. Again, only if you&#x27;re doing it on purpose. The fibers don&#x27;t get all over at all.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are not in English, but you don&#x27;t need them. It&#x27;s super easy to apply--use the gel then use the fibers. Want more, do it again. And again if you want to. It&#x27;s a buildable look so if you want longer, the fibers will cling to each other to create a longer, thicker effect without looking like clumps or like you stuck hairy spider legs to your eyeballs. For a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; day where I&#x27;m not wearing a whole face of makeup or don&#x27;t want to look too made-up for the situation, I just apply this once. For a more obvious, look at my eyes, I&#x27;m not a mom running errands look, I do more layers.&lt;br /&gt;I have worn it all day every day for the last 2 weeks. The only time that I got fibers on my face was after a massage where I was face down on the table. I had some obvious fibers under my eyes, but it just looked like tiny black flecks, not like hairs all over the place like I had assumed it would look if it shed. They wiped right off and I still had enough mascara on my lashes that it looked good and I didn&#x27;t need to reapply. Otherwise, I go all day without any flaking or fiber shedding. It looks amazing! No clumping, doesn&#x27;t look fake. Removal is easy with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I would not buy again. Only used a couple times but when I did the fibres got into my eyes and didn&#x27;t make my eyelashes look any better. I followed the directions and all. Very uncomfortable. Definitely a waste of money.</li>
            <li> amazing product that really does lengthen your lash.  it  washes off easily but does not smear.  Also it is not waterproof but it is water resistant.  The price is so very low.  I&#x27;m buying for my friends too/</li>
            <li> There was nothing in the &amp;#34;Fiber&amp;#34; tube and the other tube left my eyelashes VERY crusty!</li>
            <li> Good item for the price.</li>
            <li> The instructions are written in chinese which was ok, you can pretty much figure it out yourself. Although it just seemed to me like putting on mascara.  I put mascara on one eye and this on the other and saw no difference.</li>
            <li> instructions are in chinese and u have to apply it over and over to get that stand out affect.  please please dont get any in your eye, pure torture</li>
            <li> This did not work for me at all the first time, but I tried it again and while it was a pain going over and over my eyelashes eventually it made a huge difference. You have to put on the tranplant gel then the fibers, then the transplant gel, then the fibers, then more transplanting so on and so forth. It begins to be a little clumpy after even the first pass thru. I don&#x27;t mind the clumpy upclose stunning far away look so this didn&#x27;t bother me. It does look comparable length and thickness to false lashes altough it doesnt show up very well in pictures. The little fibers do seem to get EVERYWHERE on your face, the transplanting gel is kind of runny, so this is a little messy and will have to be cleaned up. other then that it does work.</li>
            <li> makes your lashes longer but i hated it ! i could only accomplish length not volume 😢</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am on my second order.  I now have eyelashes!!!!</li>
            <li> Love my eyelashes now.  This product really made them &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and i get so many compliments on how my eyelashes look. They touch my eyebrows, they&#x27;re so long! I love this product, i would buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I did not buy the $45 one. That would be a waste of money. It nice looks like I have false eye lashes on will try it on my mom her lashes are sparse. Believe it worth the $6 bucks. Get it I should have taken a picture</li>
            <li> Takes a very long time to deliver.  No english language instructions inclosed.  Product seems to be O.K. but I expected more results than it producted.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Great price. Will order again for sure.</li>
            <li> I would re-purchase.  Good value for the cost</li>
            <li> I have not tried the others but I think this works great for a fraction of the price of others. Took a really long time to receive, maybe a month. I even forgot I ordered it and thought I had received the wrong thing when I saw the eye glass case. I use it frequently. Read the online directions on how to put on and dont repeat so many times or you get clumpy lashes.</li>
            <li> Love this product and quick delivery. I will continue to buy if price stays the same;)</li>
            <li> Works nearly as well as the expensive kind.  Ordered more so that I wouldn&#x27;t run out.  Can&#x27;t beat the product for the price.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful on this product however the transplanting gel was nice but the tube of fiber was not! There was hardly anything in it! I could barely see any on the wand and nothing was happening to my lashes! I am posting a picture so you can see the very clean wands the one on the right has some fiber on it and only has been used twice and the one on the left has been used maybe 6 times and I finally had a chance to use the real stuff at a vendor event and it was A LOT different.. tons of fiber on the wand and you could tell a big difference when I put it on unlike this one. I will not spend $30+dollars for mascara! However.. I won&#x27;t waste my $6 bucks either!! wheres the beef? Or fiber in this case???? Don&#x27;t waste your money.... It is like buying a loaf of bread and getting it home to make a sandwich only to find there is only one slice of bread in the bag! I was hoping they would send out 2 new tubes of fiber with some actually in the tube but no such luck!! All they said was it was normal this is why they only received one star from me AND my daughter!</li>
            <li> This made my eyelashes start to fall out. I will only use 3D fiber mascara from younique. May cost more money but it has collagen in it and I truly believe my eyelashes grow out!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara!  It makes my eyelashes fuller and longer!  It doesn&#x27;t flake.  I have some to a girlfriend and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> Although it can add length it would just drop black spots all day.  I tried covering with my mascara to seal it better but didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Tried it as soon as I got it and I love it! Didn&#x27;t have problems with fibers falling onto my cheek throughout day.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!love it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have the younique brand so can&#x27;t compare. Like this one though. Only down side is that by the end of the day my eyes itch and it feels like the lashes are flaking a bit. Otherwise very effective!</li>
            <li> Awful mascara! The gel was really smelly and it irritated my eyes so much I couldn&#x27;t wear it after a few days. Its worth paying the extra pounds for a good, quality product.</li>
            <li> Bad quality and horrible ship</li>
            <li> I really wanted this stuff to work! It does add alot of length to your lashes but not too much volume. The thing I really didn&#x27;t like about it was that the fibers got into my eyes. The day I tried it I felt like I had stuff in my eyes all day and it drove me crazy! One reason I ordered this was because I read that it DIDN&#x27;T bother your eyes but unfortunately that is not true at all. I love the packaging but I don&#x27;t think I will use this again.</li>
            <li> I love this. I use it only on my upper lashes, when I use it on my bottom lashes sometimes I get black under my eyes. But it is great and works just like they say.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product after reading reviews.  However I was disappointed in the product.  I have extremely short lashes and did not find that this product work to lengthen them even with multiple applications.  It did make them thicker, but then they just looked clumpy.  Glad for those it worked for, just not a product for me. Given the inexpensive price, not a big loss.</li>
            <li> It does the job and it is better than regular drug store mascera but Younique 3D lashe mascera is 100x better.  This would be a good mascera to wear during the day</li>
            <li> no what i expected..but if you re-apply over and over maybe 4 times you might see a difference .</li>
            <li> Came slow and only lasted 3 uses</li>
            <li> love this product, best alternative out there. the smell is a bit odd? (smells like metal ?) but other than the fact it&#x27;s a bit odd smelling and it didn&#x27;t come with the box I&#x27;m happy with it , will but again!</li>
            <li> They advertise the product comes with a nice case, and mine came in a regular mail envelope, good for the price</li>
            <li> This was my first mascara like this.  It works pretty well.  It does take some practice to get it right though.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look amazing with this! If you just let it dry then lightly go over it again with the mascara, the fibers stay put nicely</li>
            <li> Completely WORKS!  I cannot go on enough about how terrific this system makes your eyelashes look...for a fraction of the price.  Totally worth the 20ish day wait!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff it actually works,</li>
            <li> stuff gets all over your face when you use it</li>
            <li> GREAT mascara! This takes a few tries to apply the proper way.  Watching the numerous YouTube videos and tutorials were very helpful!</li>
            <li> Fibers ran out after a couple of uses. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It was priced much cheaper than anywhere else and everything is in Chinese.  I am concerned that this is a Chinese knock off product and not the real thing.  I won&#x27;t take a chance on damaging my eyes with whatever ingredients are in there.  $6.00 lesson, going right in the garbage.  I suggest spending a little more money for piece of mind, it is not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> Better than the younique!!! Love it</li>
            <li> MEGA LASHES IN MOMENTS! THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I was interested in getting the YOUnique fiber lashes, but wanted something cheaper... So I ordered the Love Alpha Magic fiber mascara.  I knew this was a &amp;#34;china cheapie&amp;#34; when I bought it.  The directions are in chinese.  You can look on You Tube for fiber mascara/fiber lashes tutorials to learn how to apply it the correct way. First, do a base coat of your favorite black mascara.  Then, put a good coat of the gel on my lashes first. Apply the fibers to the tips of my lashes (don&#x27;t try to apply the fibers to the base of your lashes.. it causes clumps and more chance to get them in your eye). After doing the fiber, apply another coat of the mascara gel to seal everything.  I usually stop there.  If you want, you can do another coat of the fiber and mascara gel to make them even longer and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sealing the fibers is key!  You have to do that step or the fibers will probably fall off after everything dries.  Everything washed off with makeup remover and water.  I&#x27;ve been using them for about a week with no issues.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I bought this mascara, and was a bit skeptical because some were saying the fibers flake off the brush. I just used my mascara today and I had no problems at all with either the mascara or the fiber brush. In fact, this is my new favorite mascara!! I have tiny eyelashes that you can barely see without mascara, so I have honestly tried them all!! There is only one fiber mascara out there that even comes close to this one, but with the other fiber mascara&#x27;s price Love Alpha, in my opinion, wins hands down!! So if you are looking for a new mascara, buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> PROS: It gave me 2-minute-laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How good? HAHAHA i don&#x27;t know what to say. Definitely i will not recommend this to any of my friends. Let me just say, i need to be extra careful buying online. Only buy products that i personally tried and/or if my favorite store run out of stock. Back to my review, there are better Fiber mascara for the price. For the shipping? It arrived earlier than ETA, that&#x27;s the only reason i am giving it 2 stars. Otherwise, it&#x27;s 1 star. Packaging? You ever had a synthetic leather that you junked in your garage for months and it started to peel off? Well that&#x27;s what i got! Maybe, i am just not lucky enough to get the best leopard case. Anyway, i received this product a week ago and because of the packaging, i wasn&#x27;t too thrilled to try (little scared). Didn&#x27;t bother til today, and now i can totally say, I WASTED MY MONEY!!! The transplanting gel smell strong and the fiber...OMG they look like cotton fibers dyed in black (literally). I don&#x27;t understand Chinese so who knows what is it really. Although the transplanting gel does the job, the fiber is lame. Pieces of it keeps falling on my nose and cheeks and YUP on my eyes too!! As soon as i was done putting it on my left eye, i stopped and washed it off. That shessh still burning my eye!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE: This product can give you stiff neck--- stiff neck either from laughing or shaking your head! Alright, got to go. I got an eye to itch!</li>
            <li> I got 5 uses out of it and then the fibers stopped coming out.......RIPE OFF!</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to applying my eyelashes. The results are good and you don&#x27;t have to worry about thinning your real lashes. And my eyes look great. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do as much as I expected. The fiber doesn&#x27;t really stay after you put the second set of mascara...</li>
            <li> The transplanting gel is okay but the fiber is all dried out and when you apply the fiber it just give you a big chunk on your lashes..waste of money...</li>
            <li> Great product, my eyelashes looks amazing and I dont get allergies when i am using the mascara.</li>
            <li> Worked awesome and was worth the money</li>
            <li> I recently bought Love Alpha fiber mascara got it in the mail today and looked up a quick tutorial on YouTube and boom I have amazing lashes! I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot so I thought I&#x27;d give this mascara a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. Love it!</li>
            <li> Ok, I liked the way it made my lashes look, but had to stop using it because I kept getting the fibers in my eyes during the day. Honestly, you can get close to the same look with just good regular maskara.</li>
            <li> great product.  very easy to apply.  the transparent gel works like a mascara.  my lashes become noticeably longer.  it doesn&#x27;t shed and doesn&#x27;t irritates my eyes.  i have very sensitive eyes.  I used other similar; but more expensive products before and they all ended up in the trash.  This is a keeper</li>
            <li> Great product. A little experimenting and experience, then wow. I am 63 and have short, sparse lashes. With this product, no damage to natural lashes and really nice after application. Price fantastic too</li>
            <li> Tried this product for a burlesque show and it didn&#x27;t make my sparse eyelashes any bigger or better than drugstore mascara.  Many people in reviews complained that this product flaked into the eyes.  If applied properly and not touched it&#x27;s ok, but I can see what they mean.  Nothing gives the look of false eyelashes but false eyelashes, so if that&#x27;s what you are going for, just buy them.</li>
            <li> Hi, I just got this. I was told I wouldn&#x27;t get it until Aug 1, but received it Jul 22.  I usually use a base coat (Loreal Cils) with mascara Maybelline Mega Plush Volume.  For true comparison, I used this system on eye (followed up with mascara) and my usual system on the other.  The package arrived early, well padded in bubble wrap, followed by a complete seal of the case, followed by a decorative sealed band over a hard glasses-like case.  On my right, I used the system twice (gel-fibers-gel-fibers).  On the left, my usual products.  There was not much difference between my two eyes so I added mascara to the right eye and that&#x27;s when I saw a noticeable difference. I did not use any other makeup products on my eyes.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this.  However, I&#x27;ve only had it on for 5 minutes so I don&#x27;t know how well it holds up.  I took a picture, but I see no place to share it here.</li>
            <li> I had to you tube the instructions but it works better actually than the more expensive stuff!</li>
            <li> it does not work on my lashes. I tried youtube and did exactly what it said but nothing at all but flakes everywhere. very disappointed on this product but I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Great value, works pretty good. Watch a youtube video first on &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; and you should have no problems. I would recomend Love Alpha Fibre Mascara!</li>
            <li> Great product. I received it very quickly. Person I work with had ordered $29 version of this product, and mine was just as good.</li>
            <li> I love the fiber lashes I tried them as soon as I got them and my eyelashes just popped... and its not as expensive and I received the package a lot faster than I thought I would get it</li>
            <li> The mascara run down on your face. You will have to constantly check your chicks etc.Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Very great mascara!!! Definetly adds volume and depth, and length if applied in multiple coats. I&#x27;ve used the younique fibers and they definetly compare! Can&#x27;t beat the price either. Only thing is that the tubes seem to dry up relatively quick. Otherwise, love this! Already ordered the two pack tubes!</li>
            <li> The only 2 downfalls about this product is that 1: It is very time consuming; the longer you wan the lashes, the more time it takes to actually make that dramatic look you want. 2:with that, the longer extension of your lashes, it looks like spider legs not a natural look. Does it get the job done? Absolutely. It does extend very well, there is just some bittersweet things about the overall finish look. Some people like the spider look (looks a bit clumpy-long) and then there are some people out there that likes that look. So use to your own desecration/liking.&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion is to apply your eye-liner first and then apply your favorite mascara(s) and then apply the love Alpha Transparent gel first and then apply the Fiber and finishing it up with again the Transparent Gel to seal the fibers to your lashes. For longer lashes after the first coat , re-apply your favorite mascara and repeat the process with the gel and fiber for a 2nd coat (repeat if needed).&lt;br /&gt;I applied 3 coats of the product and it took me 30-35 mins so start this process way ahead of time. It did last all day and is really simple to take off. It does not effect your real lashes! :) enjoy</li>
            <li> best cheap 3d fiber mascara. anything cheaper has goopy gross mascara. this one gives you quality for a good price.</li>
            <li> This product did not come with English directions, but watching a youtube video made it pretty self-explanatory.  It was just what I thought.  Depending on how great your own lashes are, this doesn&#x27;t automatically make them awesome.  It does make them thicker, fuller and a tad longer.  Its easy to apply, easy to wash off.  My lashes actually felt softer after I applied....not firm and crusty like some mascaras do.  I recommended to all my friends</li>
            <li> This is okay - not a huge fan. The process to get the long lashes is cumbersome.  I did get the results promised however. So it did work as promised.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item in order to test and review</li>
            <li> It does work, but is messy and complicated to work with. Not an every day mascara, but maybe  good for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Need a few coats but really nice and NOT spidery like others.</li>
            <li> Love how my lashes look, very lengthy. Careful putting it on though i got some fibers in my eyenand it irritated it,</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the results. It was difficult to use. I could not get natural looking lashes and the fluffy stuff got everywhere on my face.</li>
            <li> Great product. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Good but very flaky. Looked up how to use on pinterest.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to put at least one coat of your regular mascara on after you&#x27;re ALL done applying the fibre mascara :-) It will seat the fibre on and won&#x27;t flake off!</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed in this :(&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to make it work because I love the results I get with it but within an hour of application, you&#x27;ll start to see the little fibers on your undereye area. After you spent all the time concealing the area you now have BLACK mess all on it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Me encant&amp;oacute;, me deja las pesta&amp;ntilde;as gruesas y largas. Genial!</li>
            <li> It took over a month to receive this an it worked alright the lashes are longer but not fuller</li>
            <li> Hate the fibers fly all into your eyes and stays for hours, i just spent my money on the 3d mascars. Buy the real deal</li>
            <li> Wow!  This stuff is amazing!  Movie star lashes in an instant for so cheap.  These are as good as false eyelashes and so much easier and more comfortable.  I&#x27;ve tried so many other fiber mascaras, this is the best. No glad I read the reviews and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I got for my Daughter she loves how it makes her eyes pop!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I wear contact lenses and haven&#x27;t had any trouble with them flaking into my eyes. LIKE IT ALOT!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. Not the best and not the worst. If you want a lot of volume and long lashes you have to apply it over and over and OVER again lol. And Sometimes the fibers can get into your eyes ouch!  I think I&#x27;ll just stick to my Walgreens mascara.</li>
            <li> GET OUT! Seriously! This is amazing, ordering more for Christmas gifts!! I watched the youtube video on application. I wear contacts and blink a lot, so I have to add a final coat of my waterproof mascara as to not have smudges. BTW, Every mascara smudges on me but L&#x27;oreal double extend. YOU WILL love this mascara/fiber lashes! My lashes look AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This fibre mascara is fabulous and it doesn&#x27;t cost $29 like other companies.  You&#x27;ll LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Holy MOTHER OF GAWD! This stuff is bonkers great! I have pretty long and full lashes, but this made them MEGA HUGE! it&#x27;s a different look. Not the soft fluffy magazine kind of look. You have to be into the kinda clumpy lash look. I like this better than fake lashes because there is no glue. If you want thicker, longer, crazy huge lashes that won&#x27;t harm your lashes or lids...get this. Get 2. I did! ***Update. Be sure to use PLENTY of the gel mascara to avoid shedding. I use a heavy duty sealer to avoid this. These babys shed like crazy if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I choose this Mascara because i saw it on a video tutorial on you tube by LaurenBeauty.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara is more than wonderful, it made my lashes thicker and longer. I bought two, for me and my sister.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for any girl who wants beautiful lashes. i also like the mascara case, so cute!!!</li>
