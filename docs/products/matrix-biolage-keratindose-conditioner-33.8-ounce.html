            <li> I&#x27;ve been a salon blonde for quite some time and my hair was really over-processed.  </li>
            <li> No parabens or sulfates, which is critical to keeping your keratin treatment lasting long.  </li>
            <li> My hair was so dry when I stepped out of the shower that I didn&#x27;t even need to use the towel.  </li>
            <li> I also use a hot oil treatment before each shampoo and other keratin products after rinsing to make sure my hair does not dry up real bad,</li>
            <li> It was $30+ at their salon (no thanks)</li>
            <li> I still use other products in between, but this has become my go-to.</li>
            <li> I ripped half of it out when trying to comb through it.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely see an improvement in my broken and split ends...</li>
            <li> and I also shampoo it everyday.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, wavy and dry from dying and heat treatments</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and it doesn&#x27;t leave my very thin hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair...  </li>
            <li> The expensive sea oils I used after didn&#x27;t even seem to help.  </li>

            <li> Great product.  Love this conditioner!!</li>
            <li> I bleached and dyed my hair multiple times resulting in significant damage. I always wore it up cause there was nothing I could do with it. This product has saved my hair! Leaves it so silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> Great product and price...will definately be ordering again.  Love that I didn&#x27;t have to go out shopping for this. Thanks</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair and I was amazed even just by one use. It was $30+ at their salon (no thanks) and I ended up buying it from Ulta on sale at $20, but now I order it from Amazon because it&#x27;s the cheapest I&#x27;ve been able to find. My hair is very thick, wavy and dry from dying and heat treatments and I just cannot say enough about this conditioner. For the first time ever people have been telling me how shiny and soft my hair is. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It works really good, but I have tried cheaper products with much better results. Spending more money does not mean better results!</li>
            <li> Only conditioner I will use, works better then any I have tried before!</li>
            <li> Amazing just amazing. My hair feels softer and shinier. I recommend to use the whole line is you are having the keratin treatment.  This will help you maintain the investment and you will see the difference.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has been really great for my over-processed hair.  I&#x27;ve been a salon blonde for quite some time and my hair was really over-processed.  This shampoo made it feel and smell great.</li>
            <li> Not impressed..its ok. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again</li>
            <li> Having used Matrix and their Biolage products off and on through the years, I was expecting the product to stand up to the name and the reviews I&#x27;ve read. However, I have been blown away. This product has made my over processed and damaged hair feel amazing, time and time again. It&#x27;s not too heavy and it doesn&#x27;t leave my very thin hair looking greasy. I still use other products in between, but this has become my go-to. I can definitely see an improvement in my broken and split ends... I think with regular use and a little more time, I&#x27;ll have a much healthier looking hair. NOTE: I have been highlighting my hair for 10+ years every 6-8 weeks. While I&#x27;ve always used high end products it&#x27;s a lot of strain on your hair. This product will definitely help ease that damage.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect conditioner for keratin treated hair.  No parabens or sulfates, which is critical to keeping your keratin treatment lasting long.  The only wish I have for this product is that it comes with a pump, since the bottle is so big.  Smells fantastic too!</li>
            <li> My hair gets colored every 6-8 weeks and I also shampoo it everyday. This conditioner helps in maintaining the softness of my hair. I also use a hot oil treatment before each shampoo and other keratin products after rinsing to make sure my hair does not dry up real bad,</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair...  My hair was so dry when I stepped out of the shower that I didn&#x27;t even need to use the towel.  The expensive sea oils I used after didn&#x27;t even seem to help.  Used approx 5-7 times with the same results.  Ended up throwing this away as my hair was so tangled I ripped half of it out when trying to comb through it.  Thought I would give this a shot, but ended up going back to Q10.</li>
            <li> Great price. Fast shipping. Great product</li>
            <li> Exactly the product that I was looking for. Received it by the date promised &amp; the price was right.</li>
            <li> Only product I trust in my hair!! Great for color treated hair and lasting softness with less breakage.</li>
            <li> Tried this product for the first time and I loved it! It smells amazing and made my hair shiny smooth and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, fixed my dead hair when nothing else did...</li>
            <li> A nice, lightweight conditioner with the classic Biolage scent. Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel wonderful and smell great!</li>
