            <li>I love this body butter.</li>

            <li>There is no greasy feeling, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s sitting on top of your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it, but a lot of people don&#x27;t like the smell of shea butter and frankincense&lt;</li>
            <li>It feels great going on; my skin feels nice and smooth, soft.</li>
            <li>Richly moisturizing!</li>
            <li>It is of great quality, with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and smells great.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love the light scent.</li>
            <li>All of the ingredients are easy to pronounce, and there are no parabens or phthalates.</li>
            <li>This lotion can be located within stores easily.</li>
            <li>The scent is extremely strong...</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-(con for some, but not for me) Has a rather strong smell that lasts.</li>
            <li>And i liked the smell very much..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a feminine scent by any means, so men could enjoy this as well(my brother did).</li>
            <li>I use it before going to bed, and I wake up to find my hands silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>* Leaves your skin feeling smooth and hydrated</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and creamy and just perfection.&lt;br /&gt;PROS</li>
            <li>They really look nice and feel buttery</li>
            <li>The scent of the Shea butter is nice, and although it seems greasy at first is absorbed quickly leaving skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>* Great for dry skin</li>
            <li>Great product with a strong, albeit pleasant smell that fades only slightly over time</li>
            <li>It smells great and is very moisturizing and would be ideal for those in dry climates who struggle with dry skin.</li>
            <li>25 seconds (full bottle)</li>
            <li>The lotion is kind of greasy, strong sent, doesn&#x27;t take for ever to soak in but its not an instant soak in either.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s always all this hype about Shea butter and to be honest the only Shea butter product that has surprised me is the Shea moisture shampoo and conditioner (love it!).</li>
            <li>worth the $$</li>
            <li>It was a hassle but worth the effort.    </li>
            <li>totally worth it once it does.</li>
            <li>I was glad to see it on amazon for a lesser price than I originally bought it.</li>
            <li>That stuff is also fair trade, natural, non toxic, and generally shouldn&#x27;t cause any health issues.</li>
            <li>This lotion is best for dry climate, very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love that it is cruelty-free and is super moisturizing, even for super dry skin like mine.</li>
            <li>I have horribly dry skin that nothing helps (which is why I make my own lotions.</li>
            <li>I have horribly dry skin that nothing helps (which is why I make my own lotions.</li>
            <li>is one of those rare, magical products that actually works!</li>
            <li>As soon as the other junk is gone, I&#x27;ll feel justified in buying more of this, which I am now using sparingly on the hands, neck arms, scars, and sometimes on my face instead of face cream.</li>
            <li>In the first place, I picked this up at Target on sale for $8.50.</li>
            <li>I know whose arms are riddled with red lines/scars.&lt;br /&gt;OK, one more thought.</li>
            <li>I purchased this lotion at a local Target store and paid $9.99 when it was on sale and can honestly say it is a good value because of how long one bottle will last.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t possibly use this stuff on your body in any useful way as the smell of it is MUCH too strong.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is overwhelming and very sweet, and long lasting,  Returned for refund.</li>
            <li>I love this product but only use it as a body cream after shaving as it is much too rich for my skin and leaves it greasy if I use it as a daily body lotion.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this product and really likes it.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a long lasting nice scent and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I had to take the top off to shake the lotion down in order to get lotion out.</li>
            <li>I will not purchase this particular item again on-line.</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion I use for my face, and have my face soft and smooth even through New England weather.</li>
            <li>Using even just a little for your hands will make your odor easily picked up across a large room... and will remain in any room you visit.</li>
            <li>It is thick, rich, and quick absorbing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, espcially if you are a little older and your skin is more sensitive and fragile than in the days of our youth.  </li>
            <li>I love Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Lotion!</li>
            <li>Love the lotion but have a hard time getting it out of bottle</li>
            <li>and this is non-greasy and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>like using natural products.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a love it or hate it kind of scent.</li>
            <li>It has a mild, fragrant smell and the effects last a long time on the skin.  </li>
            <li>You can purchase the exact same item for under $10.00 at your local Target.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I am not an everyday lotion user, mostly because I haven&#x27;t ever really seen a different between using a lotion or not, especially as I don&#x27;t typically have dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super thick and creamy, very moisturizing and smells like Frankincense and Myrrh.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and usually respond badly to anything with chemicals and preservatives, so after reading how shea butter was probably the best option for my condition, I bought this because I was desperate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also watery, doesn&#x27;t have much shea butter in it, and soaks into the skin in about two minutes, ultimately leaving my skin dry.</li>
            <li>So, be careful in discerning good quality, high potency, will-fix-your-skin-issues, shea butter products, from the many mediocre products out there that will fail you.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic, and that I didn&#x27;t need such an expensive cream for my body and legs, so bought a huge 32oz bottle of \\&quot;EveryDay</li>
            <li>There is always a sale going on somewhere, so you&#x27;re not limited to Amazon to pick this up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is much too thick, perhaps too much beeswax.</li>
            <li>I usually make my own lotions, but some times feel lazy and just want to buy one.</li>
            <li>I will use the other stuff on my legs and other areas that aren&#x27;t in need of protection or help, because I can&#x27;t afford to waste money, and it may be helping a tiny bit, but my new love is this particular brand, with a high concentration of Raw Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>I went on like that for about two weeks, kind of miserable, trying different lotions, mostly just feeling pain from them but not seeing change.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, their is not one single thing I can say that&#x27;s negative!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too crazy bout the smell of this one, but love these non greasy natural lotions.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Gave me and my kids a rash.</li>
            <li> The best lotion i&#x27;ve ever used.  worth the $$</li>
            <li> This is the best body lotion i have ever used in my entire life!! And i liked the smell very much.. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> The scent is extremely strong... I can put it on my legs but definitely not on my hands or arms. If I do, I can literally smell it all day. I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This lotion is absolutely amazing. I was using Palmers cocoa butter but the scent was nauseating, couldn&#x27;t stand smelling like a chocolate bar. The scent of the Shea butter is nice, and although it seems greasy at first is absorbed quickly leaving skin silky smooth. Shea also doesn&#x27;t clog pores like cocoa butter can so I can use it all over. Only issue is the bottle, the lotion is thick and hard to squeeze so I emptied the Palmers and refilled the pump bottle with this lotion and problem solved.  It was a hassle but worth the effort.    It is disappointing that the Amazon price is so high. This lotion is cheaper at Target and CVS. I am an Amazon addict I hope the price comes down.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere. I was glad to see it on amazon for a lesser price than I originally bought it. The lotion smells amazing. I have dry skin and this is non-greasy and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, their is not one single thing I can say that&#x27;s negative! It&#x27;s the best I have ever used !</li>
            <li> Love the lotion but have a hard time getting it out of bottle</li>
            <li> I like shea body lotion however, this lotion was too thick and very hard to squeeze out of the bottle.  I had to take the top off to shake the lotion down in order to get lotion out. What a hassle.  I will not purchase this particular item again on-line.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer put it, this lotion most definitely is amazing. It works wonders as far as keeping skin moisturized and hydrated is concerned (particularly during the extreme cold of winter!). The best thing about it is that it is not particularly greasy and the skin does absorb it nicely. I use it on my hands twice daily and have noticed that rough areas seem to be getting smoother and that those areas which used to be excessively dry are both smoother and less prone to itchiness. I purchased this lotion at a local Target store and paid $9.99 when it was on sale and can honestly say it is a good value because of how long one bottle will last. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of lotion as this is a product to which the old adage of \\&quot;a little goes a long way\\&quot; definitely applies.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this lotion YES should be in a jar but i ordered two of these and LOVE the smell and LOVE LOVE what it does to my skin!!!!  i will use this forever and i love the story behind this company!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and love the softness of my skin afterwards</li>
            <li> This lotion has a long lasting nice scent and is very moisturizing. If you are in a humid climate, it might be too thick for you. This lotion is best for dry climate, very dry skin. For humid summer months I recommend their coconut hibiscus lotion. Its lighter in fragrance and consistency and shines the skin.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is overwhelming and very sweet, and long lasting,  Returned for refund.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great. The plastic bottle is in question for me. It is very difficult to get the lotion out toward the end. I just turn it upside down and that works like a charm. This is a very good product.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing.  It feels so soothing and calming when applied yet is not greesy.  It has a mild, fragrant smell and the effects last a long time on the skin.  I really love it.  I found that it is more expensive to buy online at this point though.  You can purchase the exact same item for under $10.00 at your local Target.  This is where I will purchase mine until the online price drops to a comparable amount.  I highly recommend this product, espcially if you are a little older and your skin is more sensitive and fragile than in the days of our youth.  It is of great quality, with natural ingredients.  Your skin will thank you for it.</li>
            <li> I love Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Lotion! It&#x27;s super thick and creamy, very moisturizing and smells like Frankincense and Myrrh. It&#x27;s the only body lotion that I use. Other that that I use, my DIY Body Butter (shea butter/coconut oil). A little goes a long way so the 13 oz bottle lasts a while. I buy it for $11 at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Shea Butter, Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Vegetable Emulsifying Wax, Castor Oil, Mango Butter, Cocoa Butter, Vegetable Glycerin, Jojoba Oil, Essential Oil Blend, Soy Milk, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Frankincense Extract, Myrrh Extract, Allantoin (Comfrey Root Extract)</li>
            <li> Well, I am glad that I tried this lotion, since I&#x27;ve been considering for a while now. That said, it is just OK. It feels great going on; my skin feels nice and smooth, soft. However, it doesn&#x27;t last. Plus, I think the manufacturer should consider another dispenser. It is VERY difficult to get the lotion out of the bottle with the flip top. It needs to either have a pump or bottom lid.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s always all this hype about Shea butter and to be honest the only Shea butter product that has surprised me is the Shea moisture shampoo and conditioner (love it!). The lotion is kind of greasy, strong sent, doesn&#x27;t take for ever to soak in but its not an instant soak in either. what I do like about it is you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. a little goes an long way and covers a large area, which means it will last a long time. over all I think I&#x27;m going to stick with the jergens lotion with Shea butter. makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> It does not smell good at all</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has been AMAZING! I love that it is cruelty-free and is super moisturizing, even for super dry skin like mine. A little goes a long way so this bottle will last awhile. It&#x27;s thick so it&#x27;s sometimes hard to get out, but totally worth it once it does.</li>
            <li> I love this body butter. It&#x27;s all natural and smells great. Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so was so glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> My cousin received and loves it</li>
            <li> 1. It is thick, rich, and quick absorbing. There is no greasy feeling, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s sitting on top of your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This lotion has a love it or hate it kind of scent. It&#x27;s not a feminine scent by any means, so men could enjoy this as well(my brother did). The bright side is that the scent does not linger too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. All of the ingredients are easy to pronounce, and there are no parabens or phthalates. If you look on the side of the bottle, it lists all of the harmful ingredients it doesn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. This lotion can be located within stores easily. There is always a sale going on somewhere, so you&#x27;re not limited to Amazon to pick this up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The moisture you feel after applying this lasts all day. I use it before going to bed, and I wake up to find my hands silky and smooth. Furthermore, as an accutane user, I have not experienced dry hands since I use this religiously. When something gets itchy, I slather it on and the dry itchy feeling goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped!</li>
            <li> Great product with a strong, albeit pleasant smell that fades only slightly over time, I wouldn&#x27;t go overboard with it. a little bit goes a long way. But the price listed here of $18.78 is nearly double what this can be found at in Target and some supermarkets.  Shop around on this, unless you love it and can&#x27;t find it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this at a health fair I attended and had to buy some. It smells wonderful and make my skin feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product and really likes it.</li>
            <li> Richly moisturizing! I love this stuff. It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs well, and lasts! My husband says that it&#x27;s the best for keeping his chalk-covered hands from cracking, esp in the winter. It also helps my dad with his psoriasis. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s gunky, and that&#x27;s not enough to keep me from giving it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too crazy bout the smell of this one, but love these non greasy natural lotions. Biggest con is its hard to come out of the bottle so microwave the bottom bout 25 seconds (full bottle) &amp; you&#x27;ll have no problem getting it out.</li>
            <li> Love this product. This is the only lotion I use for my face, and have my face soft and smooth even through New England weather.</li>
            <li> I love this product but only use it as a body cream after shaving as it is much too rich for my skin and leaves it greasy if I use it as a daily body lotion. It smells great and is very moisturizing and would be ideal for those in dry climates who struggle with dry skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic. I have medical problems which makes my skin extremely dry. This helps with the dryness and also smells sooo good.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture Body Lotion is an excellent product.The problem is, it should be in a jar, it is to thick to be in a bottle&lt;br /&gt;at least the bottle should have a pump.</li>
            <li> Caused heat rash!! This is much too thick, perhaps too much beeswax. Had put it on my legs and arms in the morning. It must have clogged my sweat pores, broke out only on the areas I had applied this body lotion, no heat rash or any rash anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this lotion should only be used in the colder months and definitely avoided in the hotter months. Clogs pores!!! Had also bought the lotion for babies, will definitely not be buying any of these products, especially after examining their ingredients...(see EWG.org)</li>
            <li> The only lotion that keep my skin moisturized all day &amp; I love the light scent.</li>
            <li> I use this as my every day lotion. Great compliments for the smell and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> * Non-greasy&lt;br /&gt;* Not sticky&lt;br /&gt;* Consistency is like sour cream or Greek yogurt&lt;br /&gt;* Smooths on like whipped butter&lt;br /&gt;* Smells delicious&lt;br /&gt;* Leaves your skin feeling smooth and hydrated&lt;br /&gt;* Great for dry skin</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I usually make my own lotions, but some times feel lazy and just want to buy one. This has become the only lotion that I will buy. It&#x27;s smooth and creamy and just perfection.&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-Consistency of yogurt&lt;br /&gt;-Goes on like whipped cream/butter&lt;br /&gt;-Non-greasy and absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;-A little goes a long way, especially when put on within 60seconds after a shower while your skin is still damp&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect lotion to use after dry brushing, no need for a body oil as well&lt;br /&gt;-Made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;-Pronounceable ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;  Deionized Water, Raw Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Oil (Certified Organic Ingredient), Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter (Certified Organic Ingredient), Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Olus Oil, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Nut Oil, Carthamus Tintorius (Safflower) Oil (Certified Organic Ingredient), Vegetable Squalene, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Vegetable Emulsifying Wax, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Boswellia Serrata (Frankincense) Oil, Allantoin (Comfrey Root) Extract, Myrrh Extract, Proprietary Essential Oil Blend, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower (and) Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-(con for some, but not for me) Has a rather strong smell that lasts. I love it, but a lot of people don&#x27;t like the smell of shea butter and frankincense&lt;br /&gt;-The bottle is horrible. The lotion is so thick that it clings to the bottle. The baby lotion by them comes in a pump, why not this?! I spend the time to move this to a glass jar when I buy it so it&#x27;s easier to use. Usually need my husband to do it, since he is stronger than I.&lt;br /&gt;-Nothing about them to prove their ingredients are truly certified organic. Their &amp;#34;certification&amp;#34; is not an official logo. There are stories that they are being sued for falsely promoting certification where none exists. If this is important to you, then this is not a product for you unless you can research and find these stories to be false. I don&#x27;t care personally, so it&#x27;s a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a TON a moisturizing products on the market. I have horribly dry skin that nothing helps (which is why I make my own lotions. plain shea butter and coconut oil combined with my dry brushing for exfoliation have done wonders to help treat it without flaring my eczema.) so this has been amazing. It&#x27;s a great store lotion and moisturizes and smooths the way I would expect a good lotion to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY IT FROM AMAZON! Seriously, go to Target. It runs about 9$ in stores. The Amazon price is usually double that. Save yourself the money.

            <li> This is the best body lotion I have ever used. I will be using this product everyday from now on!!</li>
            <li> In the first place, I picked this up at Target on sale for $8.50. I would have never purchased it at the $17 Amazon is selling it for, but I might in the future if it&#x27;s the only way to get it.&lt;br /&gt;I am not an everyday lotion user, mostly because I haven&#x27;t ever really seen a different between using a lotion or not, especially as I don&#x27;t typically have dry skin. However, I recently went from a tropical climate to the depths of a Virginia winter, and my skin reacted to the weather change by drying, cracking, bleeding, peeling and hurting - a little on my face and neck, but particularly on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;As a result, I tried a few different lotions that burned and irritated, felt greasy, smelled chemically, but did nothing to fix the mess caused by the extreme weather change. I went on like that for about two weeks, kind of miserable, trying different lotions, mostly just feeling pain from them but not seeing change.&lt;br /&gt;I like using natural products. Products made from ingredients that essentially one could eat, when possible. I have very sensitive skin and usually respond badly to anything with chemicals and preservatives, so after reading how shea butter was probably the best option for my condition, I bought this because I was desperate.&lt;br /&gt;Instant relief! Not only did it cure my winter-abused skin in just a few days, but I noticed that the burn marks on my arms from cooking/baking - marks that had been there, red lines essentially, for the past year -  were gone in a week.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing bonus!&lt;br /&gt;So now I am rubbing this into all of my scars.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those rare, magical products that actually works! Despite that it is Spring, it was still snowing in Virginia until last week, and the heater has been sucking every molecule of moisture out of the air; yet my hands have never been softer. They really look nice and feel buttery soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this to include in holiday gift baskets for the women I know who battle dry skin, eczema, and one baker I know whose arms are riddled with red lines/scars.&lt;br /&gt;OK, one more thought. I figured it was just the Shea Butter that was working it&#x27;s magic, and that I didn&#x27;t need such an expensive cream for my body and legs, so bought a huge 32oz bottle of \\&quot;EveryDay Shea\\&quot; from Swanson&#x27;s vitamins for about $10. That stuff is also fair trade, natural, non toxic, and generally shouldn&#x27;t cause any health issues. It is also watery, doesn&#x27;t have much shea butter in it, and soaks into the skin in about two minutes, ultimately leaving my skin dry. So, be careful in discerning good quality, high potency, will-fix-your-skin-issues, shea butter products, from the many mediocre products out there that will fail you. I will use the other stuff on my legs and other areas that aren&#x27;t in need of protection or help, because I can&#x27;t afford to waste money, and it may be helping a tiny bit, but my new love is this particular brand, with a high concentration of Raw Shea Butter. As soon as the other junk is gone, I&#x27;ll feel justified in buying more of this, which I am now using sparingly on the hands, neck arms, scars, and sometimes on my face instead of face cream.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t possibly use this stuff on your body in any useful way as the smell of it is MUCH too strong. Using even just a little for your hands will make your odor easily picked up across a large room... and will remain in any room you visit. The smell will keep on some after you wash your hands also. It&#x27;s too bad really because otherwise it felt as though it works well. Now, if you&#x27;re one of those people who likes to choke me to death by smelling like ridiculous perfume, you might like this stuff, but if you&#x27;re not looking for a very hefty perfume (and especially if you have olfactory sensitivities), stay away and perhaps try their other products (though I have not yet so can&#x27;t speak to whether they also smell horrible).</li>
            <li> Love, love this lotion!</li>
