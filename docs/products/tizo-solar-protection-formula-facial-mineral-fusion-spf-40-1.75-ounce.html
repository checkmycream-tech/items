            <li>It goes on smooth and leaves skin looking and feeling great!!</li>
            <li>This is ideal on top of your moisturizer and underneath your powder,  </li>
            <li>It does have a silicone type feel upon application but the coverage is so good</li>
            <li>I m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, just not for my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best sunscreen I have come across , has a nice matte finish , great coverage and does not make me break out !</li>

            <li>not only a beautiful foundation but the best in sun protection.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the staying power of this sunscreen is amazing, even at the beach.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing formula.</li>
            <li>AMAZING .</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Great protection, silky smooth and a nice amount of coverage</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Also it seemed to be kind of cakey.  </li>
            <li>This was really nice.   </li>
            <li>This sunblock is the absolute best.  </li>
            <li>You make up foundation does not go on nicely</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even nice if you don&#x27;t want to put makeup over it.</li>
            <li>I will say it did blend well and had a nice finish at the end that wasn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>It honestly makes wearing sunscreen and remembering to wear it a non issue because any applications over it improves wearability.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s kind on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be an effective sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tinted and blends nicely into your skin.</li>
            <li>The nice part about the tint is blends with your skin color.</li>
            <li>It really evens out my skin tone while providing the best sun protection.</li>
            <li>it gives you a nice tinted look and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I have had two precancerous lesions (and brown spots) burned off because we did not have this kind of sunscreen when I was growing</li>
            <li>It is absolutely the one best thing that keeps my rosacea under control!  </li>
            <li>Best protection ever is very silky and can be used as foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also really effective.</li>
            <li>Tinted, but blends nicely into your own skin color.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and this company, MD Skin Solutions, offeres great customer service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve fair skin which burns easily.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best tinted sunscreen I have found yet.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best sun protection product I have found.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every face sunscreen imaginable and this sunscreen is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>But wow when you blend it in it is silky/velvety and blends perfectly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li>Cheap price and good for oily skin.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best sun protection for your face and neck...</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to apply to your face and it drys immediately!  </li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>We are both very fair so the risk was high.</li>
            <li>i use it  with bare minerals and obtain a perfect complexion.</li>
            <li>the perfect present for my little girl  the color the size all is perfect, im really happy when i see you in the face all days</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and   gives you a matte finish.  </li>
            <li>No smell, goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>also controls you sebum and protective from the sun , very light.</li>
            <li>It goes on super light, which is great.</li>

            <li>I think if you&#x27;re trying for an alternative to greasy goopy sunblock, I might suggest the many powder sunscreens that are on the market now instead of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE TIZO.  </li>
            <li>Tizo tinted sunscreen is my favorite.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love the skin tone it gives me when I have it on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the hunt for the perfect daily face sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Luckily I am able to return it no problem.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>product actually makes your skin look flawless, and its invisible.  </li>
            <li>I decided that I better get my act together and put on Tizo 3.</li>
            <li>most of all</li>
            <li>it feels kind of like a primer, it makes your face feel smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>

            <li>I used quite a bit to make sure I had coverage</li>
            <li>I love it because it appears like the lightest makeup.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>I work in the sun with my job most of the time and</li>
            <li>this gives me added protection from the sun plus it is tinted, which is why I love it.  </li>
            <li>and then I use this on top of that in the most needed places.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>

            <li>I love the creamy feel this product has.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than more chemical sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>A result of regular use of this excellent product</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>What more could I ask for.</li>

            <li>Love, love, love this stuff.  </li>

            <li>Best daily sunscreen I have found.  </li>
            <li>Plus, stays put in summer heat unlike most foundation.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it goes on .</li>
            <li>I could get on the roof top and give a speech about these Solar products (see my review for Solar Protection Formula Tinted Concealer also).  </li>
            <li>And the sooner the better.  </li>
            <li>b/c I spread it and use it mostly as primer.)&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>it is more like a foundation.  </li>
            <li>Check to see if the shade by itself is ok.  </li>
            <li>But most of all you will save yourself from skin damage.</li>
            <li>In the summer, this is all I use, the coverage is outstanding, and I have NEVER gotten a burn no matter if I am swimming, kayaking or biking.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>IT WILL BUY IT AGAIN FOR SURE.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this sunblock.  </li>

            <li>If you are ok about these two issues then you may like it.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I bought the tinted which I really love.  </li>
            <li>It is also the first product that has not given me a reaction of any kind in ages - I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
            <li>I will order more when I run out.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased to find this product.  </li>
            <li>Better deal than buying at my dermatologists office.</li>
            <li>For darker skin use more.  </li>
            <li>Those that I have told and tried it, love it too.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful facial sun protection.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I totally love this product.  </li>
            <li>but I LOVE</li>
            <li>It is lightly tinted, and I am hooked!</li>
            <li>Great, if you don&#x27;t put too much on.  </li>
            <li>Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>I love the texture of TIZO.  </li>
            <li>My plastic surgeon&#x27;s office staff recommended this product and I LOVE it</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the on-line company as well.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Excellent sun protection and has the same texture as a medium weight doundation.</li>
            <li>This is a truly elegant and non-greasy, silky matte sunscreen, but I wish they used \\&quot; tinted\\&quot; in the description.</li>
            <li>my mom uses it and if she asks for more i guess she likes it</li>
            <li>This sunscreen feels very soft on my skin and the tint blends beautifully.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the best colored clean SPF I have found so far.</li>
            <li>nice light brown hue, good sun protection, not irritating.</li>
            <li>It glides on easily, it looks good and not pasty with just the right tint,and it protects well.</li>
            <li>First, the Amazon part was great, good price, shipped quickly, the product was exactly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received the sample at my chiropractor&#x27;s office of all places and absolutely loved it, was so glad to find it was main stream and on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Im very fair but have some red in my skiin</li>
            <li>love, goes on smooth, matches my skin and</li>
            <li>this has a more velvetty texture that just allows my makeup to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It works really well and is truly a good product.  </li>
            <li>Cool!</li>
            <li>For people who are allergic to CHEMICAL sunscreens, this offeres the best protction from the sun other than staying in doors.</li>
            <li>It went on easily and although I do not wear foundation make up</li>
            <li>It feels like butter when I apply it to my skin and spreads evenly; easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a primer for your foundation and makes it so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Received product very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Also, I like that it&#x27;s tinted which makes it easy to know that you&#x27;re applying it uniformly</li>
            <li>This product does not clump or cake, removes easily and does give sun protection.  </li>
            <li>The tinted color blends easily.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to find a natural sun block that is toxin and chemical free.</li>
            <li>others, I&#x27;ve found Tizo3 really easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and my skin doesnt accept the creams so easy.</li>
            <li>Because it does not come off easily, I can sweat or swim with confidence.</li>
            <li>Easily soaks into your skin.  </li>
            <li>Your skin will love it,  worth every penny,  don&#x27;t think twice :)</li>
            <li>so the sun was plenty strong but this held up to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good customer service from Amazon and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>the TiZO3 was far and away better, smoother, more comfortable, and effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly easy to spread and leaves my skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>Also good for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Light weight and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is light and silky on your face and leaves a smooth matte finish.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy and fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>even thought this product feels light</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and not at all</li>
            <li>Goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li>This product gives my skin a smooth look.</li>
            <li>My husband must wear sunscreen on his face but complains mightily about his eyes stinging when he sweats.  </li>
            <li>it has a wrinkles smooth agent.</li>
            <li>It is a joy to find a product that will protect my skin as well as look terrific.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and covers some discoloration.</li>
            <li>The product feels smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>so the feel is important to me.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>It goes on silky smooth, blends well with my medium light skin tone.</li>
            <li>Smooth and covers evenly.  </li>
            <li>It is so smooth and blends in with any skin color.</li>
            <li>But this sunscreen is fantastic for me.</li>
            <li>It has a light tint so you can forego the foundation.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get sticky and its lightly tinted so u can skip the foundation if you want.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth and silky texture and glides on.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Again, my It-girl pal in Pasadena recommended this to me for days when you just want a light coverage and some SPF sun protection.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth, almost matte finish to it.  </li>
            <li>It is light and shear on your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s satiiny, light and not oily.</li>
            <li>Sun protection and smooth look.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great make up element for me that I forget about the screen block</li>
            <li>Since childhood, I&#x27;ve struggled to enjoy the outdoors without getting burned or developing skin damage.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, after apply tizo 3, My face Looks even, I will continue to by this product product is not cheap</li>
            <li>You get the sum block with the the smooth face feel.</li>
            <li>Such a great sun block</li>
            <li>on smooth... try it...</li>
            <li>So I looked at the ingredients and realized the reason why this sunscreen feels so silky smooth is because it&#x27;s loaded with silicone.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to see if this product really provides excellent sun protection only because I haven&#x27;t been out in the sun with it</li>
            <li>(I am fair and actually the #3 is ok</li>
            <li>/&gt;Meanwhile, I&#x27;m delighted to know there&#x27;s a product which I can (and do) use on my young red-headed daughter to reduce her risk of skin damage from the sun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Meanwhile, I&#x27;m delighted to know there&#x27;s a product which I can (and do) use on my young red-headed daughter to reduce her risk of skin damage from the sun.</li>
            <li>Used daily, this tube  lasts a good 2 to 3 month, or more.  </li>
            <li>This product contains titanium dioxide and zinc oxide which seem to be the best protection against the sun; I find it does protect my face and while there are many products out there, Tizo acts to smooth skin, it seems to even skin tone and it doesn&#x27;t feel or look like a thick layer of makeup.  </li>
            <li>When I was a child, effective sunscreens weren&#x27;t available (other than Zinc Oxide which, while effective, isn&#x27;t exactly appealing to use).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this sunscreen works best when moisturizer is applied to the face first, otherwise, it tends to be very dry</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin you may need some powder on top or  T-Zone.&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena has a new mineral sunscreen what is also worth to try for like 11$ :) Neutrogena has a make-up \\&quot;Healthy skin\\&quot; who has mineral sunscreen in it, titanium dioxide, SPF 20, not bed at all, medium-full coverage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i highly rate this product for all ages and use on the top of your hands when you are in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;enjoy and love your body!&lt;br /&gt;karen</li>
            <li>This lightly tinted product  smooths on evenly,  feels light and fresh on the skin, lasts all day, and is easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent excellent cream I only wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li>Nothing like the original formula</li>
            <li>It does have a slight tint so if you are very fair then go with the tint-less.  </li>
            <li>every single day and not have a problem, this sunscreen would be great for you.  </li>
            <li>That is what is so special about it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great at concealing dark spots and fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is so hard to find sunscreen with PA+ ratings in the US, so I am very happy to find this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an extra gentle sunscreen with a beautiful matte finish that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Well, the tinted version blended into my skin seamlessly and it felt amazing.  </li>
            <li>Overall it seems good.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s easy to remove at the end of the day, amazingly it&#x27;s still protecting my skin, with a simple makeup wipe.</li>
            <li>I order this product regularly through Amazon Prime, it&#x27;s always shipped quickly and in good shape when I get it.</li>
            <li>Excellent stuff, the only sunscreen I have ever used that did not clog pores...goes on like very sheer matte makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone that wants a light smooth coverage for all year coverage.</li>
            <li>The mild tinting allows me to often go without foundation.</li>
            <li>I gradually added a lot of the white (testing along the way) and the final shade is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a defective tube once and they quickly sent out a replacement.</li>
            <li>it blends right in, even when applying a significant amount.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for fair and sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>Works great even in extreme sun!</li>
            <li>My skin looks beautiful and natural with this   product and it&#x27;s being protected from the sun at the same time!   </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and most sunscreens</li>
            <li>Not greasy like other SPF lotions, but works amazingly!</li>
            <li>that is a first!</li>
            <li>The slight tint helps give my skin a more even tone and a nice glow.</li>
            <li>and it provides great coverage for my uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>It is amazing  have used if for over a year daily</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and the tint is so much better than white.</li>
            <li>I used Tizo for 2 summers and think it is a worth it sunscreen.</li>
            <li>My favorite still so far is the La Roche Posay line.</li>
            <li>As soon as you use the product,you know it is a quality&lt;br /&gt;facial formula and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Took awhile to get it from the distributor but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sneak into smile lines, etc.</li>
            <li>if you like the more natural look.  </li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>If you wear makeup and use a primer kind of like (Smashbox Photo Finish or similar dimethicone primers)</li>
            <li>I love this product more than other primers I have used.  </li>
            <li>This is the facial sunscreen of the rich and famous.</li>
            <li>Blends right in while evening out skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It has the right ingredients for sun protection.</li>
            <li>Am I receiving the right product?</li>
            <li>This will never get in your eyes; you can even rub it right on your eyelids.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Great coverage, but doesn&#x27;t turn &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; on your face...and... takes very little to do the trick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really smooth and silky, not thick or greasy.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is light to medium as far as if you want to use this sunscreen for the replacement of BB cream or cream foundation, but it helps my skin to look healthy and natural.  </li>
            <li>A bit dark for my fair skin</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy this product again!</li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller for getting it to me quickly.</li>
            <li>, we used an organic self tanner so that we didn&#x27;t get color on our face and that was a great alternative to exposing our facial skin too damaging the sunrays that will later create spots and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth, silky and looks very natural (it has a tan color to it).  </li>
            <li>they are not very cosmetically elegant!  </li>
            <li>It feels so soft and blend right into my skin covering marks and blemishes like a light foundation.</li>
            <li>so it looks very much like a good-looking make up.</li>
            <li>This is a very responsible seller.</li>
            <li>It makes the smooth skin and keeps natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>An added bonus is that it is tinted so much that I do not use foundation!</li>
            <li>First time I didn&#x27;t get a sunburn while teaching swimming in the summer.</li>
            <li>My plastic surgeon recommended this in HIS office, so of course I was interested.  </li>
            <li>and I found that it kept my skin matte for most of day which was a big bonus!</li>
            <li>And I appreciated the seller&#x27;s prompt shipping!</li>
            <li>the first couple days, it felt alright.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>She did very comprehensive research and chose this Tizo product over all the others!  </li>
            <li>My first time trying it a</li>
            <li>Bought same through aesthetician and it was a much better experience.</li>
            <li>First of all it does not take a lot to custom blend.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on, and I use it as a primer for foundation (which I only use in the T zone).  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty weightless.</li>
            <li>First thing to know:  </li>
            <li>The nurse at my Dermatologist&#x27;s office recommended it and after the first time of using it I am hooked......</li>
            <li>From one fair skinned sun lover to another, you can trust this stuff and wear it everyday and not end up looking like Magda (Something About Mary).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and I love the slight color tint that I didn&#x27;t even know it had.</li>
            <li>can also tell you that this cream really works because we both got some burn right along the hairline and wear our hair parts</li>
            <li>very sillicone-y and glides right on.</li>
            <li>It has this very strong silicone feeling (smooth but slick)</li>
            <li>It is smooth, feels kind of like a thick makeup primer.</li>
            <li>However, the tint is light and barely noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and feel very good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works great, just HARD to find this stuff!</li>
            <li>I live in SW Florida, sun is hot &amp; bright year-round - as a FL native, I&#x27;ve had enough sun exposure to last me a lifetime -</li>
            <li>I have read mixed reviews on dimethicone - this seems to be what makes it so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>And, this product is far, far better than even any high end foundation.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!!  </li>
            <li>then again I&#x27;m not a full face of makeup kind of girl).</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that can break out even with the most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; makeups and I have not had that problem with this product for the last 2 months of use.</li>
            <li>I wish it were cheaper, but I&#x27;ll pay up to I guess $40 since it&#x27;s been so hard to find a good &#x27;screen.</li>
            <li>Such amazing sun protection and no smell or white face issues.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just used too much, but when I would scratch my face or move some hair away that had drifted onto my forehead or something</li>
            <li>so light weight  last all day</li>
            <li>And it really protects my face.</li>
            <li>Very waterproof...</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t give you that plastic look that regular sunscreen does.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>After being in the water for 5 hours straight Tizo3 didn&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore it.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommend ..!</li>
            <li>Minus Sol, which i also love, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and works very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what this does, but each time I wear it people have said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Derm said that with chem sunscreen, you really have to use so much quantity that it is impractical on oilier skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Received this fast.</li>
            <li>Do not buy this if you want the real Tizo 3.</li>
            <li>Because has color you don&#x27;t have to use to much foundation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a surf bum that had to grow up and be responsible.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and productive was just as promised.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>this really works.</li>
            <li>HOW MUCH THIS HELPS WITH&lt;br /&gt;THE SUN</li>
            <li>I am of medium complexion and it matches me really well.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely couldn&#x27;t imagine doing without it.</li>
            <li>The tint on the cream is reasonable.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m out for the whole day, I&#x27;ll reapply before mid-day.</li>
            <li>fast service&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than my dermatologist</li>
            <li>Very waterproof and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Feels very velvety on your skin.</li>
            <li>and I used it because I had just returned from Kauai (didn&#x27;t use sunblock) and was going to spend a few hours at the beach at my house on a really warm day.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wear standard foundations any more - my skin has become too sensitive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lately, for the past week, I&#x27;ve just been wearing this, liquid concealer over blemishes, and translucent de-slick powder, and I look better than I do with a full face of makeup (in my opinion...</li>
            <li>, It glides on far more smoothely than traditional sun screens, does not run in the heat, and gives your face a finished look even with no make-up on.</li>
            <li>The tint will not cover like a foundation, but it does offset the white cast, help me see where I need to apply more, and give me a little bit of a more normal looking complexion so I don&#x27;t look like a ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I especially appreciate the friendly and speedy service.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve probably sold more of this than the company has spent to advertise it!  </li>
            <li>she has)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have worn this with nothing on top (not even powder) on the weekend which I would never have done with other products as everything makes me too shiny.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t makeup coverage, just a light tint which gives you a summer glow all year long.   </li>
            <li>To make it last longer, I snip the bottom off the tube and apply with my finger, using a small binder clip to close, this way you get the most from the tube, and there is ALOT left after you can&#x27;t squeeze any out of the top!</li>
            <li>i love it, it&#x27;s ligth and has tinted color, this doesn&#x27;t mean it will work as a makeup, but it&#x27;s way better than having a white sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I love the slight tint and wear it all the time.  </li>
            <li>I grew up not using sunscreen and now that I am in my middle forties, I regret it for so many obvious reasons.</li>
            <li>main issue is the pricing is all over the place here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This was my main selling point since I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Most the time they focus only on the product but a product can be different from skin to skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only make-up with mineral sunscreen I found on the market, big brends has no mineral sunscreen, decent brend like Neutrogena has it :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised that everyone doesn&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s as high as $40 as well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Upon seeing this highly reviewed product on Amazon, I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am highly sensitive/allergic to fragrances, and it has no scent at all.  </li>
            <li>and it was highly recommended by a cosmetic surgeon.</li>
            <li>He said he highly recommended it.  </li>
            <li>to high of cost for amount of product</li>
            <li>However could have a little more moisture in it.</li>
            <li>Love this product even if is a little pricey.</li>
            <li>Love that it is tinted for just a little coverage.</li>
            <li>No breakouts, very water and sweat resistant, a little goes a long way, goes on very smooth and silky!</li>
            <li>but so far it has worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I use this daily for facial sunscreen, but it goes on silky smooth and really acts like a primer for makeup.  </li>
            <li>As far as the UV protection working.. who the hell really knows if it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job...</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, if you are combination-dry your fine and the cream dry clear also.</li>
            <li>It is a challenge to remove from your face, but worth the extra washing for the sun and skin protection.</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t know if it comes in any other colors, but the color that I have is a bit dark for my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and does not make me breakout like other solar-protection creams.  </li>
            <li>I live in Oregon and even with a bit of a tan from summer</li>
            <li>I live in florida and</li>
            <li>My new fave.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this.  </li>
            <li>The light tint gives a bit of visible coverage, but it is a great base for everything.  </li>
            <li>Nice texture; covers with a subtle tint.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has absolutely no bluish or white cast, just melts into the skin, leaving it looking velvety and more even.</li>
            <li>Last summer we traveled to S. Africa where the sun is intense and there&#x27;s less ozone so greater risk of UV exposure.</li>
            <li>, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It has the right balance of SPF and mineral tint in it to make my near translucent skin look like it got some summer on it without actually getting summer on it.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is extremely expensive but it is amazing!</li>
            <li>No NDC#, no product logo, tube wasn&#x27;t the same and the quality of the product is not the same as the original TIZO3.  </li>
            <li>The description looks the same and the item does look similar to the original product, but I have  been buying TIZO3 for a 2 years</li>
            <li>Although it is dark it rubs in and just leaves a smooth, matte finish.  </li>
            <li>This sun screen gives more protection from the sun that ordinary MECHANICAL sun blocks.  </li>
            <li>(If I had not known this, I would have been sure it was defective or dried out when I got it!)</li>
            <li>will note that this was recommended to me because my prior (chemical) sunscreen, although a factor 25 and used consistently, was not getting the job done</li>
            <li>Gram 1 7]]&lt;br /&gt;The first day back on Eltamd&#x27;s product, and my face feels rejuvenated again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a lighter sheer coverage but that is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the slight tint.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and smoothly, not streaky or lumpy like others.</li>
            <li>you look down on the screen for a special notice for residents of California.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>B002MSN3QQ Eltamd Clear SPF 48</li>
            <li>Otherwise it practically blends in with any skin tone clearly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a clear and a tinted cream.  </li>
            <li>When I mentioned this the seller IMMEDIATELY offered to return it for the clear.  </li>
            <li>This product is not heavy and serves two purposes.  </li>
            <li>It covers and protects my face with SPF 40 with a natural barrier rather than chemicals.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and spend a lot of time at the gym &#x3D; sweating.  </li>
            <li>Before I leave the gym after a workout, when my pours are open and most vulnerable I can apply this sun block -- it goes on smoothly with stinging or burning.  </li>
            <li>but it seems to completely disappear.</li>
            <li>Offers mineral protection with a soft matte velvety finish.</li>
            <li>look so young</li>
            <li>A physical sunscreen like this allows you to apply a reasonable amount and it will work.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy and protects from the sun.</li>
            <li>This works well on my sensitive nose at all day</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive and oil skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not messy.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and oily skin prone to break outs</li>
            <li>And so far, it doesn&#x27;t irritate or break out my sensitive</li>
            <li>It has completely replaced my foundation.  </li>
            <li>One application will usually last me a whole day of activities like gardening or going to the pool.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re sensitive to silicone, stay away from this.  </li>
            <li>but once you apply to your face it evens out your skin tone and provides a wonderful base for your make up foundation.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it, especially if you live in a hot climate.</li>
            <li>Proposition 65 entitles California consumers to special warnings for products that contain chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm if those products expose consumers to such chemicals above certain threshold levels.</li>
            <li>I have tried expensive products meant for faces only and haven&#x27;t been able to find one with all the key elements like this stuff: odorless, non-greasy, water resistant, chemical free, UVA &amp; B full spectrum, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>For another tip, if you are looking for serious sun care, you may want to combine this in the morning with reapplying a mineral powder with good SPF after lunch, to maintain the SPF all day as everything wears off and it is not realistic that you want to reapply a lotion midway through the day (that is per my derm as well!</li>
            <li>The reason for the tint is apparently because otherwise the minerals are too light and you get that old zinc/titanium dioxide pale color so with this the tint makes it so it is not whitish at all on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that are highly recommended on skincareaddiction and similar sites.</li>
            <li>More recently, I&#x27;ve found that the mineral-based suncreens are less likely to cause the pain and irritation--but more often than not they&#x27;re thick, pasty and so white that I look like I&#x27;m wearing make-up for a kabuki play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Usually it&#x27;s just this sunscreen and a light mineral powder I put on for the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I am over 65, live in a hot/sunny climate and am outside a lot, play tennis, etc., and prone to skin cancer.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product for everyday and especially for women athletes.</li>
            <li>(So I alternate with the other one my derm suggested, the Skinceuticals fusion, tinted, which is liquidy and also great except it is a little little bit whitish</li>
            <li>Little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>It definitely sits on top of the skin, but that&#x27;s expected due to the type and design of the physical blockers (ZO and TiO2) in the formula.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Persistent or bioaccumulative and moderate to high toxicity concern in humans, from Environment Canada Domestic Substance List</li>
            <li>long lasting not drying to skin very protective even when swimming  </li>
            <li>I can order the clear next time.  </li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin and eyes and have struggled to find a daily sunscreen-</li>
            <li>Also, I love that it&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t clog pores or, worse, give me acne.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I am wearing a heavy foundation, while it smooths out slight skin variations making me look more polished.</li>
            <li>No, the tint doesn&#x27;t act as a concealer, it just avoids the white residue that many sunscreens leave behind.</li>
            <li>My face feels  moist and not dry or sticky with this.  </li>
            <li>The price of the product and shipping made it approximately the same price as purchasing it from the surgeon, but it was much more convenient to purchase it on-line.  </li>
            <li>I live in South Florida and use sunscreen every single day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a physical sunscreen that wouldn&#x27;t leave a horrible white cast on my skin, and I thought the reviews here were too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>It was undetectable out of the tube, or when first applying it, but after a few minutes I began to notice the smell</li>
            <li>Good product, but very expensive.</li>
            <li>I need to use a moisturizer underneath it since I live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li>If my face is slightly dry like during the winter, it will dry too much on my face, leaving lines I can see.</li>
            <li>It has a slight tint to it but doesn&#x27;t show unless you put too much.</li>
            <li>I did sample this at my derm&#x27;s office, and was able to take home a small sample to try for a few days.  </li>
            <li>The Tizo Solar is super thick and goes on like mud.</li>
            <li>m 35 years old, female, and have a combination oily and sometimes dry skin.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product!  </li>

            <li> This is the BEST suncreen product available!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen because it goes on flawlessly and the hint of time means that I don&#x27;t have to wear foundation or powder.  </li>
            <li> This product is good for your skin and makes it look great too.  </li>
            <li> I was delighted to find that Tizo3 provided great</li>
            <li> Excellent product,  there&#x27;s nothing better than this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> An awesome sunscreen, matte and easy to use.</li>
            <li> However if you are very fair, there is a formula for very light skin.</li>
            <li> Looks great on its own too.  </li>
            <li> a lot so need good protection.</li>
            <li> but it looked good on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a trip to Florida, so I could skip makeup and get good sunscreen coverage.  </li>
            <li> Tizo protects while it leaves my skin looking and feeling good.  </li>
            <li> - good ideas</li>
            <li> It has a nice feel and great sun protection, SPF 40.</li>
            <li> This item did not apply or feel good on my skin</li>
            <li> and I used it before in fair, when purchased from my dermatologists office.</li>
            <li> No greasy, and offer good protection was recommended by my dermatology Doctor.</li>
            <li> Otherwise good coverage.</li>
            <li> it goes on light and is perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and leaves skin looking and feeling great!!</li>
            <li> This is ideal on top of your moisturizer and underneath your powder,  </li>
            <li> It does have a silicone type feel upon application but the coverage is so good</li>
            <li> I m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, just not for my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best sunscreen I have come across , has a nice matte finish , great coverage and does not make me break out !</li>
            <li> The formula is very light weight and is great under makeup.</li>
            <li> BUT I am very glad I have</li>

            <li> Great protection, silky smooth and a nice amount of coverage</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Also it seemed to be kind of cakey.  </li>
            <li> This was really nice.   </li>
            <li> This sunblock is the absolute best.  </li>
            <li> You make up foundation does not go on nicely</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even nice if you don&#x27;t want to put makeup over it.</li>
            <li> I will say it did blend well and had a nice finish at the end that wasn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> It honestly makes wearing sunscreen and remembering to wear it a non issue because any applications over it improves wearability.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s kind on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this to be an effective sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tinted and blends nicely into your skin.</li>
            <li> The nice part about the tint is blends with your skin color.</li>
            <li> It really evens out my skin tone while providing the best sun protection.</li>
            <li> it gives you a nice tinted look and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> I have had two precancerous lesions (and brown spots) burned off because we did not have this kind of sunscreen when I was growing</li>
            <li> It is absolutely the one best thing that keeps my rosacea under control!  </li>
            <li> Best protection ever is very silky and can be used as foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also really effective.</li>
            <li> Tinted, but blends nicely into your own skin color.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and this company, MD Skin Solutions, offeres great customer service.</li>

            <li> I LOVE TIZO.  </li>
            <li> Tizo tinted sunscreen is my favorite.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>

            <li> I love it because it appears like the lightest makeup.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I just love it.  </li>
            <li> I work in the sun with my job most of the time and</li>
            <li> this gives me added protection from the sun plus it is tinted, which is why I love it.  </li>

            <li> Plus, stays put in summer heat unlike most foundation.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it goes on .</li>
            <li> I could get on the roof top and give a speech about these Solar products (see my review for Solar Protection Formula Tinted Concealer also).  </li>
            <li> And the sooner the better.  </li>
            <li> b/c I spread it and use it mostly as primer.)&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> it is more like a foundation.  </li>
            <li> Check to see if the shade by itself is ok.  </li>
            <li> But most of all you will save yourself from skin damage.</li>
            <li> In the summer, this is all I use, the coverage is outstanding, and I have NEVER gotten a burn no matter if I am swimming, kayaking or biking.  </li>

            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I bought the tinted which I really love.  </li>
            <li> It is also the first product that has not given me a reaction of any kind in ages - I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
            <li> I will order more when I run out.  </li>
            <li> I was so pleased to find this product.  </li>
            <li> Better deal than buying at my dermatologists office.</li>
            <li> For darker skin use more.  </li>
            <li> Those that I have told and tried it, love it too.</li>

            <li> I was pleased with the on-line company as well.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Excellent sun protection and has the same texture as a medium weight doundation.</li>
            <li> This is a truly elegant and non-greasy, silky matte sunscreen, but I wish they used \\&quot; tinted\\&quot; in the description.</li>
            <li> my mom uses it and if she asks for more i guess she likes it</li>
            <li> This sunscreen feels very soft on my skin and the tint blends beautifully.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the best colored clean SPF I have found so far.</li>
            <li> nice light brown hue, good sun protection, not irritating.</li>
            <li> It glides on easily, it looks good and not pasty with just the right tint,and it protects well.</li>
            <li> First, the Amazon part was great, good price, shipped quickly, the product was exactly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> this has a more velvetty texture that just allows my makeup to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It works really well and is truly a good product.  </li>
            <li> Cool!</li>
            <li> For people who are allergic to CHEMICAL sunscreens, this offeres the best protction from the sun other than staying in doors.</li>
            <li> It went on easily and although I do not wear foundation make up</li>
            <li> It feels like butter when I apply it to my skin and spreads evenly; easily.</li>

            <li> I have rosacea and my skin doesnt accept the creams so easy.</li>
            <li> Because it does not come off easily, I can sweat or swim with confidence.</li>
            <li> Easily soaks into your skin.  </li>
            <li> Your skin will love it,  worth every penny,  don&#x27;t think twice :)</li>
            <li> so the sun was plenty strong but this held up to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good customer service from Amazon and I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly easy to spread and leaves my skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> Also good for very sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> It is light and silky on your face and leaves a smooth matte finish.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy and fragrance free.  </li>

            <li> Goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li> This product gives my skin a smooth look.</li>
            <li> My husband must wear sunscreen on his face but complains mightily about his eyes stinging when he sweats.  </li>
            <li> it has a wrinkles smooth agent.</li>
            <li> It is a joy to find a product that will protect my skin as well as look terrific.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and covers some discoloration.</li>
            <li> The product feels smooth on my skin.</li>

            <li> This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Again, my It-girl pal in Pasadena recommended this to me for days when you just want a light coverage and some SPF sun protection.</li>
            <li> It has a smooth, almost matte finish to it.  </li>
            <li> It is light and shear on your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s satiiny, light and not oily.</li>
            <li> Sun protection and smooth look.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great make up element for me that I forget about the screen block</li>
            <li> Since childhood, I&#x27;ve struggled to enjoy the outdoors without getting burned or developing skin damage.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, after apply tizo 3, My face Looks even, I will continue to by this product product is not cheap</li>
            <li> You get the sum block with the the smooth face feel.</li>
            <li> Such a great sun block</li>
            <li> on smooth... try it...</li>
            <li> So I looked at the ingredients and realized the reason why this sunscreen feels so silky smooth is because it&#x27;s loaded with silicone.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to see if this product really provides excellent sun protection only because I haven&#x27;t been out in the sun with it</li>
            <li> (I am fair and actually the #3 is ok</li>
            <li> /&gt;Meanwhile, I&#x27;m delighted to know there&#x27;s a product which I can (and do) use on my young red-headed daughter to reduce her risk of skin damage from the sun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Meanwhile, I&#x27;m delighted to know there&#x27;s a product which I can (and do) use on my young red-headed daughter to reduce her risk of skin damage from the sun.</li>
            <li> Used daily, this tube  lasts a good 2 to 3 month, or more.  </li>
            <li> This product contains titanium dioxide and zinc oxide which seem to be the best protection against the sun; I find it does protect my face and while there are many products out there, Tizo acts to smooth skin, it seems to even skin tone and it doesn&#x27;t feel or look like a thick layer of makeup.  </li>
            <li> When I was a child, effective sunscreens weren&#x27;t available (other than Zinc Oxide which, while effective, isn&#x27;t exactly appealing to use).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this sunscreen works best when moisturizer is applied to the face first, otherwise, it tends to be very dry</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin you may need some powder on top or  T-Zone.&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena has a new mineral sunscreen what is also worth to try for like 11$ :) Neutrogena has a make-up \\&quot;Healthy skin\\&quot; who has mineral sunscreen in it, titanium dioxide, SPF 20, not bed at all, medium-full coverage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i highly rate this product for all ages and use on the top of your hands when you are in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;enjoy and love your body!&lt;br /&gt;karen</li>
            <li> This lightly tinted product  smooths on evenly,  feels light and fresh on the skin, lasts all day, and is easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent excellent cream I only wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the original formula</li>
            <li> It does have a slight tint so if you are very fair then go with the tint-less.  </li>
            <li> every single day and not have a problem, this sunscreen would be great for you.  </li>
            <li> That is what is so special about it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great at concealing dark spots and fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find sunscreen with PA+ ratings in the US, so I am very happy to find this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an extra gentle sunscreen with a beautiful matte finish that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Well, the tinted version blended into my skin seamlessly and it felt amazing.  </li>
            <li> Overall it seems good.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s easy to remove at the end of the day, amazingly it&#x27;s still protecting my skin, with a simple makeup wipe.</li>
            <li> I order this product regularly through Amazon Prime, it&#x27;s always shipped quickly and in good shape when I get it.</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff, the only sunscreen I have ever used that did not clog pores...goes on like very sheer matte makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone that wants a light smooth coverage for all year coverage.</li>
            <li> The mild tinting allows me to often go without foundation.</li>
            <li> I gradually added a lot of the white (testing along the way) and the final shade is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a defective tube once and they quickly sent out a replacement.</li>
            <li> it blends right in, even when applying a significant amount.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for fair and sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> Works great even in extreme sun!</li>
            <li> My skin looks beautiful and natural with this   product and it&#x27;s being protected from the sun at the same time!   </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and most sunscreens</li>
            <li> Not greasy like other SPF lotions, but works amazingly!</li>
            <li> that is a first!</li>
            <li> The slight tint helps give my skin a more even tone and a nice glow.</li>
            <li> and it provides great coverage for my uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> It is amazing  have used if for over a year daily</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and the tint is so much better than white.</li>
            <li> I used Tizo for 2 summers and think it is a worth it sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My favorite still so far is the La Roche Posay line.</li>
            <li> As soon as you use the product,you know it is a quality&lt;br /&gt;facial formula and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to get it from the distributor but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sneak into smile lines, etc.</li>
            <li> if you like the more natural look.  </li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> If you wear makeup and use a primer kind of like (Smashbox Photo Finish or similar dimethicone primers)</li>
            <li> I love this product more than other primers I have used.  </li>
            <li> This is the facial sunscreen of the rich and famous.</li>
            <li> Blends right in while evening out skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It has the right ingredients for sun protection.</li>
            <li> Am I receiving the right product?</li>
            <li> This will never get in your eyes; you can even rub it right on your eyelids.</li>
            <li> It goes on light and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, but doesn&#x27;t turn &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; on your face...and... takes very little to do the trick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really smooth and silky, not thick or greasy.  </li>
            <li> The coverage is light to medium as far as if you want to use this sunscreen for the replacement of BB cream or cream foundation, but it helps my skin to look healthy and natural.  </li>
            <li> A bit dark for my fair skin</li>
            <li> I would certainly buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Thanks to the seller for getting it to me quickly.</li>
            <li> , we used an organic self tanner so that we didn&#x27;t get color on our face and that was a great alternative to exposing our facial skin too damaging the sunrays that will later create spots and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth, silky and looks very natural (it has a tan color to it).  </li>
            <li> they are not very cosmetically elegant!  </li>
            <li> It feels so soft and blend right into my skin covering marks and blemishes like a light foundation.</li>
            <li> so it looks very much like a good-looking make up.</li>
            <li> This is a very responsible seller.</li>
            <li> It makes the smooth skin and keeps natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> An added bonus is that it is tinted so much that I do not use foundation!</li>
            <li> First time I didn&#x27;t get a sunburn while teaching swimming in the summer.</li>
            <li> My plastic surgeon recommended this in HIS office, so of course I was interested.  </li>
            <li> and I found that it kept my skin matte for most of day which was a big bonus!</li>
            <li> And I appreciated the seller&#x27;s prompt shipping!</li>
            <li> the first couple days, it felt alright.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> She did very comprehensive research and chose this Tizo product over all the others!  </li>
            <li> My first time trying it a</li>
            <li> Bought same through aesthetician and it was a much better experience.</li>
            <li> First of all it does not take a lot to custom blend.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on, and I use it as a primer for foundation (which I only use in the T zone).  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty weightless.</li>
            <li> First thing to know:  </li>
            <li> The nurse at my Dermatologist&#x27;s office recommended it and after the first time of using it I am hooked......</li>
            <li> From one fair skinned sun lover to another, you can trust this stuff and wear it everyday and not end up looking like Magda (Something About Mary).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and I love the slight color tint that I didn&#x27;t even know it had.</li>
            <li> can also tell you that this cream really works because we both got some burn right along the hairline and wear our hair parts</li>
            <li> very sillicone-y and glides right on.</li>
            <li> It has this very strong silicone feeling (smooth but slick)</li>
            <li> It is smooth, feels kind of like a thick makeup primer.</li>
            <li> However, the tint is light and barely noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and feel very good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works great, just HARD to find this stuff!</li>
            <li> I live in SW Florida, sun is hot &amp; bright year-round - as a FL native, I&#x27;ve had enough sun exposure to last me a lifetime -</li>
            <li> I have read mixed reviews on dimethicone - this seems to be what makes it so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> And, this product is far, far better than even any high end foundation.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!!  </li>
            <li> then again I&#x27;m not a full face of makeup kind of girl).</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that can break out even with the most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; makeups and I have not had that problem with this product for the last 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> I wish it were cheaper, but I&#x27;ll pay up to I guess $40 since it&#x27;s been so hard to find a good &#x27;screen.</li>
            <li> Such amazing sun protection and no smell or white face issues.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just used too much, but when I would scratch my face or move some hair away that had drifted onto my forehead or something</li>
            <li> so light weight  last all day</li>
            <li> And it really protects my face.</li>
            <li> Very waterproof...</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t give you that plastic look that regular sunscreen does.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> After being in the water for 5 hours straight Tizo3 didn&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore it.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommend ..!</li>
            <li> Minus Sol, which i also love, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and works very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what this does, but each time I wear it people have said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Derm said that with chem sunscreen, you really have to use so much quantity that it is impractical on oilier skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Received this fast.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this if you want the real Tizo 3.</li>
            <li> Because has color you don&#x27;t have to use to much foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a surf bum that had to grow up and be responsible.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and productive was just as promised.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> this really works.</li>
            <li> HOW MUCH THIS HELPS WITH&lt;br /&gt;THE SUN</li>
            <li> I am of medium complexion and it matches me really well.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely couldn&#x27;t imagine doing without it.</li>
            <li> The tint on the cream is reasonable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m out for the whole day, I&#x27;ll reapply before mid-day.</li>
            <li> fast service&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than my dermatologist</li>
            <li> Very waterproof and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Feels very velvety on your skin.</li>
            <li> and I used it because I had just returned from Kauai (didn&#x27;t use sunblock) and was going to spend a few hours at the beach at my house on a really warm day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear standard foundations any more - my skin has become too sensitive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lately, for the past week, I&#x27;ve just been wearing this, liquid concealer over blemishes, and translucent de-slick powder, and I look better than I do with a full face of makeup (in my opinion...</li>
            <li> , It glides on far more smoothely than traditional sun screens, does not run in the heat, and gives your face a finished look even with no make-up on.</li>
            <li> The tint will not cover like a foundation, but it does offset the white cast, help me see where I need to apply more, and give me a little bit of a more normal looking complexion so I don&#x27;t look like a ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate the friendly and speedy service.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve probably sold more of this than the company has spent to advertise it!  </li>
            <li> she has)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have worn this with nothing on top (not even powder) on the weekend which I would never have done with other products as everything makes me too shiny.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t makeup coverage, just a light tint which gives you a summer glow all year long.   </li>
            <li> To make it last longer, I snip the bottom off the tube and apply with my finger, using a small binder clip to close, this way you get the most from the tube, and there is ALOT left after you can&#x27;t squeeze any out of the top!</li>
            <li> i love it, it&#x27;s ligth and has tinted color, this doesn&#x27;t mean it will work as a makeup, but it&#x27;s way better than having a white sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love the slight tint and wear it all the time.  </li>
            <li> I grew up not using sunscreen and now that I am in my middle forties, I regret it for so many obvious reasons.</li>
            <li> main issue is the pricing is all over the place here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This was my main selling point since I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Most the time they focus only on the product but a product can be different from skin to skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only make-up with mineral sunscreen I found on the market, big brends has no mineral sunscreen, decent brend like Neutrogena has it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised that everyone doesn&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s as high as $40 as well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Upon seeing this highly reviewed product on Amazon, I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am highly sensitive/allergic to fragrances, and it has no scent at all.  </li>
            <li> and it was highly recommended by a cosmetic surgeon.</li>
            <li> He said he highly recommended it.  </li>
            <li> to high of cost for amount of product</li>
            <li> However could have a little more moisture in it.</li>
            <li> Love this product even if is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Love that it is tinted for just a little coverage.</li>
            <li> No breakouts, very water and sweat resistant, a little goes a long way, goes on very smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> but so far it has worked very well.  </li>
            <li> I use this daily for facial sunscreen, but it goes on silky smooth and really acts like a primer for makeup.  </li>
            <li> As far as the UV protection working.. who the hell really knows if it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job...</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you are combination-dry your fine and the cream dry clear also.</li>
            <li> It is a challenge to remove from your face, but worth the extra washing for the sun and skin protection.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t know if it comes in any other colors, but the color that I have is a bit dark for my fair skin.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and does not make me breakout like other solar-protection creams.  </li>
            <li> I live in Oregon and even with a bit of a tan from summer</li>
            <li> I live in florida and</li>
            <li> My new fave.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this.  </li>
            <li> The light tint gives a bit of visible coverage, but it is a great base for everything.  </li>
            <li> Nice texture; covers with a subtle tint.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has absolutely no bluish or white cast, just melts into the skin, leaving it looking velvety and more even.</li>
            <li> Last summer we traveled to S. Africa where the sun is intense and there&#x27;s less ozone so greater risk of UV exposure.</li>
            <li> , I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It has the right balance of SPF and mineral tint in it to make my near translucent skin look like it got some summer on it without actually getting summer on it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is extremely expensive but it is amazing!</li>
            <li> No NDC#, no product logo, tube wasn&#x27;t the same and the quality of the product is not the same as the original TIZO3.  </li>
            <li> The description looks the same and the item does look similar to the original product, but I have  been buying TIZO3 for a 2 years</li>
            <li> Although it is dark it rubs in and just leaves a smooth, matte finish.  </li>
            <li> This sun screen gives more protection from the sun that ordinary MECHANICAL sun blocks.  </li>
            <li> (If I had not known this, I would have been sure it was defective or dried out when I got it!)</li>
            <li> will note that this was recommended to me because my prior (chemical) sunscreen, although a factor 25 and used consistently, was not getting the job done</li>
            <li> Gram 1 7]]&lt;br /&gt;The first day back on Eltamd&#x27;s product, and my face feels rejuvenated again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a lighter sheer coverage but that is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the slight tint.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and smoothly, not streaky or lumpy like others.</li>
            <li> you look down on the screen for a special notice for residents of California.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> B002MSN3QQ Eltamd Clear SPF 48</li>
            <li> Otherwise it practically blends in with any skin tone clearly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a clear and a tinted cream.  </li>
            <li> When I mentioned this the seller IMMEDIATELY offered to return it for the clear.  </li>
            <li> This product is not heavy and serves two purposes.  </li>
            <li> It covers and protects my face with SPF 40 with a natural barrier rather than chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and spend a lot of time at the gym &#x3D; sweating.  </li>
            <li> Before I leave the gym after a workout, when my pours are open and most vulnerable I can apply this sun block -- it goes on smoothly with stinging or burning.  </li>
            <li> but it seems to completely disappear.</li>
            <li> Offers mineral protection with a soft matte velvety finish.</li>
            <li> look so young</li>
            <li> A physical sunscreen like this allows you to apply a reasonable amount and it will work.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy and protects from the sun.</li>
            <li> This works well on my sensitive nose at all day</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive and oil skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and oily skin prone to break outs</li>
            <li> And so far, it doesn&#x27;t irritate or break out my sensitive</li>
            <li> It has completely replaced my foundation.  </li>
            <li> One application will usually last me a whole day of activities like gardening or going to the pool.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re sensitive to silicone, stay away from this.  </li>
            <li> but once you apply to your face it evens out your skin tone and provides a wonderful base for your make up foundation.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it, especially if you live in a hot climate.</li>
            <li> Proposition 65 entitles California consumers to special warnings for products that contain chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm if those products expose consumers to such chemicals above certain threshold levels.</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive products meant for faces only and haven&#x27;t been able to find one with all the key elements like this stuff: odorless, non-greasy, water resistant, chemical free, UVA &amp; B full spectrum, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> For another tip, if you are looking for serious sun care, you may want to combine this in the morning with reapplying a mineral powder with good SPF after lunch, to maintain the SPF all day as everything wears off and it is not realistic that you want to reapply a lotion midway through the day (that is per my derm as well!</li>
            <li> The reason for the tint is apparently because otherwise the minerals are too light and you get that old zinc/titanium dioxide pale color so with this the tint makes it so it is not whitish at all on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that are highly recommended on skincareaddiction and similar sites.</li>
            <li> More recently, I&#x27;ve found that the mineral-based suncreens are less likely to cause the pain and irritation--but more often than not they&#x27;re thick, pasty and so white that I look like I&#x27;m wearing make-up for a kabuki play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually it&#x27;s just this sunscreen and a light mineral powder I put on for the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I am over 65, live in a hot/sunny climate and am outside a lot, play tennis, etc., and prone to skin cancer.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product for everyday and especially for women athletes.</li>
            <li> (So I alternate with the other one my derm suggested, the Skinceuticals fusion, tinted, which is liquidy and also great except it is a little little bit whitish</li>
            <li> Little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> It definitely sits on top of the skin, but that&#x27;s expected due to the type and design of the physical blockers (ZO and TiO2) in the formula.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Persistent or bioaccumulative and moderate to high toxicity concern in humans, from Environment Canada Domestic Substance List</li>
            <li> long lasting not drying to skin very protective even when swimming  </li>
            <li> I can order the clear next time.  </li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and eyes and have struggled to find a daily sunscreen-</li>
            <li> Also, I love that it&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t clog pores or, worse, give me acne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I am wearing a heavy foundation, while it smooths out slight skin variations making me look more polished.</li>
            <li> No, the tint doesn&#x27;t act as a concealer, it just avoids the white residue that many sunscreens leave behind.</li>
            <li> My face feels  moist and not dry or sticky with this.  </li>
            <li> The price of the product and shipping made it approximately the same price as purchasing it from the surgeon, but it was much more convenient to purchase it on-line.  </li>
            <li> I live in South Florida and use sunscreen every single day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a physical sunscreen that wouldn&#x27;t leave a horrible white cast on my skin, and I thought the reviews here were too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> It was undetectable out of the tube, or when first applying it, but after a few minutes I began to notice the smell</li>
            <li> Good product, but very expensive.</li>
            <li> I need to use a moisturizer underneath it since I live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> If my face is slightly dry like during the winter, it will dry too much on my face, leaving lines I can see.</li>
            <li> It has a slight tint to it but doesn&#x27;t show unless you put too much.</li>
            <li> I did sample this at my derm&#x27;s office, and was able to take home a small sample to try for a few days.  </li>
            <li> The Tizo Solar is super thick and goes on like mud.</li>
            <li> m 35 years old, female, and have a combination oily and sometimes dry skin.</li>
            <li> tint appears very brown when it comes out of the tube, but once on my pale (NC15ish) skin</li>
            <li> Just the right coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel thick or greasy.  </li>
            <li> Although this product is a little pricey, it really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Outdoors everyday at high altitude and have not burned a bit.</li>
            <li> , only complaint is it&#x27;s a little light for my skin in summer.</li>
            <li> The color of sunscreen seems shockingly dark when I put it on my face, however it completely matches my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping it works for long term sun exposure in addition to just daily under make up.  </li>
            <li> I apply a thin layer all over my face and neck, and wait a few more minutes before going out.  </li>
            <li> A bit thicker than some other more expensive brands</li>
            <li> Plus the tinted cream offers a little coverage.</li>
            <li> I was in the direct sun for over 2+ hours and came home a little nervous that I had been out too long.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I will even wear it all winter long under my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Delivery took a bit too long on this one</li>
            <li> I wear it all summer long.</li>
            <li> Matte all day long.  </li>
            <li> understand that finding a daily sunscreen for us ladies is impossible for many of us.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would make my dry skin even more dry</li>
            <li> Anyway, I don&#x27;t typically wear liquid or cream foundation, but I do wear bare minerals</li>
            <li> I usually sweat so much that other sunscreens rub off and run into my eyes.</li>
            <li> Also if you put it on several times a day, it can form little flakes since it&#x27;s a physical block.  </li>
            <li> One tube goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It works as a great base or primer if you still need to cover up little spots like me.  </li>
            <li> The other thing is that even though it&#x27;s only a 1.5 oz.</li>
            <li> Goes on and feels different from all other sunscreens I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Put it on before you go out and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> It slides on so nice...feels almost dry as you rub it on.  </li>
            <li> have pale Irish skin with freckles and recently had a bit of basal cell carcinoma removed from my nose.  </li>
            <li> - I use a cover every single morning before I leave the house</li>
            <li> Only complaints would be that it&#x27;s too dark for my skin tone in the winter</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 in stead of 5 stars is it is too dark for my complexion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sheer and matte but this product is just way to dark.</li>
            <li> greasy - in fact it seems dry!</li>
            <li> I especially like the slight tint that it has.  </li>
            <li> I found it on Amazon for about half of what my local Spa sells it.</li>
            <li> here is what I&#x27;ve learned: Solar makes a few products and it was confusing to me at first about which one to get...</li>
            <li> I find one tube lasts me several months--longer in the winter when I apply less often.</li>
            <li> This one is very dry and you can&#x27;t feel it on the skin.</li>
            <li> my face started to feel very dry and cracked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried (talking to you, LRP) and is not nearly as sticky or shiny as other sunscreens (Elta)</li>
            <li> It is less expensive than purchasing there, especially without tax and delivery fees, and it is fresh product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s complete coverage along with a little bit of tint to hide those little lines on the face.  </li>
            <li> It actually has a little tent as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This can be hard to find, and the Cotz Face Natural Skin Tone seems to be identical, so....</li>
            <li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t use more of this type of product in my teens.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> This does not run when wet, does not migrate to the eyes.  </li>
            <li> They will send you the old regular Tizo, the wrong size tube, and it will not feel the same as you&#x27;re used to.</li>
            <li> SYSTEM TOXICITY (NON-REPRODUCTIVE)&lt;br /&gt;Classified as expected to be toxic or harmful, from</li>
            <li> and my face does not even get pink.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t wet and greasy, so makeup works well with it.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s relatively pricey, you really do only need a small amount (a bit larger than a pea--maybe a small grape) to cover your face.</li>
            <li> In young adulthood when effective sunscreens came on the market, I was saddened to discover that they caused the skin on my face to redden and cause miserable irritation and pain.</li>
            <li> I have pale but yellow skin tone</li>
            <li> Also, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> tube, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It stays on extremely well through exercise and swimming activities.</li>
            <li> Unlike other sunscreens, it won&#x27;t run into your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I also feels it stay on my face a lot longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Sunblock usually feels so gross and sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to other SPF lotions.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cake like other sunscreens or burn.</li>
            <li> It goes on like foundation, lasts longer than almost any other sunscreen and covers the UVA and UVB spectrums.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It goes on with a matte finish, and because it&#x27;s tinted, it doesn&#x27;t leave a ghostly residue like other Zinc based products.</li>
            <li> It does blur things out--as do other items on the market now.  </li>
            <li> : This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The other product I got is the Solar Protection Formula Tinted Concealer.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely water-resistant.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like silicone-heavy products (primers, foundations, etc.), but this is different.</li>
            <li> It is usually greasy, white and it smells.  </li>
            <li> Perspiration doesn&#x27;t leave streaks like other tinted sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I presumed she was just trying to sell me some overpriced cosmetic just as gloppy and whitening as any other mineral sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I do feel like my face is a little dry when using it</li>
            <li> this is too dark for my skin.</li>
            <li> So when it comes out, you may think it&#x27;s going to be too dark, but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It comes out dark brown.</li>
            <li> It is not useful as a concealer as it blends so well with your skin color.</li>
            <li> The shade in the bottle is too dark for me</li>
            <li> but it comes with two tubes....white and dark.  </li>
            <li> and even with a hat, I was finding spotty areas where my sunscreen \\&quot;missed\\&quot; - Getting sunburned is not fun.  </li>
            <li> Also the color is too dark for my skin, about MAC NC30-35.</li>
            <li> I have lent it to friends with lighter complexion and it was too dark.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I&#x27;m sad it doesn&#x27;t appear among those recommended by the Environmental Working Group, I&#x27;d rather risk some unknown, undocumented adverse event than risk a specific, identified risk (skin cancer) for which I know I&#x27;m at increased risk (because of prior sun burns and family</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 20 different sunscreens and this is a winner.</li>
            <li> I wear this sunscreen every day and, even though the tube is small, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I suppose I could use it over my whole body, but I use less expensive products elsewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think that even though I have dry skin this product seemed to leave me with a greasy residue I did not enjoy!</li>
            <li> It goes on like silk and absorbs quickly never leaving a, &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly tinted, brownish gray, but does not affect my skin tone.</li>
            <li> so the mere fact that I still use this one year later makes a big statement.  </li>
            <li> Slight color.</li>
            <li> But I found it on Amazon for a lot less.</li>
            <li> For skin, use less.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews</li>
            <li> Not a good thing when hugging my boyfriend while he&#x27;s wearing a white shirt!  </li>
            <li> I walk dogs all day long and because of this protective shield over my face, I don&#x27;t have to be bothered anymore with uncomfortable, floppy, big hats!</li>
            <li> so I look a little orange.  </li>
            <li> It has a little tint to it.</li>
            <li> It says it doesn&#x27;t, and I won&#x27;t say it is making my break out, but it does seem to sort of fill into pores and maybe stick in there a little.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this product - she goes on Missionary trips in fairly brutal climates and her skin looks lovely</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will add a little water to my finger as I apply the product.</li>
            <li> Helps a little bit.</li>
            <li> I wear a little mineral powder over it.</li>
            <li> It gives a little bit of coverage, but seems to make your skin look softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> And, also it can feels a little heavy.</li>
            <li> Looks very dark, but seems to adjust to your skin tone when applied.</li>
            <li> It looks very dark when you put some on your finger</li>
            <li> and it was pretty unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> or I will get killed.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday instead of foundation.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday under my makeup or all alone.</li>
            <li> I bought this item hoping it would cover without using heavy make up during the summer.</li>
            <li> I used it a few years ago and didn&#x27;t like it and then decided to give it another try.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Year &#x27;round.  </li>
            <li> Now you might think this is a lot of trouble and it would be easier to just buy an over the counter foundation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an everyday, everywhere sunblock</li>
            <li> but, after a few seconds on the skin it smooths out evenly.  </li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me a few years ago because I have rosacea.  </li>
            <li> This product works well as a light base.  </li>
            <li> Covers uneven tones.</li>
            <li> Covers and protects your skin without feeling greasy, heavy or runny.</li>
            <li> my 7 year old said I looked weird when I had this on, because my face looked \\&quot;too brown.\\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not for everyone because it&#x27;s so thick, but it is my primer, sunscreen &amp; foundation (on days that I&#x27;m rushed), all-in-one.  </li>
            <li> It blend in when I have  tan and when I am pale.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pale</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly pale and</li>
            <li> Little tint to it to even out skin tones!</li>
            <li> Please get down the price!!</li>
            <li> Lastly, it had a weird metallic smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Not many products can make that claim.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> The tint is pointless with this product because it blends into nothing.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why because everyone raves about the silky texture that is not supposed to clog pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used inthe past,</li>
            <li> and I have used it on my face every day for the past two years.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive which is why I use it only on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all of the expensive stuff-faces only products to wear every day</li>
            <li> I usually have break outs</li>
            <li> It is not like foundation at all, but it mattifies just enough for some casual use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product seemed very very heavy.  </li>
            <li> My facialist recommended this to me because I was putting sunscreen lotion and liquid makeup on my face which seemed very heavy..  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m very pale)</li>
            <li> If you have very pale skin I would recommend the one with out the tint.  </li>
            <li> but it is hard to take off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe that everybody doesn&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> Mineral sunscreen is so hard to find, but it makes all the difference for me in protecting my face from sun spots.</li>
            <li> My skin change all the time thats why I have so hard to finde</li>
            <li> I have been using the Tizo3 formula for at least 4 years</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchased and used since Late September (1 month ago)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, not greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked wearing sunscreen (lots of freckles to prove it).</li>
            <li> I guess I will continue my research and continue to use this product in the mean time.</li>
            <li> A little expensive though.</li>
            <li> unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tired it yet out at the beach or pool</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t irritating to the skin and because it&#x27;s mineral based</li>
            <li> It is thick, I feel uncomfortable to use it and it was not as it was explained to me when I order it.</li>
            <li> It goes on similarly too make up base or cc cream.  </li>
            <li> sunscreen, while it worked, was making my skin look so much older, and when I did some research I discovered that Dimethicone is a horribly aging product.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed as this product is all it claims to be except for this ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;NEUROTOXICITY&lt;br /&gt;Strong evidence of human neurotoxicity, Chemicals known to be neurotoxic to humans&lt;</li>
            <li> So I knew it comes out of the tube the consistency of paste, and appears to be a weird color.  </li>
            <li> Authentication or batch quality questionable.</li>
            <li> Sorry to see people pulling these tricks online.</li>
            <li> I use Tizo3 every day, without fail.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Since it was my mistake for ordering the wrong thing I did not exchange it.  </li>
            <li> Item sent to me looks like a fake!</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> and some say it&#x27;s bad for you.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t transfer to clothing as badly as some others with tint</li>
            <li> I hated, and I mean HATED, all sun protection creams on my face, until I found this one.  </li>
            <li> Wear it as a base under my powder as a foundation.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this product I no longer use a base make up creme.  </li>
            <li> I hate lotion on my skin except this and it blends in with my skin color.</li>
            <li> Works like a primer and doesn&#x27;t smell terrible like some do.</li>
            <li> But then it clogged my pores and made me break out horribly.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife swears by iit so I have to give it 5 stars or I will get killed.</li>
            <li> it says facial mineral fusion but when i got it it is something else.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to see if this product really provides excellent sun protection only because I haven&#x27;t been out in the sun with it so I can&#x27;t vouch for the effectiveness in that manner, but I have used it a couple times since getting it from an aesthetician as an alternative to foundation so my review is just based on that aspect.  Anyway, I don&#x27;t typically wear liquid or cream foundation, but I do wear bare minerals face powders to help with shine and evenness.  This product seemed very very heavy.  I could feel it on my face all day, whereas the mineral powders I use are virtually weightless.  Also it seemed to be kind of cakey.  Maybe I just used too much, but when I would scratch my face or move some hair away that had drifted onto my forehead or something, I would see this product on my fingertips and under my nails.  Gross!!  Not to mention anytime my face would brush up against something there would be an obvious \\&quot;makeup streak\\&quot; where my face had been.  Not a good thing when hugging my boyfriend while he&#x27;s wearing a white shirt!  Lastly, it had a weird metallic smell to it.  It was undetectable out of the tube, or when first applying it, but after a few minutes I began to notice the smell and it was pretty unpleasant.  My boyfriend even said he could smell the stuff on me.  Not quite the aura I like to emit.  Also, I don&#x27;t know if it comes in any other colors, but the color that I have is a bit dark for my fair skin.  Kinda orangey.  I think if you&#x27;re trying for an alternative to greasy goopy sunblock, I might suggest the many powder sunscreens that are on the market now instead of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE TIZO.  Ever since my derm gave me a sample years ago, I&#x27;ve been buying it regularly.  For oily skin, nothing beats the texture and matte-effect of this.  Only complaints would be that it&#x27;s too dark for my skin tone in the winter (I&#x27;m very pale) so I look a little orange.  I was thinking of buying Tizo2 (which is white) and mixing them together for the winter to solve that problem.  Also if you put it on several times a day, it can form little flakes since it&#x27;s a physical block.  But In the summer it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Item sent to me looks like a fake! No NDC#, no product logo, tube wasn&#x27;t the same and the quality of the product is not the same as the original TIZO3.  The description looks the same and the item does look similar to the original product, but I have  been buying TIZO3 for a 2 years and I know their product well.</li>
            <li> Tizo tinted sunscreen is my favorite. It stays on extremely well through exercise and swimming activities. Plus the tinted cream offers a little coverage. I wear it everyday instead of foundation. It is a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> great.  so light weight  last all day</li>
            <li> Wear it as a base under my powder as a foundation. Although it is dark it rubs in and just leaves a smooth, matte finish.  I love this product more than other primers I have used.  Can definitely tell it shields my face from rays. My skin has actually lightened since I have used it.  Works great even in extreme sun!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist.  It is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  Our family spends a lot of time at the beach.  I can put this sunscreen on only once or twice during the entire day and I never burn.  Put it on before you go out and let it dry.  You won&#x27;t sweat it off!  Unlike other sunscreens, it won&#x27;t run into your eyes.  Also, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Tizo3 formula for at least 4 years and I love it.  My facialist recommended this to me because I was putting sunscreen lotion and liquid makeup on my face which seemed very heavy..  This product is not heavy and serves two purposes.  I know my face is protected and I love the skin tone it gives me when I have it on.  I also feels it stay on my face a lot longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  I will never use anything this else.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tinted sunscreen I have found yet.  I wear it on weekends when I am out hiking and never worry about it melting off and it provides great coverage for my uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. I use it on my face whenever I play tennis and golf. It has a matte finish so it looks very much like a good-looking make up. And it really protects my face.</li>
            <li> I live in Oregon and even with a bit of a tan from summer this is too dark for my skin. I&#x27;m still on the hunt for the perfect daily face sunscreen. Luckily I am able to return it no problem.</li>
            <li> Great product.....goes on like silk and also replaces my foundation</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff, the only sunscreen I have ever used that did not clog pores...goes on like very sheer matte makeup. Works great, just HARD to find this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Very waterproof... In my opinion best sunscreen for beach days&#x27;</li>
            <li> If you are a woman, buy this sun screen now.  Buy.it.now.&lt;br /&gt;This product actually makes your skin look flawless, and its invisible.  I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but its great.  I now wear it as foundation.  I live in florida and the staying power of this sunscreen is amazing, even at the beach.</li>
            <li> I grew up not using sunscreen and now that I am in my middle forties, I regret it for so many obvious reasons. A friend gave me her Tizo 3 spf 40 and I used it because I had just returned from Kauai (didn&#x27;t use sunblock) and was going to spend a few hours at the beach at my house on a really warm day. I decided that I better get my act together and put on Tizo 3. It went on easily and although I do not wear foundation make up, I was not bothered by the tint or the feel of it at all. Sunblock usually feels so gross and sticky. This was really nice.   I was in the direct sun for over 2+ hours and came home a little nervous that I had been out too long. You would have never known I was out yesterday. My face looks as if it did before I went to the beach. AMAZING STUFF!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sun protection product I have found.  Not greasy. I use it everyday under my makeup or all alone.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It&#x27;s light weight, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and the tint is so much better than white.</li>
            <li> love, goes on smooth, matches my skin and most of all i know it protect from the sun rays than you tizo</li>
            <li> Light weight and goes on smooth.  Blends right in while evening out skin tone.  Provides really great sun protection too.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is the absolute best.  It is light and silky on your face and leaves a smooth matte finish.  The perfect face sunblock worn alone or under makeup...it feels kind of like a primer, it makes your face feel smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt.  Not greasy and fragrance free.  The reviewer who gave it 1 star is not correct...even thought this product feels light it gives great protection.  That is what is so special about it. It isn&#x27;t makeup coverage, just a light tint which gives you a summer glow all year long.   Plus, great waterproof, all day protection.  I would buy it by the case if I could.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but I wish it came in a larger container. I live in South Florida and use sunscreen every single day. Goes on smooth and not at all greasy - in fact it seems dry! Stays on well too.</li>
            <li> like it but it is hard to take off. need to use makeup remover or scrubbie when using soap and water.</li>
            <li> I bougth it for my mother in law; she is in her sixties and she loves it since the sweat she is suffering with the menopausia, didn&#x27;t affect her sun block.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and eyes and have struggled to find a daily sunscreen- this is it!  It works great, feels great, and does not irritate AT ALL.  No, the tint doesn&#x27;t act as a concealer, it just avoids the white residue that many sunscreens leave behind.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, goes on like a BB cream and smoothes the skin. Looks very dark, but seems to adjust to your skin tone when applied. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This creme color was brown but changed no color in the skin soon. It makes the smooth skin and keeps natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the great product. I have been using this product for years. It gives my skin a healthy glow while blocking the sun... i like the idea of putting minerals on my face as sunblock also. I especially appreciate the friendly and speedy service.</li>
            <li> Best lotion, foundation, sunblock combo ever.  Not greasy like other SPF lotions, but works amazingly! I love this lotion.  I&#x27;m allergic to other SPF lotions. I can&#x27;t use them on my face with every pore burning when I sweat.  This lotion is perfect. No burning at all and I don&#x27;t get burnt.  It&#x27;s hard to believe that everybody doesn&#x27;t use this product. It feels so soft and blend right into my skin covering marks and blemishes like a light foundation. It blend in when I have  tan and when I am pale.  It just matches my skin no matter what shade It is.  It is an amazing product. Thank you Tizo Solar Protection Formula, Facial Mineral Fusion SPF 40!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like the one I get from the Dermatologist&#x27;s office. I love it because it doesn&#x27;t leave my face shiny. It goes on like silk and absorbs quickly never leaving a, &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> I have used this product religiously for about 5 years now. I love the protection on my face (even in Winter). It feels like butter when I apply it to my skin and spreads evenly; easily. It doesn&#x27;t cake like other sunscreens or burn. An added bonus is that it is tinted so much that I do not use foundation!</li>
            <li> Great product and works awesome!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It covers and protects my face with SPF 40 with a natural barrier rather than chemicals. AND it blocks out UVA AND UVB rays! Not many products can make that claim. The tint is also great, because it helps me block out the rays of the sun without looking washed out and ghost-like! My friend who worked in the skin-care industry for over 20 years and has flawless skin recommended this and it was a great recommendation.</li>
            <li> Since you have to wear sunscreen every day you want to make sure you are getting the best coverage UVA and UVB.  The problem with many of the ones you find on the shelf ant the stores....they are not very cosmetically elegant!  You make up foundation does not go on nicely and you get frusturated.  Well the is the one for you!&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the TIZO3 because it has a tint in it.  It looks very dark when you put some on your finger but once you apply to your face it evens out your skin tone and provides a wonderful base for your make up foundation.  If you have very pale skin I would recommend the one with out the tint.  Im very fair but have some red in my skiin so I prefer the tint.</li>
            <li> Excellent great product. Price was very good and the product always meets expectations. Will buy it again with no doubts.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and spend a lot of time at the gym &#x3D; sweating.  Before I leave the gym after a workout, when my pours are open and most vulnerable I can apply this sun block -- it goes on smoothly with stinging or burning.  It has a nice waxy feeling going on, spreads as easily  as butter but never oily, I really love it. I keep a tube in my car and at home.  I learned of it while having a facial at Evolutions(a Spa in Santa Barbara, CA)it&#x27;s applied at the end of the facial.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several seasons and it is wonderful to use along with your makeup. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t give you that plastic look that regular sunscreen does. One tube goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Product was recommended by the plastic surgeon who performed closure on face after Mohr&#x27;s surgery. It is less expensive than purchasing there, especially without tax and delivery fees, and it is fresh product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and absolutely love it!  It goes on smooth and does not make me breakout like other solar-protection creams.  Can&#x27;t live without it!!  Use it daily after washing my face in the morning.  Bonus - you don&#x27;t need makeup since it&#x27;s tinted!!  Love, love, love my Tizo</li>
            <li> I hatge the lotion type sunblocks. This one is very dry and you can&#x27;t feel it on the skin. Cool!</li>
            <li> Always the best and a great primer!</li>
            <li> Endorsed by my dermatologist. Love the tint and the feel. It&#x27;s even nice if you don&#x27;t want to put makeup over it.</li>
            <li> Not greasy. Goes on so smooth. Love it. Will definitely be ordering this again, and again, and again, and again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! My sister recommended it to me. Thanks to the seller for getting it to me quickly. Would definitely recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this product I no longer use a base make up creme.  It covers evenly and makes a physical barrier agains sun damage.</li>
            <li> I use the product every day and love it, it protects my skin and adds a silky coat to it.  Just FAB.</li>
            <li> yes, it was delivered on time. I have used this for a long time. I even wear this instead of make-up. It has a little tint to it. and protection. What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 years &amp; it&#x27;s the best out there!  no odor....which I love.  my detmotologist recommended this prodoct.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Stays put, doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes and it is tinted. I reorder on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I bought this item hoping it would cover without using heavy make up during the summer. It does not. It goes on super light, which is great. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> This sun screen gives more protection from the sun that ordinary MECHANICAL sun blocks.  For people who are allergic to CHEMICAL sunscreens, this offeres the best protction from the sun other than staying in doors.</li>
            <li> Best face sunscreen I have tried!  I am extremely pale so I was worried about the tint but it seems to completely disappear. It slides on so nice...feels almost dry as you rub it on.  I was afraid it would make my dry skin even more dry but so far it has worked very well.  It&#x27;s like a primer for your foundation and makes it so easy to apply.  Looks great on its own too.  I haven&#x27;t tired it yet out at the beach or pool so I&#x27;m hoping it works for long term sun exposure in addition to just daily under make up.  I have read mixed reviews on dimethicone - this seems to be what makes it so easy to apply.  Some say it&#x27;s great and some say it&#x27;s bad for you.  I guess I will continue my research and continue to use this product in the mean time.</li>
            <li> It goes on like foundation, lasts longer than almost any other sunscreen and covers the UVA and UVB spectrums.&lt;br /&gt;This is my favourite sunscreen for my face.</li>
            <li> This product gives my skin a smooth look. It has a matte finish which diminishes the appearances of lines. All of this plus an SPF of 40&lt;br /&gt;makes this one product I will continue to use and recommend.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years. I really like it. I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot so need good protection. I feel it does cost a lot.</li>
            <li> Love this sunblock. Stays on all day to protect my face from age spots. I use to love the sun but now I need to hide from it.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen ever.  I&#x27;m a scuba diver and always apply sunscreen.  Many products may cause my eyes to burn even with my face mask, Tizo sunscreen doesn&#x27;t.  I love the slight tint and wear it all the time.  My dermatologist recommended the product and I&#x27;ve been hooked for 4 years now.</li>
            <li> I used Tizo for 2 summers and think it is a worth it sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different tinted sunscreens for the face for years. My favorite still so far is the La Roche Posay line. The Tizo Solar is super thick and goes on like mud. The tint is pointless with this product because it blends into nothing. I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the side of my face I had applied the sunscreen to and the side I hadn&#x27;t. I used quite a bit to make sure I had coverage but still I noticed no difference. I will say it did blend well and had a nice finish at the end that wasn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this daily for facial sunscreen, but it goes on silky smooth and really acts like a primer for makeup.  I always have a second tube as I would never want to run out.</li>
            <li> So do my children and husband.  It&#x27;s the only one anyone will wear regularly.  After it&#x27;s applied it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not even there.  The skin still breathes, no odor, no greasy shine or feel and it does NOT sting the eyes.  I apply it all around my eyes, even on my eyelids.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> My husband must wear sunscreen on his face but complains mightily about his eyes stinging when he sweats.  Therefore he will not wear it.  This does not run when wet, does not migrate to the eyes.  Perfect.  I love it because it appears like the lightest makeup.  Next, to convert our daughter who must wear sunscreeen because of a medical condition.</li>
            <li> After being in the water for 5 hours straight Tizo3 didn&#x27;t come off. First time I didn&#x27;t get a sunburn while teaching swimming in the summer. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> My plastic surgeon recommended this in HIS office, so of course I was interested.  Price was the same, but I didn&#x27;t get it while I was there, so Amazon is just as easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s tinted.  So when it comes out, you may think it&#x27;s going to be too dark, but it isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s peeeerfect.  Glides on like silk and doesn&#x27;t cake up around my eyes or nose or deep lines.  I absolutely adore it.  No problems with breaking out or reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pale Irish skin with freckles and recently had a bit of basal cell carcinoma removed from my nose.  Covers over the scar beautifully!  Can&#x27;t say enough about this sunscreen!  I will even wear it all winter long under my makeup.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The only reason I gave it 4 in stead of 5 stars is it is too dark for my complexion. However, I did what another reviewer suggested with the Tizo 2 and mix the two together and it works great. Love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me and I just love it.  I work in the sun with my job most of the time and this gives me added protection from the sun plus it is tinted, which is why I love it.  I use regular sunscreen under my foundation and then I use this on top of that in the most needed places.</li>
            <li> great protection and spotless skin. it has a wrinkles smooth agent. i use it  with bare minerals and obtain a perfect complexion.</li>
            <li> This breaks my skin out for some reason. I am not sure why because everyone raves about the silky texture that is not supposed to clog pores. I used it a few years ago and didn&#x27;t like it and then decided to give it another try. Oh well, guess it just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I like to use on my face. It goes on with a matte finish, and because it&#x27;s tinted, it doesn&#x27;t leave a ghostly residue like other Zinc based products. Usually it&#x27;s just this sunscreen and a light mineral powder I put on for the day. Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sheer and matte but this product is just way to dark. I&#x27;m a MAC shade NC25 . It comes out dark brown.</li>
            <li> A bit dark for my fair skin</li>
            <li> long lasting not drying to skin very protective even when swimming  I love it</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sunscreen I have come across , has a nice matte finish , great coverage and does not make me break out ! Highly Recommend ..!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing formula. Offers mineral protection with a soft matte velvety finish. Perfect for the face in hot weather and under makeup. Once you put this on, it litterally feels like you&#x27;re wearing nothing. This is better than the drugstore formulas that make the &amp;#34;Best Of&amp;#34; list. I&#x27;ve used inthe past, Minus Sol, which i also love, but this has a more velvetty texture that just allows my makeup to go on smoothly. It&#x27;s slightly tinted, brownish gray, but does not affect my skin tone. However if you are very fair, there is a formula for very light skin. I received the sample at my chiropractor&#x27;s office of all places and absolutely loved it, was so glad to find it was main stream and on Amazon. It honestly makes wearing sunscreen and remembering to wear it a non issue because any applications over it improves wearability.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen feels very soft on my skin and the tint blends beautifully.  It is a joy to find a product that will protect my skin as well as look terrific.</li>
            <li> not only a beautiful foundation but the best in sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;i highly rate this product for all ages and use on the top of your hands when you are in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;enjoy and love your body!&lt;br /&gt;karen</li>
            <li> I love the creamy feel this product has.  It&#x27;s smooth and I love the slight color tint that I didn&#x27;t even know it had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for year&#x27;s, on the recommendation of my dermatologist.  I think it&#x27;s the best of it&#x27;s kind on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this to be an effective sunscreen.  It isn&#x27;t irritating to the skin and because it&#x27;s mineral based I like it better than more chemical sunscreens.  My only dissatisfaction is that it leaves your skin looking a bit chalky.  It might be possible to add some liquid makeup to it but I don&#x27;t know if that would interfere with it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and works very well. The tinting didn&#x27;t look like it would match but it looked good on.</li>
            <li> It is thick, I feel uncomfortable to use it and it was not as it was explained to me when I order it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a trip to Florida, so I could skip makeup and get good sunscreen coverage.  I am now going to use this every summer, it was perfect!  I have oily skin and I found that it kept my skin matte for most of day which was a big bonus!</li>
            <li> Tizo3 sun protection was recommended by my dermatologist after skin cancer surgery and I have used it on my face every day for the past two years.  I am over 65, live in a hot/sunny climate and am outside a lot, play tennis, etc., and prone to skin cancer.  Tizo protects while it leaves my skin looking and feeling good.  I especially like the slight tint that it has.  The extra plus is that at check-up time, my doctor finds nothing on my face that warrants treatment.  A result of regular use of this excellent product, I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li> It is a tinted sunscreen.  It stays on even around the pool and the color evens out my skin under foundation</li>
            <li> Love it. it keeps me moist all day and the tint covers my imperfections. What more could I ask for.</li>
            <li> I hated, and I mean HATED, all sun protection creams on my face, until I found this one.  My aesthetician used it on me and I had to have it. The light tint gives a bit of visible coverage, but it is a great base for everything.  My face feels  moist and not dry or sticky with this.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and don&#x27;t plan to give it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main issue is the pricing is all over the place here on Amazon.  The last I bought was $21 and this one is $26 plus shipping.  And it&#x27;s as high as $40 as well.  (The last one I bought - that seller is now selling for $40.) SO I changed sellers.</li>
            <li> It is amazing  have used if for over a year daily</li>
            <li> I love this product. Such amazing sun protection and no smell or white face issues. It&#x27;s tinted and blends nicely into your skin. I won&#x27;t use anything else on my face.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this sunscreen!  I have tried every face sunscreen imaginable and this sunscreen is by far the best.  No breakouts, very water and sweat resistant, a little goes a long way, goes on very smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> Great product. Thank you</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what this does, but each time I wear it people have said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin looks like a 20 year-olds.  How?  (I&#x27;m 44.)&lt;br /&gt;You look so young--what did you do?  I have had no plastic surgery, botox, fillers.  Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People never said this to me before wearing this!  So I&#x27;ve probably sold more of this than the company has spent to advertise it!  It does blur things out--as do other items on the market now.  This also has some color, but the reason I purchased it was for the mineral sunscreen.  It&#x27;s one-stop shopping.  Great product!  Buying more!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent excellent cream I only wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. I had acne and melasma my doctor prescribed this one to me. It dries all the oil in my face and I&#x27;m glad for it. Please get down the price!!</li>
            <li> First, the Amazon part was great, good price, shipped quickly, the product was exactly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the product.  I did sample this at my derm&#x27;s office, and was able to take home a small sample to try for a few days.  So I knew it comes out of the tube the consistency of paste, and appears to be a weird color.  (If I had not known this, I would have been sure it was defective or dried out when I got it!) But wow when you blend it in it is silky/velvety and blends perfectly! The reason for the tint is apparently because otherwise the minerals are too light and you get that old zinc/titanium dioxide pale color so with this the tint makes it so it is not whitish at all on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that this was recommended to me because my prior (chemical) sunscreen, although a factor 25 and used consistently, was not getting the job done and my melasma was coming back.  Derm said that with chem sunscreen, you really have to use so much quantity that it is impractical on oilier skin. A physical sunscreen like this allows you to apply a reasonable amount and it will work.  For another tip, if you are looking for serious sun care, you may want to combine this in the morning with reapplying a mineral powder with good SPF after lunch, to maintain the SPF all day as everything wears off and it is not realistic that you want to reapply a lotion midway through the day (that is per my derm as well! - good ideas she has)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have worn this with nothing on top (not even powder) on the weekend which I would never have done with other products as everything makes me too shiny.  It is not like foundation at all, but it mattifies just enough for some casual use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is good, and would be perfect except that (1) it pulls up flakiness on my skin a bit when I apply it and (2) it seems to plug my pores a bit.  It says it doesn&#x27;t, and I won&#x27;t say it is making my break out, but it does seem to sort of fill into pores and maybe stick in there a little. That is probably TMI.  (So I alternate with the other one my derm suggested, the Skinceuticals fusion, tinted, which is liquidy and also great except it is a little little bit whitish and I need to put some mineral foundation over it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about two months, and it is working on my sun protection issue.</li>
            <li> Great poduct. Goes on smooth and covers some discoloration. Feels great. The nice part about the tint is blends with your skin color. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone that wants a light smooth coverage for all year coverage.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to apply to your face and it drys immediately!  As soon as you use the product,you know it is a quality&lt;br /&gt;facial formula and well worth the price. I would certainly buy this product again!</li>
            <li> If you notice there is not a list of ingredients&lt;br /&gt;if you look down on the screen for a special notice for residents of California.&lt;br /&gt;You would have read the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;California&#x27;s Proposition 65 entitles California consumers to special warnings for products that contain chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm if those products expose consumers to such chemicals above certain threshold levels. We care about our customers&#x27; safety and hope that the information below helps with your buying decisions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are providing the following warning for products linked to this page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was getting close to buying this product until I saw the above. It&#x27;s up to you.&lt;br /&gt;I understand that finding a daily sunscreen for us ladies is impossible for many of us.&lt;br /&gt; They make us break out, or they feel goopy all day on our faces. they sometime&#x27;s don&#x27;e&lt;br /&gt;work with make up etc, etc....&lt;br /&gt;but please think, more than once before buying.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tizo 3 for 5 years. My dermatologist in Boca Raton recommend it because I play tennis. I usually sweat so much that other sunscreens rub off and run into my eyes. This one doesn&#x27;t! And it doesn&#x27;t turn your face white either. I like that is tinted a skin tone color but I wish they made shades.</li>
            <li> Love the matte finish. I need to use a moisturizer underneath it since I live in a very dry climate. This product would be perfect in a humid environment.</li>
            <li> The product feels smooth on my skin. I use sunscreen every day of the year so the feel is important to me. And I appreciated the seller&#x27;s prompt shipping! Thanks. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wear this every day. It has a nice feel and great sun protection, SPF 40. Recommend to anyone that spends time outdoors.</li>
            <li> It is tinted, but I am fair skinned and it is perfect! It really evens out my skin tone while providing the best sun protection. Great under make-up.  A must have!</li>
            <li> Upon seeing this highly reviewed product on Amazon, I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased and used since Late September (1 month ago)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression: it&#x27;s more pasty and tinted than I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;For the first couple days, it felt alright.&lt;br /&gt;Then my face started to feel very dry and cracked.&lt;br /&gt;I started using my body moisturizer instead sometimes to breathe some life back into my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go back to Eltamd&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002MSN3QQ Eltamd Clear SPF 48 Gram 1 7]]&lt;br /&gt;The first day back on Eltamd&#x27;s product, and my face feels rejuvenated again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s my skin type or the air or climate. This is my experience. YMMY</li>
            <li> Just the right coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel thick or greasy.  Leaves my face feeling smooth and silky.  Outdoors everyday at high altitude and have not burned a bit.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily with ad without makeup. It goes on silky smooth, blends well with my medium light skin tone. I don&#x27;t feel like I am wearing a heavy foundation, while it smooths out slight skin variations making me look more polished. It is not useful as a concealer as it blends so well with your skin color. I have very sensitive skin that can break out even with the most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; makeups and I have not had that problem with this product for the last 2 months of use. So glad I found it!</li>
            <li> The product helped me get over a rash I got from being allergic to perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that it&#x27;s tinted and protects my face from the Florida sun.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff.  I used this one day and the following day used a sunscreen lotion (50 spf) suggested by my dermatologist-- the TiZO3 was far and away better, smoother, more comfortable, and effective.</li>
            <li> Stay away from all sunscreens with Dimethicone. (and all silicones) If you are in your 20&#x27;s or 30&#x27;s you may not see it yet, but dimethicone will age your skin, as it doesn&#x27;t let it breathe.&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen, while it worked, was making my skin look so much older, and when I did some research I discovered that Dimethicone is a horribly aging product.&lt;br /&gt;You will be doing your skin a favor by not putting silicones on it.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I&#x27;m getting both sunscreen and foundation cream all in one.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of years now and like it better than anything else I have found.  It has the right ingredients for sun protection.</li>
            <li> Delivery took a bit too long on this one</li>
            <li> It is smooth, feels kind of like a thick makeup primer. I do feel like my face is a little dry when using it but it&#x27;s the best colored clean SPF I have found so far.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this product - she goes on Missionary trips in fairly brutal climates and her skin looks lovely - it protects her. She did very comprehensive research and chose this Tizo product over all the others!  I walk dogs all day long and because of this protective shield over my face, I don&#x27;t have to be bothered anymore with uncomfortable, floppy, big hats!</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin. The mild tinting allows me to often go without foundation.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial sunscreen I have ever used.  It&#x27;s tinted so no whiteness.  It&#x27;s really smooth and silky, not thick or greasy.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The best sunblock I have found, goes on matt and stays that way ALL day. No shine and it replaces foundation, which I hate.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this sunscreen!!</li>
            <li> It was perfect choice to get this product! unbelievable!! Cheap price and good for oily skin. I want to get later soon.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Stays on all day in the heat. A little expensive though. Received product very quickly.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin with a mate finish an controls oil in the face. In addition to the sun protection that it provides.</li>
            <li> Dr. recommended.  Easy to put on. Smooth and covers evenly.  I like it. Not heavy and protects from the sun.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while now. I found it on Amazon for about half of what my local Spa sells it.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on feeling like powder. It is so smooth and blends in with any skin color. My first time trying it a and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is like putting on a primer.  It goes on very smoothly and   gives you a matte finish.  My dermotologist had recommended this product and  I am very happy with it.  My skin looks beautiful and natural with this   product and it&#x27;s being protected from the sun at the same time!   This combined with powder gives you flawless skin!  This  is the only product my daughter can use without breaking her out--  she loves it!</li>
            <li> Received this fast. Received refund even faster. Murad now uses hologram labels to authenticate their products. This item did not apply or feel good on my skin and I used it before in fair, when purchased from my dermatologists office. The wording on the box was almost the same. Authentication or batch quality questionable. Bought same through aesthetician and it was a much better experience.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is non greasy but it is tinted, something I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered it.  However, the tint is light and barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen was sent in a padded envelope therefore the box was smashed, but the tube was intact.</li>
            <li> Love it.I wear it alone or under my makeup to block the rays.</li>
            <li> nice light brown hue, good sun protection, not irritating.</li>
            <li> I suspected that it might not be produced by the company.  The quality of this item was totally different from what I got from my dermatologist.  It is too watery and does not last on my skin for a while. I stopped using it!!</li>
            <li> Nothing is better then this sunblock.... it gives you a nice tinted look and lasts all day.  If you go in the water you need to reapply.</li>
            <li> Deleted promptly. This works well on my sensitive nose at all day Clearwater Beach Florida visits.</li>
            <li> The package doesn&#x27;t say Solar Protection Formula, just Protection by itself ?! Am I receiving the right product?</li>
            <li> This is NOT the item pictured or described. Do not buy this if you want the real Tizo 3. They will send you the old regular Tizo, the wrong size tube, and it will not feel the same as you&#x27;re used to. Sorry to see people pulling these tricks online. Order from someone you know.</li>
            <li> This product is very good. No greasy, and offer good protection was recommended by my dermatology Doctor. you can use all day even under your makeup. Because has color you don&#x27;t have to use to much foundation.</li>
            <li> This is a very responsible seller. This is a very good product. I use it everyday. I have a sensitive and oil skin. But this sunscreen is fantastic for me.</li>
            <li> Best daily sunscreen I have found.  I have very sensitive skin and most sunscreens make me break out.  No greasy feel.  Tint lets me use it as foundation when wearing  make up.</li>
            <li> If you dislike wearing sunscreen with foundation, this is the product for you! It has a light tint so you can forego the foundation. It is a challenge to remove from your face, but worth the extra washing for the sun and skin protection.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested this specific sunscreen to me. I have some darkened areas on my face along with acne prone skin. This stuff is amazing! It feels like silk! You can wear it alone or under makeup.</li>
            <li> Use this every summer because of the awesome coverage, beautiful finish. Plus, stays put in summer heat unlike most foundation.  The SPF can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I have pale but yellow skin tone (I am Asian). The color of sunscreen seems shockingly dark when I put it on my face, however it completely matches my skin tone.  The coverage is light to medium as far as if you want to use this sunscreen for the replacement of BB cream or cream foundation, but it helps my skin to look healthy and natural.  I get a lot of complement when I&#x27;m wearing this sunscreen.  It is so hard to find sunscreen with PA+ ratings in the US, so I am very happy to find this product. As it rated as PA+++, my skin didn&#x27;t get burned at all while I was vacationed in Hawaii, Cabo and etc.</li>
            <li> This item was just what I had from my dr&#x27;s office for a lot cheaper. Love the way it goes on . Feels like silk. Took awhile to get it from the distributor but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST suncreen product available! It goes on smoothly. Doesn&#x27;t get sticky and its lightly tinted so u can skip the foundation if you want. I apply my foundation over it and it blends in perfectly. Doesn&#x27;t peel off or leave your face shiny. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product works well with my skin.  About 5 minutes after applying moisturizer, I put this sun block on my face.  I know some people complain about it staining and such, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem.  I apply a thin layer all over my face and neck, and wait a few more minutes before going out.  It has shielded my face from the sun all summer and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I could get on the roof top and give a speech about these Solar products (see my review for Solar Protection Formula Tinted Concealer also).  You can save yourself a lot of dough in wrinkle creams and brown spot treatments if you will just use this.  And the sooner the better.  Year &#x27;round.  Get your teenage girls to wear it instead of makeup (this sunscreen is foundation too).  They will thank you years later!  My dermatologist told me about this company. I have had two precancerous lesions (and brown spots) burned off because we did not have this kind of sunscreen when I was growing up.&lt;br /&gt;So here is what I&#x27;ve learned: Solar makes a few products and it was confusing to me at first about which one to get... BUT I am very glad I have both.&lt;br /&gt;1)  Tizo Solar Protection Facial Mineral Fusion is like a primer/light foundation.  Your skin just glows like all get out with this stuff. You can wear it by itself.  #3 is for medium complexions and #2 is for lighter complexions.  (I am fair and actually the #3 is ok b/c I spread it and use it mostly as primer.)&lt;br /&gt;2) The other product I got is the Solar Protection Formula Tinted Concealer.  I have no idea why they call it a concealer b/c it is more like a foundation.  The shade in the bottle is too dark for me but it comes with two tubes....white and dark.  Check to see if the shade by itself is ok.  If not, you add drops of whichever one you want to custom blend to the shade that suits you best.  I gradually added a lot of the white (testing along the way) and the final shade is perfect.  Now you might think this is a lot of trouble and it would be easier to just buy an over the counter foundation.  Wrong!  First of all it does not take a lot to custom blend.  And, this product is far, far better than even any high end foundation.  But most of all you will save yourself from skin damage.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist in Hawaii recommended this to me about three years ago and I have used this ever since. I am fair-skinned and freckled and I work out outside and spend a lot of time at the beach. It is extremely water-resistant. This will never get in your eyes; you can even rub it right on your eyelids. I use it daily on myself and my kids.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product when I was working in a plastic surgeons office.  As a personal trainer, I am out in the sun alot! and even with a hat, I was finding spotty areas where my sunscreen \\&quot;missed\\&quot; - Getting sunburned is not fun.  I use Tizo3 every day, without fail. I love the way it goes on, and I use it as a primer for foundation (which I only use in the T zone).  In the summer, this is all I use, the coverage is outstanding, and I have NEVER gotten a burn no matter if I am swimming, kayaking or biking.  It&#x27;s an amazing product!  To make it last longer, I snip the bottom off the tube and apply with my finger, using a small binder clip to close, this way you get the most from the tube, and there is ALOT left after you can&#x27;t squeeze any out of the top!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST SOLAR PROTECTION PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED. NO SHINE!!! AMAZING . I LOVE IT WILL BUY IT AGAIN FOR SURE.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sunblock.  My esthetician turned me onto it last year.  I am highly sensitive/allergic to fragrances, and it has no scent at all.  It has a smooth and silky texture and glides on.  It works as a great base or primer if you still need to cover up little spots like me.  If you use as a primer, I recommend that you give it a minute or two after application to set.  I find that it changes color to match your tone-- similar to Koren bb creams.  I am a product junkie so the mere fact that I still use this one year later makes a big statement.  I got my mom using it now too.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been around way before bb cream came out, and I swear it&#x27;s a million times better. I&#x27;m very surprised that everyone doesn&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li> Goes on great, feels great, used for water sports and never got sunburned. BUT just read ingredient I missed when I bought it: Alumina is aluminum oxide. Here&#x27;s the details (something to consider if you are predisposed for any degenerative or neurological diseases). VERY disappointed as this product is all it claims to be except for this ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;NEUROTOXICITY&lt;br /&gt;Strong evidence of human neurotoxicity, Chemicals known to be neurotoxic to humans&lt;br /&gt;DEVELOPMENTAL/REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY&lt;br /&gt;Human nervous system toxicant - moderate evidence, Chemicals known to be neurotoxic to humans&lt;br /&gt;PERSISTENCE AND BIOACCUMULATION&lt;br /&gt;Persistent or bioaccumulative and moderate to high toxicity concern in humans, from Environment Canada Domestic Substance List&lt;br /&gt;ORGAN SYSTEM TOXICITY (NON-REPRODUCTIVE)&lt;br /&gt;Classified as expected to be toxic or harmful, from Environment Canada Domestic Substance List&lt;br /&gt;Classified as medium human health priority, from Environment Canada Domestic Substance List&lt;br /&gt;ECOTOXICOLOGY&lt;br /&gt;Suspected to be an environmental toxin, from Environment Canada Domestic Substance List&lt;br /&gt;ENHANCED SKIN ABSORPTION&lt;br /&gt;Suspected nano-scale ingredients with potential to absorb into the skin, from Nanomaterial Database</li>
            <li> Nice texture; covers with a subtle tint.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my neck to prevent sun damage.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  It goes on smoother than a high-end filler/primer for make-up.  It has tint and some coverage like makeup.  And it&#x27;s recommended by my dermatologist.  Fantastic product for everyday and especially for women athletes.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;m on my second tube and used it just last week skiing in CO. It goes on nicely, not greasy. I will continue to purchase this product.  It was shipped quickly and this company, MD Skin Solutions, offeres great customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a surf bum that had to grow up and be responsible. Too bad I didn&#x27;t use more of this type of product in my teens. I&#x27;ve never liked wearing sunscreen (lots of freckles to prove it). I guess I&#x27;m still a bit of a kid and don&#x27;t like having anything greasy, smelly or tingly on my face. I have tried expensive products meant for faces only and haven&#x27;t been able to find one with all the key elements like this stuff: odorless, non-greasy, water resistant, chemical free, UVA &amp; B full spectrum, and long lasting. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years. Yes, it&#x27;s expensive which is why I use it only on my face. I haven&#x27;t discovered anything that works as well and for this reason, it&#x27;s a bargain. The other thing is that even though it&#x27;s only a 1.5 oz. tube, a little goes a long way. Also, I like that it&#x27;s tinted which makes it easy to know that you&#x27;re applying it uniformly and it&#x27;s great at concealing dark spots and fine lines around my eyes. Oh and it doesn&#x27;t burn if you get any in your eye. Also, I love that it&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t clog pores or, worse, give me acne. I&#x27;ve used all of the expensive stuff-faces only products to wear every day (Lancome, Neutrogena, Shiseido, etc.) but they either smell like sunscreen or use chemically-based UV filters.This one is made of the stuff that&#x27;s been around since Jeff Spicoli was still in his diapers and later what he wore on his nose. It&#x27;s all natural. It&#x27;s the only product that I can get my kids to wear too. It&#x27;s an everyday, everywhere sunblock that&#x27;s easy to remove at the end of the day, amazingly it&#x27;s still protecting my skin, with a simple makeup wipe. From one fair skinned sun lover to another, you can trust this stuff and wear it everyday and not end up looking like Magda (Something About Mary).</li>
            <li> Love the feeling this product leaves on my face. However could have a little more moisture in it. If my face is slightly dry like during the winter, it will dry too much on my face, leaving lines I can see. Otherwise good coverage. Sometimes I will add a little water to my finger as I apply the product. Helps a little bit.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and productive was just as promised.  I LOVE this product and it was highly recommended by a cosmetic surgeon.</li>
            <li> This is the facial sunscreen of the rich and famous. Yes, it is extremely expensive but it is amazing! My daughter and I went off to the Bahamas in the middle of the winter and I purchased this to protect our faces from burning. We are both very fair so the risk was high. Neither of us experienced any burning at all. In addition to that, the coverage is so awesome. It goes on easily and smoothly, not streaky or lumpy like others. It actually has a little tent as well. It goes on similarly too make up base or cc cream.  Just LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I have very sensitive skin and this did not burn or irritate in anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a sidenote, we used an organic self tanner so that we didn&#x27;t get color on our face and that was a great alternative to exposing our facial skin too damaging the sunrays that will later create spots and wrinkles.  This is the way to go ladies!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also tell you that this cream really works because we both got some burn right along the hairline and wear our hair parts so the sun was plenty strong but this held up to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> So far,love the product. Noticeably more matte appearance of my face.</li>
            <li> Great product - like the texture the coverage - I use a cover every single morning before I leave the house</li>
            <li> It has this very strong silicone feeling (smooth but slick) that I&#x27;m not a fan of. Also the color is too dark for my skin, about MAC NC30-35. If you are ok about these two issues then you may like it. This has very good ingredients and is recommended by experts.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day.  I live in SW Florida, sun is hot &amp; bright year-round - as a FL native, I&#x27;ve had enough sun exposure to last me a lifetime - especially my face - This product goes on over my moisturizer, under my makeup - it&#x27;s smooth, silky and looks very natural (it has a tan color to it).  I order this product regularly through Amazon Prime, it&#x27;s always shipped quickly and in good shape when I get it.</li>
            <li> An awesome sunscreen, matte and easy to use. Love this. Will never use another sunscreen on my face. I purchased a defective tube once and they quickly sent out a replacement. Even before they got mine back.</li>
            <li> love this stuff - provides a great foundation for people with olive complexions.</li>
            <li> this really works. it goes on light and is perfect for traveling. pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen because it goes on flawlessly and the hint of time means that I don&#x27;t have to wear foundation or powder.  I always buy this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really love the way it goes on, very smooth.  I bought the tinted which I really love.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Again, my It-girl pal in Pasadena recommended this to me for days when you just want a light coverage and some SPF sun protection. It&#x27;s a great product. Goes on and feels different from all other sunscreens I&#x27;ve ever tried. It doesn&#x27;t have that slimy white clumpy feel some sun screen has. It feels silky. Slight color. My new fave.</li>
            <li> Great sun protection that is skin colored.</li>
            <li> This is the best sun protection. It goes on smooth and leaves skin looking and feeling great!! Worth every penny</li>
            <li> Protects your skin, is the best filter, recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Great product!  It feels like silk as you apply it then gives your skin a glow.  I can&#x27;t wear standard foundations any more - my skin has become too sensitive.  This product does not clump or cake, removes easily and does give sun protection.  I&#x27;ve used it all summer and I believe it has made a difference for me.  It is also the first product that has not given me a reaction of any kind in ages - I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
            <li> Little pricey but worth it. I use it after moisturizer and before foundation. Works like a primer and doesn&#x27;t smell terrible like some do.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this.  It&#x27;s certainly not for everyone because it&#x27;s so thick, but it is my primer, sunscreen &amp; foundation (on days that I&#x27;m rushed), all-in-one.  Mineral sunscreen is so hard to find, but it makes all the difference for me in protecting my face from sun spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of this sunscreen brand. It&#x27;s not messy. I enjoy the slight tint. I also appreciate how it has a matte finish on the skin and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> No smell, goes on very smooth. Can be used as a primer.</li>
            <li> came in smashed and the product was every where. Had to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;Love Tizo and use it all the time but will think twice before ordering it.</li>
            <li> PERECT-- I HAVE ORDERED THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND CAN&#x27;T EXPRESS HOW MUCH THIS HELPS WITH&lt;br /&gt;THE SUN--WE FISH A LOT AND USE THIS OFTEN.</li>
            <li> A bit thicker than some other more expensive brands but, after a few seconds on the skin it smooths out evenly.  I haven&#x27;t been to the beach or pool yet but, walking in the VA humidity and working in the yard, the daylong protection is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. This product sells for $50 at my dermatologist. It has a tint to it but its kinda like wearing foundation without having to wear it. I have Melasma so this product is a must for me.</li>
            <li> I usually have break outs but I can wear Tizo all day and not feel like I dipped my face in grease.  It works really well and is truly a good product.  I have sensitive and oily skin prone to break outs and this worked well with me. I will order more when I run out.  It does have a slight tint so if you are very fair then go with the tint-less.  Otherwise it practically blends in with any skin tone clearly.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me a few years ago because I have rosacea.  It is absolutely the one best thing that keeps my rosacea under control!  I wear it under my makeup every day.  I can put this product on my face, go outside and mow the lawn and my face does not even get pink.  Love this product even if is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> En dos veces he comprado FACIAL y me llega eyes... ??&lt;br /&gt;como se pueden equivocar con el tipo de producto ??</li>
            <li> My search is (hopefully) over. After trying literally every sunscreen on the market in every price range, from drug store kids&#x27; sunscreens to high-end and dermatologist office brands, this is the only one I can stand. Its texture is unlike anything I&#x27;ve tried before...very sillicone-y and glides right on. I usually don&#x27;t like silicone-heavy products (primers, foundations, etc.), but this is different. It is so non-goopy, non-greasy-, and soft/smooth upon application, it&#x27;s a joy to put on in the morning. It definitely sits on top of the skin, but that&#x27;s expected due to the type and design of the physical blockers (ZO and TiO2) in the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tint appears very brown when it comes out of the tube, but once on my pale (NC15ish) skin it blends right in, even when applying a significant amount. This doesn&#x27;t transfer to clothing as badly as some others with tint I&#x27;ve tried (talking to you, LRP) and is not nearly as sticky or shiny as other sunscreens (Elta) that are highly recommended on skincareaddiction and similar sites. The tint will not cover like a foundation, but it does offset the white cast, help me see where I need to apply more, and give me a little bit of a more normal looking complexion so I don&#x27;t look like a ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately, for the past week, I&#x27;ve just been wearing this, liquid concealer over blemishes, and translucent de-slick powder, and I look better than I do with a full face of makeup (in my opinion...then again I&#x27;m not a full face of makeup kind of girl). Once this sets (and I do recommend a translucent powder to help with that), I forget I&#x27;m wearing it. It&#x27;s pretty weightless. Doesn&#x27;t sneak into smile lines, etc. on my 31yo, oily, acne-prone face. And so far, it doesn&#x27;t irritate or break out my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by my dermatologist, btw. One of the only products she&#x27;s recommended that I actually like. I wish it were cheaper, but I&#x27;ll pay up to I guess $40 since it&#x27;s been so hard to find a good &#x27;screen.</li>
            <li> I do not like sunscreen.  It is usually greasy, white and it smells.  I was so pleased to find this product.  First thing to know:  This is a tinted cream.  I am of medium complexion and it matches me really well.  I have lent it to friends with lighter complexion and it was too dark.  It has a smooth, almost matte finish to it.  I tend to use it as a primer as it also smooths out the skin. At times, I use it alone.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this sunscreen works best when moisturizer is applied to the face first, otherwise, it tends to be very dry and you&#x27;ll need to use a lot of it. It&#x27;s great for days that you want sun protection but still want to wear makeup. It isn&#x27;t wet and greasy, so makeup works well with it. The tinted color blends easily.</li>
            <li> Good product, but very expensive.</li>
            <li> I hate lotion on my skin except this and it blends in with my skin color.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years! It is awesome. It is light and shear on your face. Great coverage, but doesn&#x27;t turn &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; on your face...and... takes very little to do the trick. I absolutely couldn&#x27;t imagine doing without it. I wear a little mineral powder over it.</li>
            <li> Feels great on, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out. Better deal than buying at my dermatologists office.</li>
            <li> My partner&#x27;s plastic surgeon is in Beverly Hills.  When I waiting I noticed he had all these TIZO lotions everywhere. He said he highly recommended it.  So being a a trusty person, I purchased retail from his doctor&#x27;s office. I think I paid about $55. But I found it on Amazon for a lot less. The tint on the cream is reasonable. For skin, use less. For darker skin use more.  Overall it seems good. As far as the UV protection working.. who the hell really knows if it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job...</li>
            <li> TIZO3 is the best sunscreen for the face, EVER! It&#x27;s satiiny, light and not oily. The tint is perfect for all skin tones. Put it on and forget about it. Perspiration doesn&#x27;t leave streaks like other tinted sunscreens. You can wear a foundation if you want, but don&#x27;t have to. I&#x27;m telling everyone I know to try it. Those that I have told and tried it, love it too. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;lovely\\&quot;. the perfect present for my little girl  the color the size all is perfect, im really happy when i see you in the face all days</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. It is a lighter sheer coverage but that is exactly what I need. I am so happy to find a natural sun block that is toxin and chemical free.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful facial sun protection., It glides on far more smoothely than traditional sun screens, does not run in the heat, and gives your face a finished look even with no make-up on. excellent job as both a sunscreen and a beauty aid.</li>
            <li> This product is good for your skin and makes it look great too.  Sun protection and smooth look.  A great bargain</li>
            <li> And it acts like a makeup primer! It has absolutely no bluish or white cast, just melts into the skin, leaving it looking velvety and more even. A touch of foundation or concealer around my nose and red cheeks, and I look great all day, even with sweat or rain, and no skin issues! Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be hard to find, and the Cotz Face Natural Skin Tone seems to be identical, so....</li>
            <li> My aesthetician turned me on to this about 5 years ago.  It has completely replaced my foundation.  Great protection, silky smooth and a nice amount of coverage if you like the more natural look.  It blends beautifully and covers those lil flaws.  A lil powder and I&#x27;m ready to go.  It&#x27;s such a great make up element for me that I forget about the screen block but it has saves my skin time and time again from the sun.  Get this, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I wear it all summer long. It has the right balance of SPF and mineral tint in it to make my near translucent skin look like it got some summer on it without actually getting summer on it.</li>
            <li> also controls you sebum and protective from the sun , very light. I wish they would come in bigger size</li>
            <li> Best protection ever is very silky and can be used as foundation. Love it</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this product after a chemical face peel, and I immediately loved it!  It makes skin softer and feels great when you apply it.  It gives a little bit of coverage, but seems to make your skin look softer and smoother.  I definetely recommend this product!  When I don&#x27;t have to have a lot of make-up on, I use this as my foundation. I love it!</li>
            <li> I totally love this product.  The nurse at my Dermatologist&#x27;s office recommended it and after the first time of using it I am hooked......I&#x27;m never without it.</li>
            <li> Best primer/sun screen out there!!! Little tint to it to even out skin tones! Will use this amazing stuff till I die :-D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fair skin which burns easily. Since childhood, I&#x27;ve struggled to enjoy the outdoors without getting burned or developing skin damage. When I was a child, effective sunscreens weren&#x27;t available (other than Zinc Oxide which, while effective, isn&#x27;t exactly appealing to use). In young adulthood when effective sunscreens came on the market, I was saddened to discover that they caused the skin on my face to redden and cause miserable irritation and pain. More recently, I&#x27;ve found that the mineral-based suncreens are less likely to cause the pain and irritation--but more often than not they&#x27;re thick, pasty and so white that I look like I&#x27;m wearing make-up for a kabuki play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I met an esthetician who recommended Tizo3 I presumed she was just trying to sell me some overpriced cosmetic just as gloppy and whitening as any other mineral sunscreen. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others, I&#x27;ve found Tizo3 really easy to apply. It&#x27;s incredibly easy to spread and leaves my skin really smooth. The tint is just enough to look like nothing--but conceals a bit. Although it&#x27;s relatively pricey, you really do only need a small amount (a bit larger than a pea--maybe a small grape) to cover your face. I find one tube lasts me several months--longer in the winter when I apply less often. I suppose I could use it over my whole body, but I use less expensive products elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also really effective. One application will usually last me a whole day of activities like gardening or going to the pool. If I&#x27;m out for the whole day, I&#x27;ll reapply before mid-day. Last summer we traveled to S. Africa where the sun is intense and there&#x27;s less ozone so greater risk of UV exposure. I was delighted to find that Tizo3 provided great protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m sad it doesn&#x27;t appear among those recommended by the Environmental Working Group, I&#x27;d rather risk some unknown, undocumented adverse event than risk a specific, identified risk (skin cancer) for which I know I&#x27;m at increased risk (because of prior sun burns and family history).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, I&#x27;m delighted to know there&#x27;s a product which I can (and do) use on my young red-headed daughter to reduce her risk of skin damage from the sun.I&#x27;m at increased risk (because of prior sun burns and family history).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, I&#x27;m delighted to know there&#x27;s a product which I can (and do) use on my young red-headed daughter to reduce her risk of skin damage from the sun.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews but I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get this product from my derm but they no longer carry it.  It&#x27;s an extra gentle sunscreen with a beautiful matte finish that lasts all day.  This was my main selling point since I have oily skin.  Matte all day long.  This is ideal on top of your moisturizer and underneath your powder,  It does have a silicone type feel upon application but the coverage is so good once it&#x27;s on that it doesn&#x27;t bother me. It is lightly tinted, and I am hooked!</li>
            <li> Nothing like the original formula</li>
            <li> I think that even though I have dry skin this product seemed to leave me with a greasy residue I did not enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and my skin doesnt accept the creams so easy. I need to try and try and try till I finde my night cream my day cream my sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I m impressed with this cream. A little goes a long way and feel very good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I m 35 years old, female, and have a combination oily and sometimes dry skin. My skin change all the time thats why I have so hard to finde a cream.&lt;br /&gt;When I m oily i just put on T-Zone some translucent powder from Rosaceacare.com(it also contains zinc oxide) and I m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;Hope my reviw was helpful. I finde to bed the people doesn t describe their skin type so you know if the cream can be something for you or not. Most the time they focus only on the product but a product can be different from skin to skin.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are combination-dry your fine and the cream dry clear also. If you have oily skin you may need some powder on top or  T-Zone.&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena has a new mineral sunscreen what is also worth to try for like 11$ :) Neutrogena has a make-up \\&quot;Healthy skin\\&quot; who has mineral sunscreen in it, titanium dioxide, SPF 20, not bed at all, medium-full coverage. The only make-up with mineral sunscreen I found on the market, big brends has no mineral sunscreen, decent brend like Neutrogena has it :)&lt;br /&gt;Alba Botanica mineral sunscreen 30SPF is to greasy and doesn t glide well.</li>
            <li> It glides on easily, it looks good and not pasty with just the right tint,and it protects well. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great, if you don&#x27;t put too much on.  Then it feels &amp; looks like a mask. And, also it can feels a little heavy.</li>
            <li> Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Great price&lt;br /&gt;Really fast service&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than my dermatologist&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend this product, it works as make up too</li>
            <li> I love the texture of TIZO.  It goes on smoothly and feels great on my skin.  Because it does not come off easily, I can sweat or swim with confidence. My dermatologist supports the use of this product.</li>
            <li> This product works well as a light base.  Covers uneven tones.</li>
            <li> Wonderful sunscreen!  I did not break out once-that is a first! Covers and protects your skin without feeling greasy, heavy or runny. Easily soaks into your skin.  I used it constantly on my Southeast Asia trip. Highly recommend for fair and sensitive skin!  I have tried at least 20 different sunscreens and this is a winner. This is now a constant companion on all my trips.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen you can use for your skin.  Tinted, but blends nicely into your own skin color.  Matte finish.  Great as a primer for under makeup.  Does not clog pores.  This is the only sunscreen I will use for my skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, after apply tizo 3, My face Looks even, I will continue to by this product product is not cheap but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This lightly tinted product  smooths on evenly,  feels light and fresh on the skin, lasts all day, and is easy to wash off.  Plus, it allows all day protection  against the sun&#x27;s rays.  Used daily, this tube  lasts a good 2 to 3 month, or more.  Also, PDA skin facial products work well with this product.</li>
            <li> My plastic surgeon&#x27;s office staff recommended this product and I LOVE it, it is a very effective sunscreen. The slight tint helps give my skin a more even tone and a nice glow. Since it is thicker than the sunscreen I use on the rest of my body, I apply it on my face just after the moisturizer. That way I can spread the sunscreen around evenly. If I am wearing makeup, I apply mineral powder makeup over the sunscreen. I wear this sunscreen every day and, even though the tube is small, it lasts a long time. Good customer service from Amazon and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Although this product is a little pricey, it really does go a long way. The formula is very light weight and is great under makeup. Also good for very sensitive skin. I have rosacea and it does not irritate my skin at all. It has a slight tint to it but doesn&#x27;t show unless you put too much. Very waterproof and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but had to purchase it from a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office before finding it offered on-line (Amazon).  The price of the product and shipping made it approximately the same price as purchasing it from the surgeon, but it was much more convenient to purchase it on-line.  I was pleased with the on-line company as well.</li>
            <li> best quality for sunblock, my dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li> Feels very velvety on your skin. I love it, only complaint is it&#x27;s a little light for my skin in summer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product,  there&#x27;s nothing better than this sunscreen. Your skin will love it,  worth every penny,  don&#x27;t think twice :)</li>
            <li> Great for every day use but also perfect for beach. I just used it at the beach for a week with no makeup and it worked great. Love that it is tinted for just a little coverage. It is a perfect sunscreen that won&#x27;t clog your pores.</li>
            <li> to high of cost for amount of product</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product. It appears as though I&#x27;m wearing foundation &amp; yet I&#x27;m fully protected from the sun.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> NO ESTOY TOTALMENTE CONBENSIDA.</li>
            <li> This product contains titanium dioxide and zinc oxide which seem to be the best protection against the sun; I find it does protect my face and while there are many products out there, Tizo acts to smooth skin, it seems to even skin tone and it doesn&#x27;t feel or look like a thick layer of makeup.  I definitely recommend it, especially if you live in a hot climate.</li>
            <li> i love it, it&#x27;s ligth and has tinted color, this doesn&#x27;t mean it will work as a makeup, but it&#x27;s way better than having a white sunscreen. non greasy,</li>
            <li> Almost EVERY sunscreen I use irritates my eyes and within ten minutes of applying it I can&#x27;t see and my eyes are tearing.  Tizo is the only one that does not do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a clear and a tinted cream.  When I purchased it I didn&#x27;t realize that it was tinted.  When I mentioned this the seller IMMEDIATELY offered to return it for the clear.  Since it was my mistake for ordering the wrong thing I did not exchange it.  I can order the clear next time.  I will definitely deal with this seller in the future, they are A+ in my opinion.</li>
            <li> You get the sum block with the the smooth face feel. You can even wear it as makeup. It goes on light and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent sun protection and has the same texture as a medium weight doundation. Works great as both makeup and sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Such a great sun block</li>
            <li> This is a truly elegant and non-greasy, silky matte sunscreen, but I wish they used \\&quot; tinted\\&quot; in the description. I&#x27;m fairly pale and my 7 year old said I looked weird when I had this on, because my face looked \\&quot;too brown.\\&quot; Now I&#x27;m off to see if they make an untinted version.</li>
            <li> my mom uses it and if she asks for more i guess she likes it</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sun protection for your face and neck... and it&#x27;s tinted...&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth... try it... you will love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I would recommend to men or women.  It&#x27;s complete coverage along with a little bit of tint to hide those little lines on the face.  I would use a different product for the rest of the body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a physical sunscreen that wouldn&#x27;t leave a horrible white cast on my skin, and I thought the reviews here were too good to be true.  Well, the tinted version blended into my skin seamlessly and it felt amazing.  That&#x27;s why I gave it 2 stars.  But then it clogged my pores and made me break out horribly.  So I looked at the ingredients and realized the reason why this sunscreen feels so silky smooth is because it&#x27;s loaded with silicone.  It&#x27;s like using a makeup primer.  If you wear makeup and use a primer kind of like (Smashbox Photo Finish or similar dimethicone primers) every single day and not have a problem, this sunscreen would be great for you.  It&#x27;s a good product, just not for my skin.  So if you&#x27;re sensitive to silicone, stay away from this.  My search continues...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the ingredients....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active: Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide&lt;br /&gt;Inactive: Alumina, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Methicone, PEG-10 Dimethicone</li>
