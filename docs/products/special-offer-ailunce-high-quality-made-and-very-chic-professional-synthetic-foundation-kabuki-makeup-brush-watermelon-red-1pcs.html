            <li>I really loved it and it looks like it&#x27;s going to last!!</li>
            <li>Excelent  its so soft i liked</li>
            <li>I liked about it is that it was super soft and came</li>
            <li>Seriously, the best brush.</li>
            <li>Just Had to super glue the handle on before using it.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s nothing a quick wash wont do.</li>
            <li>Also the shipping was quick</li>
            <li>They were soo soft, blended amazingly and my foundation/blush/bronzer stayed right on the tip (where it should)</li>
            <li>The sigma flat top is almost triple this price so if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap alternative this is for you!  </li>
            <li>Like it very much!</li>
            <li>Because of this, I fear more may fall out, but for now they seem strong enough to hold.</li>
            <li>Great little brush.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li>its soft yet sturdy, the hits stay in place, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Definitly recomending thwm to my subscribers worth the price, and wait from china...</li>
            <li>The seller is nice enough to ask me if I got the brush.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and dense, will be purchasing two more</li>
            <li>I wanted to find a inexpensive brush that would apply my foundation right</li>
            <li>When they came I opened them right away, washed my face and gave them a try</li>
            <li>I use this brush everyday to apply my foundation, and it works amazing!</li>
            <li>brush part felt nice just like sigma flat top kabuki but the only problem was it was detached from the handle.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>This brush came quickly and I really like it for applying foundation.</li>
            <li>I use this to apply my liquid foundation and my concealer, the bristles are very soft and feels light on my face.</li>
            <li>At such a price, you cannot expect more...</li>
            <li>con to me was that it did shed, even the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>and I have only lost one more strand.  </li>
            <li>It looked exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>This brush was came exactly one week after I ordered it</li>
            <li>so well that you can&#x27;t tell your wearing foundation which is the whole point!</li>
            <li>I pretty much sleep with that brush!</li>
            <li>; Kabuki brush.&lt;br /&gt;After using this, my foundation looks so much better and blended properly.</li>

            <li>It blends my foundation out really well</li>
            <li>Some leave your foundation looking chalky or very layered and this one blends in your foundation</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s to much for me, my skin can&#x27;t breath if I&#x27;m blending foundation with this brush.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels like the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>

            <li>Broken handle but good for the price.</li>
            <li>After browsing Amazon and other websites looking for a flat top brush for liquid foundations I came across this one and decided to purchase it after reading the positive feedback.</li>

            <li>, it&#x27;s very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Seems well made and is very soft.</li>
            <li>It did shed when I first received it, but I washed and deep conditioned it as I do with all new brushes before use.</li>
            <li>Shipping was earlier then expected! :)</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have recently washed this brush for the first time and it has not shed at all.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and so far I haven&#x27;t had any bristles fall out.  </li>
            <li>It is so soft.</li>
            <li>Smelly but soft.</li>
            <li>Soft.  </li>
            <li>The brush was so soft and after washing the brush the bristles did not shed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly marked that the package should contain 2 .</li>
            <li>There is no damage as far as I can see done to the brush.</li>

            <li>Received exactly what I ordered, and delivery was faster than expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually thinking of purchasing more of these brushes and other products from this seller; besides one can never have enough makeup brushes (especially face brushes).</li>
            <li>It was also delivered much faster than I expected since it is shipped from China.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone wether your just starting in makeup or professional...</li>
            <li>I got this brush in place of my bare minerals foundation brush.</li>
            <li>The white handle was not properly firmly attached to the metal cylinder that holds the bristles.</li>
            <li>My package came and only 1 brush was in the package, ( clearly ordered 2 brushed and paid for 2 brushes )  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really soft like those more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>It does shed a little bit at first.</li>
            <li>Very soft and came way earlier than expected!</li>

            <li> Like it very much!</li>
            <li> Because of this, I fear more may fall out, but for now they seem strong enough to hold.</li>

            <li> Totally worth the money.  </li>

            <li> and I have only lost one more strand.  </li>
            <li> It looked exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> This brush was came exactly one week after I ordered it</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s to much for me, my skin can&#x27;t breath if I&#x27;m blending foundation with this brush.</li>

            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have recently washed this brush for the first time and it has not shed at all.</li>

            <li> Smelly but soft.</li>
            <li> Soft.  </li>
            <li> The brush was so soft and after washing the brush the bristles did not shed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearly marked that the package should contain 2 .</li>

            <li> The white handle was not properly firmly attached to the metal cylinder that holds the bristles.</li>
            <li> My package came and only 1 brush was in the package, ( clearly ordered 2 brushed and paid for 2 brushes )  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really soft like those more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> It does shed a little bit at first.</li>
            <li> Very soft and came way earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t get the bristles as white as they used to be when I wash the brush, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> and it last this long!</li>
            <li> It is very soft, and comparable to other more expensive brushes I have bought in the past.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could use it on face all day long without keeping it in ma bag.</li>
            <li> I wet the brush with water, dip it into foundation on the back of my hand, and stipple it on.</li>
            <li> and they even came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> , it arrived earlier that expected.  </li>
            <li> Brush was reeived after a long period of waiting approximatly 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> &gt; Firm, but soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a back up to use when my other one needs to be washed.  </li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t seem to spread those very well, but in honesty, I really am not very skilled at cosmetic techniques &amp; that&#x27;s probably my fault, not the brush.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> Works well with foundation and loose powder.</li>
            <li> I ordered it on November 12, and expected delivery was December 26.</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> but its really not.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job just not very well</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than expected, too.</li>
            <li> Its made well also, bristles don&#x27;t fall out or loose their shapes like other brushes.</li>
            <li> it beats the MAC brushes, seriously its so soft</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and trusted the opinion of the other folks who rated it and why.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first when I seen the price</li>
            <li> Applies my foundation frawlessly,  and arrived sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> her other out.</li>
            <li> Not really!</li>
            <li> , it blends very smoothly and evenly, i hate brushes that leave brush marks on your face</li>
            <li> Was using one from bare minerals for the past few years, it has nothing on this one!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price, really.</li>
            <li> I got the brush waaaay before I had expected it to be here!!</li>
            <li> I did get a slight &#x27;paint&#x27; smell after unwrapping it</li>
            <li> It took about 3 weeks to arrive &amp; I was a little perturbed about that.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday for my foundation</li>
            <li> This brush is sooooo soft, comparable to really expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush a few months ago</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush a while ago, and I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Head fell off after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of expensive makeup brushes, yet I use this one almost daily for powder.</li>
            <li> Not a cheaply made brush!</li>
            <li> I hardly use this brush and when I do it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been favoring this brush lately.</li>
            <li> If u like thick make up on, a lot of foundation and powder</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that it would shed so early on.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Girls why waste your money to buy expensive brushes ?</li>
            <li> I am too poor to buy all those name brand brushes out there that cost $20</li>
            <li> I was afraid it was going to be really weak bristles and fall apart</li>
            <li> It works just as well as an expensive kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> I WAS A LIL SKEPTICAL</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and the brush started to shed. :(</li>
            <li> it looks cakey and ugly, but this brush is bomb!</li>
            <li> the hair is shedding very badly on the brush</li>
            <li> So give them a try, you wont be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Its smooth and works great.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for putting on foundation and it was great for the price, however it keeps falling off the handle and i have to continue to re-glue it. If that&#x27;s not a problem then I would say to go for it because its a great brush for the price you pay!</li>
            <li> My daughter is particular about her brushes and there performance,&lt;br /&gt;She uses this brush for powdering her face.&lt;br /&gt;She likes the way the brush feels and performs.</li>
            <li> This brush is comparable to my Sephora foundation brushes. It is extremely soft and dense enough for a perfect foundation application every time.</li>
            <li> ALL I CAN SAY IS I LOVE IT!!!! I recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Love it... Easy to use</li>
            <li> The best makeup brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  Was using one from bare minerals for the past few years, it has nothing on this one! A must for anyone using powdered foundation.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to apply my mac foundation because I prefer brushes to a sponge for application. My make up comes on very smoothly and the brush is a perfect size.</li>
            <li> Girls why waste your money to buy expensive brushes ? please forget about the NAMES&lt;br /&gt;and think about what the brush can do. This brush is GREAT.</li>
            <li> OMG ..... I just received my brush and I dont know what to do. I love love love it. I wish I could use it on face all day long without keeping it in ma bag. Its soft and makes my face real smooth. It doesn&#x27;t leave residues of powder on my face. Can&#x27;t stop recommending this brush to my friends and y&#x27;all out there. Its soo gooooood. Love it</li>
            <li> Brush is great I was afraid it was going to be really weak bristles and fall apart but it didn&#x27;t. Works great! Shipping was super fast. I ordered it on November 12, and expected delivery was December 26. I got it on November 18 so that was a really great plus as well! Love the brush, cost is great, and shipping was fast and free.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the best brush. Just as good as my Sigma foundation brush! Great even for liquid highlighters! Love love love love. Seriously.</li>
            <li> I used this with my liquid foundation and it really works well, the brush is so soft. Great addition to any brush collection.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t resist the price.  I read all the reviews and trusted the opinion of the other folks who rated it and why.  Totally worth the money.  Very good quality and shipping was ahead of schedule.  It&#x27;s my favorite &#x27;go to&#x27; brush for foundation application.  I wanted a good substitute for the pricey sigma line... I got it!  I wish I bought more to give away as gifts.  If you&#x27;re on the fence... don&#x27;t be.  Just buy it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy. It blends my make up in perfectly. I&#x27;ve only had for about a month now so if any problems do occur after this post I will come back and edit my review. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love love love this brush. I use it everyday for my foundation and it&#x27;s fantastic! The bristles don&#x27;t fall out and it&#x27;s super soft  :)  Shipping was earlier then expected! :)</li>
            <li> I iasolutely love this brush. It is my favorite brushes I have ever had. It is so soft. It blends my makeup very nicely. I would say It isworth a lot more than but we pay for it</li>
            <li> Good synthetic brush.  Distributes makeup evenly.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Loved this brush but the bristles fell apart today. I ordered mine in January 2014 and it last this long! Will be replacing it ASAP</li>
            <li> Received exactly what I ordered, and delivery was faster than expected.  This brush is a must-have in my cosmetic arsenal.  It is very soft, and comparable to other more expensive brushes I have bought in the past.  Well packaged also.  Very good make-up brush.  Provides even application of my face powder.</li>
            <li> Smelly but soft. At such a price, you cannot expect more... But it was from China... I wonder if it is safe to use.</li>
            <li> Handle came off.  Had to glue it back on.</li>
            <li> Great little brush.  Yes, comparable to sigma.  Soft.  Bit of a smell from packaging, but once you have product on it you do not even realize it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con to me was that it did shed, even the first time I used it.  Lost 3 hairs.  I sprayed my outer edges with a bit of hairspray to keep it kind of tucked and uniform and I have only lost one more strand.  Very good for the price, would still recommend.</li>
            <li> Wow! This brush is a dream come true! I&#x27;m a first time user and the flawless finish I get is phenomenal! Before, I applied all my make up products by hand and fingers and boy was I missing out and cheating myself out of a fabulous celebrity finish! Go ahead and grab one two or even three for gifts for the holidays...your friends would adore you for it!</li>
            <li> Looooooove it sooo soft!! The handle is thick enough to have a good grip and the bristles are soft when I first recieved it it smelled like petroleum but after a good wash smell went away</li>
            <li> I have a ton of expensive makeup brushes, yet I use this one almost daily for powder. The bristles are densely packed, it buffs in powder very nicely.</li>
            <li> I liked about it is that it was super soft and came&lt;br /&gt;And before it would&lt;br /&gt;Said it would! :D&lt;br /&gt;I think I would buy more brushes now</li>
            <li> I was suppose to receive this brush in 2 weeks and it came in just one! I love it it blends my foundation very well its soft yet sturdy, the hits stay in place, easy to clean. A great dupe for the sigma brush</li>
            <li> please buy this brush Its the best brush ever the price is great it works wonderful with any foundation. You wont find a price at this low price that works so well.  This is a must have!! will buy again and again</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing, I use it with liquid/cream foundation and also with powder foundation. The bristles are dense and very soft. Mine personally hasn&#x27;t shed at all so i&#x27;m very satisfied with it :)</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s almost like the Sigma F80 brush. I use this brush everyday to apply my foundation, and it works amazing! I would recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great soft and fluffy flat top brush for liquid foundation. Minimal hair loss and great price point. Glad I made this purchase, I should get another for backup.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It looked exactly like the picture. Shipping was faster than expected. The brush was so soft and after washing the brush the bristles did not shed. It&#x27;s a medium size brush but it&#x27;s so dense and it was perfect for me to apply my liquid foundation. I got them for my sister&#x27;s for Christmas hope they love it like I do (:</li>
            <li> I use it to put on my liquid foundation snd it works great i love this brush 5 star all the way</li>
            <li> The kabuki brush arrived earlier than excepted. I have used the brush numerous times since I have received it. My foundation looks like it has been airbrushed on with the kabuki brush. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of foundation when I&#x27;m using the kabuki brush. It works just as well as an expensive kabuki brush. I am so glad I made this purchase!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is January 24,2014. I have had this brush for 2 months now. I cleansed all my brushes Wednesday January 22,2014 and the brush started to shed. :( I hardly use this brush and when I do it&#x27;s if I&#x27;m in the mood to look GLAMOROUS. I&#x27;m disappointed that it would shed so early on. I still recommend the kabuki brush but just beware of shedding. I am a makeup artist and I use this brush only on me.</li>
            <li> THIS BRUSH IS OF ABSOLUTE GOOD QUALITY !!. I WAS A LIL SKEPTICAL AT 1ST BUT WENT FOR IT , AND IM GLAD I DID. YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED.. GOOD ADDITION TO ANY WOMANS MAKE-UP KIT!!</li>
            <li> Broken handle but good for the price. Very soft bristles and no shedding, even with liquid foundation. Just Had to super glue the handle on before using it.</li>
            <li> Love this brush and what a great deal! I switch between this and a beauty blender and both I have to say work amazing but I&#x27;ve been favoring this brush lately. Great for stippling and blending and it&#x27;s really soft like those more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Works very well for liquid foundation. I wet the brush with water, dip it into foundation on the back of my hand, and stipple it on. My boyfriend commented that my makeup looked better without any prompting, so it does make a difference. My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t get the bristles as white as they used to be when I wash the brush, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> I use it to apply my BB cream and it really smooths and blends everything out. It was also delivered much faster than I expected since it is shipped from China.</li>
            <li> smells a bit like spray paint but that&#x27;s nothing a quick wash wont do. absolutely 100% satisfied, would order 1 million times over</li>
            <li> My order took forever to get here, but it did come from china . My package came and only 1 brush was in the package, ( clearly ordered 2 brushed and paid for 2 brushes )  It&#x27;s clearly marked that the package should contain 2 . I sent an email to the seller and the auto reply said they were on holiday . okay ???  I will give an updated review  once it is resolved . As for the brush,  it is great , How did I apply foundation before this is beyond me . Even application when going to a full coverage look. No shredding of bristles  or streaking when using this. I would buy this again ..</li>
            <li> This brush really works.  I use it after I apply liquid makeup, helps smooth out lines.  Easy to keep clean.  For the price, great buy</li>
            <li> As someone who has always applied foundation with my fingertips, this is incredible! I use my hand as a palette and stipple the foundation on my face before swirling it into an airbrushed finished! Solid product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to review, but I received an email from the seller asking my thoughts about this product. I received my product in a timely manner and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I just started using it recently and I love this brush with the black handle. Like another reviewer said, it gives an airbrush look. I have recently washed this brush for the first time and it has not shed at all. I&#x27;m actually thinking of purchasing more of these brushes and other products from this seller; besides one can never have enough makeup brushes (especially face brushes).</li>
            <li> This brush was came exactly one week after I ordered it and it was in perfect condition. It&#x27;s an extremely soft kabuki which is perfect for liquid foundation and I am very pleased with it! It does shed a little bit at first.</li>
            <li> Omg this brush is the softest brush iv ever used! it beats the MAC brushes, seriously its so soft i cant help but touch it everytime i see it! i used it to apply my maybelline fit me stick foundation, apply my concealer and contour my face, it blends very smoothly and evenly, i hate brushes that leave brush marks on your face it looks cakey and ugly, but this brush is bomb! amazing i love it, im a makeup blogger on youtube and i definitely recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> This brush is one of my favorites. It blends my foundation out really well, it&#x27;s very soft to the touch. I would recommend this brush to anybody!</li>
            <li> wanted to try a flat top kabuki brush without spending a lot of money. This one is great!! Glad I tried it and saved big time</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush. It makes putting on make up a breeze. Its made well also, bristles don&#x27;t fall out or loose their shapes like other brushes. Very happy with my purchase !</li>
            <li> I absolutly love love love these brushes theyre sigma dupes!!! Definitly recomending thwm to my subscribers worth the price, and wait from china... 8 days and i had them in my hands, freeee shipping!!!???? IM SOLD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MUST BUY !!!! GUYS &amp; GIRLS!!! ITS A DEAL</li>
            <li> I really love this brush I wanted to find a inexpensive brush that would apply my foundation right and that&#x27;s what this brush does! Some leave your foundation looking chalky or very layered and this one blends in your foundation so well that you can&#x27;t tell your wearing foundation which is the whole point! It gives you an airbrush look!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first when I seen the price..thought it was too good to be true. I&#x27;ve heard great things about them (the stipple brushes) so I figured why not give them a try. I bought the 4 pack of these which was 18$ I think plus free shipping ( it was a sale) and they even came earlier than I expected. When they came I opened them right away, washed my face and gave them a try LOL literally...I was soo amazed. They were soo soft, blended amazingly and my foundation/blush/bronzer stayed right on the tip (where it should) unlike other brushes your makeup ends ups more in* the brush than on* it.. Im guessing its also the &amp;#34;stipple&amp;#34; style of it which helps.&lt;br /&gt;I love these more than my mac brushes which is crazy lol but its really not. I would recommend these to everyone!! They are cheap, excellent quality and seriously you will LOVE them!! So give them a try, you wont be disappointed! I PROMISE!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush. Feels high quality. Great for foundation and powders.</li>
            <li> I got the brush waaaay before I had expected it to be here!! Thursday! Aka Halloween! Not only.. Was i able to do my makeup but i also was able to do my stepsister&#x27;s! I didn&#x27;t even bother to wash it! It blended so well! I pretty much sleep with that brush! lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its pretty much the equivalent to the Sigma F80 Kabuki brush. People say that a quality of a brush is defined by the name slapped on it. Well.. They need to smack Sigma on this and see who can&#x27;t tell the difference! Not only does it work very well but its more than half the cost.</li>
            <li> Best brush I have used for my foundation!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great! Just as well as more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Very soft and came way earlier than expected! Awesome!</li>
            <li> Nice quality it came in a week</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Applies my foundation frawlessly,  and arrived sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in November of 2013, and I&#x27;m STILL using it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so much more cheaper than a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Kabuki brush.&lt;br /&gt;After using this, my foundation looks so much better and blended properly.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a back up to use when my other one needs to be washed.  For the price I just couldn&#x27;t pass it up. It is very soft and so far I haven&#x27;t had any bristles fall out.  Also the shipping was quick, it arrived earlier that expected.  Great buy, I will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> What a great deal!! I love this brush! Blends my foundation perfectly!</li>
            <li> Seems well made and is very soft. Makes foundation cover nicely. Assuming it holds up for a good while, I would count it as an excellent purchase.  Will update review if there are any changes.</li>
            <li> Received this brush yesterday,  its nice and soft,  I used it to apply my stay matte powder after I applied my foundation. Its works beautifully! Will definitely recommend this brush. Loved the price. Also the seller is great.... I will buy more of their brushes.</li>
            <li> i brought for my sister for x mas but gave 2 weeks ago.she loves them she says gives more coverage and hair does not come out.throw her other out.</li>
            <li> Really nice brush. If u like thick make up on, a lot of foundation and powder it&#x27;s gonna work for u! Winter time u need this one, summer...? Not really! It&#x27;s to much for me, my skin can&#x27;t breath if I&#x27;m blending foundation with this brush.</li>
            <li> brush part felt nice just like sigma flat top kabuki but the only problem was it was detached from the handle. I need to glue and fix it as a temporary solution. The seller is nice enough to ask me if I got the brush.</li>
            <li> I received this flat top brush in the mail and I am extremely impressed by its quality. It arrived in a timely fashion wrapped in bubble wrap. There is no damage as far as I can see done to the brush. Perhaps the best part is just how darn soft the bristles/brush hairs are. Jeez Louise, its perfection. It feels heavenly against my face. It is however slightly smaller than I imagined. Regardless, it&#x27;s a beautiful brush and will serve its foundation purposes. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels like the real thing. Perfect for those who apply everyday makeup and don&#x27;t want to use animal hair. No synthetic hair drops and very accurate on putting your makeup on.</li>
            <li> Saw a difference in my make up application. Works well with foundation and loose powder. Quality is amazing, no shredding and i have washed it. Bristles are soft and dense, will be purchasing two more</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep form!!!!!! It&#x27;ll do it&#x27;s job just not very well</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned!  It took about 3 weeks to arrive &amp; I was a little perturbed about that.  It comes from China I think, which I didn&#x27;t know when I ordered.  However, it&#x27;s a good brush no matter where it comes from.  I haven&#x27;t had very good results trying to apply my foundation with it, but I use a full coverage &amp; a 24 hr. makeup alternately.  The brush doesn&#x27;t seem to spread those very well, but in honesty, I really am not very skilled at cosmetic techniques &amp; that&#x27;s probably my fault, not the brush.  The brush is super soft &amp; well made &amp; I wish I had a dozen of them, for foundation, blush &amp; anything else!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!!!!! I got It like three days ago and ordered it like 2 weeks ago so for me that&#x27;s pretty fast shipping! This brush is sooooo soft and perfect for blending foundation! The sigma flat top is almost triple this price so if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap alternative this is for you!  The brush hasn&#x27;t bled and it doesn&#x27;t smell funky! Thanks Ailunce!!!!</li>
            <li> Brush arrived way before deadline! Brush is super soft! Works great and puts my foundation on very smooth! Keeps it even and prevents me from applying to much and wasting my foundation!</li>
            <li> it applies on foundation very evenly. love the feeling of this brush. works just as good as the expensive ones u get from the store.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for the money. It is exactly what I was looking for. Applies liquid foundation evenly and with a nice finish.</li>
            <li> the hair is shedding very badly on the brush and i only used it three times&lt;br /&gt;i am disapointed at the quality</li>
            <li> After browsing Amazon and other websites looking for a flat top brush for liquid foundations I came across this one and decided to purchase it after reading the positive feedback. The estimated delivery date was Jan 23 - Feb 10 and it arrived Jan 10th! I did get a slight &#x27;paint&#x27; smell after unwrapping it but I washed it and the smell is gone there was no shedding of hairs and I was very pleased. I use this to apply my liquid foundation and my concealer, the bristles are very soft and feels light on my face. I absolutely love this brush and  at $5.29 you cant go wrong. Buy buy buy!!!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome.  It is SUPER soft.  Would definitely recommend.  Can&#x27;t believe it was so inexpensive.  It&#x27;s a great dupe for the Sigma version.</li>
            <li> Omg this brush is amazing. It applies my foundation great! I totally recommend it! I&#x27;ve used it twice and it doesn&#x27;t shed yet. I havent washed it yet though. But I love how it applies my foundation</li>
            <li> It feels so smooth and it works amazing I really loved it and it looks like it&#x27;s going to last!!</li>
            <li> This brush came quickly and I really like it for applying foundation. It feels nice and is great quality. You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price, really.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, provides a very clean finish, and is made very durable! Not a cheaply made brush! I love it and will be buying more!</li>
            <li> This amazing foundation brush creates a smoother, flawless coverage than a damp sponge-puff.  It&#x27;s an affordable version of the Sigma F80 foundation brush -- why buy one when you can buy 6 for the same price?!</li>
            <li> OmGeee!.. I freakin love this brush... I use it to blend out my undereye concealer and highlight.... i been in love since i first used it... Bristles are extra soft and easy on the skin.. No oder, Of course i wash and sterilize all makeup bruses before use..and at a low price with free shipping. If your looking for a buffing brush for foundation or for blending out concealer this one is a great choice.. I would recommend this product to anyone wether your just starting in makeup or professional...</li>
            <li> These are very good makeup brushes, there are very soft to touch, and the make glides on deep into the skin with a smooth finish. I plan to order more brushes.</li>
            <li> Was given a delivery estimate of sometime in January.&lt;br /&gt;I received it on the 30th of December, which is way ahead of schedule and a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is extremely soft, but there was a hair that had fallen out when I received it. Because of this, I fear more may fall out, but for now they seem strong enough to hold.</li>
            <li> I got this brush in place of my bare minerals foundation brush. This brush is sooooo soft, comparable to really expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I have looked around for inexpensive flat top brushes and there just arent any out there until I found this one.  I love it!  Works beautifully.  Will order again from this company.  .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more they wash really good, I use dawn dishwashing liquid!! Makeup applies perfect like the perfessional brushes from Mac!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush a few months ago and I love it! It is my go to brush for buffing in my foundation. I am too poor to buy all those name brand brushes out there that cost $20+ but I bet this one would compare to them. It is super soft and dense and buffs in my foundation perfectly. I have washed it many time and it has not shed and the ferrule is still secure. It arrived sooner than expected, too.</li>
            <li> Brush was reeived after a long period of waiting approximatly 3 weeks. I have used the brush once and it was very good. The white handle was not properly firmly attached to the metal cylinder that holds the bristles. When you wave it you hear the shaking sound.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush a while ago, and I use it almost everyday. It did shed when I first received it, but I washed and deep conditioned it as I do with all new brushes before use. The shedding has stopped after completing my brush cleansing routine. I absolutely love this brush as well as the angled kabuki for applying my foundation. I purchased both brushes along with another one from the same company.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It is soft and feels good on the skin. I use it for applying liquid foundation. It is a really good brush.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush! Used itfor foundation. Washed it once.&lt;br /&gt; Firm, but soft bristles. Outstanding price. Nary a hair shed. Like it very much!</li>
            <li> Bristles dont fall out, great size, the edge allows for sharper activity. If you&#x27;r like me and you like having two-three multi-functional brushes replace 168796 brushes, this is a great choice. I use it for blending, for powder, for mineral foundation, even brozer and blush, occasionally. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Excelent  its so soft i liked</li>
            <li> AMAZING for the price. I&#x27;ve had this brush for quite a while and it is still like brand new.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush but the handle fell off within 3 months. I glued it back and still use it.</li>
            <li> not the best not the worst. blending depends on the product.</li>
            <li> Cheap. Head fell off after a few uses. Difficult to clean.</li>
