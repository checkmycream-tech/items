            <li>I&#x27;ve also used this as a moisturizer on my legs which are especially dry at times, and it&#x27;s given me wonderful results at keeping my skin more soft and moisturized.  </li>

            <li>This is a very high quality coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>This coconut oil was really creamy and rich-tasting.  </li>
            <li>Even I tried some of the recipes at home and found to be really tasty.</li>
            <li>Really like the cocanut oil.</li>
            <li>It was a much lighter taste than tradition oil.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>

            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>I also used it on the tips of my hair and so far it seems to be reversing the damage that my hair dye did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m especially using it with my cooking because I was researching ways to live and eat healthier and coconut oil kept coming up in my research over and over.  </li>
            <li>This is a must for anyone who wants natural feelings of soft skin not greasy and order less.</li>
            <li>There is barely any scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it so far as a hair conditioner</li>
            <li>The state has several natural remedies and diet entirely based on coconut oil.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Yes received all everything ok just dissapointed in shipping for earrings guess I slipped up on watching that</li>
            <li> This is a must for anyone who wants natural feelings of soft skin not greasy and order less.</li>
            <li> I love this coconut oil because it does not have that strong scent that coconut oil tends to have and yet it is very delicious. I use it to cook just about everything that I need oil for. It is a great product and I thank you very much selling it. the price was excellent and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The oil was rancid when I opened it up.</li>
            <li> I used this organic coconut oil on my kids dry skin this summer. The oil turns liquid at warm temperatures so it&#x27;s easy to spread. Coconut oil is the best natural moisturizer and it really helped them. I recommend this product if you love the benefits and taste of natural coconut oil.</li>
            <li> it does not smell like coconut, does not taste like coconut, I bought two cans and have not use them, I don&#x27;t know if this is the way is suppose to be,</li>
            <li> Works great! Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Have been trying to make better choices in my cooking style and this was a great choice for me.  Not only does it have great flavor, but I really like the fact that it&#x27;s organic.  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my aunt to review.</li>
            <li> LOVE the coconut smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only going to use this coconut oil for hot oil treatments for my hair since its not organic virgin coconut oil, you can&#x27;t go wrong with applying oil to your hair hopefully I still get good results.</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil to cook with, in my coffee, and for hair and skin health. Buy this if you&#x27;re wanting a healthier alternative to regular cooking oils.</li>
            <li> This coconut oil was really creamy and rich-tasting.  It was refined, so no coconut flavor, but great for cooking and sautéing vegetables, meat, and fish.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product and went straight to texting all of its abilities as it essentially replaces lotion, its all natural, and it tastes good.  This stuff is like the wd40, or duct tape of the cooking world.  I strongly reccomend it to all!</li>
            <li> I recently had an opportunity to visit a province/state in India which is actually named after coconut tree. The name of the state is kerala which means related to coconut. The state has several natural remedies and diet entirely based on coconut oil. Even I tried some of the recipes at home and found to be really tasty. As stated by the latest research if coconut oil is healthy and helps in weight loss, then I would say that this a very unique combination. May be that could be the secret of longevity people in kerala. It is comparable to most of the developed countries</li>
            <li> I really love it for moisturizing my skin and keeping it smooth. Its the best moisturizer for skin that I&#x27;ve tried as compared to other lotion. Its definitely will be my go to moisturizer now.</li>
            <li> This is great. So far I&#x27;ve used it for smoothies, for frying something, for conditioner in my hair and for making baby wipes. I just bookmarked a page recently called 101 uses for coconut oil, so I can&#x27;t wait to use it for many more things. I love that it&#x27;s organic and made in the USA. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this coconut oil. My hair feels great</li>
            <li> I love this Nature Green coconut oil.  I am new to coconut oil, however I have been trying to live a healthier lifestyle so I wanted to learn.  I used it in cooking now and notice a big difference in using this coconut oil instead of my usual vegetable oil.  The food tastes good and seems to taste lighter at the same time.  I have used it in dinner preparation as well as baking.  I have also used it in place of butter or margarine and it does great there too.  This Nature Green coconut oil has good flavoring and aroma.  It is said to increase metabolism, so I am hoping to experience that bonus as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it as a conditioner, after melting some in water, and putting it through my damp hair, wrapping with saran wrap and leaving for a few hours, before washing it out.  I have only done this once, but will do it again.  Even with one use, it put some life back into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad I tried this Nature Green Coconut Oil and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Used this on my unmanageable, long hair. it is smooth and tangle free! It also says can replace butter or oil in cooking, i will be trying this as soon as I start dinner later! Great for your body, inside and out!</li>
            <li> I love this coconut oil. There is barely any scent.  It makes my skin feel so soft.  I also used it on the tips of my hair and so far it seems to be reversing the damage that my hair dye did.  Would definitely recommend this very versatile product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it so far as a hair conditioner and it makes my hair look amazing.</li>
            <li> Really like the cocanut oil. Not only for cooking but also skin care.</li>
            <li> its good product and hygiene for health. strongly recommended to buy.</li>
            <li> Great quality! I usually take it directly with a spoon, it tastes good. Sometimes I will add a few spoons on my soup, just loving it. Also, I use it to replace my mineral oil (harmful chemical) where I use it to remove my makeup.</li>
            <li> Great product, I actually used this for my son, he has very dry skin and after a couple of applications of this coconut oil on his legs and elbows, it made a big difference.Now I have to buy another one for cooking</li>
            <li> A definate item to have if you are looking for a better way of eating. I used the coconut oil to cook with and the taste was great!! My chicken was not drenched in grease. It was a much lighter taste than tradition oil. I highly recommend this product to all. Thank You !!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Fast shipping. Will be back for my second jar soon!</li>
            <li> I just received my supply of coconut oil and at this time, I cannot review it. It is the first time I will be using it. I&#x27;m hoping it works well on my skin. I have crepey skin and hope it will help. I will continue to order this product for it&#x27;s benefits. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is great coconut oil, I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product at a great price. I have made bath exfoliating shrubs, used it as a hair moisturizer overnight and it feels great on your skin. Love this product!</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality coconut oil.  I&#x27;m especially using it with my cooking because I was researching ways to live and eat healthier and coconut oil kept coming up in my research over and over.  I&#x27;ve completely cut other oils out of my cooking and baking, (save for some olive oil now and again,) and I&#x27;ve found my creations to turn out deliciously!

I&#x27;ve also used this as a moisturizer on my legs which are especially dry at times, and it&#x27;s given me wonderful results at keeping my skin more soft and moisturized.  It makes me feel good because it&#x27;s a natural product, instead of a lotion with a million ingredients I can&#x27;t pronounce!  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for more healthy alternatives.</li>
            <li> This product has a richer, more nutty flavor than the cheaper brands at grocery stores. Very happy with this new find.</li>
