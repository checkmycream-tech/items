            <li>It tastes pleasant, too!!</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Beautiful Color!</li>
            <li>but I just use a makeup brush and can detail the lining of my lips perfectly.</li>
            <li>it looks very good</li>
            <li>They truly are great products....</li>
            <li>The Colorsensational is really great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice, but 10 Hours, NO.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and color lasts!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous color though.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Nice color and smell.</li>
            <li>They come in handy in a pinch.  </li>
            <li>But it is still I a really nice color.</li>
            <li>The nice thing is the stain doesn&#x27;t come off once it has set, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about someone having lipstick smears if you kiss them.</li>
            <li>liked it</li>
            <li>the applicator is like flexible and easy to apply!</li>
            <li>Love everything about this product will buy a different color as soon as I get freed up money lol !!!!</li>
            <li>, that would have been so much better.</li>
            <li>My daughter was very happy with the color and bought more in different shades.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it here.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love how it keeps a glossy look after application.</li>
            <li>Love the color and,</li>
            <li>Omg I love this lipstick</li>
            <li>Good job Maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to order several more at this great price.</li>
            <li>It is just okay.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a very cool product.</li>
            <li>It has a nice satiny sheen, feels moist, and when the finish wears off, leaves nice natural looking color on the lips.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it provide beautiful color and coverage</li>
            <li>my goodness, the unique applicator provides one stroke coverage without even having to look in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>Super cheap too.</li>
            <li>This product came really quick.</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast!</li>
            <li>Color is bright and pretty, but does not last 10 hours.</li>
            <li>its worth the price</li>
            <li>, the gloss add just the right shine without being sticky or slimy.  </li>
            <li>these stains are really pigmented!</li>
            <li>The only think I wish is that the wand was more pointed</li>
            <li>but I could not guess the exact color while buying so try to experiment.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last as long as it&#x27;s advertised to, but the colour is great</li>
            <li>The color doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as a stand alone stain, but It&#x27;s perfect for 1 step color and shine especially on the go.  </li>
            <li>The stain itself is very saturated, but the glossy part is pretty much gone after 1/2 an hour.</li>
            <li>This line of staining gloss does stay on very well, isn&#x27;t tacky but isn&#x27;t as smooth as a regular gloss.</li>
            <li>I really like these.  </li>
            <li>I wore this a whole day (drank water,eat food,talk etc..)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really comment on this color because I gave it as a gift to my sister.  </li>
            <li>i really liked this product, it arrived in just a few days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other stains but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The color is good but the texture and the feel of the product is not good.</li>
            <li>I love the color and you very last long thanks .</li>
            <li>However, I love this product and have 3 other colors I love - pink, red, and mauve.  </li>
            <li>but for such a blissful stain gloss, its worth reapplying.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal is much better for long lasting color.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>but it looks more RED than pink.</li>
            <li>It left my lips extremely dry and had a strong taste when removing.</li>
            <li>A really light weight gloss, not even a little sticky that lasts quite some time.</li>
            <li>It was a present for my 15 year old sister and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I love this lip stain because, unlike other stains, it is actually LONG LASTING and having a wand makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li>Much darker than expected.</li>
            <li>and I hope that doesn&#x27;t mean it will not be available anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I have thin lips, and this paddle is nowhere near precise application..</li>
            <li>I find it to be a far better lip stain than the expensive ones I&#x27;ve purchased at Ulta.  </li>
            <li>and I do mean the very first application and the applicator broke off, stained my fingers and ruined my shirt.</li>

            <li> Lips dry out after using this product.</li>
            <li> it was dry.  </li>
            <li> It does not stay for long and gives a watery look, not very shiny</li>
            <li> it did fade out a little tiny bit but</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it last 10 hours, but I don&#x27;t put it on very dark so that might be why.</li>
            <li> Some place it is dark, other places it lightens.</li>
            <li> I might like it, but it did stain the chapped places really dark.</li>
            <li> The applicator is a little odd looking</li>
            <li> No matter how little of this you put on, it looks like you rubbed your lips in kool aid.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product only to be disappointed by the poor construction of the applicator.</li>
            <li> Messy.</li>
            <li> I have ordered at least a dozen of these gloss stains.  </li>
            <li> Not attractive, and it&#x27;s not just this color that it&#x27;s this way with.</li>
            <li> poor quality, poor colors and poor poor poor</li>
            <li> Im sad that they are getting discontinued.  </li>
            <li> weird probably.</li>
            <li> I was so sad to find that it was gone from the stores</li>
            <li> I ran across this as an \\&quot;add on\\&quot; and since I have tried over a dozen expensive lip stains, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I HATE the applicator, which looks like a flocked pipe cleaner folded into a paddle shape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product came really quick. It was a present for my 15 year old sister and she absolutely loves it. I gave it 4 stars because her only complaint was that it would take like 5 coats just to get the right color. Also that it doesn&#x27;t stay on for a long period of time. Other than that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this product will buy a different color as soon as I get freed up money lol !!!!</li>
            <li> Tried to use this stain...and I do mean the very first application and the applicator broke off, stained my fingers and ruined my shirt. I was really excited about this product only to be disappointed by the poor construction of the applicator.</li>
            <li> Nice color and smell. This stuff doesn&#x27;t even last to lunch for me, but that might be because I drink a lot of coffee in the mornings. I HATE the applicator, which looks like a flocked pipe cleaner folded into a paddle shape. I have thin lips, and this paddle is nowhere near precise application.. I constantly have to wipe off the excess, especially in the corners of my mouth. I wish it had come with just a regular flocked doe foot applicator, that would have been so much better. This morning the flocked paddle broke off my wand, so now I guess it&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Such a shame these are getting discontinued!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not cake or flake or dry your lips. A really light weight gloss, not even a little sticky that lasts quite some time. Definnitely not 10 hours... but for such a blissful stain gloss, its worth reapplying. It tastes pleasant, too!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered at least a dozen of these gloss stains.  They come in handy in a pinch.  They are NOT a 10 hour stain.</li>
            <li> Color not as pictured.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on recommendation of Real Simple magazine. It&#x27;s terrible. L&#x27;Oreal is much better for long lasting color. I would not buy this again</li>
            <li> Much darker than expected. Does not apply well. Messy. Thicker. Wand does not work well. Does not stain lips, it is just like lipgloss; continuously needs to be applied.</li>
            <li> Its a really lovely color! The applicator is a little odd looking but it&#x27;s a very cool product. I&#x27;ve tried other stains but this is my favorite. Super cheap too.</li>
            <li> I really like these.  Im sad that they are getting discontinued.  They truly are great products....I really really love them!</li>
            <li> i really liked this product, it arrived in just a few days. smells like wine and tastes strawberries. weird probably. the one thing about this is i have to apply it twice a day. but i definitely will buy again</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I wore this a whole day (drank water,eat food,talk etc..) but it didn&#x27;t go away! it did fade out a little tiny bit but thats obvious! i also love this color! these stains are really pigmented! the applicator is like flexible and easy to apply! there&#x27;s a lot of product inside! i used this for about 1 year applying it almost everyday!&lt;3 I definitely recommend it! its worth the price and also i&#x27;m a makeup artist...just sayin&#x27;</li>
            <li> It actually works! But if you lick your lips it will come off. I was look for a pinkish redish color so I bought this one but it looks more RED than pink. But it is still I a really nice color.</li>
            <li> It feels as if you are using an ink on your lips. Lips dry out after using this product. The color is good but the texture and the feel of the product is not good. The application of the product does not give even effect. Some place it is dark, other places it lightens. Looks patchy. Also it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> No matter how little of this you put on, it looks like you rubbed your lips in kool aid.  Not attractive, and it&#x27;s not just this color that it&#x27;s this way with.</li>
            <li> My daughter was very happy with the color and bought more in different shades.</li>
            <li> Color is bright and pretty, but does not last 10 hours. I have had to reapply during my work day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really comment on this color because I gave it as a gift to my sister.  However, I love this product and have 3 other colors I love - pink, red, and mauve.  I find it to be a far better lip stain than the expensive ones I&#x27;ve purchased at Ulta.  It has a nice satiny sheen, feels moist, and when the finish wears off, leaves nice natural looking color on the lips.  I was so sad to find that it was gone from the stores and I hope that doesn&#x27;t mean it will not be available anywhere.  So glad I found it here.  I stocked up.</li>
            <li> Love it! Beautiful Color! Arrived very fast! Smells nice and color lasts!</li>
            <li> poor quality, poor colors and poor poor poor</li>
            <li> This line of staining gloss does stay on very well, isn&#x27;t tacky but isn&#x27;t as smooth as a regular gloss. The stain itself is very saturated, but the glossy part is pretty much gone after 1/2 an hour. The stain won&#x27;t stay on for 10 hours, but it is long lasting. You could go to work with it in the morning and it&#x27;ll last until lunch, then after lunch another application will last for the rest of the day. The nice thing is the stain doesn&#x27;t come off once it has set, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about someone having lipstick smears if you kiss them.</li>
            <li> Love it. Love how it keeps a glossy look after application.</li>
            <li> I love this lip stain because, unlike other stains, it is actually LONG LASTING and having a wand makes it easier to use. The only think I wish is that the wand was more pointed but I just use a makeup brush and can detail the lining of my lips perfectly. Love the color and, did I mention, it lasts ALL DAY!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice, but 10 Hours, NO.  I told my daughter in law that if I put this with the 16 Hr lipstick, I get 10 minutes of color.</li>
            <li> It seemed as though it had been opened. There was tape around the seal trying to make it look as though it. Was sealed</li>
            <li> I did not like this.  It was streaky looking and flaked off she it was dry.  Dissappointing product, would no buy again</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t come off on my teeth I might like it, but it did stain the chapped places really dark. (I got the brown.) I&#x27;d stick with Maybelline&#x27;s Colorsensational lip stain, and follow with a lip balm. The Colorsensational is really great.</li>
            <li> Omg I love this lipstick it looks very good I love the color and you very last long thanks .</li>
            <li> It left my lips extremely dry and had a strong taste when removing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it last 10 hours, but I don&#x27;t put it on very dark so that might be why. It&#x27;s a gorgeous color though.</li>
            <li> I ran across this as an \\&quot;add on\\&quot; and since I have tried over a dozen expensive lip stains, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Oh my goodness, the unique applicator provides one stroke coverage without even having to look in the mirror.  Not only does it provide beautiful color and coverage, the gloss add just the right shine without being sticky or slimy.  The color doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as a stand alone stain, but It&#x27;s perfect for 1 step color and shine especially on the go.  Good job Maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to order several more at this great price.</li>
            <li> It is just okay. It does not stay for long and gives a watery look, not very shiny though.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it but I could not guess the exact color while buying so try to experiment.&lt;br /&gt;This product is good if you consider the price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as it&#x27;s advertised to, but the colour is great and I like the smell.</li>
