    <ol>
            <li>I wish there was something I could recommend instead, but I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect product myself.  </li>
            <li>I think it would work best with damp hair.</li>
            <li>Not sticky and does a very great job.  </li>
            <li>great product,.</li>
            <li>and it worked great.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Strike one: Changing the formula of a product your customers were perfectly happy with&lt;br /&gt;Strike two:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for curly hair, though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s specifically intended for it.</li>
            <li>This used to be a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great price.  </li>
            <li>Garnier had a great line of putty and paste to add texture and volume to your hair.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, the amount of product has been reduced greatly, and it does not perform as well as it used to.</li>
            <li>It does not feel greasy and styles amazingly well!</li>
            <li>Nice marketing!</li>
            <li>Awesome lightweight yet strong putty.</li>
            <li>Good hold and texture.</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>this good.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my husband&#x27;s hair looking stylish!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my favorite hairgel ever!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing</li>
            <li>I did not get this on Amazon, but this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>Rub the &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; as the hairdresser is fond of saying, between both hands until it is warm.  </li>
            <li>It is a good hair product still, but it isn&#x27;t what many of us had become accustomed too.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get sticky, come off, look shiny, flake, but it is really strong!</li>
            <li>Once dry run your fingers through your hair for great hold and great looking hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this on sale at the grocery store for $2.50 and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t pay more because it&#x27;s going in the trash.  </li>
            <li>the top part of men&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>If you are trying to achieve a wavy beach look, I would keep searching for a better product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Which, I&#x27;m told, works for me. :)</li>
            <li>My favorite hair product.  </li>
            <li>Still here I am buying six more because I like the way this stuff looks with my hair</li>
            <li>It had better holding properties and was more waxy.  </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s more evaporative, requiring the application of more product.  </li>
            <li>But the fact remains, I believe for many it still is a usable product.</li>
            <li>I do get why many people are complaining, and I don&#x27;t disagree with them, it hasn&#x27;t changed for the better, and I would be very happy if they went back to what it once was.</li>
            <li>and I prefer this Surfer Power Putty better.</li>
            <li>The old formula was a GREAT product, and very unique.</li>
            <li>Even though this was a couple dollars more than the &#x27;original&#x27; Garnier Surfer Hair</li>
            <li>Run the product through your hair with a light touch.  </li>
            <li>This pomade compares favorably to those available at hairdresser supply stores and salons for quadruple the price.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a great hold and the putty is actually closer to gel.  </li>
            <li>They also changed the formula of the product as well and gave it a fragrance (it used to be fragrance free).</li>
            <li>It has great hold and also washes out more cleanly than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>First, the cream itself was much better before.  </li>
            <li>A couple of years ago Garnier changed the formula of its original Surf Hair product to this..</li>
            <li>It just makes your hair look cool.</li>
            <li>There were a handful of different types, and they all worked fairly well and came in 5 oz containers.</li>
            <li>The real kick in the head is that they screwed with the formula making this more oily with a girly smell.</li>
            <li>The original Surf Hair gave good hold and a finish matte, just like you came out of the ocean and let your hair sun dry.</li>
            <li>I have been using this hair product for several years &amp; LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I thought this was a case of \\&quot;new look, same great formula\\</li>
            <li>I have alot of hair and a little dap of this stuff works great.  </li>
            <li>For the cost, its worth it to try and see if you like it.</li>
            <li>* far more expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the old version of this product every day for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this hair styling cream better than any other I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The new product isn&#x27;t as good, has unnecessary perfume, costs more per ounce, and comes in a container with more plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it just doesn&#x27;t feel right going on.  </li>
            <li>This was a great hair styling product prior to the massive change in the quality and quantity of this hair cream.  </li>
            <li>Holds well, doesn&#x27;t have a lot of shine, very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the discontinued Surf Hair is like, but according to the reviews I&#x27;ve read, it probably would do exactly what I want.  </li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s more for styling (swooping to the side or back)</li>
            <li>tub was also priced higher than the 5 oz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny.</li>
            <li>The price is the same or more for maybe 25% of the product.</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s 60% of what they used to give you), and they made the container larger to appear like they are giving you more.</li>
            <li>After trying numerous salon and grocery store products in an attempt to find a replacement for Surf Hair, I have found a product that I like even better, and it&#x27;s inexpensive:</li>
            <li>it comes half empty but the product is good :)</li>
            <li>The previous product has a natural smell, was not sticky and worked amazingly well!  </li>
            <li>any positive reviews must work for Garnier.</li>
            <li>There are so many hollow parts on this package, it&#x27;s very deceptive.</li>
            <li>Absolute junk.</li>
            <li>remember, we&#x27;re all free to choose a different hair product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very liquidy and seems to disappear into my head when I apply it.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Their old surfer hair was not only BETTER, but you got 5oz of product.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully if enough customers voice their opinions, they will return to the old product and its more generous size.</li>
            <li>And it seems to not get as flat throughout the day (I have extremely fine hair).</li>
            <li>First, you need less and it is more of a Putty while the other brand had more of a gel like feel to it than a putty.</li>
            <li>I was a long term user of the original Surf Style hair, and it worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>After a while of using this new version, I began to notice my hair was getting unusually frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy these when Garnier sold them for less with more ounces.  </li>
            <li>But half the product for more money than before?</li>
            <li>I love all Garnier products, and I&#x27;ve tried them all and more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I have tried both versions of this product (the older Surf) and now the this new formula</li>
            <li>I was so upset when they changed that I purchased as much of the old product that I could find.  </li>
            <li>keep the style for more than a few hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard.</li>
            <li>It also simply can&#x27;t give the bold hair styles of the old product.  </li>
            <li>so I bought the new version.  </li>
            <li>This new product pales in comparison to the now discontinued &amp;#34;Garnier</li>
            <li>but I find it to be clean no real oil feel.</li>
            <li>to 3.6 oz a few years ago, so I run through this pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>This new product is garbage compared to the old Surf Hair.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old container was 5.1 oz, the new container is 3.0oz.</li>
            <li>They charge the same (or more) for 40% less</li>
            <li>be fooled by the large container, inside is a smaller container the size of a film canister.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead of destroying a perfectly good product couldn&#x27;t they have just raised the price a little?</li>
            <li>This is an inferior product in a larger container to conceal the fact that they are giving you less product for a significant price increase!</li>
            <li>As others have said, a complete letdown.  </li>
            <li>AS THE OLD VERSION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have moved on to Old Spice Unruly.</li>
            <li>For people considering this product and seeing the many negative reviews, here is my two cents.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the old 5 oz version of this product:[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m done until they bring the old stuff</li>
            <li>This is perfect for me as I have thick and coarse hair, and I keep it short and with a messy half-spikey thing.  </li>
            <li>Other reviewers are right, the new bulky packaging is a complete scam.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not exactly the same, but I&#x27;m able to achieve results similar to the \\&quot;old\\&quot; Surf Style.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the original in the round container anywhere</li>
            <li>Garnier not only reduced the amount from 5.1 to 3 ounces, but also packaged it in a larger container, which seems pretty deceptive.  </li>
            <li>For a while I tried to buy up the old version and switched back and forth, still can&#x27;t get used to this inferior new version.</li>
            <li>bring back old formula!!  </li>
            <li>Echoing many of the previously shared sentiments: increase the size of the plastic casing, decrease the quantity of the actual product from 5.1oz to 3 oz (41%) and use arguably an inferior mix of ingredients to produce a far inferior product that actually requires the consumer to use more to get less hold than from the previous formula.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is an update to that original product with a larger container, which for me is less convenient.</li>
            <li>finally, ejected for flagrant unsportsmanlike conduct: INTENTIONALLY DESIGNING THE NEW CONTAINER TO DECEIVE PEOPLE INTO THINKING</li>
            <li>None of these things are the same with the new \\&quot;surfer hair\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li>Obviously Garnier wants you to think you&#x27;re getting the same amount of product as before.  </li>
            <li>Bring back the old formla!</li>
            <li>The major drawback is that the tub size changed from 5 oz.</li>
            <li>Not sure that it&#x27;s strong enough to create surfer hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one thing to mess up a great formula, but to CHARGE MORE FOR LESS is just bad business practice.</li>
            <li>They are dishonest, cheap swindlers.</li>
            <li>At least it&#x27;s cheap..</li>
            <li>In reading all of the negative reviews, I&#x27;m aware that the person using it is probably using too much.  </li>
            <li>Since I have wavy hair, my hair curls up instantly into soft waves.  </li>
            <li>My husband has an old fashioned hairstyle with a deep side part.</li>
            <li>This product is a total ripoff compared to the old product.</li>
            <li>As well, the product is just not nearly the same as far as leaving a nice mess that stays messy and does fail/fall.  </li>
            <li>They recently repackaged them in these new containers to only hold 3oz</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame they changed it as I had been using the original for at least 2 years now</li>
            <li>It took me way too long to make the connection that it was the surf hair, because I was so used to the old version which not only eliminated hair frizz, but it also kept my hair in place and looking natural as if there wasn&#x27;t any product in it.</li>
            <li>The new product is thin, smelly and doesn&#x27;t hold like the original version.  </li>
            <li>And on top of the the product packaging is deceptive, container the same or slightly larger than the previous product but barely half the amount of product inside.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the same holding power as the old version, and it performs very differently.</li>
            <li>At first, when you put it in, if you put it in wet, it holds things in place almost like a gel, but it&#x27;s soft, and then if you just dig your fingers in, it&#x27;ll make your hair soft but still maintain that messy look.</li>
            <li>This putty let&#x27;s me get more a messy look to my hair and not have it feel crunchy or stiff, but have some hold to it.</li>
            <li>the day they changed the formula: many fewer days of styling from 1 package, a more watery viscosity (less like a paste than the previous version) that holds style less well and dries more slowly, a terrible new synthetic mango-like scent, etc.</li>
            <li>give you less product then before, the container is very deceiving.</li>
            <li>I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to wash out each day and doesn&#x27;t make a mess or feel sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li>Old Surf hair was fantastic, this new &amp;#34;Surfer Hair&amp;#34; is just terrible - it smells, doesn&#x27;t work, has funny oily finish, and costs way too much.</li>
            <li>, the new container has a hollow shell around the portion that actually contains product.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The price is the same or more for maybe 25% of the product.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s 60% of what they used to give you), and they made the container larger to appear like they are giving you more.</li>
            <li> After trying numerous salon and grocery store products in an attempt to find a replacement for Surf Hair, I have found a product that I like even better, and it&#x27;s inexpensive:</li>
            <li> it comes half empty but the product is good :)</li>
            <li> The previous product has a natural smell, was not sticky and worked amazingly well!  </li>
            <li> any positive reviews must work for Garnier.</li>
            <li> There are so many hollow parts on this package, it&#x27;s very deceptive.</li>
            <li> Absolute junk.</li>
            <li> remember, we&#x27;re all free to choose a different hair product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very liquidy and seems to disappear into my head when I apply it.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Their old surfer hair was not only BETTER, but you got 5oz of product.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully if enough customers voice their opinions, they will return to the old product and its more generous size.</li>
            <li> And it seems to not get as flat throughout the day (I have extremely fine hair).</li>
            <li> First, you need less and it is more of a Putty while the other brand had more of a gel like feel to it than a putty.</li>
            <li> I was a long term user of the original Surf Style hair, and it worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> After a while of using this new version, I began to notice my hair was getting unusually frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy these when Garnier sold them for less with more ounces.  </li>
            <li> But half the product for more money than before?</li>
            <li> I love all Garnier products, and I&#x27;ve tried them all and more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I have tried both versions of this product (the older Surf) and now the this new formula</li>
            <li> I was so upset when they changed that I purchased as much of the old product that I could find.  </li>
            <li> keep the style for more than a few hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard.</li>
            <li> It also simply can&#x27;t give the bold hair styles of the old product.  </li>
            <li> so I bought the new version.  </li>
            <li> This new product pales in comparison to the now discontinued &amp;#34;Garnier</li>
            <li> but I find it to be clean no real oil feel.</li>
            <li> to 3.6 oz a few years ago, so I run through this pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This new product is garbage compared to the old Surf Hair.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old container was 5.1 oz, the new container is 3.0oz.</li>
            <li> They charge the same (or more) for 40% less</li>
            <li> be fooled by the large container, inside is a smaller container the size of a film canister.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead of destroying a perfectly good product couldn&#x27;t they have just raised the price a little?</li>
            <li> This is an inferior product in a larger container to conceal the fact that they are giving you less product for a significant price increase!</li>
            <li> As others have said, a complete letdown.  </li>
            <li> AS THE OLD VERSION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have moved on to Old Spice Unruly.</li>
            <li> For people considering this product and seeing the many negative reviews, here is my two cents.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the old 5 oz version of this product:[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m done until they bring the old stuff</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me as I have thick and coarse hair, and I keep it short and with a messy half-spikey thing.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers are right, the new bulky packaging is a complete scam.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly the same, but I&#x27;m able to achieve results similar to the \\&quot;old\\&quot; Surf Style.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the original in the round container anywhere</li>
            <li> Garnier not only reduced the amount from 5.1 to 3 ounces, but also packaged it in a larger container, which seems pretty deceptive.  </li>
            <li> For a while I tried to buy up the old version and switched back and forth, still can&#x27;t get used to this inferior new version.</li>
            <li> bring back old formula!!  </li>
            <li> Echoing many of the previously shared sentiments: increase the size of the plastic casing, decrease the quantity of the actual product from 5.1oz to 3 oz (41%) and use arguably an inferior mix of ingredients to produce a far inferior product that actually requires the consumer to use more to get less hold than from the previous formula.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is an update to that original product with a larger container, which for me is less convenient.</li>
            <li> finally, ejected for flagrant unsportsmanlike conduct: INTENTIONALLY DESIGNING THE NEW CONTAINER TO DECEIVE PEOPLE INTO THINKING</li>
            <li> None of these things are the same with the new \\&quot;surfer hair\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li> Obviously Garnier wants you to think you&#x27;re getting the same amount of product as before.  </li>
            <li> Bring back the old formla!</li>
            <li> The major drawback is that the tub size changed from 5 oz.</li>
            <li> Not sure that it&#x27;s strong enough to create surfer hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one thing to mess up a great formula, but to CHARGE MORE FOR LESS is just bad business practice.</li>
            <li> They are dishonest, cheap swindlers.</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s cheap..</li>
            <li> In reading all of the negative reviews, I&#x27;m aware that the person using it is probably using too much.  </li>
            <li> Since I have wavy hair, my hair curls up instantly into soft waves.  </li>
            <li> My husband has an old fashioned hairstyle with a deep side part.</li>
            <li> This product is a total ripoff compared to the old product.</li>
            <li> As well, the product is just not nearly the same as far as leaving a nice mess that stays messy and does fail/fall.  </li>
            <li> They recently repackaged them in these new containers to only hold 3oz</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame they changed it as I had been using the original for at least 2 years now</li>
            <li> It took me way too long to make the connection that it was the surf hair, because I was so used to the old version which not only eliminated hair frizz, but it also kept my hair in place and looking natural as if there wasn&#x27;t any product in it.</li>
            <li> The new product is thin, smelly and doesn&#x27;t hold like the original version.  </li>
            <li> And on top of the the product packaging is deceptive, container the same or slightly larger than the previous product but barely half the amount of product inside.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the same holding power as the old version, and it performs very differently.</li>
            <li> At first, when you put it in, if you put it in wet, it holds things in place almost like a gel, but it&#x27;s soft, and then if you just dig your fingers in, it&#x27;ll make your hair soft but still maintain that messy look.</li>
            <li> This putty let&#x27;s me get more a messy look to my hair and not have it feel crunchy or stiff, but have some hold to it.</li>
            <li> the day they changed the formula: many fewer days of styling from 1 package, a more watery viscosity (less like a paste than the previous version) that holds style less well and dries more slowly, a terrible new synthetic mango-like scent, etc.</li>
            <li> give you less product then before, the container is very deceiving.</li>
            <li> I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to wash out each day and doesn&#x27;t make a mess or feel sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> Old Surf hair was fantastic, this new &amp;#34;Surfer Hair&amp;#34; is just terrible - it smells, doesn&#x27;t work, has funny oily finish, and costs way too much.</li>
            <li> , the new container has a hollow shell around the portion that actually contains product.  </li>
            <li> I have read in the other reviews that some are switching to Old Spice Unruly.</li>
            <li> The new formulation of Surf Hair, which is now called &amp;#34;Surfer Hair,&amp;#34; is a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really seem to do much to my hair besides give it the occasional wave in random places.</li>
            <li> * has far less hold&lt;br</li>
            <li> the product feels different and smells different and there is less in the container even though the jar is bigger.</li>
            <li> Prepare for crazy bed-head every morning though, comical even.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Hair is soft to the touch, not greasy or stiff.  </li>
            <li> Put on dry hair after styling.  </li>
            <li> The texture of this stuff is gooey and even though I only used a little bit and warmed it in my hands for several minutes, it didn&#x27;t accomplish anything other than making my hair look like I hadn&#x27;t washed in a month.  </li>
            <li> You get less, and the formula is different.</li>
            <li> The container is smaller and the whipped consistency is less dense.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it has gone from 5 oz to 3oz, so the content has been cut almost in half.  </li>
            <li> Can make bad haircuts look better.  </li>
            <li> I used it everyday prior to their formula and container change.  </li>
            <li> I used to be a fan of Garnier Fructis Fiber Gum Putty, but apparently that product has been discontinued (and the few third party sellers here that have it are charging ridiculous prices for it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only used a small amount of this.</li>
            <li> Every other paste-like product I&#x27;ve used leaves a residue that feels like it is harming my hair.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have stated, Garnier Fructis discontinued \\&quot;Surf Hair\\&quot; in the 5.1oz container and replaced it with this \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; version in a 3oz container.</li>
            <li> Does not look crunchy or wet!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter what other people think, it just depends on how they use</li>
            <li> Surf Head Extreme Texturizing Paste.</li>
            <li> this new Surfer Hair Power Putty is a poor substitute.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste a single penny on it.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I use a very small amount, smaller than the &amp;#34;dime size&amp;#34; recommended on the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Like a few other people, don&#x27;t be turned off by the 1 star reviews.</li>
            <li> Plus it has less product per jar.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the formula has been changed and it&#x27;s turned into a completely different product with a similar name.  </li>
            <li> Garnier seriously changed the container so it looks bigger, but shrunk the contents by almost half.</li>
            <li> Plus the packaging is twice the size and the volume of product was cut almost in half.</li>
            <li> It was a little sticky.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> To make things worse, the smaller 3.6 oz.</li>
            <li> I used surf hair for years, but this product is going into the garbage after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Helps if you use it for a few days without shampooing your hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Honestly, This version is absolutely awful.</li>
            <li> ...because this company is screwing their loyal customer base.</li>
            <li> Very little holding power</li>
            <li> just not sure why I was billed for 2 after I ordered 1,.</li>
            <li> One thing&#x27;s for sure, this stuff is terrible.  </li>
            <li> Cutting the amount of product nearly in half&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very disappointing because it was almost half the size of the original and more expensive but worst of all I feel it didn&#x27;t work as well either.  </li>
            <li> I really just wanted something to make my hair look not so horrible after swimming and such.</li>
            <li> , I feel this company is dishonest and unethical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> At first I thought that it was not going to be a horrible change.</li>
            <li> The hold is way, way, way worse.</li>
            <li> This product is the absolute worst.  </li>
            <li> This new stuff is awful.</li>
            <li> new stuff is horrible and smells like cloying old-lady perfume.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked by how little product you get in a jar when considering the price.</li>
            <li> They changed the formula, making it less hold, adding a disgusting perfume scent, oily consistency, and making the container appear larger while cutting the amount by 50% AND raising the price!</li>
            <li> but kinda weird.</li>
            <li> think that should be enough of why not to buy this horrible product</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they changed the packaging and reduced the ounces and raised the price.  </li>
            <li> WTF Garnier?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like glue and instead of separating my layers, it bunched my hair up and made it look really dirty.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> this crap.</li>
            <li> I hate gel and mousse, and that&#x27;s what Surfer Hair is like.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the reviewers who&#x27;ve said this stuff is awful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Brilliant for marketing, terrible for the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a horrible move by Garnier...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The old formula was a GREAT product, and very unique. Good hold and texture. This new stuff is awful. You get less, and the formula is different. The hold is way, way, way worse.</li>
            <li> Keeps my husband&#x27;s hair looking stylish!</li>
            <li> Garnier ruined this product.  I used it everyday prior to their formula and container change.  The previous product has a natural smell, was not sticky and worked amazingly well!  I was so upset when they changed that I purchased as much of the old product that I could find.  I have now made it through the five (5) tubs I purchased and am searching for a replacement.  DO NOT BUY this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this makes my hair:&lt;br /&gt;-Sticky&lt;br /&gt;-Not keep the style for more than a few hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They give you less product then before, the container is very deceiving.</li>
            <li> great product,. just not sure why I was billed for 2 after I ordered 1,. I recieved 2,. but kinda weird.</li>
            <li> Even though this was a couple dollars more than the &#x27;original&#x27; Garnier Surfer Hair I couldn&#x27;t find the original in the round container anywhere so I bought the new version.  It&#x27;s very disappointing because it was almost half the size of the original and more expensive but worst of all I feel it didn&#x27;t work as well either.  I will not buy this version anymore and currently looking for another product to replace this one.  It&#x27;s a shame they changed it as I had been using the original for at least 2 years now and it worked great.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the reviewers who&#x27;ve said this stuff is awful.  I can&#x27;t imagine what I&#x27;ll use it for.  I wanted something that would give my shoulder length layered hair piecey separation. This product isn&#x27;t it.  It&#x27;s like glue and instead of separating my layers, it bunched my hair up and made it look really dirty.  I ended up putting my hair in an updo, even though I had just washed it the night before.  The texture of this stuff is gooey and even though I only used a little bit and warmed it in my hands for several minutes, it didn&#x27;t accomplish anything other than making my hair look like I hadn&#x27;t washed in a month.  Yuck!  I bought this on sale at the grocery store for $2.50 and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t pay more because it&#x27;s going in the trash.  I don&#x27;t know what the discontinued Surf Hair is like, but according to the reviews I&#x27;ve read, it probably would do exactly what I want.  This product serves no purpose I know of.  It doesn&#x27;t add texture, which would work for some hairstyles, it only adds gooey gloppyness (is that a word,lol?).  Don&#x27;t buy this stuff.  I wish there was something I could recommend instead, but I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect product myself.  One thing&#x27;s for sure, this stuff is terrible.  Don&#x27;t waste a single penny on it.</li>
            <li> Awesome lightweight yet strong putty. Smells amazing</li>
            <li> Absolute junk.Don&#x27;t waste your money. My hair felt filthy,dirty after using this.Bring back the old formla!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re all in agreement.  The new product isn&#x27;t as good, has unnecessary perfume, costs more per ounce, and comes in a container with more plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My question is, what product did you replace Surf Hair with?  I&#x27;m looking for a similar product and haven&#x27;t found one I like yet.  Please add replies in the comments.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Holds well, doesn&#x27;t have a lot of shine, very reasonable cost. Smells nice too. For the cost, its worth it to try and see if you like it. I would say it&#x27;s more for styling (swooping to the side or back) the top part of men&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t received my Amazon order yet, however, I have tried this product.  It works well.  In reading all of the negative reviews, I&#x27;m aware that the person using it is probably using too much.  I use a very small amount, smaller than the &amp;#34;dime size&amp;#34; recommended on the packaging.  Rub the &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; as the hairdresser is fond of saying, between both hands until it is warm.  Run the product through your hair with a light touch.  Since I have wavy hair, my hair curls up instantly into soft waves.  I let it dry naturally.  Hair is soft to the touch, not greasy or stiff.  The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the packaging.  Would have preferred a ceramic jar to the plastic.  This pomade compares favorably to those available at hairdresser supply stores and salons for quadruple the price.  Pomade is pomade. I didn&#x27;t notice any fragrance in the product I purchased.  Buy it.</li>
            <li> Echoing many of the previously shared sentiments: increase the size of the plastic casing, decrease the quantity of the actual product from 5.1oz to 3 oz (41%) and use arguably an inferior mix of ingredients to produce a far inferior product that actually requires the consumer to use more to get less hold than from the previous formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliant for marketing, terrible for the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But remember, we&#x27;re all free to choose a different hair product but we have no control over the monetary regime.</li>
            <li> I tried this product during one of my summer beach trips. I really just wanted something to make my hair look not so horrible after swimming and such. I was shocked by how little product you get in a jar when considering the price. I only used a small amount of this. It didn&#x27;t really seem to do much to my hair besides give it the occasional wave in random places. It was a little sticky. I think it would work best with damp hair. If you are trying to achieve a wavy beach look, I would keep searching for a better product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I used to be a fan of Garnier Fructis Fiber Gum Putty, but apparently that product has been discontinued (and the few third party sellers here that have it are charging ridiculous prices for it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this new Surfer Hair Power Putty is a poor substitute.  Very little holding power and it just doesn&#x27;t feel right going on.  As others have said, a complete letdown.  And on top of the the product packaging is deceptive, container the same or slightly larger than the previous product but barely half the amount of product inside.  I bought this once but definitely won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strike one: Changing the formula of a product your customers were perfectly happy with&lt;br /&gt;Strike two: Raising the price&lt;br /&gt;Strike three: Cutting the amount of product nearly in half&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, ejected for flagrant unsportsmanlike conduct: INTENTIONALLY DESIGNING THE NEW CONTAINER TO DECEIVE PEOPLE INTO THINKING THEY ARE GETTING THE SAME AMOUNT OF PRODUCT AS THE OLD VERSION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the new container has a hollow shell around the portion that actually contains product.  Obviously Garnier wants you to think you&#x27;re getting the same amount of product as before.  You&#x27;re not.  Not even close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disgusting and shameful.  Anyone have any suggestions for an alternative product?</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;new\\&quot; version is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 40% smaller&lt;br /&gt;* has far less hold&lt;br /&gt;* is not actually a putty but a gel&lt;br /&gt;* far more expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that should be enough of why not to buy this horrible product but if not here is more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garnier ruined everything about this product. At first I thought that it was not going to be a horrible change. They threw me off with the deceptive packaging that made it look bigger when it was actually 40% smaller. After a while of using this new version, I began to notice my hair was getting unusually frizzy.  It took me way too long to make the connection that it was the surf hair, because I was so used to the old version which not only eliminated hair frizz, but it also kept my hair in place and looking natural as if there wasn&#x27;t any product in it. None of these things are the same with the new \\&quot;surfer hair\\&quot; version. I am beyond furious at Garnier for their deceptive sales tactics. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A GARNIER PRODUCT EVER AGAIN. They are dishonest, cheap swindlers. I have read in the other reviews that some are switching to Old Spice Unruly. I will be doing the same. Goodbye Garnier.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for seven or eight years. It has great hold and also washes out more cleanly than any other product I&#x27;ve used. Every other paste-like product I&#x27;ve used leaves a residue that feels like it is harming my hair. Not this one. It&#x27;s great for curly hair, though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s specifically intended for it. The major drawback is that the tub size changed from 5 oz. to 3.6 oz a few years ago, so I run through this pretty quickly. To make things worse, the smaller 3.6 oz. tub was also priced higher than the 5 oz. one was. So I&#x27;m constantly on the lookout for something else to switch to.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Got2B line for years before trying this last week. I must say for the price this works well with my short cropped hair to give it some style. Not sure that it&#x27;s strong enough to create surfer hair. Would not work well on longer hair but I find it to be clean no real oil feel.</li>
            <li> The new product is thin, smelly and doesn&#x27;t hold like the original version.  Plus it has less product per jar.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product that my husband will use!</li>
            <li> This used to be a great product.  Unfortunately, the formula has been changed and it&#x27;s turned into a completely different product with a similar name.  It doesn&#x27;t have a great hold and the putty is actually closer to gel.  It&#x27;s very liquidy and seems to disappear into my head when I apply it.  I used surf hair for years, but this product is going into the garbage after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny. I&#x27;ve tried like a zillion different products, but I keep coming back to this stuff. It&#x27;s not hard. It just makes your hair look cool. At first, when you put it in, if you put it in wet, it holds things in place almost like a gel, but it&#x27;s soft, and then if you just dig your fingers in, it&#x27;ll make your hair soft but still maintain that messy look. Which, I&#x27;m told, works for me. :)</li>
            <li> I love this hair styling cream better than any other I&#x27;ve used.  If you want to spike your hair a bit, you won&#x27;t regret trying Fructis Power Putty.</li>
            <li> Old Surf hair was fantastic, this new &amp;#34;Surfer Hair&amp;#34; is just terrible - it smells, doesn&#x27;t work, has funny oily finish, and costs way too much.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have stated, Garnier Fructis discontinued \\&quot;Surf Hair\\&quot; in the 5.1oz container and replaced it with this \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; version in a 3oz container. The price is the same or more for maybe 25% of the product. The container is smaller and the whipped consistency is less dense. This new product is garbage compared to the old Surf Hair. Trying to find all the left over stock I can and buy it up since it was the only product that worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING BACK SURF HAIR!!!!</li>
            <li> I was a long term user of the original Surf Style hair, and it worked very well for me. This product is an update to that original product with a larger container, which for me is less convenient. As well, the product is just not nearly the same as far as leaving a nice mess that stays messy and does fail/fall.  This product is un-usable to me now and I have moved on to Old Spice Unruly. It&#x27;s not exactly the same, but I&#x27;m able to achieve results similar to the \\&quot;old\\&quot; Surf Style.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product.  Doesn&#x27;t take much.  Put on dry hair after styling.  Can make bad haircuts look better.  Rub some on your fingertips and put it where you want the hair to go.  Not too heavy.  Lasts a long time.  I love all Garnier products, and I&#x27;ve tried them all and more expensive ones. Great price.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these when Garnier sold them for less with more ounces.  Unfortunately, they changed the packaging and reduced the ounces and raised the price.  Still here I am buying six more because I like the way this stuff looks with my hair and it&#x27;s easy to wash out each day and doesn&#x27;t make a mess or feel sticky or stiff.  It would get 5 stars if the price per ounce was lower!  So it gets 3 stars because of the price.</li>
            <li> This product is the absolute worst.  It leaves my hair frizzy and if I touch it, leaves a sticky residue on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the large container, inside is a smaller container the size of a film canister.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay a dime for this junk.</li>
            <li> I used the old version of this product every day for many years. It was very obvious (not just from the packaging) the day they changed the formula: many fewer days of styling from 1 package, a more watery viscosity (less like a paste than the previous version) that holds style less well and dries more slowly, a terrible new synthetic mango-like scent, etc. Very disappointing. For a while I tried to buy up the old version and switched back and forth, still can&#x27;t get used to this inferior new version. Other reviewers are right, the new bulky packaging is a complete scam. WTF Garnier?</li>
            <li> Not sticky and does a very great job.  Does not look crunchy or wet! Once dry run your fingers through your hair for great hold and great looking hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair product for several years &amp; LOVE it! It does not weigh my hair down. It does not feel greasy and styles amazingly well!</li>
            <li> GARNIER RUINED THIS PRODUCT. They changed the formula, making it less hold, adding a disgusting perfume scent, oily consistency, and making the container appear larger while cutting the amount by 50% AND raising the price! Never buying any garner products ever again! Nice marketing!</li>
            <li> ...because this company is screwing their loyal customer base. This is an inferior product in a larger container to conceal the fact that they are giving you less product for a significant price increase!</li>
            <li> Their old surfer hair was not only BETTER, but you got 5oz of product.  Now you get an INFERIOR product in a LARGER container but with only 3oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talk about deceiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never buying another Garnier product again.  It&#x27;s one thing to mess up a great formula, but to CHARGE MORE FOR LESS is just bad business practice.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t buy it...any positive reviews must work for Garnier. Take a deuce in your hand, rub your hands together, put it in your hair and wa-la. No hold and smells like..well you get the idea. At least it&#x27;s cheap..oh wait</li>
            <li> This was a great hair styling product prior to the massive change in the quality and quantity of this hair cream.  First, the cream itself was much better before.  It had better holding properties and was more waxy.  Now it&#x27;s more evaporative, requiring the application of more product.  It also simply can&#x27;t give the bold hair styles of the old product.  Lastly, it has gone from 5 oz to 3oz, so the content has been cut almost in half.  Hopefully if enough customers voice their opinions, they will return to the old product and its more generous size.</li>
            <li> Garnier seriously changed the container so it looks bigger, but shrunk the contents by almost half. They charge the same (or more) for 40% less product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old container was 5.1 oz, the new container is 3.0oz. They tried to sneak one by on consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying their products again, I feel this company is dishonest and unethical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll see if I can put up a picture.</li>
            <li> For people considering this product and seeing the many negative reviews, here is my two cents. It is a good hair product still, but it isn&#x27;t what many of us had become accustomed too. But the fact remains, I believe for many it still is a usable product. I do get why many people are complaining, and I don&#x27;t disagree with them, it hasn&#x27;t changed for the better, and I would be very happy if they went back to what it once was.</li>
            <li> I have alot of hair and a little dap of this stuff works great.  Excellant price.</li>
            <li> Depends on your hair type.  This is perfect for me as I have thick and coarse hair, and I keep it short and with a messy half-spikey thing.  I can style with this and it won&#x27;t be shiny, like my hair came out of bed lookin&#x27; this good.  Helps if you use it for a few days without shampooing your hair in the shower. Prepare for crazy bed-head every morning though, comical even.</li>
            <li> it comes half empty but the product is good :)</li>
            <li> Garnier had a great line of putty and paste to add texture and volume to your hair. There were a handful of different types, and they all worked fairly well and came in 5 oz containers. Here&#x27;s the old 5 oz version of this product:[[ASIN:B004ZWMDZ4 Garnier Fructis Surf Hair Texture Paste, 5.1 oz]] They recently repackaged them in these new containers to only hold 3oz (that&#x27;s 60% of what they used to give you), and they made the container larger to appear like they are giving you more. There are so many hollow parts on this package, it&#x27;s very deceptive. They also changed the formula of the product as well and gave it a fragrance (it used to be fragrance free). It&#x27;s a shame, and it&#x27;s nothing like it used to be. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> My husband has an old fashioned hairstyle with a deep side part. This keeps his hair in place all day and doesn&#x27;t let his bangs separate and flop into his face! I don&#x27;t see how you&#x27;d use this to style for a &amp;#34;surfer hair&amp;#34; look, though.</li>
            <li> This new product pales in comparison to the now discontinued &amp;#34;Garnier Fructis Surf Hair Texture Paste&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they say - &amp;#34;if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I did not get this on Amazon, but this product is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t get sticky, come off, look shiny, flake, but it is really strong! It doesn&#x27;t matter what other people think, it just depends on how they use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite hairgel ever!</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago Garnier changed the formula of its original Surf Hair product to this..this crap. Honestly, This version is absolutely awful. It is nothing like the prior version. The original Surf Hair gave good hold and a finish matte, just like you came out of the ocean and let your hair sun dry. This stuff is greasy and smelly and not matte at all. Plus the packaging is twice the size and the volume of product was cut almost in half. This was a horrible move by Garnier... they lost this customer.</li>
            <li> Like a few other people, don&#x27;t be turned off by the 1 star reviews. I have tried both versions of this product (the older Surf) and now the this new formula and I prefer this Surfer Power Putty better. First, you need less and it is more of a Putty while the other brand had more of a gel like feel to it than a putty. This putty let&#x27;s me get more a messy look to my hair and not have it feel crunchy or stiff, but have some hold to it. And it seems to not get as flat throughout the day (I have extremely fine hair).</li>
            <li> bring back old formula!!  new stuff is horrible and smells like cloying old-lady perfume.  I thought this was a case of \\&quot;new look, same great formula\\&quot; but it is not.  the product feels different and smells different and there is less in the container even though the jar is bigger.</li>
            <li> I know inflation is raising prices of almost everything we can buy. But half the product for more money than before? Seriously? The real kick in the head is that they screwed with the formula making this more oily with a girly smell. Forget it. I&#x27;ve been buying Garnier products for the last decade but I&#x27;m done until they bring the old stuff back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of destroying a perfectly good product couldn&#x27;t they have just raised the price a little?</li>
            <li> This product is a total ripoff compared to the old product. As others have mentioned, the amount of product has been reduced greatly, and it does not perform as well as it used to.</li>
            <li> The new formulation of Surf Hair, which is now called &amp;#34;Surfer Hair,&amp;#34; is a huge disappointment. The product used to be a matte paste, but now it&#x27;s a gel. It doesn&#x27;t have the same holding power as the old version, and it performs very differently. I hate gel and mousse, and that&#x27;s what Surfer Hair is like. Garnier not only reduced the amount from 5.1 to 3 ounces, but also packaged it in a larger container, which seems pretty deceptive.  UPDATE: After trying numerous salon and grocery store products in an attempt to find a replacement for Surf Hair, I have found a product that I like even better, and it&#x27;s inexpensive: Surf Head Extreme Texturizing Paste. Now I just hope that they don&#x27;t discontinue or change the formula for this product....</li>
