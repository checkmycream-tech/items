            <li>Shiseido Ts instant Eye and Lip Makeup Remover Makeup Remover, is good one with best price in online works good</li>
            <li>The solution soaks into the cotton ball to allow wiping off all mascara effectively.  </li>
            <li>Not too oily or watery, it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on the skin, but seems to hydrate and moisturize the skin around the eyes nicely.  </li>
            <li>My Aunt gave me a sample of this makeup remover &amp; it is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, my mascara and eye liner came off so easy.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this remover, I just love it.</li>
            <li>love  shiseido products and this is one of the best removers for their waterproof/ regular mascara.</li>
            <li>Authentic product.</li>
            <li>So it might be more money</li>
            <li>I mostly use waterproof eye makeup and this + a cotton pad takes it right off.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most effective and without using much of it even with a full eye make</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>It has a subtle scent, if any, and the applicator is perfect for getting the right amount.  </li>
            <li>My skin does not usually react well with make up removers, but Shisheido&#x27;s works like magic.</li>
            <li>this to me is worth the splurge.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li>Sent right away</li>
            <li>Easy to use, washes off clearly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much Shiseido!</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;m not really paying much more for it than a bargain remover I have to use 9 drops of.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and does not burn or irritate my eyes at all.</li>
            <li>Yet it does not tug on the eyes and is gentle</li>
            <li>Gentle for eyes and lips.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ve been using Shiseido facial cleanser, moisturizer and the such but for eye makeup remover</li>
            <li>My husband pointed out if I use less of it &amp; it does a better job</li>
            <li>It is really the best eye and lip make up remover!I use it for years and will use forever!It lasts a long time,and don;t think is expensive,and worse each penny!</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.  </li>
            <li>This item came looking opened and used with some old tape on it.  </li>
            <li>There are many other products on the market that work as well and cost much less.</li>
            <li>I have a very serious eye issue, I trust this product completely to make it possible for me to use it safely.</li>
            <li>But this product has no damage or hurt or any uncomfortable feelings to my eyes and so fast to clean my eye makeup/</li>

            <li> My Aunt gave me a sample of this makeup remover &amp; it is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. One swish on a cotton ball takes off my waterproof mascara &amp; liquid eye liner. My eyes used to get rubbed pink with other make up removers. I had to rub &amp; rub to get my mascara off. I usually purchase moderately priced toiletries but this to me is worth the splurge. My husband pointed out if I use less of it &amp; it does a better job then I&#x27;m not really paying much more for it than a bargain remover I have to use 9 drops of. I will continue to use this remover, I just love it.</li>
            <li> One or two swipes and you&#x27;re done.  It really is a great product.  As all eye makeup removers, avoid your eyes.  I got some in my eyes and they felt sort of greasy.</li>
            <li> Great eye and lip remover</li>
            <li> Have tried other eye makeup removers, and like this one.  Easy to use, washes off clearly.  Tho baby oil works well, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; s a good product and works as described. I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s worth it for the price. There are many other products on the market that work as well and cost much less.</li>

            <li> The best eye makeup remover product !</li>
            <li> Love this!  It just works!</li>
            <li> This product does what it says...it is great for eye makeup removal.  I wear hard to get off eye liner and mascara, but have no problem removing it with the Shiseido Ts. It is gentle and does not burn or irritate my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> Authentic product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve been using Shiseido facial cleanser, moisturizer and the such but for eye makeup remover I figured who cares? Any ol&#x27; remover would do. How could I have been so wrong? SO WRONG. I&#x27;ve struggled with all my eye makeup removers trying to get off the eye liner and mascara gunk.  I loved the Rimmel I used but it still made me scrub and scrub and scrub. Even the Neutrogena. I couldn&#x27;t win. I finally decided to try this and I&#x27;m so psyched that I did. So it might be more money but it&#x27;s so worth the extra cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never removed my eye makeup with such ease before. Honestly, my mascara and eye liner came off so easy. The black gunk was gone. I used to give up after several minutes and just go to bed with black goo everywhere. I&#x27;d wake up with dark rings and looked terrible the next day. Lucky for me I tried this amazing remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much Shiseido! You&#x27;re the best.</li>
            <li> I like the applicator. It the solution is a bit oily. Yet it does not tug on the eyes and is gentle and I wear contacts.</li>
            <li> When you apply makeup to improve your skin, you don&#x27;t want the act of removing the makeup further damage your skin.  This product removes your makeup without effortlessly while leaving your skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Shiseido White Lucent face wash, with a Clairsonic brush.  And I follow it with this product to take off lipstick and eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Took me years to finish this bottle but I only use it on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other liquid removers like Clinique, Neutrogena, and a few other name brand ones. This is by far the most effective and without using much of it even with a full eye make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just squirt a bit on a cotton pad and swipe. Flip and swipe again. Can be used for both eyes if your only using liner.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Gentle for eyes and lips. Recommend highly.  Shiseido products are awesome! Sent right away and it was sealed and wrapped well.</li>
            <li> Best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve used so far.  I mostly use waterproof eye makeup and this + a cotton pad takes it right off.</li>
            <li> This item came looking opened and used with some old tape on it.  This is an eye product and I am afraid to use it because it does not appear new.</li>
            <li> My skin does not usually react well with make up removers, but Shisheido&#x27;s works like magic. This this probably the best make up remover yet.</li>
