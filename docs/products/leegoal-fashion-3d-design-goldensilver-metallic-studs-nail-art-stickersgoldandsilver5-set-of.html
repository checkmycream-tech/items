            <li>and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love them.</li>

            <li>These are really cute</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more</li>

            <li>it looks  love it</li>
            <li>You get more like 70-80 rather than 250.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would say these are probably more usful on objects like phone cases.</li>
            <li>these stars are so cute.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the gold ones (I mostly just wanted the silver), but the silver ones didn&#x27;t discolor at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These can be elegant or playful.</li>
            <li>I ordered these and did not expect to get so many.</li>

            <li>There is definitely not 250 maybe 75 at the most!!!</li>
            <li>But on the bright side they are exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast &amp; was packaged nicely, thank you!</li>
            <li>Just did a design in my nails with them and it turned out pretty good.</li>

            <li>I love them they are super cute.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to put a top coat or it will change colors quick.</li>
            <li>I got a couple little baggies more than I thought but works out great for me!</li>
            <li>they fit great on the nail, i used ontop of acrylic then covered it with clear</li>
            <li>It tends to fall off easily if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Thanks worth the wait Great nail item as a adding for the price</li>
            <li>but the stars would not stay in my nails and bend easily</li>
            <li>n don&#x27;t bend easily to be flush with the nail.</li>
            <li>THESE STARS ARE EASY TO ATTACH WITH GLUE</li>
            <li>They pop off really easily though if you are using nail polish to adhere/seal them on.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply i recommend using glue for acrylics.</li>
            <li>They just get lost easily.</li>
            <li>Other wise I&#x27;m very satisfied :)</li>
            <li>They are shiny, silver and gold, and pretty nice size.  </li>
            <li>They are super cute.</li>
            <li>They are super cute though.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with, cute shapes, and fun designs.</li>
            <li>Overall they are great quality for what I paid for.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic for nail art.</li>
            <li>I had a problem with my order but the company was very helpful and nice in fixing the problem.</li>
            <li>These gems are very tiny, great for nail art.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t fit 100% of the way</li>
            <li>But these are fantastic.</li>
            <li>You bet so mmany for such a great price.</li>
            <li>It doesnt fit my nail</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t curved to fit a nail</li>
            <li>and theyre forsure secure</li>
            <li>very edgy...great price, nice variety...love the gold and silver because it goes with anything.</li>
            <li>This fit the profile.</li>
            <li>Flimsy and cheap looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually quite happy with what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it will last a good while. :)</li>
            <li>Pieces are a bit more three dimensional than I&#x27;d thought - I expected them to be flat, but way cute and will work great!</li>
            <li>Pretty, now it&#x27;s time to get creative.</li>
            <li>Perfect for even small nail beds.</li>
            <li>Lots of fun!</li>
            <li>I like to paint these studs with nail polish to give them a unique look</li>
            <li>Super cheap.</li>
            <li>Look very cute and such but my God, they fall off so easily -- I don&#x27;t even know when they fall off</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t count them but it looks like the right amount!</li>
            <li>It ook almost a full 2 months to receive shipment.</li>
            <li>USED THE SILVER ONES FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY, GOT A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS ON THEM, EVERYONBE ONE LOVED THEM</li>
            <li>Got these earlier than I was expecting which was good.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really pay attention to how many I was supposed to get until after they arrived.</li>
            <li>I am not using nail polish or nail paint on my nails so that&#x27;s why this is not use full for me</li>
            <li>They were def true to the picture.</li>
            <li>glad i found these at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Happy with my purchase got here faster than expected!</li>
            <li>The stars are very pretty.</li>
            <li>these are great to design on black polish.  </li>
            <li>exactly as pictured!</li>
            <li>Love to use these stars as part of my nail art, works great, last long, and what fun they add to my nails</li>
            <li>Great on nails, other art projects too!!</li>
            <li>These have been a fun addition to the nail art menu.  </li>
            <li>Fun product.</li>
            <li>I had to bend it for a proper fit but looks adorable.</li>
            <li>What I received is WORTH a dollar or so..</li>
            <li>I love it, but I can only fit one on my nails.</li>
            <li>Having fun with all the nail stuff I have bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li>They are fun to add to nails.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying if you like nail art and have the time.</li>
            <li>Then I painted a clear coat over top.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I got away with using glossy top coat on natural nail.</li>
            <li>But are really fun to put on your nails</li>
            <li>They look very light and pretty consistent, so they should look good on a nail and not weigh them down like a real metal stud might.</li>
            <li>These came pretty quick.</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>However, with the right tools/glue, patience, and practice this could be no problem for you.</li>
            <li>But I may have also not put them on right.</li>
            <li>They are the right size for nails.</li>
            <li>there were the right amount in there</li>
            <li>Arrived in good shape and we got exactly what was expected.  </li>
            <li>These are great little studs for any manicure!  </li>
            <li>These are adorable and great for adding that extra little pop to your manicure.  </li>
            <li>Super cheap and arrived early.</li>

            <li>Pretty stars took a while to come.</li>
            <li>Exactly the size I needed.</li>
            <li>Everything looks better with a tiny sparkly star stuck to it.</li>
            <li>You do have to use enough coating on the top after applying the nail.</li>

            <li>Pretty neat.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as described.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what they say.</li>
            <li>And I will most definitely use again.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>When or IF it finally shows up I am hoping to give it a better review.</li>
            <li>and they shipped really fast !</li>
            <li>item is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, and several packets and so many included.</li>
            <li>and when my stock runs low I am buying more but will buy 2 instead of 1 this time.</li>
            <li>I will just make sure in the future to order far in advance!!!</li>
            <li>Great value for the money, these studs are easy to apply to nails and stay on for a long amount of time as long as the proper nail glue is used.</li>
            <li>Thin and light, perfect 3D embellishments for cell phone cases, cards, magnets, etc, using minimal adhesive.</li>
            <li>they are cool maybe a little more</li>
            <li>The only thing is they came off easily.</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just a little over two weeks turnaround time, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>It is durable and very fashionable.</li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>thanks for</li>
            <li>thanks so much</li>
            <li>And really, I doubt she would ever use all 250 of them even if there really is 250 in there.</li>
            <li>Really, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>I paint my nails every week and these made it the whole week.</li>
            <li>but it doesnt fit on your nail if its a smaller one.</li>
            <li>and it worked out very well.</li>
            <li>These worrk really on my nails.</li>
            <li>Not noticeable really, but they do get caught in my hair, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely buy again given how cheap they are.</li>
            <li>Fast, efficient and a pleasure.</li>
            <li>but I really like them</li>
            <li>and i could only fit 2 or 1</li>
            <li>They got here really fast.</li>
            <li>Also thank you so much cheekys beuty</li>
            <li>Fortunately none of them fell out during shipping, but I intend to move them to a different container.</li>
            <li>Will use them for nail art, didn&#x27;t take too much gel to cover them well.</li>
            <li>but they stayed ion the whole time</li>
            <li>I think for flimsy pieces of 10 they&#x27;re charging too much money</li>
            <li>These are very nice little stars, and I would&#x27;ve given them 5 stars, but it does NOT come with silver stars; only gold stars are in the baggie.</li>
            <li>This is a nice addition to my small nail art collection.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t exactly expect quality, but i&#x27;m always pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>highly recommend these...</li>
            <li>I will recommend highly.</li>
            <li>then nailpolish let it dry put a clear coat and apply the star and then apply another top clear coat</li>
            <li>These little stars are SO cute.</li>
            <li>Although these do take quite awhile to arrive, it is worth it as the price is so LOW.</li>
            <li>i tried using them but they wont fit on my nail so will being using them for something other then nails.</li>
            <li>These stars were the ones I ordered for a project i was doing, the size is exactly as advertised but they were definitely not 300 pcs.</li>
            <li>so I do not think they would be ok for small nails.  </li>
            <li>I used the standard nail glue and it stayed on pretty well.</li>
            <li>I used them on my nails last night and they stick pretty well.</li>
            <li>and they seem to work when i apply them onto my nails(Acrylic Tips).I was scared to buy them at first because i though that they would be too big</li>
            <li>Not only did I get these on a timely fashion, but they were exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Easy application with a little  patience</li>
            <li>but they did travel pretty far on standard shipping.</li>
            <li>I painted my nails, then put a tiny bit of super glue on the back of them and stuck them on my nails.</li>
            <li>but these are larger than I thought they would be and because they are so large, they don&#x27;t stick to the nail.</li>
            <li>It is a little to big for nails, better suited for cell phone deco.</li>
            <li>Just starting out with trying a little nail art and thought that these stars would be something cute to put on my nails.</li>
            <li>I apply them to my nail using a clear coat.</li>
            <li>Also, doesn&#x27;t really look like 250 of them, but I&#x27;m not counting each individual one, so don&#x27;t quote me on that</li>
            <li>I ordered them early around October 6th for Christmas</li>
            <li>your imaginations  run wild and see where it is the mind</li>
            <li>It has been nearly a MONTH</li>
            <li>I used a tiny dot of nail glue to adhere them to my nails and then used a heavy layer of top coat.  </li>
            <li>It took a month until I got them which was a drag but really worth it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re super active and do sports, i wouldn&#x27;t wear these.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend these as long as you&#x27;re not expecting too much from them, which if you&#x27;re expecting 300 real metal studs for $1.16 and free shipping from Singapore in a bubble wrap envelope, you&#x27;re just being an unrealistic cheap skate.</li>
            <li>MY REVIEWS FOR THE TWO ARE MORE OR LESS THE SAME, SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PRODUCTS WORK AND ARE MORE OR LESS THE SAME (same issues, etc)**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t count all of them, but I received 5 tiny bags of equal size with a pretty even mix of gold and silver stars.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-They&#x27;re tricky to use at first if you&#x27;re inexperienced.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li>However, I will say that on nails that don&#x27;t have a lot of flat space (ie natural nails with a natural curve) these won&#x27;t bend to shape.</li>
            <li>I love them so much, half silver half gold.</li>
            <li>but maybe I&#x27;ll attach with glue instead of clear polish only.</li>
            <li>Simply took a bit longer to get here because it was from a far away country.</li>
            <li>I ended up giving them to my ten year old daughter to play with.</li>
            <li>These are nice, only complaint is they all were loose and just thrown in a plastic bag, i wish they came in an actual container</li>
            <li>You can bend them a little so that they stay on better with the curve of your nail, because if you don&#x27;t, they stick up on the sides a little,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the low price and shipping didn&#x27;t take nearly as long as expected.</li>
            <li>Star deducted because you pretty much have to apply the star dead center of the nail</li>
            <li>It only works if you apply directly to the middle of the nail, in my case.</li>
            <li>I expected them to be smaller, since the picture shows three on one nail, but it obviously isn&#x27;t a real nail.</li>
            <li>They are teeny tiny little stars exactly what you see here.  </li>
            <li>Obviously I was aware that I&#x27;d be getting quite a few.</li>
            <li>I cannot use these on nails because they are not flat.</li>
            <li>but they are small enough that you could fit 3 or 4 depending on how wide and big ur tips are.</li>
            <li>A lot of pretty little sparkly stars!</li>

            <li> I love them :)</li>
            <li> They look like plastic with a shiny gold metal looking top coat.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li> Just the envelope and shipping alone was probably way more than $1.16.</li>
            <li> Its okay, I guess.</li>
            <li> These are really cute</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> the nail studs work well on any colors of the nails so many designs and mays</li>
            <li> One of my favorite nail art items.</li>
            <li> it looks  love it</li>
            <li> You get more like 70-80 rather than 250.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say these are probably more usful on objects like phone cases.</li>
            <li> these stars are so cute.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the gold ones (I mostly just wanted the silver), but the silver ones didn&#x27;t discolor at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These can be elegant or playful.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and did not expect to get so many.</li>

            <li> Got what I was expecting, these are cute and I get lots of compliments on them.</li>

            <li> These stars are so cute and adorable, my daughter just loves the colors and the fact that she can work with them.  </li>
            <li> There is definitely not 250 maybe 75 at the most!!!</li>
            <li> But on the bright side they are exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast &amp; was packaged nicely, thank you!</li>
            <li> Just did a design in my nails with them and it turned out pretty good.</li>
            <li> The design is very cool.</li>
            <li> these are cute easy to apply perfect size for nails and decorating other items would recommend and would buy again</li>
            <li> the photo is one of the most accurate photos of nail art supplies that i&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> i really like them good size.</li>
            <li> I love them they are super cute.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to put a top coat or it will change colors quick.</li>
            <li> I got a couple little baggies more than I thought but works out great for me!</li>
            <li> they fit great on the nail, i used ontop of acrylic then covered it with clear</li>
            <li> It tends to fall off easily if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Thanks worth the wait Great nail item as a adding for the price</li>
            <li> but the stars would not stay in my nails and bend easily</li>
            <li> n don&#x27;t bend easily to be flush with the nail.</li>
            <li> THESE STARS ARE EASY TO ATTACH WITH GLUE</li>
            <li> They pop off really easily though if you are using nail polish to adhere/seal them on.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply i recommend using glue for acrylics.</li>
            <li> They just get lost easily.</li>
            <li> Other wise I&#x27;m very satisfied :)</li>
            <li> They are shiny, silver and gold, and pretty nice size.  </li>
            <li> They are super cute.</li>
            <li> They are super cute though.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with, cute shapes, and fun designs.</li>
            <li> Overall they are great quality for what I paid for.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for nail art.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with my order but the company was very helpful and nice in fixing the problem.</li>
            <li> These gems are very tiny, great for nail art.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t fit 100% of the way</li>
            <li> But these are fantastic.</li>
            <li> You bet so mmany for such a great price.</li>
            <li> It doesnt fit my nail</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t curved to fit a nail</li>
            <li> and theyre forsure secure</li>
            <li> very edgy...great price, nice variety...love the gold and silver because it goes with anything.</li>
            <li> This fit the profile.</li>
            <li> Flimsy and cheap looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually quite happy with what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it will last a good while. :)</li>
            <li> Pieces are a bit more three dimensional than I&#x27;d thought - I expected them to be flat, but way cute and will work great!</li>
            <li> Pretty, now it&#x27;s time to get creative.</li>
            <li> Perfect for even small nail beds.</li>
            <li> Lots of fun!</li>
            <li> I like to paint these studs with nail polish to give them a unique look</li>
            <li> Super cheap.</li>
            <li> Look very cute and such but my God, they fall off so easily -- I don&#x27;t even know when they fall off</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t count them but it looks like the right amount!</li>
            <li> It ook almost a full 2 months to receive shipment.</li>
            <li> USED THE SILVER ONES FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY, GOT A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS ON THEM, EVERYONBE ONE LOVED THEM</li>
            <li> Got these earlier than I was expecting which was good.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really pay attention to how many I was supposed to get until after they arrived.</li>
            <li> I am not using nail polish or nail paint on my nails so that&#x27;s why this is not use full for me</li>
            <li> They were def true to the picture.</li>
            <li> glad i found these at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase got here faster than expected!</li>
            <li> The stars are very pretty.</li>
            <li> these are great to design on black polish.  </li>
            <li> exactly as pictured!</li>
            <li> Love to use these stars as part of my nail art, works great, last long, and what fun they add to my nails</li>
            <li> Great on nails, other art projects too!!</li>
            <li> These have been a fun addition to the nail art menu.  </li>
            <li> Fun product.</li>
            <li> I had to bend it for a proper fit but looks adorable.</li>
            <li> What I received is WORTH a dollar or so..</li>
            <li> I love it, but I can only fit one on my nails.</li>
            <li> Having fun with all the nail stuff I have bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li> They are fun to add to nails.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying if you like nail art and have the time.</li>
            <li> Then I painted a clear coat over top.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I got away with using glossy top coat on natural nail.</li>
            <li> But are really fun to put on your nails</li>
            <li> They look very light and pretty consistent, so they should look good on a nail and not weigh them down like a real metal stud might.</li>
            <li> These came pretty quick.</li>
            <li> other wise</li>
            <li> However, with the right tools/glue, patience, and practice this could be no problem for you.</li>
            <li> But I may have also not put them on right.</li>
            <li> They are the right size for nails.</li>
            <li> there were the right amount in there</li>
            <li> Arrived in good shape and we got exactly what was expected.  </li>
            <li> These are great little studs for any manicure!  </li>
            <li> These are adorable and great for adding that extra little pop to your manicure.  </li>
            <li> Super cheap and arrived early.</li>
            <li> i lovethe gold look good dark colors polish.</li>
            <li> I loved the little silver and golden stars.</li>
            <li> These are nice to add to nail routine,  So nice to have a little something extra for Partying!  </li>
            <li> Pretty stars took a while to come.</li>
            <li> Exactly the size I needed.</li>
            <li> Everything looks better with a tiny sparkly star stuck to it.</li>
            <li> You do have to use enough coating on the top after applying the nail.</li>
            <li> there really pretty i like them</li>
            <li> They are tiny, but they look really cute on</li>
            <li> Its pretty</li>
            <li> Would definitely repurchase these cute babies.</li>
            <li> Item arrived and is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Pretty neat.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as described.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what they say.</li>
            <li> And I will most definitely use again.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> When or IF it finally shows up I am hoping to give it a better review.</li>
            <li> and they shipped really fast !</li>
            <li> item is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, and several packets and so many included.</li>
            <li> and when my stock runs low I am buying more but will buy 2 instead of 1 this time.</li>
            <li> I will just make sure in the future to order far in advance!!!</li>
            <li> Great value for the money, these studs are easy to apply to nails and stay on for a long amount of time as long as the proper nail glue is used.</li>
            <li> Thin and light, perfect 3D embellishments for cell phone cases, cards, magnets, etc, using minimal adhesive.</li>
            <li> they are cool maybe a little more</li>
            <li> The only thing is they came off easily.</li>
            <li> exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just a little over two weeks turnaround time, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> It is durable and very fashionable.</li>
            <li> I really like them.</li>
            <li> thanks for</li>
            <li> thanks so much</li>
            <li> And really, I doubt she would ever use all 250 of them even if there really is 250 in there.</li>
            <li> Really, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails every week and these made it the whole week.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt fit on your nail if its a smaller one.</li>
            <li> and it worked out very well.</li>
            <li> These worrk really on my nails.</li>
            <li> Not noticeable really, but they do get caught in my hair, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely buy again given how cheap they are.</li>
            <li> Fast, efficient and a pleasure.</li>
            <li> but I really like them</li>
            <li> and i could only fit 2 or 1</li>
            <li> They got here really fast.</li>
            <li> Also thank you so much cheekys beuty</li>
            <li> Fortunately none of them fell out during shipping, but I intend to move them to a different container.</li>
            <li> Will use them for nail art, didn&#x27;t take too much gel to cover them well.</li>
            <li> but they stayed ion the whole time</li>
            <li> I think for flimsy pieces of 10 they&#x27;re charging too much money</li>
            <li> These are very nice little stars, and I would&#x27;ve given them 5 stars, but it does NOT come with silver stars; only gold stars are in the baggie.</li>
            <li> This is a nice addition to my small nail art collection.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t exactly expect quality, but i&#x27;m always pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> highly recommend these...</li>
            <li> I will recommend highly.</li>
            <li> then nailpolish let it dry put a clear coat and apply the star and then apply another top clear coat</li>
            <li> These little stars are SO cute.</li>
            <li> Although these do take quite awhile to arrive, it is worth it as the price is so LOW.</li>
            <li> i tried using them but they wont fit on my nail so will being using them for something other then nails.</li>
            <li> These stars were the ones I ordered for a project i was doing, the size is exactly as advertised but they were definitely not 300 pcs.</li>
            <li> so I do not think they would be ok for small nails.  </li>
            <li> I used the standard nail glue and it stayed on pretty well.</li>
            <li> I used them on my nails last night and they stick pretty well.</li>
            <li> and they seem to work when i apply them onto my nails(Acrylic Tips).I was scared to buy them at first because i though that they would be too big</li>
            <li> Not only did I get these on a timely fashion, but they were exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> Easy application with a little  patience</li>
            <li> but they did travel pretty far on standard shipping.</li>
            <li> I painted my nails, then put a tiny bit of super glue on the back of them and stuck them on my nails.</li>
            <li> but these are larger than I thought they would be and because they are so large, they don&#x27;t stick to the nail.</li>
            <li> It is a little to big for nails, better suited for cell phone deco.</li>
            <li> Just starting out with trying a little nail art and thought that these stars would be something cute to put on my nails.</li>
            <li> I apply them to my nail using a clear coat.</li>
            <li> Also, doesn&#x27;t really look like 250 of them, but I&#x27;m not counting each individual one, so don&#x27;t quote me on that</li>
            <li> I ordered them early around October 6th for Christmas</li>
            <li> your imaginations  run wild and see where it is the mind</li>
            <li> It has been nearly a MONTH</li>
            <li> I used a tiny dot of nail glue to adhere them to my nails and then used a heavy layer of top coat.  </li>
            <li> It took a month until I got them which was a drag but really worth it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re super active and do sports, i wouldn&#x27;t wear these.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend these as long as you&#x27;re not expecting too much from them, which if you&#x27;re expecting 300 real metal studs for $1.16 and free shipping from Singapore in a bubble wrap envelope, you&#x27;re just being an unrealistic cheap skate.</li>
            <li> MY REVIEWS FOR THE TWO ARE MORE OR LESS THE SAME, SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PRODUCTS WORK AND ARE MORE OR LESS THE SAME (same issues, etc)**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t count all of them, but I received 5 tiny bags of equal size with a pretty even mix of gold and silver stars.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-They&#x27;re tricky to use at first if you&#x27;re inexperienced.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> However, I will say that on nails that don&#x27;t have a lot of flat space (ie natural nails with a natural curve) these won&#x27;t bend to shape.</li>
            <li> I love them so much, half silver half gold.</li>
            <li> but maybe I&#x27;ll attach with glue instead of clear polish only.</li>
            <li> Simply took a bit longer to get here because it was from a far away country.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving them to my ten year old daughter to play with.</li>
            <li> These are nice, only complaint is they all were loose and just thrown in a plastic bag, i wish they came in an actual container</li>
            <li> You can bend them a little so that they stay on better with the curve of your nail, because if you don&#x27;t, they stick up on the sides a little,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth the low price and shipping didn&#x27;t take nearly as long as expected.</li>
            <li> Star deducted because you pretty much have to apply the star dead center of the nail</li>
            <li> It only works if you apply directly to the middle of the nail, in my case.</li>
            <li> I expected them to be smaller, since the picture shows three on one nail, but it obviously isn&#x27;t a real nail.</li>
            <li> They are teeny tiny little stars exactly what you see here.  </li>
            <li> Obviously I was aware that I&#x27;d be getting quite a few.</li>
            <li> I cannot use these on nails because they are not flat.</li>
            <li> but they are small enough that you could fit 3 or 4 depending on how wide and big ur tips are.</li>
            <li> A lot of pretty little sparkly stars!</li>
            <li> They are absolutely the right size and you can&#x27;t go wrong with silver and gold; must haves.</li>
            <li> just the slightest bit too flat, but nothing a pair of pliers can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> They are flat, which means that if you don&#x27;t have a wide/flat nail bed the edges may stick out a bit.  </li>
            <li> 2) they don&#x27;t lay flat and get snagged and pulled</li>
            <li> BUT THEY DO NOT SIT FLAT ON THE NAIL</li>
            <li> But they must be bended before putting on the nails because they are flat.</li>
            <li> but these stars require nail glue or they wont stay on for 1 single second.</li>
            <li> If you put it on the center of the nail, for example, it isn&#x27;t going to lay flat and the sides will actually stick off the nail.</li>
            <li> Waited a long time for them to arrive, too..</li>
            <li> Theyd have to only be used down the middle of nail</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality is perfectly adequate to use on your nails, they have some shine to them and they are thin but not very flimsy.  </li>
            <li> I tried two different brands of nail glue and adding a thick amount of clear nail polish over these and they won&#x27;t stay on!</li>
            <li> I usually can get away with adhering my crystals with clear nail polish</li>
            <li> ENDED UP BUYING SEVERAL NAIL ITEMS FOR A FRIEND WHOS STARTING HER SMALL BUSINESS</li>
            <li> These may work on larger sized nail beds or nails with acrylic overlay, but they will not fit on my small, natural nail.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;d be near impossible to get it in just the right spots and</li>
            <li> These little stars look just the same as pictured.  </li>
            <li> the little present appreciate .</li>
            <li> These were a little big</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they came in a bunch of little bags all mixed together</li>
            <li> A little big!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that these came in a tiny ziplock bag.</li>
            <li> If you are opening the container/envelope/pouch with scissors, be careful.  </li>
            <li> but I just transferred them over to an empty spot in a wheel I have</li>
            <li> Im not much of a gold person</li>
            <li> But I sort of expected that to be the case.</li>
            <li> it came before the expected delivery date..</li>
            <li> As expected, gold and silver stars.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the size I expected.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to stick them on my nails, because the shape of the stars aren&#x27;t flat, they&#x27;re too solid.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell you how to get these little suckers to stay on!</li>
            <li> My only little nit pick with it is they come in a little baggie.</li>
            <li> After trying to glue them on, they lifted off repeatedly within the hour due to the corner of the stars not laying against the nail.</li>
            <li> just like any other stud except in star form.</li>
            <li> YOU GET A SHARP EDGE THAT CAN CATCH ON STUFF.</li>
            <li> when i order nail supplies that cost less than $5 and say that they&#x27;re shipping from china and there&#x27;s no real guarantee when they might arrive (i was given a 4-6 week window)</li>
            <li> I mean, it looks pretty its just not really functional for long wear unless you apply on fake nails or have wider nails.</li>
            <li> but It has less but other than than that ilove it even though u can&#x27;t place them on the edge of the nail</li>
            <li> In the past it has never taken so long to receive anything.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really look like metal, but I could be wrong.</li>
            <li> This came in the mail a few days ago, on the expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> they tend to stick to each other unpackaging from little bags.</li>
            <li> They are silver on one side and gold on the other!</li>
            <li> There were less maybe about 200 if i counted correctly.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, it took about 3 and a half weeks.</li>
            <li> They were half and half as described.</li>
            <li> They have a high quality look to them without being extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> I cut into one of the little plastic bags and spilled about 50 stars on my floor.</li>
            <li> somehow my little stars managed to make it across the sea in 3 weeks and they&#x27;re darling.</li>
            <li> And when u get them they are separated into little bags of 50, I think, and packaged well.</li>
            <li> It was in a package with five or six little baggies that had the stars in them.</li>
            <li> However they are just shapes bent up, so there is little area to glue onto nails.  </li>
            <li> These can as described, were send in manilla envelope with 3 little bags of stars.</li>
            <li> Way bigger than I expected and extremely difficult to apply them to nails.</li>
            <li> got these a few months ago</li>
            <li> nothing missing  </li>
            <li> The stars really do stick the key is to put a base coat</li>
            <li> They are not easy to bend to form to the nail, either.</li>
            <li> you get a few small bags of these.</li>
            <li> They are a little hard to keep because the tips of the star snag on my clothes  </li>
            <li> Small stars but pointy.</li>
            <li> This package was small and didn&#x27;t have 250 pieces</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I considered how they would come</li>
            <li> no more words to say</li>
            <li> i was not very happy with what i received</li>
            <li> The standard colored round ones were getting a bit boring</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed because I waited so long for these to get here.</li>
            <li> it game a $5 dollar reward</li>
            <li> and it comes with  a little bag :(</li>
            <li> Maybe I can find a craft to use these for but they are useless for nails.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using these in polymer clay projects and gluing them to random surfaces.</li>
            <li> This is a bit difficult because sometimes they stick to the tweezers or I don&#x27;t get them to drop/lay how I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> but whatever, ill use them any ways.</li>
            <li> I didnt get 250 of them, but im not even mad about that</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried mine yet, still disappointed about the amount that came with them.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed but</li>
            <li> i still didnt get them! :(</li>
            <li> Just hate that it&#x27;s mandatory to write 30&lt;br /&gt;Words.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I saw them in person.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> just like pictured! i didn&#x27;t count if there were 250 pieces, but it sure did seem like it! shipping was fast &amp; was packaged nicely, thank you!</li>
            <li> My Daughter loved these for her nails.  They stayed on a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Not 250 and it comes with  a little bag :( but rest is good</li>
            <li> I cannot use these on nails because they are not flat. There is no way to attach them to a nail. I am so disappointed because I waited so long for these to get here. Maybe I can find a craft to use these for but they are useless for nails.</li>
            <li> I love them so much, half silver half gold. I don&#x27;t think there is 125 of each though I&#x27;ll count to verify. Other wise I&#x27;m very satisfied :)</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive the studs. They are beautiful. Overall they are great quality for what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I have friends who ride streetbikes. these are great to design on black polish.  they tend to stick to each other unpackaging from little bags.</li>
            <li> Nice design. It is durable and very fashionable. Be sure to use it with tweezers though. I tried it with a wax tip and somehow it wasn&#x27;t sticking properly.</li>
            <li> Pretty stars took a while to come. The sliver i lovethe gold look good dark colors polish. But love them</li>
            <li> Recieved mine just in time for Forth of July(4 days before,I placed the order June 14)worth it love em great size for nail art.</li>
            <li> These have been a fun addition to the nail art menu.  They have a high quality look to them without being extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> These came pretty quick. I really like them. I&#x27;ve already tried them on my nails. They stay on until I wanna take them off.</li>
            <li> I know it says 5mm but these are larger than I thought they would be and because they are so large, they don&#x27;t stick to the nail. They almost need to be bent. Keep this in mind when purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably use these for arts and crafts instead of nail decals.</li>
            <li> Fun product. They look great on.</li>
            <li> It ook almost a full 2 months to receive shipment. In the past it has never taken so long to receive anything.</li>
            <li> Exactly the size I needed. These are fantastic for nail art. Everyone I have used them on just loves them. I&#x27;ll be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Perfect decor for the 4th of July !</li>
            <li> These are nice, only complaint is they all were loose and just thrown in a plastic bag, i wish they came in an actual container</li>
            <li> Was a good product the only thing was that I did not get any gold just silver and it was not 250 pieces. . I might buy this again would like it if it came with everything it says it has</li>
            <li> Great value for the money, these studs are easy to apply to nails and stay on for a long amount of time as long as the proper nail glue is used.</li>
            <li> These little stars look just the same as pictured.  I had a problem with my order but the company was very helpful and nice in fixing the problem. I look forward to using these in polymer clay projects and gluing them to random surfaces. Everything looks better with a tiny sparkly star stuck to it.</li>
            <li> The design is very cool. You do have to use enough coating on the top after applying the nail. It tends to fall off easily if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> came on time great price good for all kinds of stuff nail, crafts , well made lots of both colors.</li>
            <li> these are tiny stars to use on your nails or even as tine stars in arts and crafts I could think of million different things to use these on</li>
            <li> These stars are great but I cant get them to stay on unless I use nail glue. I usually can get away with adhering my crystals with clear nail polish but these stars require nail glue or they wont stay on for 1 single second. They look great on and I am getting lots of compliments !! Enjoy them !!!</li>
            <li> I love the stars. They are super cute. They do fall off if they arent done on acurlyic. If just painted on they can tug your hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all they didn&#x27;t stay on the nail like it was suppose to.. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Thanks worth the wait Great nail item as a adding for the price I&#x27;ve already used them on my nails</li>
            <li> These are very nice little stars, and I would&#x27;ve given them 5 stars, but it does NOT come with silver stars; only gold stars are in the baggie.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for nail art.  It is a little to big for nails, better suited for cell phone deco.</li>
            <li> USED THE SILVER ONES FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY, GOT A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS ON THEM, EVERYONBE ONE LOVED THEM</li>
            <li> I love how the packaging is but it claims to have 250 pieces but It has less but other than than that ilove it even though u can&#x27;t place them on the edge of the nail</li>
            <li> I ordered these to use for my nails. Just starting out with trying a little nail art and thought that these stars would be something cute to put on my nails. I didn&#x27;t count the number of hearts in the bag. The bag is small, so I don&#x27;t know if there are exactly 250 pieces in it. Regardless, they were a good price and I plan on order more soon. This is a nice addition to my small nail art collection.</li>
            <li> there really pretty i like them so if u want star on your nails you should by it. there gold an silver</li>
            <li> Way bigger than I expected and extremely difficult to apply them to nails.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good shape and we got exactly what was expected.  The studs look great on nails and so far my daughter as been happy with the product..</li>
            <li> Got them in the mail since I ordered a couple things from this seller they all came together, which was GREAT. Everything looked just like the picture very satisfied.</li>
            <li> this is a good qualities very good I like it. thanks for the little present appreciate . thanks so much</li>
            <li> They are teeny tiny little stars exactly what you see here.  Has more staying power (on the nail) then others.  Probably because of the design.  Takes some time to get to you, but they don&#x27;t mislead you on the time frame.  There are a lot.  If you are opening the container/envelope/pouch with scissors, be careful.  I cut into one of the little plastic bags and spilled about 50 stars on my floor.</li>
            <li> These stars were the ones I ordered for a project i was doing, the size is exactly as advertised but they were definitely not 300 pcs. There were less maybe about 200 if i counted correctly. Still a really good price for them.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use these yet but have them. I bet I can make a fantastic forth of July nails with these! Super cheap and arrived early. Great item IMO</li>
            <li> I ordered these and did not expect to get so many...I love them :) I would order them again..Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for a friend. These gems are very tiny, great for nail art. Really nice!</li>
            <li> Got these earlier than I was expecting which was good. They don&#x27;t really look like metal, but I could be wrong. They look like plastic with a shiny gold metal looking top coat. Also, doesn&#x27;t really look like 250 of them, but I&#x27;m not counting each individual one, so don&#x27;t quote me on that either. They look very light and pretty consistent, so they should look good on a nail and not weigh them down like a real metal stud might. I got these for a Christmas gift and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love them. And really, I doubt she would ever use all 250 of them even if there really is 250 in there. It&#x27;s a good cheap gift for the nail lovers in your life. Really, you can&#x27;t beat the price. Just order them a month or so before you need them and you&#x27;ll be alright; they are coming from somewhere in Asia after all. I ordered them early around October 6th for Christmas and I just got them, 2 months before I needed, so that&#x27;s great. That&#x27;s just a little over two weeks turnaround time, so that&#x27;s nice. Overall, I would recommend these as long as you&#x27;re not expecting too much from them, which if you&#x27;re expecting 300 real metal studs for $1.16 and free shipping from Singapore in a bubble wrap envelope, you&#x27;re just being an unrealistic cheap skate. Just the envelope and shipping alone was probably way more than $1.16. I mailed a letter to Singapore recently and it cost me $1.10 in postage. I don&#x27;t know how they do it but kudos to them.</li>
            <li> Purchased for Christmas (2014) gifts and I am very happy with what I received.  Pieces are a bit more three dimensional than I&#x27;d thought - I expected them to be flat, but way cute and will work great!</li>
            <li> Its okay, I guess. Its too big for us people with smaller hands and nails. It won&#x27;t fit 100% of the way so it gets caught up by the corners and comes off. I mean, it looks pretty its just not really functional for long wear unless you apply on fake nails or have wider nails. It only works if you apply directly to the middle of the nail, in my case. I might repurchase this products for clients, but definitely not for me.</li>
            <li> These are perfect size and come with gold and silver. I inlay them under gel and they look great for 3D art.</li>
            <li> Pretty, now it&#x27;s time to get creative. Saving money at the salon by doing my own designs. Can&#x27;t wait to try these out.</li>
            <li> Small stars but pointy. I had to bend it for a proper fit but looks adorable. They are a great buy!</li>
            <li> I never got this item.I would like it as soon as possible or my money back.This is going on for 2 months now</li>
            <li> These are really cute and I couldn&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;ll be ordering more I&#x27;m sure. They are tiny, but they look really cute on</li>
            <li> This is amazing, I got a ton. I&#x27;m not going to take my time and count out 250 stars. I didn&#x27;t really pay attention to how many I was supposed to get until after they arrived. Obviously I was aware that I&#x27;d be getting quite a few. But these are fantastic. No complaints, sliver and gold. Seemingly equal amounts of both received.</li>
            <li> the nail studs work well on any colors of the nails so many designs and mays your imaginations  run wild and see where it is the mind can and will go thank you</li>
            <li> These little stars are SO cute. They are silver and gold. They took a while to get here, I even forgot that I ordered them! They are super cute though.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product Dec 3rd and it came in the mail 13 days later. This package was small and didn&#x27;t have 250 pieces so I decided to count it and counted 116 pieces. I have replied to this seller about getting the rest of my product. I will leave another post letting you guys know what they will be doing. I feel if a seller going to cheat you out of what you pay for than I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you purchasing this.</li>
            <li> my daughter bought these and she just loves them  that&#x27;s all I can tell you.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails every week and these made it the whole week. They are a great shape that fit my nails well.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love! One of my favorite nail art items. Cut very precisely. You bet so mmany for such a great price. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> There are only 70 pieces in the baggy I received. Waited a long time for them to arrive, too.. but hey. What I received is WORTH a dollar or so.. but it shouldn&#x27;t be advertised as something it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, they seem good quality.</li>
            <li> I am not using nail polish or nail paint on my nails so that&#x27;s why this is not use full for me other wise I think this is good product</li>
            <li> These are adorable and great for adding that extra little pop to your manicure.  They are silver on one side and gold on the other!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to stick them on my nails, because the shape of the stars aren&#x27;t flat, they&#x27;re too solid.</li>
            <li> Its pretty but it doesnt fit on your nail if its a smaller one. It doesnt fit my nail the the edges of the star lift off the nail...</li>
            <li> I love this item use all the time with my customers  and they are very happy and satisfied with the way it looks  love it</li>
            <li> These have got to be the prettiest stars for my nails. They are absolutely the right size and you can&#x27;t go wrong with silver and gold; must haves. Would definitely repurchase these cute babies.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and I like to use them but the stars would not stay in my nails and bend easily</li>
            <li> These may work on larger sized nail beds or nails with acrylic overlay, but they will not fit on my small, natural nail. They are not easy to bend to form to the nail, either. I was expecting them to be slightly smaller.</li>
            <li> Great! Comes with a bunch in separate baggies. Looks great, perfect size. A+</li>
            <li> You get more like 70-80 rather than 250.&lt;br /&gt;They are fairly big. You would need nails like the picture to use them I think. Haven&#x27;t tried mine yet, still disappointed about the amount that came with them.</li>
            <li> awesome price! great size for your nail! and sooo many of them i really liked them i would buy them again</li>
            <li> Love these! Wish they could bend to the curve of my nail because even with like 10 layers of too coat the ends somehow pop out and next thing you know I&#x27;ve lost my nail jem.</li>
            <li> I would say these are probably more usful on objects like phone cases. Def not nails. They aren&#x27;t curved to fit a nail so they like out white a bit n don&#x27;t bend easily to be flush with the nail.</li>
            <li> Item arrived and is exactly as pictured. My only little nit pick with it is they come in a little baggie. I&#x27;m not sure I considered how they would come but I just transferred them over to an empty spot in a wheel I have and i was good to go.</li>
            <li> when i order nail supplies that cost less than $5 and say that they&#x27;re shipping from china and there&#x27;s no real guarantee when they might arrive (i was given a 4-6 week window) i don&#x27;t exactly expect quality, but i&#x27;m always pleasantly surprised. somehow my little stars managed to make it across the sea in 3 weeks and they&#x27;re darling. the photo is one of the most accurate photos of nail art supplies that i&#x27;ve ever seen. the stars are darling. just the slightest bit too flat, but nothing a pair of pliers can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Love to use these stars as part of my nail art, works great, last long, and what fun they add to my nails</li>
            <li> Both the stars and bows are adorable on my toes!! Perfect for summertime sandals!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for nail art accents.</li>
            <li> I love it, but I can only fit one on my nails. I expected them to be smaller, since the picture shows three on one nail, but it obviously isn&#x27;t a real nail. They&#x27;re great, however!</li>
            <li> never got but they look good online lol never again ! i wish i could say what they look like</li>
            <li> these stars are so cute. they fit great on the nail, i used ontop of acrylic then covered it with clear it looks great in the acrylic and theyre forsure secure</li>
            <li> These are great little studs for any manicure!  I didn&#x27;t count all of them, but I received 5 tiny bags of equal size with a pretty even mix of gold and silver stars.  I counted one bag and there were 50 in there, so I assume the count was accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is perfectly adequate to use on your nails, they have some shine to them and they are thin but not very flimsy.  They are flat, which means that if you don&#x27;t have a wide/flat nail bed the edges may stick out a bit.  I used a tiny dot of nail glue to adhere them to my nails and then used a heavy layer of top coat.  They stayed intact for the duration of my mani.  I haven&#x27;t used the gold ones (I mostly just wanted the silver), but the silver ones didn&#x27;t discolor at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the low price and shipping didn&#x27;t take nearly as long as expected.</li>
            <li> These were a little big so I do not think they would be ok for small nails.  I got a good amount of gold and silver mised in just a baggy, I am happy with these.  I&#x27;ve also reused them so that&#x27;s a huge plus!  Stayed on well till I removed them.</li>
            <li> I have not used them yet but I cant wait. Im not much of a gold person but maybe my clients will.</li>
            <li> Every star is made to perfection. Great for a starry night nail or a rock-n-roll theme. These can be elegant or playful. I am eases with the product. It got to me on time and with no problems! Will order again when I&#x27;m out!!</li>
            <li> great for party nails</li>
            <li> Having fun with all the nail stuff I have bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li> They are fun to add to nails.</li>
            <li> excellent product I recommend</li>
            <li> I tried this on my daughters nails and it worked out very well. I used the standard nail glue and it stayed on pretty well.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and did not expect to get so many. I got a couple little baggies more than I thought but works out great for me! I would order again.</li>
            <li> Product does not lay on nail as shown. After trying to glue them on, they lifted off repeatedly within the hour due to the corner of the stars not laying against the nail. Cute, but caught on everything.</li>
            <li> These worrk really on my nails. I had never use this before and I love them. They r the best and I will order much more.</li>
            <li> nail art can&#x27;t go wrong love the stars</li>
            <li> **I BOUGHT THESE IN ANOTHER SHAPE AND MY REVIEWS FOR THE TWO ARE MORE OR LESS THE SAME, SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PRODUCTS WORK AND ARE MORE OR LESS THE SAME (same issues, etc)**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these a few months ago and I&#x27;ve only used them a couple of times but I do like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I didn&#x27;t count them but it does look like a fair amount.&lt;br /&gt;-They&#x27;re durable material. They hold up. I tried bending with no luck. However, I will say that on nails that don&#x27;t have a lot of flat space (ie natural nails with a natural curve) these won&#x27;t bend to shape. If you put it on the center of the nail, for example, it isn&#x27;t going to lay flat and the sides will actually stick off the nail. Not noticeable really, but they do get caught in my hair, etc.&lt;br /&gt;-They&#x27;re tricky to use at first if you&#x27;re inexperienced. I use tweezers to pick up a stud by the edge and drop a tad of nail glue into the underside. I then stick it on my nail. This is a bit difficult because sometimes they stick to the tweezers or I don&#x27;t get them to drop/lay how I&#x27;d like. However, with the right tools/glue, patience, and practice this could be no problem for you. You will need those three things.&lt;br /&gt;-I also bought triangles and they work just as nice.&lt;br /&gt;-I only use these for a day or two at a time because 1) I think even if I got stronger glue it&#x27;d be near impossible to get it in just the right spots and 2) they don&#x27;t lay flat and get snagged and pulled off.&lt;br /&gt;-They took a bit to get here but they did travel pretty far on standard shipping. Maybe a month? It&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;-Great price! I&#x27;d definitely buy again given how cheap they are. I can stand for them to fall off after a couple days cause it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m selling an arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all:&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re tricky but doable. Definitely worth buying if you like nail art and have the time. Fantastic price!</li>
            <li> loves these. would give 5 stars but you cant put them on the sides of your nail because they will stick up (because of the bend). Theyd have to only be used down the middle of nail</li>
            <li> Purchased these along with a packet of gold and silver toned triangles and am very happy with them.  Great for nail art and crafting.</li>
            <li> The stars are very pretty. they are just one color though. and the amount that i recieved does not seem to be 250</li>
            <li> you get a lot of tiny gems, silver and gold color variety. good quality and good price!</li>
            <li> There is definitely not 250 maybe 75 at the most!!! Kinda disappointed but they are cool maybe a little more and I would have been satisfied!</li>
            <li> you get a few small bags of these. i tried using them but they wont fit on my nail so will being using them for something other then nails.</li>
            <li> Pretty neat. I really only wanted the silver ones, but I didn&#x27;t care. Super cheap. I painted my nails, then put a tiny bit of super glue on the back of them and stuck them on my nails. Then I painted a clear coat over top. If you do that, it doesn&#x27;t get caught on your clothing. But after like a week, it starts to catch on things.</li>
            <li> Love them. Exactly what I was looking for. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as described. No problems with it at all. Simply took a bit longer to get here because it was from a far away country.</li>
            <li> love these...great accent for nail art. very edgy...great price, nice variety...love the gold and silver because it goes with anything. highly recommend these...</li>
            <li> It took a month until I got them which was a drag but really worth it. It didn&#x27;t come with 250 pieces more like a hundred but again its not even a dollar so it still  a really good for that amount. The stars really do stick the key is to put a base coat then nailpolish let it dry put a clear coat and apply the star and then apply another top clear coat and it will last a good while. :)</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. very nice I like it. my teacher and classmates like it as well. no more words to say</li>
            <li> Havent gotten them yet.&lt;br /&gt;Nope, I still have not gotten them. I wish I did.&lt;br /&gt;Still waiting for them to come now wished I had ordered 3x thd amount got several grandgirls!</li>
            <li> These were great, no problem with delivery at all. They are a little hard to keep because the tips of the star snag on my clothes  so they didn&#x27;t stay on for longer period of time but maybe I&#x27;ll attach with glue instead of clear polish only.</li>
            <li> I thought that I was getting 250 pieces I ended up only getting 25...i was not very happy with what i received</li>
            <li> i still didnt get them! :( but they look good.i just hope that all of them are in there and that they come!</li>
            <li> Great on nails, other art projects too!! Sturdy, well made. And when u get them they are separated into little bags of 50, I think, and packaged well. Which is nice, they are easier to handle. Very good product, they even have the slightest curve to them to fit ur nails. Also helps if u glue them to paper.</li>
            <li> Just used one of the gold stars today. Dont know what to say...just like any other stud except in star form.</li>
            <li> great price and great service thank you!</li>
            <li> 4 stars because of they way they are packaged. 5 baggies of 50 and they are not equal of silver and gold. More silver. But on the bright side they are exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> THESE STARS ARE EASY TO ATTACH WITH GLUE BUT THEY DO NOT SIT FLAT ON THE NAIL UNLESS ON TOP OF THE NAIL. IF YOU ATTACH TO THE SIDE OF THE NAIL YOU GET A SHARP EDGE THAT CAN CATCH ON STUFF.</li>
            <li> got it awesome some bent but really cool.</li>
            <li> These are great just like the picture.  But Ebay has them cheeper for a lot more pieces. Will purchase from Ebay in the future</li>
            <li> These take a while to get, but be patient. They are exactly what they say. Worth the price. Nice quality. Be patient.</li>
            <li> I love and cannot wait to use these.  They are shiny, silver and gold, and pretty nice size.  Love them.</li>
            <li> My experience has been absolutely amazing. I will recommend highly. Fast, efficient and a pleasure. 5 stars from me. And I will most definitely use again. Just hate that it&#x27;s mandatory to write 30&lt;br /&gt;Words.</li>
            <li> I now have stars to use for my manicure designs! The standard colored round ones were getting a bit boring and I wanted something different. This fit the profile. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love them they are super cute. The only thing is they came off easily. But I may have also not put them on right. If you&#x27;re super active and do sports, i wouldn&#x27;t wear these. They came off when I was cheering. If you&#x27;re more of the nonactive type, you may like these a lot!</li>
            <li> Love these.  I did Dallas Cowboy Nails and these were perfect!  I used them with shellac and they stayed for the whole 2.5 weeks and looked great.  Look forward to using them again soon!</li>
            <li> These are really cute but they just fall of no matter what I do, but I&#x27;m not about to glue them to my nails.</li>
            <li> A lot of pretty little sparkly stars! Thin and light, perfect 3D embellishments for cell phone cases, cards, magnets, etc, using minimal adhesive.</li>
            <li> Got what I was expecting, these are cute and I get lots of compliments on them. They pop off really easily though if you are using nail polish to adhere/seal them on. But I sort of expected that to be the case.</li>
            <li> Cute! I don&#x27;t understand why they came in a bunch of little bags all mixed together but I really like them</li>
            <li> Look very cute and such but my God, they fall off so easily -- I don&#x27;t even know when they fall off, I just notice they&#x27;re gone</li>
            <li> This came in the mail a few days ago, on the expected arrival date. It was in a package with five or six little baggies that had the stars in them. I used them on my nails last night and they stick pretty well. You can bend them a little so that they stay on better with the curve of your nail, because if you don&#x27;t, they stick up on the sides a little,</li>
            <li> Stars were very cute and kids will like them.  Didn&#x27;t use them yet but they will be used for something.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves putting these on her nails. Easy to work with, cute shapes, and fun designs. Good value for inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> February 14th and I am still waiting for it to arrive. It has been nearly a MONTH and I have no way of tracking it. I am displeased. When or IF it finally shows up I am hoping to give it a better review.</li>
            <li> I received these items in great condition. They were def true to the picture. Make sure you have a set of tweezers to put these on. They are definitely the size stated in the description. Perfect for even small nail beds. I bought these and the square and triangle ones. Loooove them.</li>
            <li> i have no complaints. it came before the expected delivery date.. nothing missing  i am very pleased..</li>
            <li> I loved them i just got them like a couple days ago. and they seem to work when i apply them onto my nails(Acrylic Tips).I was scared to buy them at first because i though that they would be too big i and i could only fit 2 or 1 but they are small enough that you could fit 3 or 4 depending on how wide and big ur tips are.</li>
            <li> Fabulous quality, fabulous colors and impeccable workmanship.  I can&#x27;t wait to break these babies out on tomorrows nail art design!</li>
            <li> I bought for myself n sister in law n we luv it we&#x27;re already guna buy some more cuz we are all out will be buying more from this seller</li>
            <li> easy to use, and the size is perfect to. great for precipitant nail art&#x27;s, my kids have a lots of fun with this.</li>
            <li> Flimsy and cheap looking. I was very disappointed when I saw them in person. I ended up giving them to my ten year old daughter to play with.</li>
            <li> This is a really cute product to buy for nail art.  I loved the little silver and golden stars. They got here really fast.</li>
            <li> They took a while ro het here but i love them they look greag on my nails . Also thank you so much cheekys beuty it game a $5 dollar reward</li>
            <li> I like them a lot. They are the right size for nails. However they are just shapes bent up, so there is little area to glue onto nails.  I ordered these for my daughter for her birthday. I did not realize that, they were coming from China.  So delivery time was almost a month.  All in all, I am happy. I will just make sure in the future to order far in advance!!!</li>
            <li> Lots of fun! A little big!</li>
            <li> They are perfect a very good quality  there were the right amount in there and they shipped really fast ! They came just like the description said they would ! I LOVE them</li>
            <li> item is exactly as pictured. works for what i needed it for. glad i found these at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Although these do take quite awhile to arrive, it is worth it as the price is so LOW. My DIL Loves them and will be ordering more nail d√©cor from the seller!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet, but I recently bought some nail glue to use with them, and look forward to trying it out. My only complaint is that these came in a tiny ziplock bag. Fortunately none of them fell out during shipping, but I intend to move them to a different container.</li>
            <li> exactly as pictured! I wasn&#x27;t expecting these to be cute and good quality becuase of the price but they are. I didn&#x27;t count them but it looks like the right amount! They will be perfect for decorating phone cases!</li>
            <li> Everything is neatly packed. I just wish they would separate the silver ones from the goals. They are great and I am going to use them on my nails.</li>
            <li> love it! exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li> these are cute easy to apply perfect size for nails and decorating other items would recommend and would buy again</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, and several packets and so many included.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell you how to get these little suckers to stay on! They are very pretty and are a nice addition to the nail and all, but they keep falling off! I tried two different brands of nail glue and adding a thick amount of clear nail polish over these and they won&#x27;t stay on! I might just use the rest of these for an art project, I don&#x27;t know...</li>
            <li> I bought these for my niece, I thought they were a very good deal for what they cost.  Thank you</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OK THE GEMS DIDN&#x27;T LASTED A WEEK ON MY NAILS. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE. HAPPY COSTUMER!</li>
            <li> These can as described, were send in manilla envelope with 3 little bags of stars. Great addition to any nail art kit.</li>
            <li> I didnt get 250 of them, but im not even mad about that, theres a lot of them in there. I&#x27;m rating 3 stars because i only got gold ones and i really only wanted the silver ones. but whatever, ill use them any ways.</li>
            <li> Its just like in the picture.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Cute and fashionable. I got a lot of compliments from many people. Just make sure to put a top coat or it will change colors quick.</li>
            <li> I ordered alot of my stuff at one time to do my own nails and I never even received these, but I bet it would be nice to have them!</li>
            <li> i really like them good size. i still havent use them but cant wait to try them on they are too cute.</li>
            <li> These are nice to add to nail routine,  So nice to have a little something extra for Partying!  Real nice.</li>
            <li> I love these. Just did a design in my nails with them and it turned out pretty good. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> As expected, gold and silver stars.  Will use them for nail art, didn&#x27;t take too much gel to cover them well.</li>
            <li> Only used them once but they stayed ion the whole time</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, very happy buyer! (:</li>
            <li> These are pretty awesome. I apply them to my nail using a clear coat. I only wished that the two different colored stars were separated in the packaging.</li>
            <li> These came today...ahead of schedule! Yay! They are as described, they come in 5 seperate baggies w/ 50 in each bag. I took the time to separate them and there were more than what was advertised because some of them were stuck together. I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I like them. it was actually more than i thought was going to be in there.its great you should get them.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, it took about 3 and a half weeks. Came in a tiny ziplock baggie. They were half and half as described. Easy to apply i recommend using glue for acrylics. I got away with using glossy top coat on natural nail. Star deducted because you pretty much have to apply the star dead center of the nail so it doesn&#x27;t catch on things. Aside from that they are cute.</li>
            <li> I like it. good product for good price. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet. They&#x27;re really cute and there&#x27;s a lot of them. I received these on time which I was happy with.</li>
            <li> You get what you order</li>
            <li> Perfect for nails or DIY projects. I will be using them on my nails. They&#x27;re the size I expected. But they must be bended before putting on the nails because they are flat.</li>
            <li> very cute, I cannot think of a con but pros They stay on until you take them off if you use a dab of glue before adhering them to the nails and they also go great with everything if you are just wearing jeans and a t-shirt they look great and if you are dressed up IN a dress they also look great.I am glad I bought this and when my stock runs low I am buying more but will buy 2 instead of 1 this time.</li>
            <li> I think for flimsy pieces of 10 they&#x27;re charging too much money but that&#x27;s just my opinion what you see is what you get</li>
            <li> Cute for my kit. I like em alot</li>
            <li> I love these! They just get lost easily. But are really fun to put on your nails and they look great</li>
            <li> Exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase got here faster than expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually quite happy with what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it arrived in five separate small baggies, and after sorting and counting I found that I got 135 silver stars and 138 gold stars and that two bags were big enough for both with still some extra room left over.</li>
            <li> ENDED UP BUYING SEVERAL NAIL ITEMS FOR A FRIEND WHOS STARTING HER SMALL BUSINESS AND SHE LOVED IT</li>
            <li> I like to paint these studs with nail polish to give them a unique look</li>
            <li> Not only did I get these on a timely fashion, but they were exactly like the picture. I put them on my nails &amp; they look great :) Im impressed !!</li>
            <li> These stars are so cute and adorable, my daughter just loves the colors and the fact that she can work with them.  Easy application with a little  patience</li>
            <li> Do not stay on nails well even with glue</li>
