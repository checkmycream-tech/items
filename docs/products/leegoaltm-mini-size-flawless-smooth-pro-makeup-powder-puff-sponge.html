            <li>They are a great price!</li>
            <li>My suggestions, and it is probably best to place the make up on your face with your fingers to emulsify the product and then use the blender to provide a photo finish look.</li>
            <li>I know that may defeat the purpose, but with this tool... it might be best.</li>
            <li>I received mine today and they&#x27;re not the best thing in the world.</li>

            <li>All-in-all good product.</li>
            <li>good quality and price</li>
            <li>The application is good</li>
            <li>üåüüåüüåü, is because a pamphlet showing what each was good for would have been helpful to me.</li>
            <li>Hoping this was a good dupe for BB....</li>
            <li>even gave some to my family and they loved it too</li>
            <li>Cheaper than the one in stores works just as good.</li>
            <li>They are good for the price you pay for them.</li>
            <li>Good until you have to wash or reuse them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good for price.  </li>
            <li>Good price on them too</li>
            <li>No smell love the colors and most of worked perfect with foundation and concelars.very happy</li>
            <li>I rather buy bunch of free latex at CVS or walmart or I rather pay 5-15 dollars for one blender but perfect one.</li>
            <li>still good</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>good looked good to use with my make</li>
            <li>But they are good for the price you pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a good material</li>
            <li>This is so cheap and for a great deal!</li>
            <li>Seem to be just as good as the high-dollar name brand ones here.</li>
            <li>, my daughter loved them now</li>
            <li>product is good.</li>
            <li>it works good to me.</li>
            <li>but they do a good job.</li>
            <li>Good for the price too</li>
            <li>These are good for the price.</li>
            <li>Daughter loved them.</li>
            <li>My make up is applied flawlessly and smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>They work as good as the 19.00 ones at the retail store.</li>
            <li>The sender was good as well</li>
            <li>When you are looking for a good Make up blender, Firmness is something you do not want.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good practice anyway, but these smelled a bit &#x27;off&#x27; when they arrived.</li>
            <li>Came in good condition.</li>
            <li>they work good...</li>
            <li>/&gt;+Price is great, but you do get what you pay for&lt;br /&gt;+Provide a nice finish when used to apply foundation, or in my case BB cream&lt;</li>
            <li>Good price, good blenders.  </li>
            <li>good buy.</li>
            <li>They worked for me and I loved it.</li>
            <li>This size sponge is good for blending areas around the eyes and nose.</li>
            <li>but honestly mine are great, just like the beauty blender</li>
            <li>But if have youthful, even, skin then these will be good for you.</li>
            <li>the price was really good</li>
            <li>good quailty and give my foundation an even spread.</li>
            <li>like see good  and all I wait&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>Price is cheap but the quality is great for me!</li>
            <li>I really loved this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is really good though.</li>
            <li>I hear they are good</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re thinking of getting the micro BBs then these would be good dupes</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work good.</li>
            <li>Good for the price</li>
            <li>My wife loved the product</li>
            <li>It was a good product</li>
            <li>The perfect size and very useful.</li>
            <li>Over all I love the sponges they blend good!</li>
            <li>But I was really impressed when I first opened up the package and then even more impressed when I used it to apply my makeup.</li>
            <li>Love these blenders, good quality at a great price.</li>

            <li>I was happy with my purchase and looking forward to buying some more</li>

            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>She says they&#x27;re easy to wash and do a great job blending the makeup.</li>
            <li>If you want a good beauty blender I wouldn&#x27;t recommend very cheaply made and tore as soon as I tried to put my makeup on...</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re very, very unique!</li>
            <li>Very good quality bending sponge, if you like the beauty blending sponges these are worth getting.</li>
            <li>These are really amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>They work amazing  </li>
            <li>Fabulous job the product was great</li>
            <li>I use these every day and they are amazing</li>
            <li>I like this product considering it comes in 4 for a cheap great price.</li>
            <li>Amazing price for an amazing quality sponge.</li>
            <li>I will never do my makeup without these after trying them&lt;br /&gt;i made an amazing airbrushed finish with these sponges&lt;</li>
            <li>They do an amazing job.</li>
            <li>I use them to apply my bb cream &amp; concealers &amp; it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing for all the sponges you get.</li>
            <li>I love this sponges they are just great, soft and perfect size!!</li>
            <li>honestly have tried them both</li>
            <li>Love these they work really good</li>
            <li>Nice ones..</li>
            <li>They work great and for such a great price!!</li>
            <li>I was given this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>yea I can honestly compare these to the ones at ulta</li>
            <li>Nice polish when u apply it and nice colors to</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged arrived as stated</li>
            <li>Nice sponges.</li>
            <li>These are really nice makeup sponges.</li>
            <li>Nice sponges...</li>
            <li>and they also liked item.</li>
            <li>but i liked it any ways because its just for the face sn</li>
            <li>It blends my make-up nicely and i have no problem with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: i got this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li>but I honestly think that this was a mistake to buy.</li>
            <li>I like the colors and texture they are nice to use</li>
            <li>But it does distribute the makeup nicely.</li>
            <li>The sponges blend the product nice</li>
            <li>They work really well for blending and there texture is awesome.</li>
            <li>I rinsed it in warm water, squeezed it out, dotted my foundation on my face and blended it using the sponge.</li>
            <li>When I used the Pro Beauty Flawless Makeup Blender to apply makeup, I noticed that it absorbed more of the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know WHAT I would recommend them for to be honest.</li>
            <li>They work well for me however and for the price was really nice.</li>
            <li>These were nice to try though x</li>
            <li>but it kind of hurts just hitting your face over and over with these.</li>
            <li>I suggest you soak them in warm water with makeup brush cleaner for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 30 seconds or so, continue to work the mixture into the sponge while under running warm water.</li>
            <li>bought this blender because the coupon community on instagram really sold this like it was the&lt;br /&gt;cheapest, greatest thing on earth!</li>
            <li>Love these so cute and work great..</li>
            <li>I, honestly, don&#x27;t even have the desire to use this crappy product anymore.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune and yet have a good product :)</li>
            <li>I honestly have no comparison to the 20.00 beauty blenders</li>
            <li>this one can be squeezed until just damp, so it leaves a nice airbrushed appearance.</li>
            <li>and I end up using more product to get a good face coverage.</li>
            <li>So it was a great buy and worth the wait!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so excited to use them!!</li>
            <li>Work so good took a while to get to me but worth the wait!!</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and they are the perfect sizes.</li>
            <li>They are the best it was more that what u expect works good totally recommend and good pricing for all three</li>
            <li>A great tip is to use a water mist or a setting spray on the sponges so that the product will move and blend more easily.</li>
            <li>If your new to beauty blenders then this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Good but has a strong smell</li>
            <li>I love this product because iIt blends makeup really well for a flawless finish.</li>
            <li>These are very soft and perfect for my makeup needs.</li>
            <li>they are very easy to work with</li>
            <li>Soon As I Opened It, It Had a Very Strong Rubber Smell</li>
            <li>When I bought these, I was so excited to have something like the popular beauty blenders from Sephora!</li>
            <li>I love these blenders, works a lot better then a brush!</li>
            <li>Or i would HIGHLY recommend getting a &amp;#34;Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Sponge&amp;#34; In some cases people will argue that it is better than the beauty blender and the best part is, it&#x27;s a fraction of the price, I got mine at walmart for like $4</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these amazing for contouring and applying foundation powders, creams, and liquid.</li>
            <li>Colors are definitely bright and cheerful.</li>
            <li>Honestly, $1 makeup sponges from the Dollar Store are much better than these considering they expand with water</li>
            <li>This is an un effective product that absorbs more makeup than it applies.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled with my puffs :)</li>
            <li>Nice and cute just needed extras.....</li>
            <li>I was trying to get a good deal and these are so cheap they don&#x27;t absorb any water but work</li>
            <li>They came early in the mail and are in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>Amazing I love this</li>
            <li>Best deal I have found so far.</li>
            <li>It does come in handy to have more than once</li>
            <li>So far the best I&#x27;ve used to apply makeup.</li>
            <li>Good for the price but not the best quality definitely prefer to spend a more and get the beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>but I honestly think results are better without water.</li>
            <li>Lol after immersing them in water &amp; squeezing them for almost a minute, it didn&#x27;t grow, but I heard that if you put them in warm or barely hot water for 10 minutes, they&#x27;ll soften up.</li>
            <li>Work great, look super cute.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very quick also !</li>
            <li>For the price of this item it is an extremely very good product for anyone to have as either some back-up beauty blenders or as your main beauty blender.</li>
            <li>the colors are cute, no bad odor, easy to use, cheap, i&#x27;m a happy customer!</li>
            <li>loved it, perfect size, was delivered before expected time</li>
            <li>They came in perfect condition in their plastic Baggie and have different variations of &amp;#34;hardness&amp;#34; to get the kind of look you want.</li>
            <li>They are cute, colourful and very easy to through into your makeup bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work great and look exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works pretty great as a nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>The packaging wasn&#x27;t great and it was pretty beat up when it got to me.  </li>
            <li>a piece seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Worked just fine!</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
            <li>These were very cheap and basically you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>The reason I gave it 2 stars is because they were very cheap</li>
            <li>Very light weight and would recommend than buying a $20 &amp;#34;original blender&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>But, I have figured out away to make this soft and amazing to use!!</li>
            <li>This give nice coverage and is easy to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li>great product and super cheap price</li>
            <li>It will work fine for me because I do my own makeup.</li>
            <li>Very soft and good quality!</li>
            <li>They still look brand new after clean and continue to blend perfectly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m OK with that for the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>These sponges came from HongKong, with cute packages.</li>
            <li>they will make sure you get what you ordered</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Love these for setting powder or concealer</li>
            <li>Does blending well and the colors are really cute :)</li>
            <li>Really cheap!</li>
            <li>you get a pack of 4 which is even better.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>My wife is in love with them</li>
            <li>This way you are not losing the most of your product with the applicator.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love...</li>
            <li>The one I got from Walmart works way better than these</li>
            <li>And CHEAP!</li>
            <li>I feel like it absorbs more product than what it leaves on your skin.</li>
            <li>, I also love how cute the colors are.</li>
            <li>Glad i got them.</li>
            <li>Applying foundation is easier for me now because i can apply it in the corners of my face alot better.</li>
            <li>I bought these to apply my foundation with, my favorite is the egg shaped makeup sponge.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a pointed tip to easier</li>

            <li>The application of my foundation and concealer is build able and even with this blenders.</li>

            <li>They don&#x27;t react with water, but they&#x27;re okay for concealer use.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>fingers makes for a better texture than using these sponges on my skin.</li>
            <li>These are so much better to use when applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I last bought the Pueen beauty-blender knock off via Amazon and was really impressed.</li>
            <li>but it takes more effort.</li>
            <li>how much better foundation goes on using a sponge.</li>
            <li>they are surprisingly very sturdy and do a great job at applying liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>For the price, they&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li>I love it&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use these for bronzer and they work better than the brush I have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the size that I was I in satisfied with, it was the texture.</li>
            <li>More of a plastic/ rubber feeling to them</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible</li>
            <li>Love it works so well better than the 14.99 ones.</li>
            <li>I love these things to death.</li>
            <li>I love the variety and the colors.</li>

            <li>Just as I imagined. :)</li>
            <li>and when I start to pay it absorbs most of the product on my face.</li>

            <li>Defenitely recomend them ! :)</li>
            <li>Worked ok for applying my makeup.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I thought these would be softer more spongy</li>
            <li>I really love these blending sponges they really work great</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>But it was okay for its price.</li>
            <li>Until i got the sponges i used brushes that left streakmarks and now these blend my makeup perfectly!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE COLORS AND PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>how much better it is then anything else,</li>
            <li>I have used many blenders</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they work for some people, but I just felt like they would NOT soak up water.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>They do such a wonderful job &amp;</li>
            <li>Peace and love ladies</li>
            <li>I would get four more</li>
            <li>i feel like they soak up the product more than they&#x27;re supposed to</li>
            <li>I love these beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cute, but too dense.</li>
            <li>These couldn&#x27;t suck any more......</li>
            <li>but C&#x27;MON! I could get better from Forever 21.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Just ok...</li>
            <li>Not the most sanitary of ways,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use them much anymore, but they are great.</li>
            <li>but I have tried and tried many times to correct this issue.</li>
            <li>If I would have been paying better attention.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wait 20-28 days for shipping.</li>
            <li>If the packaging was better this would not happen.</li>
            <li>Love the colors, they are just as the leader brand but way cheaper.</li>
            <li>love these-</li>
            <li>it damp absorbs most of your product when apply liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>I am more inclined to change the sponge when it becomes soiled because it does not cost $20.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re so cheap!</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Great  blendin in very well</li>
            <li>They work wonderful just a smaller size</li>

            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I love these blender sponges.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe i got them for such a great price!</li>
            <li>but I really do love these.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend love&#x27;s them and will be ordering more .</li>
            <li>Even the sponges at Forever 21 works much better than these.</li>

            <li>Eh..its ok.</li>
            <li>Me and my daughter love em.</li>
            <li>I bought the set of four Makeup Blenders, thinking it was going to be a better deal, then buying the Beauty Blender for $20 at Sephora.</li>
            <li>The Pro Beauty Flawless Makeup Blender took several weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li>I would save your money and find another product that works better.</li>
            <li>I use the Famous Beauty Blender and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both designs and flaws aside, they really are great.</li>
            <li>but I feel like it couldn&#x27;t get much better than this.</li>
            <li>These are okay.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love them because they&#x27;re do darn cute</li>
            <li>Maybe they will soften up in time and work better for blending.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I bought these for a big Make-up project (Halloween) and they worked great!</li>
            <li>and so do I. :)</li>
            <li>but satisfied.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>if am going to waist more</li>
            <li>but they are going to be better</li>
            <li>Thank you :))</li>
            <li>what do you expect ovrr all I love them they are a steal</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t feel like the authentic beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking to get more coverage, I don&#x27;t suggest this.</li>
            <li>My favorite ones are the tear drop shape blenders.</li>
            <li>I just recive my product really love them.</li>
            <li>I love this beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>and I love the results I get</li>
            <li>, it looks much better than when I apply it with a brush or my fingers.</li>
            <li>I reallt love these</li>
            <li>i love them helps makeup</li>
            <li>I love these makeup sponge.</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>but they are an okay doop.</li>
            <li>I love the colors.</li>
            <li>And feels better than using your sticky hands.</li>
            <li>These blenders work very well when a bit damp and provide great coverage.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>Love em.</li>
            <li>The hourglass shaped sponges worked ok, but the teardrop shaped ones doesn&#x27;t blend at all.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the disposable $1 sponges they sell at the dollar store since you are better off using those.</li>
            <li>and I love how my makeup comes out with this sponge</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and am extremely glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li>okay</li>

            <li>I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>and theyre really cute.</li>
            <li>All in all I am satisfied.</li>

            <li>But I love them</li>
            <li>and I just ordered more.</li>
            <li>I love these with all of my heart, way better than my fingers.</li>
            <li>I wonder if that works better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Therefore the quality is just ok.</li>
            <li>I bought 1 from from target which I like a lo better just more pricey.</li>
            <li>They did get better with the smell</li>
            <li>i wasn&#x27;t sure what the difference was and what I would be getting.</li>
            <li>Love these sponges.&lt;br /&gt;Work</li>

            <li>Able to maneuver and blend product effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>And for the cherry on top they took 2 months to ship  </li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>When I tried to blend out my foundation, it took most of it off my face and felt like I was smashing my skin with a rock.</li>
            <li>Maybe they need more time to wear in?</li>
            <li>Good price but the tear drop looking ones aren&#x27;t the greatest but the other ones work just fine</li>
            <li>Not as good as the original make up blender, but it&#x27;s fine for me.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, very satisfied</li>
            <li>Soft &amp; i loved it!</li>
            <li>Super soft and awesome :)</li>

            <li>All you have to do is clean then with warm water &amp; soap when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>Super cute!</li>
            <li>The more they expand the softer the sponge and the more easily they blend makeup.</li>
            <li>Great price &amp; quality, definitely buying more!</li>
            <li>great normal beauty blenders are around 20</li>
            <li>I was nervous when I first used the first sponge (sent with 4), but after 2 or 3 times using it, my makeup was going on smooth and flawless!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still a nice but at a cool price</li>
            <li>but they are pretty good.</li>
            <li>Quality is pretty good.  </li>

            <li>I love how easy they are to use, and I love how they make my makeup look so light when I soak them in water before application.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m better off just buying the original beauty blenders :)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super cheap and cute!</li>
            <li>These are a great product especially for the price, don&#x27;t pay 3 times as much for one sponge when you can get a great quality here.</li>
            <li>I love them sooo smooth</li>
            <li>They came sooner than I expected and they were the perfect size I wanted.</li>
            <li>It is cheap, but I was still expecting more.</li>
            <li>They were a great price but the only thing I dislike is that it soaks up all the makeup, making me apply more and more to it.</li>
            <li>Came early and were great.  </li>
            <li>These were cheap and cute</li>
            <li>i love the sponges they are great on blending, I would definitely order more of them.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m happy with them so far</li>
            <li>Took a long time for shipping but the sponges are amazing and a great price</li>
            <li>its as genuine as it gets its lovely</li>
            <li>You get what you paid for, based on the price i know it wasn&#x27;t going to be good the real thing.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was too good to be true...and it really was.</li>
            <li>Good quality and a very convenient shape.</li>
            <li>For the price and the shipping time and everything, deft worth it.</li>
            <li>but they do a very damn good job blending makeup and concealer.</li>
            <li>They worked awesome just as good even better then the more expensive brand ones</li>
            <li>It come with all the colors very nice and soft</li>
            <li>They are a lot more dense than the original beauty blender.  </li>
            <li>Alright, I am definitely sure you makeup artists out there are familiar with the beauty blender worldly known at seohora.</li>
            <li>The other two are perfect for blending concealer or foundation</li>
            <li>you should get it a little damp, but I will be ordering like 12 more of these because of the price and how great they are!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this listing, I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It is true that it is very cheap</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li>Reusable and easy to wash.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply?</li>
            <li>The makeup washes out easy out of the sponge.</li>
            <li>They do not apply foundation easily and effortlessly as they are supposed to.  </li>
            <li>makes it easy to apply foundation.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use..</li>
            <li>the real beauty blender is extremely soft and airy, easy to press together and works perfect for applying foundation.</li>
            <li>The material is durable and easy to wash.</li>
            <li>I like using brushes better to apply my make up because I can clean it</li>
            <li>they are tiny beauty blenders ,eveb thought they worked great &amp; more easier to reach on under eyes</li>
            <li>They were more tiny then I imagined but work just as great.</li>
            <li>Making blending incredibly easy.</li>
            <li>easy to hold.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll clean</li>
            <li>Love how the price is great for a total of 4 of them.</li>
            <li>Has a really strong odor.</li>
            <li>but they have a strong smell of latex</li>
            <li>Just as good as any high end beauty sponges.</li>
            <li>I believe they are just as good as the high dollar ones.</li>
            <li>Arrived early which was amazing!</li>
            <li>It works great for blending and just in general makeup application.</li>
            <li>so I guess they are OK but for full application coverage don&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li>Was hoping this would be a nice dupe for the higher end sponges and it was not.</li>
            <li>they blend the foundation so good, make it look real natural in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love the blenders they are true to photo except colors vary.</li>
            <li>love these not as fantastic as the original beauty blender</li>
            <li>:) Would definitely recommend, good enough product for a very good price.</li>
            <li>Gives my makeup a flawless finish, they&#x27;re soft, doesn&#x27;t absorb too much product when used damp, &amp; easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I went to Ulta and bought a large beauty blender and love it!</li>
            <li>Small, but perfect for traveling light!</li>
            <li>you know how to used them, I suppose they are fine.</li>
            <li>but they work fine</li>
            <li>and this gets the job done just fine.</li>
            <li>because its so light weight it easily molds to the face and that is what makes it apply</li>
            <li>I was thinking that it would be fine and tested to see if it was absorb water, they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless they still blend fine for the price.</li>
            <li>I think they will be fine.</li>
            <li>but they work fine.</li>
            <li>but once i washed them they worked fine</li>
            <li>These are just fine and seem to work just peachy.</li>
            <li>Super affordable blending sponges!</li>
            <li>However, the package did arrive before its estimated time :) I have never used the Beauty Blender, but these sponges seems to be an adequate dupe.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more like a rubbery odor but goes away after so many times of using it able to clean very easy and there super soft!</li>
            <li>because I didn&#x27;t know if I would like the real sponge I ordered these, and I love them!</li>
            <li>Good bye Sephora as far as makeup sponges!</li>
            <li>They are super easy to clean too!</li>
            <li>Wet them before you use them, wash them weekly, they are really a very good product.</li>
            <li>First off these are super cute!</li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t a huge loss.</li>
            <li>Product is great, came sooner than expected, should have brought more.</li>
            <li>Tried it because they were so cheap.</li>
            <li>Overall, great sponges.</li>
            <li>Great for blending last forever too!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I had one real beauty blender given to me as a gift that wirked amazing,</li>
            <li>They fit in the palm of my hand even when damp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>when i got the package, it could fit in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li>The sponge sucked up all my fountain no matter how lightly I blotted.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Work great, are a lot smaller</li>
            <li>Overall these makeup blenders are great for the price</li>
            <li>They are smaller than I would like but still great for use</li>
            <li>The smooth makeup powder puff is just a cheaper brand of the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>yes they are cheap</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave you a smooth finish and feel on your skin.</li>
            <li>and they apply my foundation smoothly.</li>
            <li>If you want to go the cheap route then this would do</li>
            <li>Great quality and price ,the only problem shipping took 6-8 wks</li>
            <li>but if you like to save money and look fabulous while doing it..then order these sponges.</li>
            <li>Nice reasonable price</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Creams and make-up glide smoothly across  </li>
            <li>However I did enjoy the quality of it.</li>
            <li>4small sponges, nice colors , &amp; fast shipping .</li>
            <li>Smooth finish when used correctly (moisten the sponge before applying liquid or creme makup)</li>
            <li>Then when I try to blend my makeup, even something as light as BB cream, it looks like they pick it up without blending it in.</li>
            <li>But I enjoy them ; works well for my needs</li>
            <li>so I tried to shoot for this cheap alternative.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and everything.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter that these are cheap.</li>
            <li>I was not impress with the quality , no wonder there so cheap in price.</li>
            <li>the foundation gets suck and doesn&#x27;t apply on to your skin smoothly.</li>
            <li>Its suppose to glide and coat your face smoothly.</li>
            <li>I used to smooth out my clay projects.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really enjoy it</li>
            <li>As an artist I can not use cheap stuff on my clients faces.</li>
            <li>but i paid cheap for it</li>
            <li>its cheap... don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>but I do enjoy them a lot</li>
            <li>Great quality, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>but I do enjoy the size since I just use them for my under eye concealer.</li>
            <li>Just soak them in water and squeeze some water out so the sponge is lightly damp</li>
            <li>And they are cheap.</li>
            <li>Cheap material</li>
            <li>i got them a few weeks after i ordered and I have to say, I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li>I think they are well worth the price :)</li>
            <li>They are cheap beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>They blend my makeup great and they will last a while!</li>
            <li>Feels cheap does not blend well</li>
            <li>I also have two Beauty Blenders already so these were just extra lol.</li>
            <li>But overall was happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Such a great deal, and</li>
            <li>Cheap product</li>
            <li>The product is fantastic</li>
            <li>They are really good for putting on foundation because it makes it look so natural.</li>
            <li>They came in a clear Ziploc bag, in good condition.</li>
            <li>But no real complaint it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>I wash mine regularly, and they are much softer and great for foundation application!</li>
            <li>soft, good quality.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Style Wurks makes a much better knock off for a couple more bucks, as does Real Techniques.</li>
            <li>Overall if you want a more inexpensive beauty blender option this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t need them right away.</li>
            <li>Still very useful.</li>
            <li>I gave one to my sister, daughter, friend and kept one, found it very useful  </li>
            <li>I blends products on smoothly just like the original beauty blender, and for the price and quantity I can not complain at all.</li>
            <li>The quality of the sponges, however, is incomparable to that of the original beauty blender.</li>
            <li>super easy to use and to clean great product overall.</li>
            <li>The application was clean and streak free.</li>
            <li>Over all, the shipping was pretty fast and the price was good</li>
            <li>Cleans easily and air dries quick.  </li>
            <li>Excellent little sponges!</li>
            <li>Good price, however this makeup blender absorbs too much of your makeup compared to the beauty blender and its more dense, but overall its ok.</li>
            <li>but I love them they&#x27;re perfect for hard areas to blend!</li>
            <li>These have made such a HUGE difference in highlighting &amp; contouring on me &amp; for my clients &amp; very easy to use &amp; easily washable!</li>
            <li>will purchase  more in the future :) i recommend!</li>
            <li>Of course this is NOT the ORIGINAL BEAUTY BLENDER,  but it will do the job.</li>
            <li>worth the buck!</li>
            <li>but they are significantly smalled and denser.</li>
            <li>I was so excited.</li>
            <li>At first i wasnt sure if i should have ordered these beauty blenders</li>
            <li>This is not the original beauty blender üíî</li>
            <li>I also liked that I was able to get 4 for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing like the original beauty blender.</li>
            <li>I bought the beauty blender original from another seller here in amazon.com</li>
            <li>The colors are fun too!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Not as excited about them</li>
            <li>This product is worth the price!</li>
            <li>unbelievable price and great product!</li>
            <li>So worth the money!</li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>but well worth the wait!</li>
            <li>They worked pretty well, not my favorite beauty tool.</li>
            <li>Love the item, but it took over 2 months to get to me, as the first was lost in the mail.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not like the original beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Love em and received them much quicker than I thought!</li>
            <li>Was not disappointed when I received them.</li>
            <li>WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>The colors and shapes are adorable (the colors of mine match the picture exactly).</li>
            <li>That being said, I have never tried the original</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t grow like original beauty blenders</li>
            <li>Product not very absorbent and breaks easily but also way better than spending fifteen bucks on one at Sephora!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t wash off as easy with soap n water used twice only works great when first used</li>
            <li>Very affordable and easy to use!</li>
            <li>I tried to get the products out of the blender using soap, olive oil and a mixture of baby shampoo (as they recommend when you clean the original beauty blender) and I noticed the product would not get clean and started coming apart.</li>
            <li>it made my skin look so clean</li>
            <li>Just clean them well before using them</li>
            <li>But benefit of the doubt they are clean, no scent of anything on them.</li>
            <li>I also found a tutorial on how to clean them with dish-soap and olive oil.</li>
            <li>If you use a sponge constantly, going for this economical version is a great option to save $</li>
            <li>In two minutes all the product should be lifted and you should have a clean sponge.</li>
            <li>Durable, washes clean &amp; hadnt stained after 28 uses</li>
            <li>Some foundations and concealers will stain the sponges, just wash the areas used for applying makeup with soap to insure that they are completely clean.</li>
            <li>clean your sponges with makeup removing face wash.</li>
            <li>(that bottle can dispense erratically) and this bb saved my face after blotting excess off with a cloth and just rolling bb rinsed clean over everything a couple of times for flawlessness.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even need to clean it.</li>
            <li>For the price I think its amazing just like one I paid $10 for its very soft.</li>
            <li>Love my sponges it gives my make up a nice feel and smooth look even though it took long to come</li>
            <li>Super clean, very soft and spongy, nicely sealed packaging that delivered on time.</li>
            <li>Nothing special...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you can just clean them off if the smell bothers you that much.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and able to blend makeup in easily.</li>
            <li>Awesome and does the job but a lil hard</li>
            <li>These sponges are great for applying concealer even loose powder!</li>
            <li>These beauty sponges work great and all only has a foul smell first time , so</li>
            <li>Damp the sponge and apply your liquid makeup for amazing smoothness and soft looking skin.</li>
            <li>These beauty blenders were exactly what I was looking for and at such a great price, there&#x27;s no mistake buying this product.</li>
            <li>ONE WAS GREAT WET</li>
            <li>Nothing compared to the beauty blender but good enough.</li>
            <li>Good product for a lesser price than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I love them and it was fast delivery</li>
            <li>Smaller than the picture appears but it does a good job</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t purchased an actual Beauty Blender before as I am unwilling to spend $20 on a sponge, but have purchased knock-offs before that I really loved.</li>
            <li>Get the real deal :-)</li>
            <li>These are cool.</li>
            <li>so you assume you&#x27;re getting 4 full sized beauty blenders</li>
            <li>The spotting was near immediate when I put them in warm water.</li>
            <li>There good but way smaller then</li>
            <li>Thought they would be bigger, but they are a good size.</li>
            <li>Good middle of the line make-up sponge.</li>
            <li>I prefer them to be more gentle.</li>
            <li>The color is spot on (if you care about that) and they&#x27;re soft, but they don&#x27;t expand with water and they don&#x27;t bounce on your skin nicely, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>You can probably use these, but they will be more damaging to your face as you want to be gentle when applying makeup so as not to cause any wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li>I got this product because i heard so many people rave about this and say how much they adore it and</li>
            <li>These are so cute and work really really well.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good enough for the price</li>
            <li>but overall was a good purchase for the price.  </li>
            <li>they nice soft and manageble</li>
            <li>the colors are true to picture .</li>
            <li>its overall a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When they arrived, I absolutely fell in love with them.</li>
            <li>good price and the product coming earlier</li>
            <li>Good but can find same product and cheaper.</li>
            <li>Thought it was a good deal for 4 of them, instead of one for the same price.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for the sponges that much, my foundation brushes get the job done more efficiently.</li>
            <li>Ive used them numerous times &amp; they work really good.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft.</li>
            <li>these are so cool</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also made of a different material that&#x27;s not as good.</li>
            <li>they absorb a lot of makeup , so really your using about 3x more , than if you were just to use your fingers ...</li>
            <li>I went and bought the real beauty blender for 20 bucks rather spend the money on something better.</li>
            <li>Not bad for what i paid .</li>
            <li>Not bad considering</li>
            <li>Not bad, work well</li>
            <li>SO NOT BAD</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>It handles my make up well and blends perfectly like any other high price one.</li>
            <li>If you just use your blender like a sponge, with less padding and more wiping, you might find it good.</li>
            <li>I will order more and appreciated how quickly they came.</li>
            <li>The original Beauty Blender is supposed to grow considerably in size when wet, changing it&#x27;s texture and allowing for the flawless finish</li>
            <li>Swells slightly soaked in water and applies liquid beautifully.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product , but not 5 star worthy .</li>
            <li>They clean up pretty well with brush cleaner, too!</li>
            <li>Other than that, this was a great buy.</li>
            <li>Good at blending but kind hard</li>
            <li>Gotta love my new beauty blenders!</li>
            <li>love this set because it allows me to use a new sponge every couple months-better for your skin!  </li>
            <li>I love them and will definitely be getting more when I need them.</li>
            <li>So somebody stole one of em and it was the cute blue one that i wanted the most.</li>
            <li>I love the way my make up goes on, much better than the regular sponges and brushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use them for some quick blending when I&#x27;m in a hurry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the purple one a couple of times and I have to say that with a couple more dollars you could definitely get a better one.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that the sponges were cheap, but you are definitely getting what you paid for.</li>
            <li>The only reason they don&#x27;t get all stars is because I revived mines packaged in the mailing bag if it would of been packaged in a different bag besides the mailing one , that would of been great!</li>
            <li>Super hard...not sponge like at all.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty small, but they work perfect!</li>
            <li>These are super dense.</li>
            <li>Wash them with water and mild soap every time you use them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they would be awesome with dry products rather than wet products.</li>
            <li>The quality is comparable to those purchased at a high end makeup store and the cost is so low one can discard rather than spending time in cleaning which gives you a better and more healthy applicator.  </li>
            <li>, if you don&#x27;t need it right away and can wait the shipping date it is SO WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>It works a lot better than some high end blending brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>:) I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>As normal dip into water squeeze excess water dab onto foundation, dab lightly in the eye ducts, nose all over face, these are true to color and work as well as you&#x27;d pay 20.00 each!</li>
            <li>I tested them when they were dry and was pretty happy.</li>
            <li>The colors were pretty accurate</li>
            <li>Size was smaller than original beauty blender but girlfriend liked them.</li>
            <li>I got them today, it takes a long time because its from china, but they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>Pros Cheap,Soft,Pretty,Reaches into Certain Areas, easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Worth the money, better then the high end department store brands you can buy for $20+ ‚Ä¶</li>
            <li>4 sponges is way more than enough super easy to wash and is super convenient.</li>
            <li>and they are super fun colors.</li>
            <li>It is too dense of a material to really blend easily.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product and from this seller as they shipped fast coming from China.</li>
            <li>These work very well, but they do have a strong odor to them.</li>
            <li>They also tear extremely easily with a gentle squeeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my makeup didn&#x27;t really spread to easily.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>You get amazing colors and they work good &amp; last long</li>
            <li>When I first got them I was soo excited thinking I would never ave to buy a beauty blender again because there was four.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited for them</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Recommended by a Make up Professional and artist as my self! :)</li>
            <li>I know they&#x27;re super cheap and not the real beauty blender brand</li>
            <li>Very soft And easy to clean.</li>
            <li>spend a few more bucks on a better one!</li>
            <li>but I love my blenders, works better with loose powders</li>
            <li>These blenders are pretty cool, if only i would get better at this blending thing!</li>
            <li>These are great sponges, I was just a little upset</li>
            <li>These are great little blenders.</li>
            <li>Still, they&#x27;re really great little blenders.</li>
            <li>To clean them, squeeze water through them and apply either a facial cleanser that can remove makeup, dish soap, or a special beauty blender sponge cleaner, the bar version is supposed to work better than the liquid one.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very excited to have gotten them!</li>
            <li>I received these sponges and since they were so cheap, my expectations weren&#x27;t very high.</li>
            <li>The cheaper one gives you the same finish and the design is amazing.</li>
            <li>These are really very efficient for application and the price is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; anything in but they do smooth it out.</li>
            <li>They work really well with giving my face a smooth airbrushed look.</li>
            <li>it really helps make your foundation have a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>I knew not to expect much from these seeing as they were SO cheap.</li>
            <li>Really firm , but would be great for contouring to press the make up in .</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>The shipping took a bit of time, but these babies are worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s useful, it does its job</li>
            <li>They are pretty cool for the price...</li>
            <li>Worth the wait on shipping.</li>
            <li>i wash them then apply hand sanitizer to keep them fresh.</li>
            <li>Just took a while to get here but there worth it</li>
            <li>Use a sponge, better coverage, seamless blending for foundation, cover up, etc.</li>
            <li>but for the price it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li>These are colorful, dense sponges.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>So I ordered a different kind that I saw some girls on youtube use in there tutorial.</li>
            <li>While the product itself is a wonderful texture and density, I have to say that they are a lot smaller than I had expected them to be.</li>
            <li>So they are worth the price.</li>
            <li>So worth the couple bucks.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, but these aren&#x27;t even worth the $3.00.</li>
            <li>Nice application, doesn&#x27;t glide over the skin as well as actual beauty blender</li>
            <li>I washed them a few times with dish soap and warm water and the smell is most gone.</li>
            <li>But they were worth the wait</li>
            <li>Which is way over priced but worth it because the finish it leaves.</li>
            <li>I love how soft these are compared to beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>worth the purchase for me.</li>
            <li>and my makeup is so much fun to apply with the sponges.</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>It was such a nice deal.</li>
            <li>But for the price your paying for 4 sponges I think its worth it.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or money on this cheap product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;i guess its worth the price.</li>
            <li>It took over a month to finally receive them, and once I got them and opened the package they were not in any kind of bag or wrapping, they were just shoved in a envelope and sent out.</li>
            <li>However, they weren&#x27;t useful at all.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait</li>
            <li>If you want a really good one, I would recommend trying to find some that expand when wet.</li>
            <li>Soooo worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Took almost a month to receive this product, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>i love them so far.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Worth d money.</li>
            <li>Worth it</li>
            <li>They were smaller than expected, but since i need them for concealer, they worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait for the delivery üëç</li>
            <li>They are well worth what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I really liked these for smaller areas on your face</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought they would be bigger but its not.</li>
            <li>but I just didn&#x27;t find it useful for me at all.</li>
            <li>Be sure to thoroughly rinse with water, squeezing to get all of the makeup out, until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>I still switch back and forth, but hey it&#x27;s nice to have in my arsenal loll.</li>
            <li>Got here pretty quickly and exactly as pictured!</li>
            <li>The sponges are reusable and you can clean them with makeup brush cleaner or run them under warm water and let them air dry !</li>
            <li>/&gt;they are very soft and clean so well!</li>
            <li>I bought this flawless from other seller and they were bigger</li>
            <li>I love them there way cheaper than the original ones and does just the same thing there is a bit of an odor</li>
            <li>Sure i could go buy the normal white ones but these ones are more fun.</li>
            <li>Other wise I would have not purchased.</li>
            <li>These sponges are very dense and user friendly.</li>
            <li>This are cute and enjoy being able to get into small areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no professional makeup artist nor a beauty guru, I just love make up!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold too much product, its easy to clean, and most of the time I use my dry.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of softness and resiliency.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t absorb makeup and they are just the right size and price.</li>
            <li>right (shruggs).</li>
            <li>Or maybe I&#x27;m not using it right?</li>
            <li>I order a beauty blender from sephora right away.</li>
            <li>Maybe I wasn&#x27;t doing it right</li>
            <li>They clean really and help to apply make evenly.</li>
            <li>These are nice little applicators for applying foundation to make sure it goes one evevnly,I would definitely purchase more of these.</li>
            <li>They are great for makeup but it is super hard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like getting  them for free and high quality</li>
            <li>Small but works great</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re too small and leave a smell on my face like the smell of a balloon lol</li>
            <li>They are sooo small lol</li>
            <li>I really liked the set, but it took a really long time to get them.  </li>
            <li>Loooooove came a little later but great product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I wish I had just dished out a little more and bought the one in the store.</li>
            <li>pretty nice for concealer , way smaller then I expected but still quite nice .</li>
            <li>kind of hard, but cute colors</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>Plus, if you have dry skin, they don&#x27;t feel too nice being rubbed on your face.</li>
            <li>Not even worth sending back because it would cost more to ship than the purchase price.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>This product is more useful after several usages.</li>
            <li>They are now soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>but there fun and cute for a girl starting out if shed patient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually a complainer, but these were cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I use powders only and this has a very smooth finish on my skin.</li>
            <li>They are very soft too and very colorful.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>And they are very soft and very useful.</li>
            <li>The first couple times you use a new one, you&#x27;ll need to use a lot more water than normal.</li>
            <li>They feel soft and mine arrived smelling fine and appearing without marks.</li>
            <li>Smaller then expected but really loved them !</li>
            <li>These little sponges work wonderfully at a REALLY fair price.</li>
            <li>They are little, but they&#x27;re a good size for your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also given these as gifts in little makeup bags for people I&#x27;ve done exchanges with, and they all said they found a good use for them.</li>
            <li>the original is very soft and blends makeup.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this same product many times.</li>
            <li>The smallness actually helps get in the nooks and crannies better.</li>
            <li>i got only 3 but its better than nothing.</li>
            <li>my first time using these</li>
            <li>Works really!</li>
            <li>Shipping was also really fast which is also a plus!</li>
            <li>Came fast!</li>
            <li>I really like them!</li>
            <li>The only redeeming quality is that my nephew likes to play with them.</li>
            <li>Worked very well!</li>
            <li>I wish more companies would treat their clients with such respect.</li>
            <li>You are better off spending the extra money on a nicer one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure each shape is for a different purpose.</li>
            <li>They work a lot better with the bigger size I received from my first order.</li>
            <li>but I decided to change it because i was going based off my first impression.</li>
            <li>Blends makeup really well !</li>
            <li>Still use in a pinch but prefer a more absorbent sponge and a different texture to create an airbrush effect.</li>
            <li>They are trying to sell only one applicator for over 10 dollars at Target and these are even better.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>These are ok, I thought they would be bigger.</li>
            <li>but the only thing is that they are a bit more dense</li>
            <li>For as inexpensive as they are, and if you&#x27;re willing to wait for the shipping, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying a blender like this</li>
            <li>These are small in size but are still perfect to use and are portable since they are tiny.</li>
            <li>And the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>i love this product and totally recommend this to anyone who cant afford the beautyblender.-XOAuriBeauty&lt;br /&gt;XOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com</li>
            <li>Although I love the very low price!</li>
            <li>Anyone who has reviewed these saying these are just like the Beauty blender or even better is obviously lying.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and assorted colors makes applying makeup fun.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what i thought i would</li>
            <li>Love them just wish they came  in the set and not all 4 the same</li>
            <li>Glad I only paid $2.50 for them.</li>
            <li>I love the different shapes as well.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered these they were squishy like a blender sponge.</li>
            <li>They are a basic sponge in cute colors.</li>
            <li>I would rather save money on sponges and save it for higher end make up.</li>
            <li>They work well for the price, kinda smell funny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They blended pretty well</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work better than just a regular make up sponge</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for beginners at least.</li>
            <li>They do exactly what I need them to do.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the product and</li>
            <li>Love them way smaller than I expect ed but still gets the Job done</li>
            <li>I wanted to get the higher end ones that they sell at the store for ten times more.</li>
            <li>These do not smell funny or like chemicals.</li>
            <li>Love them I totally recommend them</li>
            <li>You get exactly whats shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>I thought they were alot more bigger</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t grow with water like higher priced beauty blenders and they don&#x27;t seem quite as durable.</li>
            <li>It makes all beauty blenders work better, and it makes the blenders a bit bigger, trust me.</li>
            <li>on me one of them smelled funny</li>
            <li>especially cause they came with more than one</li>
            <li>I use it for applying BB cream and it works very well for me!</li>
            <li>and they work pretty well considering the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to accept the cons for the price break.</li>
            <li>Exactly whas was described and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>and then it is ready to use!</li>
            <li>I will order more in the future</li>
            <li>Well I really hoped this helped!</li>
            <li>They are softer and because they&#x27;re slightly smaller, I get a more even coverage.</li>
            <li>I would save my $2 and just go get a real beauty blender!</li>
            <li>THEY ARE SO CHEAP AND SO SOFT, JUST LIKE THE BEAUTY BLENDER AND</li>
            <li>SOOOO MUCH CHEAPER!</li>
            <li>They worked ok but obviously nowhere close to the quality of beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>First, this product took a month to ship to my place.</li>
            <li>It is much smaller, but I like the size better.</li>
            <li>I thought they were bigger, but I love them either way.</li>
            <li>DONT BUY, for $6 you can buy the sponge from real techniques !</li>
            <li>I ordered these back in summer and now I made another purchase for more of them.</li>
            <li>As good of a quality as the ones I buy at Ulta, but for so much less!</li>
            <li>The texture is really soft but there was a very distinct smell when I took them out of the packaging which gave me a headache</li>
            <li>I expected to get 2 of one kind and 2 of the other kind.</li>
            <li>They came right on time the blend really well.</li>
            <li>They are a bit hard at first but the more you use the better they feel.</li>
            <li>They did so great that my Sister got a set for herself &amp; my young little friend that helps me sometimes with</li>
            <li>but I prefer a flat top brush to the sponge method anyway.</li>
            <li>When I first started using them, I thought they were basic make up sponges, but you really have to break it in for it to work better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite a hard sponge, it doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference when you put water on it, but it still does a great job of putting on make up and for the price you get quite a deal.</li>
            <li>very soft, not sure of the material but feels like memory foam, beautiful colors, shipped pretty fast</li>
            <li>These seriously work amazing just need to wet them first and your foundation turns out amazing!  </li>
            <li>Got them earlier then I expected which is great.</li>
            <li>These sponges are smaller than I expected, but the quality is great</li>
            <li>Great product, smaller than expected and slower shipping than I hoped for.</li>
            <li>as far as cleaning, someone said it doesn&#x27;t get clean with soap and water.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really absorb water when you get them wet, but honestly you get what you pay for when it comes to a beauty blender.</li>
            <li>so dont expect that.. their pretty small and good for things like concealer</li>
            <li>Just wish the texture was similar more to the real beaut blender...</li>
            <li>It is so convenient to be able to use the same applicator for the whole face</li>
            <li>Compared to the one I currently have, they are not as spongy and do not absorb water as good as my current one.</li>
            <li>My package did get lost in the mail so it too far too long to ship but other than that, this product in my opinion, is great!</li>
            <li>But were super affordable and soft!</li>
            <li>I find these pretty decent for blending out concealer, but oh lord don&#x27;t even think of using these with your foundation!</li>
            <li>Not the best, they kind of absorb the product weird and distribute it unevenly.</li>
            <li>Buh the acetone eats it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Took a long time to ship but for the price that was ok.</li>
            <li>I bought these because I&#x27;ve been wanting to try some different sponges, and I find these to work better than those cheap white wedges you can buy at any store.</li>
            <li>Even though these took a long time to arrive I still love them.</li>
            <li>These took a long time to ship, but I love these things.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t do much good because they are so small.</li>
            <li>These good enough for travel, very tiny, but I don&#x27;t like how much it absorbs product.</li>
            <li>Small but still a good buy</li>
            <li>They feel nice in my hand and I am no longer tied down to a pricy beauty sponge which makes for healthier skin.</li>
            <li>These little sponges are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>These little guys are cute and blend well!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wet the sponge first.  </li>
            <li>and I find it works a lot better rather than having it dry.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I expected I love them</li>
            <li>Super soft</li>
            <li>Wring/squeeze them out and let them dry on the counter top.</li>
            <li>Second thing is that the product has a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>If you take good care of your sponges, then they should last a long time no matter where they were bought.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly certain, so when it gives you a delivery date of five weeks out, believe it.</li>
            <li>but these do not blend well with certain foundation brands.</li>
            <li>Way to large to apply Foundation and Powder.</li>
            <li>I honestly bought these because I wanted to try a beauty blender without the original&#x27;s ridiculous price tag.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give them a few more days to see how they work!</li>
            <li>These are very stiff and do not do a good job of blending anything.  </li>
            <li>These sponges are fine but THEY ARE WAY SMALLER</li>
            <li>I am fine with this - I don&#x27;t know what being larger would help anyway.</li>
            <li>Other than the long shipping time, this product is great.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent sponges</li>
            <li>Smaller than expected but also super cute in fun shapes and sizes.</li>
            <li>Really handy little things.</li>
            <li>Just as expected and SUPER soft!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Good shape and gets into hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>However, for the price it is hard to complain.&lt;br /&gt;All 4 in good shape.</li>
            <li>They are a little smaller than the ones I bought in the store, but this makes them perfect for blending smaller areas like the nose and can still be used for the temples, cheekbones and anywhere else.</li>
            <li>They are a little harder than the ones at professional make up stores but work just as great!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t feel too soft or hard, texture is just great.</li>
            <li>the egg shaped ones seem to dry up quicker now but other than that extremely happy with them</li>
            <li>good for the price, the material they are made of is more dense than others I have bought from make up stores such as ulta, whether that is a good or bad thing, I think, is based on personal preference</li>
            <li>I was surprised how soft they were considering how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>probably 1/3 size of the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li>They are very dense.</li>
            <li>They came really fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>makes beating my face so much easier</li>
            <li>It did not &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34; off my skin when applying, unlike the real deal sponges.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Blends very well</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOOOVVEEEEE</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>These blenders are actually much softer and easier to blend with then some drug store brands.</li>
            <li>They work really well and their washable</li>
            <li>Where did the beauty blender sponge from sephora derive from to cost so much?</li>
            <li>very poorly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would really make a difference</li>
            <li>1/4 the size of the authentic ones  - and don&#x27;t expand at all when wet.  </li>
            <li>I bought a set of identical sponges from a different seller and they were a fantastic dupe for the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li>but otherwise its a very sturdy product, I was expecting it to be softer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to apply rather than rubbing it on your face.</li>
            <li>these sponges work really well for me.</li>
            <li>Such a low price for such a great product.</li>
            <li>Very well.</li>
            <li>When I opened them there was an intense chemical smell.</li>
            <li>I used one of the pink ones (with no spots) on my face, but I&#x27;m not so sure I want to use it again.</li>
            <li>Skip this and by a Real Techniques dupe.</li>
            <li>Get a real Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li>Overall cheap</li>
            <li>Order was shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Material is very rubbery-like .</li>
            <li>Not what she was expecting and would rather spend $20 for the real thing.</li>
            <li>So if you want the real thing, you are going to have to shop elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I suggest this to anyone  who needs something light and simple to apply makeup with.</li>
            <li>these really suck.</li>
            <li>Splurge and buy the real deal.</li>
            <li>nothing like the real beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>They hold up really well and don&#x27;t piece apart</li>
            <li>When I bought these, I wasn&#x27;t into makeup as much as I am now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it really does work well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suggest real techniques orange sponge thing.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work very well for foundation either.</li>
            <li>Will stick with the real blenders from now on.</li>
            <li>They do tend to soak up product since they are very dense.</li>
            <li>So much for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Work really well haven&#x27;t tried a real beauty blender yet to no the difference between them.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to everyone!</li>
            <li>They also did not seem to expand when wet the way most beauty blenders should.</li>
            <li>Holds to much product</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t complain too much.  </li>
            <li>It also came in really fast</li>
            <li>I have never tried a beauty blender, but I will very soon.</li>
            <li>I dont really recommend them.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>not so much liquid foundations</li>
            <li>I absolutely like this product.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product</li>
            <li>it takes up too much of my productsut</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always not taking up too much</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>They make your makeup look polished and picture ready.</li>
            <li>Such a fantastic deal for 4 of them.</li>
            <li>They are very har, and they do not come in the box</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really wash it out</li>
            <li>I love these sponges they make your makeup extra smooth and blended when you use em wet.</li>
            <li>and you really save on product, and it goes on smoother.  </li>
            <li>if u don&#x27;t have make up brushes or for really real beginners in makeup.</li>
            <li>And they do not grow that much</li>
            <li>I have found that concealer does not wash out as it does with my beauty blender, and the sponges hold too much moisture when damp (the beauty blender sponges are meant to be used damp).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to throw them all away and buy the real thing I guess.</li>
            <li>They blend really well for the price.</li>
            <li>I use it to apply makeup on my neck as I figured it didn&#x27;t do much coverage as I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li>It did light coverage only which made me stick to my concealer brush to blend foundation on my face.</li>
            <li>Overall, if you are looking for light coverage blending sponges, this may work for you.</li>
            <li>These arrived surprisingly fast, it still says here on Amazon that &amp;#34;it&#x27;s on its way.</li>
            <li>I Really Like This Dupe Beauty Blenders.</li>
            <li>really like these.</li>
            <li>They blend very well when I applie my make up.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product, as well as offordable.</li>
            <li>Nothing like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t like the real beauty blender</li>
            <li>It applies really well</li>
            <li>About 2 1/2 inches in height, works REALLY well.</li>
            <li>so I needed something that was reasonable for the price and quantity.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much  </li>
            <li>These work well, but definitely don&#x27;t blend as smoothly as a foundation brush.</li>
            <li>very easy!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really see that as a problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just I feel like the sponge absorbes a lot of the makeup and doesn&#x27;t apply much of it to my face.</li>
            <li>Using these is so much easier than using a foundation brush.</li>
            <li>They do increase in size but not by much after wetting them.</li>
            <li>This product really covers my makeup very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks again for the bargain.</li>
            <li>AND IT DOES BLENDING VERY</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li>If you have used a beauty blender or even the real techniques</li>
            <li>I really soaked these sponges like you&#x27;re supposed to (like</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t perform very well for me.</li>
            <li>Soaked up a lot of product and then didn&#x27;t distribute much at all.</li>
            <li>I really hope that they would improve their product and shipping time.</li>
            <li>You really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery work</li>
            <li>Ladies/Gents, just get the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kinda glad I got all pink</li>
            <li>and it overwhelms my whole bedroom.</li>
            <li>I doubt I&#x27;ll use them though because it seems really chemically which is weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It blends in very well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>Instead of paying so much for 1 at a stre</li>
            <li>They came really fast.</li>
            <li>I gave 3 starts because I think they absorb too much of my foundation</li>
            <li>Never used real one</li>
            <li>I would much rather just buy the beauty blender and know what I&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li>Please note: I have never used the real Beauty Blender, I got these as replacements for the sponges I had been buying at TJ Maxx.</li>
            <li>but I think they&#x27;ll work better once I get them broken in more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more in the near future.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used to almond shaped ones, but they work well to blend in my BB cream, much better than just my fingers.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, and you use less makeup than putting the foundation on with your fingers.</li>
            <li>Its okay I guess ,they are super small though.</li>
            <li>Perfect other than they are much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li>It had smaller pores than most other dupes and had a smooth surface.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste money on the high priced sponges when these little babies do just as awesome.</li>
            <li>This is an example of how some knock off&#x27;s can be equal to the original.</li>
            <li>If they were larger or closer to the consistency of the original Beauty Blender</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re smaller than the original blending sponges</li>
            <li>I purchased these to replace my other beauty blender and I am pleased with my choice.</li>
            <li>there a great product just like the real thing and there small enough to carry around in your bag</li>
            <li>If you want a sponge to apply your makeup stick with the original beauty blender, That will set you back $15-$20 depending on where you buy it.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are okay</li>
            <li>these babies did the same as my original blender.</li>
            <li>They are small but cute!</li>
            <li>They smelled funny had to wash a few times before it actually smelled good, but they do the job for concealer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learnt to only use them for concealer, and use my original beauty blender for my foundation.</li>
            <li>Other that that, love it.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash &amp; dry.</li>
            <li>The product is fine for the price, but clearly not the beauty blender brand quality.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what soap they used but regular soap doesn&#x27;t clean makeup.</li>
            <li>I can even clean my foundation off my hands with regular soap and water.</li>
            <li>They r small travel size but for the price it was a good deal excited to use and shipping was faster than expected</li>
            <li>I am giving them 2 stars simply because they were reasonably priced and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>and then they are left out to dry on their own.</li>
            <li>This is probably the best value for these type of sponge, their only &amp;#34;flaw&amp;#34; being they remain hard despite adding water, but it does not make a very big difference.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think its worth it for basic and/or daily makeup use, however, special occasions and important events, I use my Soho beauty blender.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re small but amazing.</li>
            <li>I just went ahead and spent the extra money and got a beauty blender they work way better !</li>
            <li>I liked how soft they where only thing is thst they where so tiny</li>
            <li>youre better off buying the real deal for a more expensive price than these knockoffs</li>
            <li>it was ok not worth the hype</li>
            <li>Not sure if I&#x27;ll use it since there were not packaged effectively.</li>
            <li>well (better than the average drugstore triangle sponge), but they also absorb a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product this imitating is far superior and also expands when you wet it prior to using it.  </li>
            <li>The size is good too, they&#x27;re also considerable large, I was expecting them to be very small</li>
            <li>when they are dry and you first get them they are super dense...</li>
            <li>Though they did come with a pretty gross smell that took several washes with a strong scented soap to get out.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see these little sponge puffs as blenders but more so as appliers for foundation and concealer.</li>
            <li>it was really a surprise to get those four little things:)</li>
            <li>Guess he got himself some new toys!</li>
            <li>Just throw it away and use a new one!</li>
            <li>great dupe for the beauty blender that are way more expensive at other make up stores</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for my new toys.</li>
            <li>so glad I found these one for less.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft, and when you get the wet they work even better.</li>
            <li>Decent quality and</li>
            <li>Good enough for a few uses and in case of emergencies.</li>
            <li>They will blend but I will most likely end up buying a regular palm sized sponge from Wal Mart.</li>
            <li>I will admit they do not work as well as my main beauty blender I have purchased from a store in the mall</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased and would definitely order this item again.</li>
            <li>These sponges are really small and they don&#x27;t blend pretty well, they&#x27;re are OK for the price but would not buy them again.</li>
            <li>Seriously, DO NOT BUY IT.</li>
            <li>these are super mini make up sponges and actually leave &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; on your face when you use them meaning they bleed</li>
            <li>I would suggest anyone looking for a decent blender to keep on looking.</li>
            <li>They are a nice firm foam material, but still soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste too much money on these.</li>
            <li>vibrant colors as well, as shown in picture.</li>
            <li>The beauty blenders are really nice, their just a smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>Love the various shapes as a bonus next to a more affordable price, same product than &amp;#34;branded&amp;#34; items with nothing extra.</li>
            <li>the quality is just ok, but what do u expect from such low price?</li>
            <li>Overall, incredibly pleased, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>They are okay for consealers...but not full foundation.</li>
            <li>Not soft like the original</li>
            <li>For the price they work very well, they actually had pretty fast shipping for me.</li>
            <li>They work just as well as the high dollar ones you find in stores.</li>
            <li>I had been a cheapskate and didn&#x27;t want to pay the high prices for the brand name beauty blenders, so I opted for these instead.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these sponges.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them</li>
            <li>and I highly reccomend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend you give them a try.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Its hard to clean.. but make up went on smooth...</li>
            <li>Amazing, doesn&#x27;t take water like the real one, and it&#x27;s very small but still works</li>
            <li>cute little sponges.</li>
            <li>These little things are so cute.</li>
            <li>but my little sisters likes them but doesn&#x27;t love them.</li>
            <li>cute and little, I like them</li>
            <li>so they work a little better</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fall apart easily like other make-up sponges.</li>
            <li>so I am probably going to use them as painting brush soaking sponges, but again they are so hard I do not know whether they can soak effectively.</li>
            <li>These are very well made an dense yet soft on the face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very dense rather than soft and squishy.</li>
            <li>give it two stars because yes it was a much easier blend than using my fingers, but you have to wonder if you&#x27;re getting something else on your face that you didn&#x27;t want anywhere near your skin.</li>
            <li>Great substitute for the expensive beauty blender.  </li>
            <li>Thought they would be the normal size blenders</li>
            <li>the different shapes are all useful</li>
            <li>when i saw the picture they looked like a normal size beauty blender.</li>
            <li>but they arent normal size.</li>
            <li>But I noticed they don&#x27;t expand like a normal cosmetic sponge when soaked in water.</li>
            <li>So cute and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I still have three more and they&#x27;ll last quite a long time.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, especially for a four count.</li>
            <li>I loved them, they are small but don&#x27;t need anything bigger!</li>
            <li>It took three washes to get them smelling somewhat normal.</li>
            <li>These sponges aren&#x27;t the normal beauty blender size.</li>
            <li>They BARELY expand when wet under water and still soak up most of the makeup product.</li>
            <li>The liquid make up is absorbed by foam until it is used several times.</li>
            <li>It took over a month to come but product was worth it, especially for the price</li>
            <li>I love it and can&#x27;t believe what I&#x27;ve been missing out on.</li>
            <li>I THOUGHT THE SPONGES WOULD BE LIKE A NORMAL SIZE BEAUTY BLENDER‚Ä¶</li>
            <li>Good sponges, they are very small!</li>
            <li>I still believe the original beauty blender is just a tiny tiny tiny bit better but not enough for me to continue buying it at that price.</li>
            <li>Just like the regular beauty blender but a little better!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care what the colors are, as long as they worked right</li>
            <li>I think this is worth it considering the other beauty blenders are very much over priced.</li>
            <li>Once you get past the initial smell, they&#x27;re pretty good little blenders, especially if you&#x27;re in between purchasing some of more substance.</li>
            <li>Thanks again I look it use it everyday easy to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li>Smell a little funny and get very dirty very quick but great sponges !!!</li>
            <li>These make up blenders actually worked out just right for me.</li>
            <li>but I go right back to either wedges or the BB for soft,,pliable applicators.</li>
            <li>They all seem more stiff than I&#x27;d prefer in a makeup sponge.</li>
            <li>let dry, not a bad buy at all</li>
            <li>they smell like new rubber balls but only if you put it right on your nose.</li>
            <li>A little harder than normal but still good blenders.</li>
            <li>soft, cute little sponges.</li>
            <li>I needed a new beauty sponge</li>
            <li>and I ordered them brand new .</li>
            <li>I had to soak them in water and soap and leave them over night just to get the brand new smell away.</li>
            <li>and I ordered them brand  new .</li>
            <li>I just ended up going and buying 2 new ones myself.</li>
            <li>These are so reasonable in pricing that its hard for me to see spending more</li>
            <li>They are great wet or dry, but they do not increase in size or change shape when wet as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li>I would like to compare these to more expensive brands and see if there is a difference in how smooth they apply makeup.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like them they dry to quickly</li>
            <li>the colors all match my makeup products its nothing short of what i expected and for the price phenomenal</li>
            <li>They are not only cheap, but theres 4 of them, so I don&#x27;t have to reuse them on the different shades I apply on my face.</li>
            <li>So far, they&#x27;re soft &amp; seem very durable.</li>
            <li>It will seem like it is taking on a lot of product, but by wetting the sponge the water inside makes a weighted core which keeps most of the wet product your using on the outside of the sponge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried the light Blue one and it seems to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t regret buying these (especially since they were really cheap), but they&#x27;re definitely not holy grail</li>
            <li>I love these little puffs!</li>
            <li>I love these little sponges!</li>
            <li>Great quality...a little rough with the first use, so maybe wet it to moisten it a tad bit.</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected it wasn&#x27;t expensive really good since I&#x27;m a beginner !</li>
            <li>Very soft, squishy, and work well for applying foundation/cover-up.</li>
            <li>Very soft</li>
            <li>It blends in the makeup to a T. Looks very natural and it can be reused if you are into saving money.</li>
            <li>I received four very soft beauty blender &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It kind of absorbs the makeup, and theyre stiff even if constantly used.</li>
            <li>Been excited for several days before finally got a chance to put on my makeups.</li>
            <li>and they do the exact same job.</li>
            <li>They are no where near the size of a normal beauty blender.</li>
            <li>it remains the same exact size and it does not blend well at all.</li>
            <li>and when it does the blender itself doesn&#x27;t feel any different from when I first took it out of the package.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>One when you open the bag for the first time it smells rubbery.</li>
            <li>I usually never write a review.</li>
            <li>but they are exactly the same as the ones you would buy at a drug store for $13!!!</li>
            <li>They are really small but cute</li>
            <li>This time was the exact opposite.</li>
            <li>I would rather spend the extra money to have a higher quality tool, but I don&#x27;t worry about losing these on vacation or at school.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re so small but so cute</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re so soft!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using your finger or small brushes.</li>
            <li>They even came a week early!</li>
            <li>thwyare small but cute.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not expensive and they definitely do their work.</li>
            <li>When I first saw the price on these sponges, I was very iffy about whether or not they were worth the risk, but then I thought it‚Äôs a few bucks!</li>
            <li>Extremely soft and durable!</li>
            <li>These sponges do the exact same this as the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Would work better if I took it to school and used it for an essay :/</li>
            <li>they are soft and feel like normal makeup sponges.</li>
            <li>Yes, they&#x27;re cheap but not worth it at all.</li>
            <li>These beauty blenders are very stiff and not soft, they don&#x27;t apply or blend your foundation or concealers good.</li>
            <li>Did NOT smell at all, were NOT hard but soft like a blender should be.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and squishy, not hard at all</li>
            <li>They dry easily and do not ensure proper application.</li>
            <li>Much more difficult to clean, probably because they are made of a thicker sponge in comparison to the beauty blender products.</li>
            <li>These have become a daily staple in my makeup routine, and are simple to clean.</li>
            <li>I just used one this morning, and although they&#x27;re a little small, they work great for me.</li>
            <li>There a little small but there great</li>
            <li>These are really nice beauty blenders and so much cheaper than other name brand ones, they come in a shipping bag loose with no individual packaging which is why they are so affordable.</li>
            <li>Smaller than expected, but inexpensive and free shipping, I guess makes it a decent buy.  </li>
            <li>Before the first use, it did have a weird &amp;#34;plastic-like&amp;#34; smell, so I washed with warm water and baby soap.</li>
            <li>Surprised to see that most people said they were small but even if you think so they do give four.</li>
            <li>They arrived early, with no smell and feel very soft and squishy.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the smaller hard to reach place AND the bigger areas, all in one little sponge that takes up a very small amount of real estate (very important when you have lots of makeup).&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Because of their size if using this to apply foundation to entire face, it takes a lot longer and a lot more blending/patting/pressing motions because it covers less surface area.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use less foundation and still cover my entire face.</li>
            <li>I usually have good luck and don&#x27;t end up with what other people do.</li>
            <li>They are secure to hold in my hands, unlike the little tear off wedges.</li>
            <li>Works fine for me, just not as big as expected.</li>
            <li>so you definitely need to play with them a little to make them more spongy.</li>
            <li>Always a top buy on my amazon list, can never have enough of these little guys.</li>
            <li>but for me personally i would spend a little more and just get the beauty blender brand.</li>
            <li>I love the sponges although 2 were hard.</li>
            <li>If you really must try these, be aware that shipping is super slow too!</li>
            <li>and I want to clear up some confusion about this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just buy the real thing next time.</li>
            <li>Product is much smaller than anticipated can&#x27;t use for much</li>
            <li>but they did take nearly 3 months to get here</li>
            <li>They blend really well especially when damp.</li>
            <li>Ordered the product from Magetefia and COMPLETELY UNSATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li>I have used my sponges for a week and so far they are holding up and doing everything they are suppose to do.</li>
            <li>wow, i had no idea</li>
            <li>Really helps to get in those tiny places.</li>
            <li>The picture of the sponge being used makes the sponge appear larger than it really is.</li>
            <li>If you are really into makeup I would suggest investing in a actual beauty blender for $20</li>
            <li>they make my make-up process so much easier especially applying my primer n concealers.</li>
            <li>There soft on the face</li>
            <li>I got different colors than the picture, but that really doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>They just completely absorb your makeup,  leaving none on your face.</li>
            <li>and if I am in a rush and I use them without wetting them they are still soft.</li>
            <li>Soft on skin.</li>
            <li>they are also smaller than the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to everyone looking for a professional finish in its makeup.</li>
            <li>Foundation did not apply seamlessly.</li>
            <li>This product completely exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying the real one later.</li>
            <li>So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really compare, I&#x27;m not a makeup artist so just to do a simple thing like putting on makeup</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on these sponges.</li>
            <li>My 17 year old gave them five stars...</li>
            <li>and I was surprised at the difference it made from just using a makeup brush.</li>
            <li>I was surprised</li>
            <li>The sponges are soooo soft</li>
            <li>Really wish they were bigger</li>
            <li>These beauty blender things really arent a big deal.</li>
            <li>I actually think it takes away the make up rather than put it on your face because it is a sponge so is taken up your product so for me I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend using it</li>
            <li>Your Makeup blender has to be soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>They are soft and durable.</li>
            <li>but they were perfectly soft.</li>
            <li>These actually work really well at blending &amp; highlighting makeup.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t regret the purchase because the 4pc set was only $3.50 and the shape is very ergonomic for reaching nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li>When I got my beauty blenders I was surprised to see they were mini ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even soft</li>
            <li>They are soft and blend makeup</li>
            <li>The sponges do not get soft at all...</li>
            <li>I ended up ordering the Real Techniques miracle complexion sponge 3 days later.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>The package was marked that it was a phone case.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get 4 different colors, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter to me</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t not have it near my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I washed immediately with DrBronners lavender (organic and naturally antibacterial) and air dried in hanging mesh bag (which I do EVERY time I use a b.blender) and no odor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently only using the cream colored egg shape and love it.</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft.</li>
            <li>This product is so SOFT.</li>
            <li>then I know that the money spent was worth it.</li>
            <li>I actually bought these to use with clay sculpturing; they work fine for smoothing and wiping away wet materials!</li>
            <li>but thats due to the international shipping which l was totally fine with.</li>
            <li>Not for anyone with big pores, fine lines, or other skin problems.</li>
            <li>I wasted so much product because it goes right into the sponge</li>
            <li>Kinda stiff, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting super high quality for the price.</li>
            <li>They are small and wash easily with out falling apart.</li>
            <li>I read a review saying the sponges doesn&#x27;t come back to its original shape once wet</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not as easy to blend with even after dampening them because they&#x27;re so small and not quite as pliable.</li>
            <li>They were dramatically smaller than the original beauty blender and material was harder.</li>
            <li>Arrived more than a week early but is very small and color is faded.</li>
            <li>At first they are rather hard and not very spongy, but the more I washed them, used them, and played around with them, the squishier they got.</li>
            <li>no wonder it&#x27;s so cheap, seriously just save your time and money and buy a real beauty blender</li>
            <li>Smell a little funny but doesn&#x27;t bother you to much</li>
            <li>They blend your makeup in really good, so you aren&#x27;t left with any harsh lines or dark spots of makeup.</li>
            <li>But they are very small, they work ok.</li>
            <li>I dont feel i got what i payed for, they&#x27;re okay sponges, but a little too small, &amp; not the right material.</li>
            <li>Really small and don&#x27;t work quite like a blender,  but for price its fine.</li>
            <li>After using this product to blend in my foundation a few times, I realized I need to clean the blender.</li>
            <li>So hard to clean!</li>
            <li>A sponge is a sponge and quality is key but they have the same exact results.</li>
            <li>The only cons are that they u have to soak them in water because it absorbs really quick and that they are pretty small.</li>
            <li>make sure you wet them down when you use them.</li>
            <li>I got these earlier than the predicted time and they look just like the high end ones.</li>
            <li>Kudos to them for making such a high quality product.</li>
            <li>these come in very handy and are just like my expensive ones that I carry!</li>
            <li>I should have just paid the money and gotten the usual beauty blender and not tried to cheap out.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as soft, and don&#x27;t absorb as much as the more expensive beauty blenders, buy they defiantly get the job done.</li>
            <li>Its not good to keep 1 beauty blender for 2 months or more even though you may wash it out because bacteria can still build up.</li>
            <li>but they work really well , as what i dont like is the really long delivery wont be ordering from here again.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>You have to wet them first but still to ruff</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>They bled the first time that I washed them, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li>though these would be the same as a normal beauty blender</li>
            <li>the sponges work find just have to wet them first</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>applying wet or oil based products, dampen sponge with water first.</li>
            <li>I will probably go back to the normal sponges.</li>
            <li>But the second time I ordered them I got them and they were half the size of the original ones I ordered.</li>
            <li>They blend my concealer better than any other blending method I have previously used.  </li>
            <li>are smaller than than the original but bigger than expected, still works well thank you</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE LITTLE MAKE UP BLENDERS!!!</li>
            <li>really well dry</li>
            <li>Two stars because low price and reasonable shipping speed even if this product didn&#x27;t work for me personally</li>
            <li>They last a pretty long whole&lt;br /&gt;Also.</li>
            <li>I hoped that the quality was good but it only mediocre.</li>
            <li>So cheap and definitely worth buying, except when it came there&#x27;s a weird smell but not a problem to me</li>
            <li>Unfortunately they aren&#x27;t nearly as good as the actual makeup sponge</li>
            <li>love them so much, but the blenders are a little small.</li>
            <li>I have seen these at other places for a  higher price,</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re stiff, but work better when wet.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how to clean these.</li>
            <li>They are decent sponges, The only flaw is that I wish they were a bit bigger.</li>
            <li>I was expecting full size products and you get like little inch big sponges.</li>
            <li>I expected them to be a little bit bigger, but they&#x27;re ok</li>
            <li>I suggest you buy them and use a bit of baby shampoo to wash them and wring them out and let them dry, although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary many of these products are of the same quality but costs are cut due to not having to pay to make and ship plastic individual boxes per sponge,thus saving us customers money.</li>
            <li>But they do not last you a long time, they tear when you use them to much, and soak up all the product in then</li>
            <li>They are rough and do not blend very well.  </li>
            <li>These are really soft and would definitely buy again if needed so.</li>
            <li>I did not really expect much</li>
            <li>Not as soft as i thought they would be, Or absorbent, same size with or without water... but</li>
            <li>and they really stink when you wet them.</li>
            <li>only used one so far, i have to wash it to know wat</li>
            <li>then i expected they are very teeny tinny</li>
            <li>Can barely hold between my fingers.</li>
            <li>They are much smaller than expected, but they are very plush and soft.</li>
            <li>i even tried to wet it to see if it would apply easier and that didnt help much.</li>
            <li>The picture shows the four sponges I purchased and my old one from ULTA in the middle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since gotten a different brand from the store and its so soft and covers my pores so well.</li>
            <li>When compared to the actual beauty blender it is just as soft.  </li>
            <li>Yes they don&#x27;t enlarge much when wet</li>
            <li>The actaul beauty blender is FAR bigger than these</li>
            <li>The only one I got was the hot pink one - and it took forever to receive.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, there is nothing about this product that&#x27;s even useful.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, there is nothing about this product that&#x27;s even useful.</li>
            <li>Honestly I was not impressed.</li>
            <li>I loved the price, but wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the time it would take to get to me.</li>
            <li>The colors are random but it honestly doesn&#x27;t matter because they&#x27;ll get covered in the product anyway.</li>
            <li>Only downside is they are a little bit small but what do you expect for cheap right?</li>
            <li>The sponges are almost impossible to clean and cracked very quickly.</li>
            <li>Right now I feel like it a waste to just throw away these sponges</li>
            <li>Super small.</li>
            <li>And even though they&#x27;re super small there&#x27;s 4 of them</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t absorb too much makeup like other sponges.</li>
            <li>Hard to clean, but they blend so well.</li>
            <li>They work well though, but are really hard to clean.</li>
            <li>Other than the almost one month wait I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The are a little more firm then the beauty blenders .</li>
            <li>if your young and you like to try out new things and or find other uses for them</li>
            <li>Nice little sponges, thick, durable, they do not plump up much when wet, overall does the job of blending makeup.</li>
            <li>Very affordable,delivered two weeks earlier then expected date.</li>
            <li>smaller than expected and very rubbery feel</li>
            <li>They are quite smaller than I anticipated, and also have kind of a weird smell.</li>
            <li>They are okay for the price, but they&#x27;re a little stiff and they don&#x27;t absorb water to make it simpler to blend, also they seem to take all the product off my face and leave none on.</li>
            <li>These sponges are super hard and super tiny only 1.5 inches long 1 inch wide.</li>
            <li>Only received the dark pink and the light blue.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very small, only over an inch tall, but it&#x27;s in the description, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting huge ones.</li>
            <li>My only concern is that they are hard to clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only using two of this and gave the other ones away to my friend she absolutely loves them</li>
            <li>However, if you use these for foundation weekly, they will get dirty pretty fast and don&#x27;t dry quickly if you wash yours.</li>
            <li>I mainly use the teardrop shaped ones for concealer and the other shape for my cream blush.</li>
            <li>You can tell high quality sponges by how much they expand once wet, and these don&#x27;t expand at all, just stay a little moist.</li>
            <li>They are a bit stiff at first.</li>
            <li>I purchased this and returned the one beauty sponge I fort for 15$. This whole package was less then 5$.</li>
            <li>Not sure the point of different shapes, but fun</li>
            <li>My BB cream was completely absorbed by the blenders and only applied a small amount to my face.</li>
            <li>The only draw back from this product is that they are hard to clean, but all of these puffy blenders are the same in that way.</li>
            <li>at first the product is a little hard but after a few uses when damp it starts to get softer and more sponglike.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, because these things are super tiny and hard as rocks.</li>
            <li>These sponges are super tiny and hard.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay they apply make up better than my fingers so its not so bad they are small though</li>
            <li>Mine came two light pink and two dark pink, not multicolored like the picture.</li>
            <li>Theyre also super affordable and i mean its four of them .</li>
            <li>They are super small!</li>
            <li>Use them only a few times and not very dirty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great buy and isn&#x27;t expensive in the slightest!!</li>
            <li>At the beginning they feel a little hard but after washing it and using it more it starts to adjust to your face</li>
            <li>These little sponges are cute but they&#x27;re really hard.</li>
            <li>JUST A LITTLE TO HARD OTHERWISE OK</li>
            <li>Very affordable,  shippng takes a little while</li>
            <li>Cute little puffs, but they leave tiny pieces on your face if you rub too hard...</li>
            <li>this product smells really bad whenyou use it an it doesn&#x27;t even work for good use, it dont even grow with water</li>
            <li>these suckers are so dense they don&#x27;t really absorb water, they don&#x27;t get soft or even expand.</li>

            <li> I love these sponges!!!!</li>
            <li> They are a great price!</li>
            <li> My suggestions, and it is probably best to place the make up on your face with your fingers to emulsify the product and then use the blender to provide a photo finish look.</li>
            <li> I know that may defeat the purpose, but with this tool... it might be best.</li>
            <li> I received mine today and they&#x27;re not the best thing in the world.</li>

            <li> The price is great but the image that they use makes it seem like the blenders are the size of the one that you&#x27;d get from CVS, target, ulta or sephora.</li>
            <li> its great</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this!!</li>

            <li> Got a good mix-</li>
            <li> good set.</li>
            <li> and they are good size</li>

            <li> They loved the Pro Beauty makeup blender.</li>
            <li> Good blenders</li>
            <li> but for the price, I can say it&#x27;s a really good deal.</li>
            <li> took a while to arrive, but good</li>
            <li> Mini ones but still work good.</li>
            <li> Loved the item and the price.</li>
            <li> All-in-all good product.</li>
            <li> good quality and price</li>
            <li> The application is good</li>
            <li> üåüüåüüåü, is because a pamphlet showing what each was good for would have been helpful to me.</li>
            <li> Hoping this was a good dupe for BB....</li>
            <li> even gave some to my family and they loved it too</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the one in stores works just as good.</li>
            <li> They are good for the price you pay for them.</li>
            <li> Good until you have to wash or reuse them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good for price.  </li>
            <li> Good price on them too</li>
            <li> No smell love the colors and most of worked perfect with foundation and concelars.very happy</li>
            <li> I rather buy bunch of free latex at CVS or walmart or I rather pay 5-15 dollars for one blender but perfect one.</li>
            <li> still good</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> good looked good to use with my make</li>
            <li> But they are good for the price you pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a good material</li>
            <li> This is so cheap and for a great deal!</li>
            <li> Seem to be just as good as the high-dollar name brand ones here.</li>
            <li> , my daughter loved them now</li>
            <li> product is good.</li>
            <li> it works good to me.</li>
            <li> but they do a good job.</li>
            <li> Good for the price too</li>
            <li> These are good for the price.</li>
            <li> Daughter loved them.</li>
            <li> My make up is applied flawlessly and smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li> They work as good as the 19.00 ones at the retail store.</li>
            <li> The sender was good as well</li>
            <li> When you are looking for a good Make up blender, Firmness is something you do not want.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good practice anyway, but these smelled a bit &#x27;off&#x27; when they arrived.</li>
            <li> Came in good condition.</li>
            <li> they work good...</li>
            <li> /&gt;+Price is great, but you do get what you pay for&lt;br /&gt;+Provide a nice finish when used to apply foundation, or in my case BB cream&lt;</li>
            <li> Good price, good blenders.  </li>
            <li> good buy.</li>
            <li> They worked for me and I loved it.</li>
            <li> This size sponge is good for blending areas around the eyes and nose.</li>
            <li> but honestly mine are great, just like the beauty blender</li>
            <li> But if have youthful, even, skin then these will be good for you.</li>
            <li> the price was really good</li>
            <li> good quailty and give my foundation an even spread.</li>
            <li> like see good  and all I wait&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> Price is cheap but the quality is great for me!</li>
            <li> I really loved this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is really good though.</li>
            <li> I hear they are good</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re thinking of getting the micro BBs then these would be good dupes</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work good.</li>
            <li> Good for the price</li>
            <li> My wife loved the product</li>
            <li> It was a good product</li>
            <li> The perfect size and very useful.</li>
            <li> Over all I love the sponges they blend good!</li>
            <li> But I was really impressed when I first opened up the package and then even more impressed when I used it to apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> Love these blenders, good quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> Came so quickly and they work great!</li>

            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> She says they&#x27;re easy to wash and do a great job blending the makeup.</li>
            <li> If you want a good beauty blender I wouldn&#x27;t recommend very cheaply made and tore as soon as I tried to put my makeup on...</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re very, very unique!</li>
            <li> Very good quality bending sponge, if you like the beauty blending sponges these are worth getting.</li>
            <li> These are really amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> They work amazing  </li>
            <li> Fabulous job the product was great</li>
            <li> I use these every day and they are amazing</li>
            <li> I like this product considering it comes in 4 for a cheap great price.</li>
            <li> Amazing price for an amazing quality sponge.</li>
            <li> I will never do my makeup without these after trying them&lt;br /&gt;i made an amazing airbrushed finish with these sponges&lt;</li>
            <li> They do an amazing job.</li>
            <li> I use them to apply my bb cream &amp; concealers &amp; it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> The price is amazing for all the sponges you get.</li>
            <li> I love this sponges they are just great, soft and perfect size!!</li>
            <li> honestly have tried them both</li>
            <li> Love these they work really good</li>
            <li> Nice ones..</li>
            <li> They work great and for such a great price!!</li>
            <li> I was given this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> yea I can honestly compare these to the ones at ulta</li>
            <li> Nice polish when u apply it and nice colors to</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged arrived as stated</li>
            <li> Nice sponges.</li>
            <li> These are really nice makeup sponges.</li>
            <li> Nice sponges...</li>
            <li> and they also liked item.</li>
            <li> but i liked it any ways because its just for the face sn</li>
            <li> It blends my make-up nicely and i have no problem with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: i got this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> but I honestly think that this was a mistake to buy.</li>
            <li> I like the colors and texture they are nice to use</li>
            <li> But it does distribute the makeup nicely.</li>
            <li> The sponges blend the product nice</li>
            <li> They work really well for blending and there texture is awesome.</li>
            <li> I rinsed it in warm water, squeezed it out, dotted my foundation on my face and blended it using the sponge.</li>
            <li> When I used the Pro Beauty Flawless Makeup Blender to apply makeup, I noticed that it absorbed more of the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know WHAT I would recommend them for to be honest.</li>
            <li> They work well for me however and for the price was really nice.</li>
            <li> These were nice to try though x</li>
            <li> but it kind of hurts just hitting your face over and over with these.</li>
            <li> I suggest you soak them in warm water with makeup brush cleaner for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> After 30 seconds or so, continue to work the mixture into the sponge while under running warm water.</li>
            <li> bought this blender because the coupon community on instagram really sold this like it was the&lt;br /&gt;cheapest, greatest thing on earth!</li>
            <li> Love these so cute and work great..</li>
            <li> I, honestly, don&#x27;t even have the desire to use this crappy product anymore.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune and yet have a good product :)</li>
            <li> I honestly have no comparison to the 20.00 beauty blenders</li>
            <li> this one can be squeezed until just damp, so it leaves a nice airbrushed appearance.</li>
            <li> and I end up using more product to get a good face coverage.</li>
            <li> So it was a great buy and worth the wait!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so excited to use them!!</li>
            <li> Work so good took a while to get to me but worth the wait!!</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and they are the perfect sizes.</li>
            <li> They are the best it was more that what u expect works good totally recommend and good pricing for all three</li>
            <li> A great tip is to use a water mist or a setting spray on the sponges so that the product will move and blend more easily.</li>
            <li> If your new to beauty blenders then this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Good but has a strong smell</li>
            <li> I love this product because iIt blends makeup really well for a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> These are very soft and perfect for my makeup needs.</li>
            <li> they are very easy to work with</li>
            <li> Soon As I Opened It, It Had a Very Strong Rubber Smell</li>
            <li> When I bought these, I was so excited to have something like the popular beauty blenders from Sephora!</li>
            <li> I love these blenders, works a lot better then a brush!</li>
            <li> Or i would HIGHLY recommend getting a &amp;#34;Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Sponge&amp;#34; In some cases people will argue that it is better than the beauty blender and the best part is, it&#x27;s a fraction of the price, I got mine at walmart for like $4</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these amazing for contouring and applying foundation powders, creams, and liquid.</li>
            <li> Colors are definitely bright and cheerful.</li>
            <li> Honestly, $1 makeup sponges from the Dollar Store are much better than these considering they expand with water</li>
            <li> This is an un effective product that absorbs more makeup than it applies.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled with my puffs :)</li>
            <li> Nice and cute just needed extras.....</li>
            <li> I was trying to get a good deal and these are so cheap they don&#x27;t absorb any water but work</li>
            <li> They came early in the mail and are in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> Amazing I love this</li>
            <li> Best deal I have found so far.</li>
            <li> It does come in handy to have more than once</li>
            <li> So far the best I&#x27;ve used to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> Good for the price but not the best quality definitely prefer to spend a more and get the beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> but I honestly think results are better without water.</li>
            <li> Lol after immersing them in water &amp; squeezing them for almost a minute, it didn&#x27;t grow, but I heard that if you put them in warm or barely hot water for 10 minutes, they&#x27;ll soften up.</li>
            <li> Work great, look super cute.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very quick also !</li>
            <li> For the price of this item it is an extremely very good product for anyone to have as either some back-up beauty blenders or as your main beauty blender.</li>
            <li> the colors are cute, no bad odor, easy to use, cheap, i&#x27;m a happy customer!</li>
            <li> loved it, perfect size, was delivered before expected time</li>
            <li> They came in perfect condition in their plastic Baggie and have different variations of &amp;#34;hardness&amp;#34; to get the kind of look you want.</li>
            <li> They are cute, colourful and very easy to through into your makeup bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work great and look exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works pretty great as a nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> The packaging wasn&#x27;t great and it was pretty beat up when it got to me.  </li>
            <li> a piece seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Worked just fine!</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
            <li> These were very cheap and basically you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 2 stars is because they were very cheap</li>
            <li> Very light weight and would recommend than buying a $20 &amp;#34;original blender&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But, I have figured out away to make this soft and amazing to use!!</li>
            <li> This give nice coverage and is easy to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> great product and super cheap price</li>
            <li> It will work fine for me because I do my own makeup.</li>
            <li> Very soft and good quality!</li>
            <li> They still look brand new after clean and continue to blend perfectly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m OK with that for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> These sponges came from HongKong, with cute packages.</li>
            <li> they will make sure you get what you ordered</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>

            <li> Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> My wife is in love with them</li>
            <li> This way you are not losing the most of your product with the applicator.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love...</li>
            <li> The one I got from Walmart works way better than these</li>
            <li> And CHEAP!</li>
            <li> I feel like it absorbs more product than what it leaves on your skin.</li>
            <li> , I also love how cute the colors are.</li>
            <li> Glad i got them.</li>
            <li> Applying foundation is easier for me now because i can apply it in the corners of my face alot better.</li>
            <li> I bought these to apply my foundation with, my favorite is the egg shaped makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> I love that it has a pointed tip to easier</li>
            <li> I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Great quality product &amp; fast shipping from overseas</li>
            <li> I feel like they soak up more of my foundation than they should</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The application of my foundation and concealer is build able and even with this blenders.</li>

            <li> They don&#x27;t react with water, but they&#x27;re okay for concealer use.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> fingers makes for a better texture than using these sponges on my skin.</li>
            <li> These are so much better to use when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I last bought the Pueen beauty-blender knock off via Amazon and was really impressed.</li>
            <li> but it takes more effort.</li>
            <li> how much better foundation goes on using a sponge.</li>
            <li> they are surprisingly very sturdy and do a great job at applying liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> For the price, they&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use these for bronzer and they work better than the brush I have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the size that I was I in satisfied with, it was the texture.</li>
            <li> More of a plastic/ rubber feeling to them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible</li>
            <li> Love it works so well better than the 14.99 ones.</li>
            <li> I love these things to death.</li>
            <li> I love the variety and the colors.</li>
            <li> But this product is okay.</li>

            <li> I got it today after waiting for like more than two weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they do any better job than the disposable sponge applicators.  </li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>

            <li> But does it&#x27;s job !:)</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic product, honestly I prefer these to the name brand.</li>
            <li> but I love them.</li>
            <li> Just as I imagined. :)</li>
            <li> and when I start to pay it absorbs most of the product on my face.</li>
            <li> sponges are okay-</li>
            <li> I love these..and that fact that you get for for the price..</li>
            <li> Love them....</li>
            <li> It took a while to arrive but ok.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know, better perhaps?</li>
            <li> So umm improve would be my suggestion if you purchase this. :)</li>
            <li> Defenitely recomend them ! :)</li>
            <li> Worked ok for applying my makeup.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I thought these would be softer more spongy</li>
            <li> I really love these blending sponges they really work great</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> But it was okay for its price.</li>
            <li> Until i got the sponges i used brushes that left streakmarks and now these blend my makeup perfectly!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE COLORS AND PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> how much better it is then anything else,</li>
            <li> I have used many blenders</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they work for some people, but I just felt like they would NOT soak up water.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> They do such a wonderful job &amp;</li>
            <li> Peace and love ladies</li>
            <li> I would get four more</li>
            <li> i feel like they soak up the product more than they&#x27;re supposed to</li>
            <li> I love these beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cute, but too dense.</li>
            <li> These couldn&#x27;t suck any more......</li>
            <li> but C&#x27;MON! I could get better from Forever 21.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Just ok...</li>
            <li> Not the most sanitary of ways,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them much anymore, but they are great.</li>
            <li> but I have tried and tried many times to correct this issue.</li>
            <li> If I would have been paying better attention.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you wait 20-28 days for shipping.</li>
            <li> If the packaging was better this would not happen.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, they are just as the leader brand but way cheaper.</li>
            <li> love these-</li>
            <li> it damp absorbs most of your product when apply liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I am more inclined to change the sponge when it becomes soiled because it does not cost $20.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re so cheap!</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Great  blendin in very well</li>
            <li> They work wonderful just a smaller size</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I love these blender sponges.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe i got them for such a great price!</li>
            <li> but I really do love these.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend love&#x27;s them and will be ordering more .</li>
            <li> Even the sponges at Forever 21 works much better than these.</li>
            <li> love them will be ordering a lot more especially for the price :D</li>
            <li> Eh..its ok.</li>
            <li> Me and my daughter love em.</li>
            <li> I bought the set of four Makeup Blenders, thinking it was going to be a better deal, then buying the Beauty Blender for $20 at Sephora.</li>
            <li> The Pro Beauty Flawless Makeup Blender took several weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> I would save your money and find another product that works better.</li>
            <li> I use the Famous Beauty Blender and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both designs and flaws aside, they really are great.</li>
            <li> but I feel like it couldn&#x27;t get much better than this.</li>
            <li> These are okay.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love them because they&#x27;re do darn cute</li>
            <li> Maybe they will soften up in time and work better for blending.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> I bought these for a big Make-up project (Halloween) and they worked great!</li>
            <li> and so do I. :)</li>
            <li> but satisfied.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> if am going to waist more</li>
            <li> but they are going to be better</li>
            <li> Thank you :))</li>
            <li> what do you expect ovrr all I love them they are a steal</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel like the authentic beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking to get more coverage, I don&#x27;t suggest this.</li>
            <li> My favorite ones are the tear drop shape blenders.</li>
            <li> I just recive my product really love them.</li>
            <li> I love this beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> and I love the results I get</li>
            <li> , it looks much better than when I apply it with a brush or my fingers.</li>
            <li> I reallt love these</li>
            <li> i love them helps makeup</li>
            <li> I love these makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> Love them</li>
            <li> but they are an okay doop.</li>
            <li> I love the colors.</li>
            <li> And feels better than using your sticky hands.</li>
            <li> These blenders work very well when a bit damp and provide great coverage.</li>
            <li> Love them.  </li>
            <li> Love em.</li>
            <li> The hourglass shaped sponges worked ok, but the teardrop shaped ones doesn&#x27;t blend at all.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the disposable $1 sponges they sell at the dollar store since you are better off using those.</li>
            <li> and I love how my makeup comes out with this sponge</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and am extremely glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> They blend perfectly I&#x27;m satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> and theyre really cute.</li>
            <li> All in all I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I will try these out some more</li>
            <li> But I love them</li>
            <li> and I just ordered more.</li>
            <li> I love these with all of my heart, way better than my fingers.</li>
            <li> I wonder if that works better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Therefore the quality is just ok.</li>
            <li> I bought 1 from from target which I like a lo better just more pricey.</li>
            <li> They did get better with the smell</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t sure what the difference was and what I would be getting.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges.&lt;br /&gt;Work</li>
            <li> came just as pictured love them ..still learning how to use them</li>
            <li> Love them want more :)</li>

            <li> Um I will not need any more anytime soon</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Able to maneuver and blend product effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> And for the cherry on top they took 2 months to ship  </li>
            <li> Thank you :)</li>
            <li> When I tried to blend out my foundation, it took most of it off my face and felt like I was smashing my skin with a rock.</li>
            <li> Maybe they need more time to wear in?</li>
            <li> Good price but the tear drop looking ones aren&#x27;t the greatest but the other ones work just fine</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original make up blender, but it&#x27;s fine for me.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, very satisfied</li>
            <li> Soft &amp; i loved it!</li>
            <li> Super soft and awesome :)</li>
            <li> For the most part, they sounded pretty good</li>
            <li> All you have to do is clean then with warm water &amp; soap when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Super cute!</li>
            <li> The more they expand the softer the sponge and the more easily they blend makeup.</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; quality, definitely buying more!</li>
            <li> great normal beauty blenders are around 20</li>
            <li> I was nervous when I first used the first sponge (sent with 4), but after 2 or 3 times using it, my makeup was going on smooth and flawless!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still a nice but at a cool price</li>
            <li> but they are pretty good.</li>
            <li> Quality is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Good investment it helps apply my foundation ;)</li>
            <li> They work pretty good</li>
            <li> The pieces look good and come in pretty colors, it blends well too.</li>
            <li> It took awhile for me to receive them in the mail, but once they came I was excited!</li>
            <li> Work just like the original beauty blender!</li>
            <li> love it easy to manage.</li>
            <li> love this, it easy for me to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so in love with this beauty blender they are so easy to use</li>
            <li> Super affordable and works amazing.</li>
            <li> These are so cute and easy to use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice, clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nice blenders,they apply my makeup very well, feels nice to my skin.</li>
            <li> Its also very easy to clean with a bit of olive oil and dishwash soap.</li>
            <li> Very soft great for the price</li>
            <li> I found that dabbing with my (clean!)</li>
            <li> I love how easy they are to use, and I love how they make my makeup look so light when I soak them in water before application.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m better off just buying the original beauty blenders :)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super cheap and cute!</li>
            <li> These are a great product especially for the price, don&#x27;t pay 3 times as much for one sponge when you can get a great quality here.</li>
            <li> I love them sooo smooth</li>
            <li> They came sooner than I expected and they were the perfect size I wanted.</li>
            <li> It is cheap, but I was still expecting more.</li>
            <li> They were a great price but the only thing I dislike is that it soaks up all the makeup, making me apply more and more to it.</li>
            <li> Came early and were great.  </li>
            <li> These were cheap and cute</li>
            <li> i love the sponges they are great on blending, I would definitely order more of them.</li>
            <li> It makes them easier and more comfortable to hold while blending makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with them so far</li>
            <li> Took a long time for shipping but the sponges are amazing and a great price</li>
            <li> its as genuine as it gets its lovely</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for, based on the price i know it wasn&#x27;t going to be good the real thing.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was too good to be true...and it really was.</li>
            <li> Good quality and a very convenient shape.</li>
            <li> For the price and the shipping time and everything, deft worth it.</li>
            <li> but they do a very damn good job blending makeup and concealer.</li>
            <li> They worked awesome just as good even better then the more expensive brand ones</li>
            <li> It come with all the colors very nice and soft</li>
            <li> They are a lot more dense than the original beauty blender.  </li>
            <li> Alright, I am definitely sure you makeup artists out there are familiar with the beauty blender worldly known at seohora.</li>
            <li> The other two are perfect for blending concealer or foundation</li>
            <li> you should get it a little damp, but I will be ordering like 12 more of these because of the price and how great they are!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this listing, I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is true that it is very cheap</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> Reusable and easy to wash.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply?</li>
            <li> The makeup washes out easy out of the sponge.</li>
            <li> They do not apply foundation easily and effortlessly as they are supposed to.  </li>
            <li> makes it easy to apply foundation.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use..</li>
            <li> the real beauty blender is extremely soft and airy, easy to press together and works perfect for applying foundation.</li>
            <li> The material is durable and easy to wash.</li>
            <li> I like using brushes better to apply my make up because I can clean it</li>
            <li> they are tiny beauty blenders ,eveb thought they worked great &amp; more easier to reach on under eyes</li>
            <li> They were more tiny then I imagined but work just as great.</li>
            <li> Making blending incredibly easy.</li>
            <li> easy to hold.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll clean</li>
            <li> Love how the price is great for a total of 4 of them.</li>
            <li> Has a really strong odor.</li>
            <li> but they have a strong smell of latex</li>
            <li> Just as good as any high end beauty sponges.</li>
            <li> I believe they are just as good as the high dollar ones.</li>
            <li> Arrived early which was amazing!</li>
            <li> It works great for blending and just in general makeup application.</li>
            <li> so I guess they are OK but for full application coverage don&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would be a nice dupe for the higher end sponges and it was not.</li>
            <li> they blend the foundation so good, make it look real natural in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love the blenders they are true to photo except colors vary.</li>
            <li> love these not as fantastic as the original beauty blender</li>
            <li> :) Would definitely recommend, good enough product for a very good price.</li>
            <li> Gives my makeup a flawless finish, they&#x27;re soft, doesn&#x27;t absorb too much product when used damp, &amp; easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I went to Ulta and bought a large beauty blender and love it!</li>
            <li> Small, but perfect for traveling light!</li>
            <li> you know how to used them, I suppose they are fine.</li>
            <li> but they work fine</li>
            <li> and this gets the job done just fine.</li>
            <li> because its so light weight it easily molds to the face and that is what makes it apply</li>
            <li> I was thinking that it would be fine and tested to see if it was absorb water, they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless they still blend fine for the price.</li>
            <li> I think they will be fine.</li>
            <li> but they work fine.</li>
            <li> but once i washed them they worked fine</li>
            <li> These are just fine and seem to work just peachy.</li>
            <li> Super affordable blending sponges!</li>
            <li> However, the package did arrive before its estimated time :) I have never used the Beauty Blender, but these sponges seems to be an adequate dupe.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more like a rubbery odor but goes away after so many times of using it able to clean very easy and there super soft!</li>
            <li> because I didn&#x27;t know if I would like the real sponge I ordered these, and I love them!</li>
            <li> Good bye Sephora as far as makeup sponges!</li>
            <li> They are super easy to clean too!</li>
            <li> Wet them before you use them, wash them weekly, they are really a very good product.</li>
            <li> First off these are super cute!</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t a huge loss.</li>
            <li> Product is great, came sooner than expected, should have brought more.</li>
            <li> Tried it because they were so cheap.</li>
            <li> Overall, great sponges.</li>
            <li> Great for blending last forever too!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I had one real beauty blender given to me as a gift that wirked amazing,</li>
            <li> They fit in the palm of my hand even when damp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> when i got the package, it could fit in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> The sponge sucked up all my fountain no matter how lightly I blotted.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Work great, are a lot smaller</li>
            <li> Overall these makeup blenders are great for the price</li>
            <li> They are smaller than I would like but still great for use</li>
            <li> The smooth makeup powder puff is just a cheaper brand of the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> yes they are cheap</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave you a smooth finish and feel on your skin.</li>
            <li> and they apply my foundation smoothly.</li>
            <li> If you want to go the cheap route then this would do</li>
            <li> Great quality and price ,the only problem shipping took 6-8 wks</li>
            <li> but if you like to save money and look fabulous while doing it..then order these sponges.</li>
            <li> Nice reasonable price</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Creams and make-up glide smoothly across  </li>
            <li> However I did enjoy the quality of it.</li>
            <li> 4small sponges, nice colors , &amp; fast shipping .</li>
            <li> Smooth finish when used correctly (moisten the sponge before applying liquid or creme makup)</li>
            <li> Then when I try to blend my makeup, even something as light as BB cream, it looks like they pick it up without blending it in.</li>
            <li> But I enjoy them ; works well for my needs</li>
            <li> so I tried to shoot for this cheap alternative.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly and everything.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter that these are cheap.</li>
            <li> I was not impress with the quality , no wonder there so cheap in price.</li>
            <li> the foundation gets suck and doesn&#x27;t apply on to your skin smoothly.</li>
            <li> Its suppose to glide and coat your face smoothly.</li>
            <li> I used to smooth out my clay projects.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really enjoy it</li>
            <li> As an artist I can not use cheap stuff on my clients faces.</li>
            <li> but i paid cheap for it</li>
            <li> its cheap... don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> but I do enjoy them a lot</li>
            <li> Great quality, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> but I do enjoy the size since I just use them for my under eye concealer.</li>
            <li> Just soak them in water and squeeze some water out so the sponge is lightly damp</li>
            <li> And they are cheap.</li>
            <li> Cheap material</li>
            <li> i got them a few weeks after i ordered and I have to say, I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> I think they are well worth the price :)</li>
            <li> They are cheap beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> They blend my makeup great and they will last a while!</li>
            <li> Feels cheap does not blend well</li>
            <li> I also have two Beauty Blenders already so these were just extra lol.</li>
            <li> But overall was happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal, and</li>
            <li> Cheap product</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic</li>
            <li> They are really good for putting on foundation because it makes it look so natural.</li>
            <li> They came in a clear Ziploc bag, in good condition.</li>
            <li> But no real complaint it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> I wash mine regularly, and they are much softer and great for foundation application!</li>
            <li> soft, good quality.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Style Wurks makes a much better knock off for a couple more bucks, as does Real Techniques.</li>
            <li> Overall if you want a more inexpensive beauty blender option this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t need them right away.</li>
            <li> Still very useful.</li>
            <li> I gave one to my sister, daughter, friend and kept one, found it very useful  </li>
            <li> I blends products on smoothly just like the original beauty blender, and for the price and quantity I can not complain at all.</li>
            <li> The quality of the sponges, however, is incomparable to that of the original beauty blender.</li>
            <li> super easy to use and to clean great product overall.</li>
            <li> The application was clean and streak free.</li>
            <li> Over all, the shipping was pretty fast and the price was good</li>
            <li> Cleans easily and air dries quick.  </li>
            <li> Excellent little sponges!</li>
            <li> Good price, however this makeup blender absorbs too much of your makeup compared to the beauty blender and its more dense, but overall its ok.</li>
            <li> but I love them they&#x27;re perfect for hard areas to blend!</li>
            <li> These have made such a HUGE difference in highlighting &amp; contouring on me &amp; for my clients &amp; very easy to use &amp; easily washable!</li>
            <li> will purchase  more in the future :) i recommend!</li>
            <li> Of course this is NOT the ORIGINAL BEAUTY BLENDER,  but it will do the job.</li>
            <li> worth the buck!</li>
            <li> but they are significantly smalled and denser.</li>
            <li> I was so excited.</li>
            <li> At first i wasnt sure if i should have ordered these beauty blenders</li>
            <li> This is not the original beauty blender üíî</li>
            <li> I also liked that I was able to get 4 for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing like the original beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I bought the beauty blender original from another seller here in amazon.com</li>
            <li> The colors are fun too!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Not as excited about them</li>
            <li> This product is worth the price!</li>
            <li> unbelievable price and great product!</li>
            <li> So worth the money!</li>
            <li> So worth it!</li>
            <li> but well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> They worked pretty well, not my favorite beauty tool.</li>
            <li> Love the item, but it took over 2 months to get to me, as the first was lost in the mail.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not like the original beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Love em and received them much quicker than I thought!</li>
            <li> Was not disappointed when I received them.</li>
            <li> WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> The colors and shapes are adorable (the colors of mine match the picture exactly).</li>
            <li> That being said, I have never tried the original</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t grow like original beauty blenders</li>
            <li> Product not very absorbent and breaks easily but also way better than spending fifteen bucks on one at Sephora!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t wash off as easy with soap n water used twice only works great when first used</li>
            <li> Very affordable and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I tried to get the products out of the blender using soap, olive oil and a mixture of baby shampoo (as they recommend when you clean the original beauty blender) and I noticed the product would not get clean and started coming apart.</li>
            <li> it made my skin look so clean</li>
            <li> Just clean them well before using them</li>
            <li> But benefit of the doubt they are clean, no scent of anything on them.</li>
            <li> I also found a tutorial on how to clean them with dish-soap and olive oil.</li>
            <li> If you use a sponge constantly, going for this economical version is a great option to save $</li>
            <li> In two minutes all the product should be lifted and you should have a clean sponge.</li>
            <li> Durable, washes clean &amp; hadnt stained after 28 uses</li>
            <li> Some foundations and concealers will stain the sponges, just wash the areas used for applying makeup with soap to insure that they are completely clean.</li>
            <li> clean your sponges with makeup removing face wash.</li>
            <li> (that bottle can dispense erratically) and this bb saved my face after blotting excess off with a cloth and just rolling bb rinsed clean over everything a couple of times for flawlessness.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need to clean it.</li>
            <li> For the price I think its amazing just like one I paid $10 for its very soft.</li>
            <li> Love my sponges it gives my make up a nice feel and smooth look even though it took long to come</li>
            <li> Super clean, very soft and spongy, nicely sealed packaging that delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Nothing special...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you can just clean them off if the smell bothers you that much.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and able to blend makeup in easily.</li>
            <li> Awesome and does the job but a lil hard</li>
            <li> These sponges are great for applying concealer even loose powder!</li>
            <li> These beauty sponges work great and all only has a foul smell first time , so</li>
            <li> Damp the sponge and apply your liquid makeup for amazing smoothness and soft looking skin.</li>
            <li> These beauty blenders were exactly what I was looking for and at such a great price, there&#x27;s no mistake buying this product.</li>
            <li> ONE WAS GREAT WET</li>
            <li> Nothing compared to the beauty blender but good enough.</li>
            <li> Good product for a lesser price than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I love them and it was fast delivery</li>
            <li> Smaller than the picture appears but it does a good job</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased an actual Beauty Blender before as I am unwilling to spend $20 on a sponge, but have purchased knock-offs before that I really loved.</li>
            <li> Get the real deal :-)</li>
            <li> These are cool.</li>
            <li> so you assume you&#x27;re getting 4 full sized beauty blenders</li>
            <li> The spotting was near immediate when I put them in warm water.</li>
            <li> There good but way smaller then</li>
            <li> Thought they would be bigger, but they are a good size.</li>
            <li> Good middle of the line make-up sponge.</li>
            <li> I prefer them to be more gentle.</li>
            <li> The color is spot on (if you care about that) and they&#x27;re soft, but they don&#x27;t expand with water and they don&#x27;t bounce on your skin nicely, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> You can probably use these, but they will be more damaging to your face as you want to be gentle when applying makeup so as not to cause any wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li> I got this product because i heard so many people rave about this and say how much they adore it and</li>
            <li> These are so cute and work really really well.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good enough for the price</li>
            <li> but overall was a good purchase for the price.  </li>
            <li> they nice soft and manageble</li>
            <li> the colors are true to picture .</li>
            <li> its overall a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When they arrived, I absolutely fell in love with them.</li>
            <li> good price and the product coming earlier</li>
            <li> Good but can find same product and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Thought it was a good deal for 4 of them, instead of one for the same price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the sponges that much, my foundation brushes get the job done more efficiently.</li>
            <li> Ive used them numerous times &amp; they work really good.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft.</li>
            <li> these are so cool</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also made of a different material that&#x27;s not as good.</li>
            <li> they absorb a lot of makeup , so really your using about 3x more , than if you were just to use your fingers ...</li>
            <li> I went and bought the real beauty blender for 20 bucks rather spend the money on something better.</li>
            <li> Not bad for what i paid .</li>
            <li> Not bad considering</li>
            <li> Not bad, work well</li>
            <li> SO NOT BAD</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> It handles my make up well and blends perfectly like any other high price one.</li>
            <li> If you just use your blender like a sponge, with less padding and more wiping, you might find it good.</li>
            <li> I will order more and appreciated how quickly they came.</li>
            <li> The original Beauty Blender is supposed to grow considerably in size when wet, changing it&#x27;s texture and allowing for the flawless finish</li>
            <li> Swells slightly soaked in water and applies liquid beautifully.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product , but not 5 star worthy .</li>
            <li> They clean up pretty well with brush cleaner, too!</li>
            <li> Other than that, this was a great buy.</li>
            <li> Good at blending but kind hard</li>
            <li> Gotta love my new beauty blenders!</li>
            <li> love this set because it allows me to use a new sponge every couple months-better for your skin!  </li>
            <li> I love them and will definitely be getting more when I need them.</li>
            <li> So somebody stole one of em and it was the cute blue one that i wanted the most.</li>
            <li> I love the way my make up goes on, much better than the regular sponges and brushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use them for some quick blending when I&#x27;m in a hurry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the purple one a couple of times and I have to say that with a couple more dollars you could definitely get a better one.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that the sponges were cheap, but you are definitely getting what you paid for.</li>
            <li> The only reason they don&#x27;t get all stars is because I revived mines packaged in the mailing bag if it would of been packaged in a different bag besides the mailing one , that would of been great!</li>
            <li> Super hard...not sponge like at all.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty small, but they work perfect!</li>
            <li> These are super dense.</li>
            <li> Wash them with water and mild soap every time you use them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they would be awesome with dry products rather than wet products.</li>
            <li> The quality is comparable to those purchased at a high end makeup store and the cost is so low one can discard rather than spending time in cleaning which gives you a better and more healthy applicator.  </li>
            <li> , if you don&#x27;t need it right away and can wait the shipping date it is SO WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> It works a lot better than some high end blending brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> :) I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> As normal dip into water squeeze excess water dab onto foundation, dab lightly in the eye ducts, nose all over face, these are true to color and work as well as you&#x27;d pay 20.00 each!</li>
            <li> I tested them when they were dry and was pretty happy.</li>
            <li> The colors were pretty accurate</li>
            <li> Size was smaller than original beauty blender but girlfriend liked them.</li>
            <li> I got them today, it takes a long time because its from china, but they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> Pros Cheap,Soft,Pretty,Reaches into Certain Areas, easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Worth the money, better then the high end department store brands you can buy for $20+ ‚Ä¶</li>
            <li> 4 sponges is way more than enough super easy to wash and is super convenient.</li>
            <li> and they are super fun colors.</li>
            <li> It is too dense of a material to really blend easily.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product and from this seller as they shipped fast coming from China.</li>
            <li> These work very well, but they do have a strong odor to them.</li>
            <li> They also tear extremely easily with a gentle squeeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my makeup didn&#x27;t really spread to easily.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> You get amazing colors and they work good &amp; last long</li>
            <li> When I first got them I was soo excited thinking I would never ave to buy a beauty blender again because there was four.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited for them</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Recommended by a Make up Professional and artist as my self! :)</li>
            <li> I know they&#x27;re super cheap and not the real beauty blender brand</li>
            <li> Very soft And easy to clean.</li>
            <li> spend a few more bucks on a better one!</li>
            <li> but I love my blenders, works better with loose powders</li>
            <li> These blenders are pretty cool, if only i would get better at this blending thing!</li>
            <li> These are great sponges, I was just a little upset</li>
            <li> These are great little blenders.</li>
            <li> Still, they&#x27;re really great little blenders.</li>
            <li> To clean them, squeeze water through them and apply either a facial cleanser that can remove makeup, dish soap, or a special beauty blender sponge cleaner, the bar version is supposed to work better than the liquid one.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very excited to have gotten them!</li>
            <li> I received these sponges and since they were so cheap, my expectations weren&#x27;t very high.</li>
            <li> The cheaper one gives you the same finish and the design is amazing.</li>
            <li> These are really very efficient for application and the price is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; anything in but they do smooth it out.</li>
            <li> They work really well with giving my face a smooth airbrushed look.</li>
            <li> it really helps make your foundation have a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> I knew not to expect much from these seeing as they were SO cheap.</li>
            <li> Really firm , but would be great for contouring to press the make up in .</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> The shipping took a bit of time, but these babies are worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useful, it does its job</li>
            <li> They are pretty cool for the price...</li>
            <li> Worth the wait on shipping.</li>
            <li> i wash them then apply hand sanitizer to keep them fresh.</li>
            <li> Just took a while to get here but there worth it</li>
            <li> Use a sponge, better coverage, seamless blending for foundation, cover up, etc.</li>
            <li> but for the price it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li> These are colorful, dense sponges.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> So I ordered a different kind that I saw some girls on youtube use in there tutorial.</li>
            <li> While the product itself is a wonderful texture and density, I have to say that they are a lot smaller than I had expected them to be.</li>
            <li> So they are worth the price.</li>
            <li> So worth the couple bucks.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, but these aren&#x27;t even worth the $3.00.</li>
            <li> Nice application, doesn&#x27;t glide over the skin as well as actual beauty blender</li>
            <li> I washed them a few times with dish soap and warm water and the smell is most gone.</li>
            <li> But they were worth the wait</li>
            <li> Which is way over priced but worth it because the finish it leaves.</li>
            <li> I love how soft these are compared to beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> worth the purchase for me.</li>
            <li> and my makeup is so much fun to apply with the sponges.</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> It was such a nice deal.</li>
            <li> But for the price your paying for 4 sponges I think its worth it.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money on this cheap product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;i guess its worth the price.</li>
            <li> It took over a month to finally receive them, and once I got them and opened the package they were not in any kind of bag or wrapping, they were just shoved in a envelope and sent out.</li>
            <li> However, they weren&#x27;t useful at all.</li>
            <li> Worth the wait</li>
            <li> If you want a really good one, I would recommend trying to find some that expand when wet.</li>
            <li> Soooo worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Took almost a month to receive this product, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> i love them so far.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Worth d money.</li>
            <li> Worth it</li>
            <li> They were smaller than expected, but since i need them for concealer, they worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Worth the wait for the delivery üëç</li>
            <li> They are well worth what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I really liked these for smaller areas on your face</li>
            <li> but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought they would be bigger but its not.</li>
            <li> but I just didn&#x27;t find it useful for me at all.</li>
            <li> Be sure to thoroughly rinse with water, squeezing to get all of the makeup out, until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li> I still switch back and forth, but hey it&#x27;s nice to have in my arsenal loll.</li>
            <li> Got here pretty quickly and exactly as pictured!</li>
            <li> The sponges are reusable and you can clean them with makeup brush cleaner or run them under warm water and let them air dry !</li>
            <li> /&gt;they are very soft and clean so well!</li>
            <li> I bought this flawless from other seller and they were bigger</li>
            <li> I love them there way cheaper than the original ones and does just the same thing there is a bit of an odor</li>
            <li> Sure i could go buy the normal white ones but these ones are more fun.</li>
            <li> Other wise I would have not purchased.</li>
            <li> These sponges are very dense and user friendly.</li>
            <li> This are cute and enjoy being able to get into small areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no professional makeup artist nor a beauty guru, I just love make up!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold too much product, its easy to clean, and most of the time I use my dry.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of softness and resiliency.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t absorb makeup and they are just the right size and price.</li>
            <li> right (shruggs).</li>
            <li> Or maybe I&#x27;m not using it right?</li>
            <li> I order a beauty blender from sephora right away.</li>
            <li> Maybe I wasn&#x27;t doing it right</li>
            <li> They clean really and help to apply make evenly.</li>
            <li> These are nice little applicators for applying foundation to make sure it goes one evevnly,I would definitely purchase more of these.</li>
            <li> They are great for makeup but it is super hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like getting  them for free and high quality</li>
            <li> Small but works great</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re too small and leave a smell on my face like the smell of a balloon lol</li>
            <li> They are sooo small lol</li>
            <li> I really liked the set, but it took a really long time to get them.  </li>
            <li> Loooooove came a little later but great product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I wish I had just dished out a little more and bought the one in the store.</li>
            <li> pretty nice for concealer , way smaller then I expected but still quite nice .</li>
            <li> kind of hard, but cute colors</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> Plus, if you have dry skin, they don&#x27;t feel too nice being rubbed on your face.</li>
            <li> Not even worth sending back because it would cost more to ship than the purchase price.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> This product is more useful after several usages.</li>
            <li> They are now soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> but there fun and cute for a girl starting out if shed patient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a complainer, but these were cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I use powders only and this has a very smooth finish on my skin.</li>
            <li> They are very soft too and very colorful.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> And they are very soft and very useful.</li>
            <li> The first couple times you use a new one, you&#x27;ll need to use a lot more water than normal.</li>
            <li> They feel soft and mine arrived smelling fine and appearing without marks.</li>
            <li> Smaller then expected but really loved them !</li>
            <li> These little sponges work wonderfully at a REALLY fair price.</li>
            <li> They are little, but they&#x27;re a good size for your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also given these as gifts in little makeup bags for people I&#x27;ve done exchanges with, and they all said they found a good use for them.</li>
            <li> the original is very soft and blends makeup.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this same product many times.</li>
            <li> The smallness actually helps get in the nooks and crannies better.</li>
            <li> i got only 3 but its better than nothing.</li>
            <li> my first time using these</li>
            <li> Works really!</li>
            <li> Shipping was also really fast which is also a plus!</li>
            <li> Came fast!</li>
            <li> I really like them!</li>
            <li> The only redeeming quality is that my nephew likes to play with them.</li>
            <li> Worked very well!</li>
            <li> I wish more companies would treat their clients with such respect.</li>
            <li> You are better off spending the extra money on a nicer one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure each shape is for a different purpose.</li>
            <li> They work a lot better with the bigger size I received from my first order.</li>
            <li> but I decided to change it because i was going based off my first impression.</li>
            <li> Blends makeup really well !</li>
            <li> Still use in a pinch but prefer a more absorbent sponge and a different texture to create an airbrush effect.</li>
            <li> They are trying to sell only one applicator for over 10 dollars at Target and these are even better.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> These are ok, I thought they would be bigger.</li>
            <li> but the only thing is that they are a bit more dense</li>
            <li> For as inexpensive as they are, and if you&#x27;re willing to wait for the shipping, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a blender like this</li>
            <li> These are small in size but are still perfect to use and are portable since they are tiny.</li>
            <li> And the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> i love this product and totally recommend this to anyone who cant afford the beautyblender.-XOAuriBeauty&lt;br /&gt;XOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> Although I love the very low price!</li>
            <li> Anyone who has reviewed these saying these are just like the Beauty blender or even better is obviously lying.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and assorted colors makes applying makeup fun.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what i thought i would</li>
            <li> Love them just wish they came  in the set and not all 4 the same</li>
            <li> Glad I only paid $2.50 for them.</li>
            <li> I love the different shapes as well.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered these they were squishy like a blender sponge.</li>
            <li> They are a basic sponge in cute colors.</li>
            <li> I would rather save money on sponges and save it for higher end make up.</li>
            <li> They work well for the price, kinda smell funny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They blended pretty well</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work better than just a regular make up sponge</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for beginners at least.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what I need them to do.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the product and</li>
            <li> Love them way smaller than I expect ed but still gets the Job done</li>
            <li> I wanted to get the higher end ones that they sell at the store for ten times more.</li>
            <li> These do not smell funny or like chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love them I totally recommend them</li>
            <li> You get exactly whats shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> I thought they were alot more bigger</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t grow with water like higher priced beauty blenders and they don&#x27;t seem quite as durable.</li>
            <li> It makes all beauty blenders work better, and it makes the blenders a bit bigger, trust me.</li>
            <li> on me one of them smelled funny</li>
            <li> especially cause they came with more than one</li>
            <li> I use it for applying BB cream and it works very well for me!</li>
            <li> and they work pretty well considering the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to accept the cons for the price break.</li>
            <li> Exactly whas was described and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> and then it is ready to use!</li>
            <li> I will order more in the future</li>
            <li> Well I really hoped this helped!</li>
            <li> They are softer and because they&#x27;re slightly smaller, I get a more even coverage.</li>
            <li> I would save my $2 and just go get a real beauty blender!</li>
            <li> THEY ARE SO CHEAP AND SO SOFT, JUST LIKE THE BEAUTY BLENDER AND</li>
            <li> SOOOO MUCH CHEAPER!</li>
            <li> They worked ok but obviously nowhere close to the quality of beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> First, this product took a month to ship to my place.</li>
            <li> It is much smaller, but I like the size better.</li>
            <li> I thought they were bigger, but I love them either way.</li>
            <li> DONT BUY, for $6 you can buy the sponge from real techniques !</li>
            <li> I ordered these back in summer and now I made another purchase for more of them.</li>
            <li> As good of a quality as the ones I buy at Ulta, but for so much less!</li>
            <li> The texture is really soft but there was a very distinct smell when I took them out of the packaging which gave me a headache</li>
            <li> I expected to get 2 of one kind and 2 of the other kind.</li>
            <li> They came right on time the blend really well.</li>
            <li> They are a bit hard at first but the more you use the better they feel.</li>
            <li> They did so great that my Sister got a set for herself &amp; my young little friend that helps me sometimes with</li>
            <li> but I prefer a flat top brush to the sponge method anyway.</li>
            <li> When I first started using them, I thought they were basic make up sponges, but you really have to break it in for it to work better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite a hard sponge, it doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference when you put water on it, but it still does a great job of putting on make up and for the price you get quite a deal.</li>
            <li> very soft, not sure of the material but feels like memory foam, beautiful colors, shipped pretty fast</li>
            <li> These seriously work amazing just need to wet them first and your foundation turns out amazing!  </li>
            <li> Got them earlier then I expected which is great.</li>
            <li> These sponges are smaller than I expected, but the quality is great</li>
            <li> Great product, smaller than expected and slower shipping than I hoped for.</li>
            <li> as far as cleaning, someone said it doesn&#x27;t get clean with soap and water.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really absorb water when you get them wet, but honestly you get what you pay for when it comes to a beauty blender.</li>
            <li> so dont expect that.. their pretty small and good for things like concealer</li>
            <li> Just wish the texture was similar more to the real beaut blender...</li>
            <li> It is so convenient to be able to use the same applicator for the whole face</li>
            <li> Compared to the one I currently have, they are not as spongy and do not absorb water as good as my current one.</li>
            <li> My package did get lost in the mail so it too far too long to ship but other than that, this product in my opinion, is great!</li>
            <li> But were super affordable and soft!</li>
            <li> I find these pretty decent for blending out concealer, but oh lord don&#x27;t even think of using these with your foundation!</li>
            <li> Not the best, they kind of absorb the product weird and distribute it unevenly.</li>
            <li> Buh the acetone eats it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to ship but for the price that was ok.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I&#x27;ve been wanting to try some different sponges, and I find these to work better than those cheap white wedges you can buy at any store.</li>
            <li> Even though these took a long time to arrive I still love them.</li>
            <li> These took a long time to ship, but I love these things.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t do much good because they are so small.</li>
            <li> These good enough for travel, very tiny, but I don&#x27;t like how much it absorbs product.</li>
            <li> Small but still a good buy</li>
            <li> They feel nice in my hand and I am no longer tied down to a pricy beauty sponge which makes for healthier skin.</li>
            <li> These little sponges are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> These little guys are cute and blend well!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you wet the sponge first.  </li>
            <li> and I find it works a lot better rather than having it dry.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I expected I love them</li>
            <li> Super soft</li>
            <li> Wring/squeeze them out and let them dry on the counter top.</li>
            <li> Second thing is that the product has a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> If you take good care of your sponges, then they should last a long time no matter where they were bought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly certain, so when it gives you a delivery date of five weeks out, believe it.</li>
            <li> but these do not blend well with certain foundation brands.</li>
            <li> Way to large to apply Foundation and Powder.</li>
            <li> I honestly bought these because I wanted to try a beauty blender without the original&#x27;s ridiculous price tag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give them a few more days to see how they work!</li>
            <li> These are very stiff and do not do a good job of blending anything.  </li>
            <li> These sponges are fine but THEY ARE WAY SMALLER</li>
            <li> I am fine with this - I don&#x27;t know what being larger would help anyway.</li>
            <li> Other than the long shipping time, this product is great.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent sponges</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but also super cute in fun shapes and sizes.</li>
            <li> Really handy little things.</li>
            <li> Just as expected and SUPER soft!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good shape and gets into hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> However, for the price it is hard to complain.&lt;br /&gt;All 4 in good shape.</li>
            <li> They are a little smaller than the ones I bought in the store, but this makes them perfect for blending smaller areas like the nose and can still be used for the temples, cheekbones and anywhere else.</li>
            <li> They are a little harder than the ones at professional make up stores but work just as great!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel too soft or hard, texture is just great.</li>
            <li> the egg shaped ones seem to dry up quicker now but other than that extremely happy with them</li>
            <li> good for the price, the material they are made of is more dense than others I have bought from make up stores such as ulta, whether that is a good or bad thing, I think, is based on personal preference</li>
            <li> I was surprised how soft they were considering how cheap it is.</li>
            <li> probably 1/3 size of the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li> They are very dense.</li>
            <li> They came really fast in the mail.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> makes beating my face so much easier</li>
            <li> It did not &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34; off my skin when applying, unlike the real deal sponges.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Blends very well</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOOOVVEEEEE</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> These blenders are actually much softer and easier to blend with then some drug store brands.</li>
            <li> They work really well and their washable</li>
            <li> Where did the beauty blender sponge from sephora derive from to cost so much?</li>
            <li> very poorly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would really make a difference</li>
            <li> 1/4 the size of the authentic ones  - and don&#x27;t expand at all when wet.  </li>
            <li> I bought a set of identical sponges from a different seller and they were a fantastic dupe for the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> but otherwise its a very sturdy product, I was expecting it to be softer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to apply rather than rubbing it on your face.</li>
            <li> these sponges work really well for me.</li>
            <li> Such a low price for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Very well.</li>
            <li> When I opened them there was an intense chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I used one of the pink ones (with no spots) on my face, but I&#x27;m not so sure I want to use it again.</li>
            <li> Skip this and by a Real Techniques dupe.</li>
            <li> Get a real Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> Overall cheap</li>
            <li> Order was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Material is very rubbery-like .</li>
            <li> Not what she was expecting and would rather spend $20 for the real thing.</li>
            <li> So if you want the real thing, you are going to have to shop elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I suggest this to anyone  who needs something light and simple to apply makeup with.</li>
            <li> these really suck.</li>
            <li> Splurge and buy the real deal.</li>
            <li> nothing like the real beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> They hold up really well and don&#x27;t piece apart</li>
            <li> When I bought these, I wasn&#x27;t into makeup as much as I am now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it really does work well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suggest real techniques orange sponge thing.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work very well for foundation either.</li>
            <li> Will stick with the real blenders from now on.</li>
            <li> They do tend to soak up product since they are very dense.</li>
            <li> So much for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Work really well haven&#x27;t tried a real beauty blender yet to no the difference between them.  </li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to everyone!</li>
            <li> They also did not seem to expand when wet the way most beauty blenders should.</li>
            <li> Holds to much product</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t complain too much.  </li>
            <li> It also came in really fast</li>
            <li> I have never tried a beauty blender, but I will very soon.</li>
            <li> I dont really recommend them.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> not so much liquid foundations</li>
            <li> I absolutely like this product.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product</li>
            <li> it takes up too much of my productsut</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always not taking up too much</li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> They make your makeup look polished and picture ready.</li>
            <li> Such a fantastic deal for 4 of them.</li>
            <li> They are very har, and they do not come in the box</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really wash it out</li>
            <li> I love these sponges they make your makeup extra smooth and blended when you use em wet.</li>
            <li> and you really save on product, and it goes on smoother.  </li>
            <li> if u don&#x27;t have make up brushes or for really real beginners in makeup.</li>
            <li> And they do not grow that much</li>
            <li> I have found that concealer does not wash out as it does with my beauty blender, and the sponges hold too much moisture when damp (the beauty blender sponges are meant to be used damp).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to throw them all away and buy the real thing I guess.</li>
            <li> They blend really well for the price.</li>
            <li> I use it to apply makeup on my neck as I figured it didn&#x27;t do much coverage as I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> It did light coverage only which made me stick to my concealer brush to blend foundation on my face.</li>
            <li> Overall, if you are looking for light coverage blending sponges, this may work for you.</li>
            <li> These arrived surprisingly fast, it still says here on Amazon that &amp;#34;it&#x27;s on its way.</li>
            <li> I Really Like This Dupe Beauty Blenders.</li>
            <li> really like these.</li>
            <li> They blend very well when I applie my make up.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product, as well as offordable.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the real thing.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t like the real beauty blender</li>
            <li> It applies really well</li>
            <li> About 2 1/2 inches in height, works REALLY well.</li>
            <li> so I needed something that was reasonable for the price and quantity.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much  </li>
            <li> These work well, but definitely don&#x27;t blend as smoothly as a foundation brush.</li>
            <li> very easy!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really see that as a problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just I feel like the sponge absorbes a lot of the makeup and doesn&#x27;t apply much of it to my face.</li>
            <li> Using these is so much easier than using a foundation brush.</li>
            <li> They do increase in size but not by much after wetting them.</li>
            <li> This product really covers my makeup very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks again for the bargain.</li>
            <li> AND IT DOES BLENDING VERY</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li> If you have used a beauty blender or even the real techniques</li>
            <li> I really soaked these sponges like you&#x27;re supposed to (like</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t perform very well for me.</li>
            <li> Soaked up a lot of product and then didn&#x27;t distribute much at all.</li>
            <li> I really hope that they would improve their product and shipping time.</li>
            <li> You really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery work</li>
            <li> Ladies/Gents, just get the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda glad I got all pink</li>
            <li> and it overwhelms my whole bedroom.</li>
            <li> I doubt I&#x27;ll use them though because it seems really chemically which is weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It blends in very well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Instead of paying so much for 1 at a stre</li>
            <li> They came really fast.</li>
            <li> I gave 3 starts because I think they absorb too much of my foundation</li>
            <li> Never used real one</li>
            <li> I would much rather just buy the beauty blender and know what I&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li> Please note: I have never used the real Beauty Blender, I got these as replacements for the sponges I had been buying at TJ Maxx.</li>
            <li> but I think they&#x27;ll work better once I get them broken in more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more in the near future.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used to almond shaped ones, but they work well to blend in my BB cream, much better than just my fingers.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, and you use less makeup than putting the foundation on with your fingers.</li>
            <li> Its okay I guess ,they are super small though.</li>
            <li> Perfect other than they are much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> It had smaller pores than most other dupes and had a smooth surface.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on the high priced sponges when these little babies do just as awesome.</li>
            <li> This is an example of how some knock off&#x27;s can be equal to the original.</li>
            <li> If they were larger or closer to the consistency of the original Beauty Blender</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re smaller than the original blending sponges</li>
            <li> I purchased these to replace my other beauty blender and I am pleased with my choice.</li>
            <li> there a great product just like the real thing and there small enough to carry around in your bag</li>
            <li> If you want a sponge to apply your makeup stick with the original beauty blender, That will set you back $15-$20 depending on where you buy it.</li>
            <li> Other than that they are okay</li>
            <li> these babies did the same as my original blender.</li>
            <li> They are small but cute!</li>
            <li> They smelled funny had to wash a few times before it actually smelled good, but they do the job for concealer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learnt to only use them for concealer, and use my original beauty blender for my foundation.</li>
            <li> Other that that, love it.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> The product is fine for the price, but clearly not the beauty blender brand quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what soap they used but regular soap doesn&#x27;t clean makeup.</li>
            <li> I can even clean my foundation off my hands with regular soap and water.</li>
            <li> They r small travel size but for the price it was a good deal excited to use and shipping was faster than expected</li>
            <li> I am giving them 2 stars simply because they were reasonably priced and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> and then they are left out to dry on their own.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best value for these type of sponge, their only &amp;#34;flaw&amp;#34; being they remain hard despite adding water, but it does not make a very big difference.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think its worth it for basic and/or daily makeup use, however, special occasions and important events, I use my Soho beauty blender.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small but amazing.</li>
            <li> I just went ahead and spent the extra money and got a beauty blender they work way better !</li>
            <li> I liked how soft they where only thing is thst they where so tiny</li>
            <li> youre better off buying the real deal for a more expensive price than these knockoffs</li>
            <li> it was ok not worth the hype</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll use it since there were not packaged effectively.</li>
            <li> well (better than the average drugstore triangle sponge), but they also absorb a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product this imitating is far superior and also expands when you wet it prior to using it.  </li>
            <li> The size is good too, they&#x27;re also considerable large, I was expecting them to be very small</li>
            <li> when they are dry and you first get them they are super dense...</li>
            <li> Though they did come with a pretty gross smell that took several washes with a strong scented soap to get out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see these little sponge puffs as blenders but more so as appliers for foundation and concealer.</li>
            <li> it was really a surprise to get those four little things:)</li>
            <li> Guess he got himself some new toys!</li>
            <li> Just throw it away and use a new one!</li>
            <li> great dupe for the beauty blender that are way more expensive at other make up stores</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for my new toys.</li>
            <li> so glad I found these one for less.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft, and when you get the wet they work even better.</li>
            <li> Decent quality and</li>
            <li> Good enough for a few uses and in case of emergencies.</li>
            <li> They will blend but I will most likely end up buying a regular palm sized sponge from Wal Mart.</li>
            <li> I will admit they do not work as well as my main beauty blender I have purchased from a store in the mall</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased and would definitely order this item again.</li>
            <li> These sponges are really small and they don&#x27;t blend pretty well, they&#x27;re are OK for the price but would not buy them again.</li>
            <li> Seriously, DO NOT BUY IT.</li>
            <li> these are super mini make up sponges and actually leave &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; on your face when you use them meaning they bleed</li>
            <li> I would suggest anyone looking for a decent blender to keep on looking.</li>
            <li> They are a nice firm foam material, but still soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste too much money on these.</li>
            <li> vibrant colors as well, as shown in picture.</li>
            <li> The beauty blenders are really nice, their just a smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Love the various shapes as a bonus next to a more affordable price, same product than &amp;#34;branded&amp;#34; items with nothing extra.</li>
            <li> the quality is just ok, but what do u expect from such low price?</li>
            <li> Overall, incredibly pleased, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> They are okay for consealers...but not full foundation.</li>
            <li> Not soft like the original</li>
            <li> For the price they work very well, they actually had pretty fast shipping for me.</li>
            <li> They work just as well as the high dollar ones you find in stores.</li>
            <li> I had been a cheapskate and didn&#x27;t want to pay the high prices for the brand name beauty blenders, so I opted for these instead.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these sponges.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them</li>
            <li> and I highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend you give them a try.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Its hard to clean.. but make up went on smooth...</li>
            <li> Amazing, doesn&#x27;t take water like the real one, and it&#x27;s very small but still works</li>
            <li> cute little sponges.</li>
            <li> These little things are so cute.</li>
            <li> but my little sisters likes them but doesn&#x27;t love them.</li>
            <li> cute and little, I like them</li>
            <li> so they work a little better</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fall apart easily like other make-up sponges.</li>
            <li> so I am probably going to use them as painting brush soaking sponges, but again they are so hard I do not know whether they can soak effectively.</li>
            <li> These are very well made an dense yet soft on the face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dense rather than soft and squishy.</li>
            <li> give it two stars because yes it was a much easier blend than using my fingers, but you have to wonder if you&#x27;re getting something else on your face that you didn&#x27;t want anywhere near your skin.</li>
            <li> Great substitute for the expensive beauty blender.  </li>
            <li> Thought they would be the normal size blenders</li>
            <li> the different shapes are all useful</li>
            <li> when i saw the picture they looked like a normal size beauty blender.</li>
            <li> but they arent normal size.</li>
            <li> But I noticed they don&#x27;t expand like a normal cosmetic sponge when soaked in water.</li>
            <li> So cute and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I still have three more and they&#x27;ll last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, especially for a four count.</li>
            <li> I loved them, they are small but don&#x27;t need anything bigger!</li>
            <li> It took three washes to get them smelling somewhat normal.</li>
            <li> These sponges aren&#x27;t the normal beauty blender size.</li>
            <li> They BARELY expand when wet under water and still soak up most of the makeup product.</li>
            <li> The liquid make up is absorbed by foam until it is used several times.</li>
            <li> It took over a month to come but product was worth it, especially for the price</li>
            <li> I love it and can&#x27;t believe what I&#x27;ve been missing out on.</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT THE SPONGES WOULD BE LIKE A NORMAL SIZE BEAUTY BLENDER‚Ä¶</li>
            <li> Good sponges, they are very small!</li>
            <li> I still believe the original beauty blender is just a tiny tiny tiny bit better but not enough for me to continue buying it at that price.</li>
            <li> Just like the regular beauty blender but a little better!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care what the colors are, as long as they worked right</li>
            <li> I think this is worth it considering the other beauty blenders are very much over priced.</li>
            <li> Once you get past the initial smell, they&#x27;re pretty good little blenders, especially if you&#x27;re in between purchasing some of more substance.</li>
            <li> Thanks again I look it use it everyday easy to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> Smell a little funny and get very dirty very quick but great sponges !!!</li>
            <li> These make up blenders actually worked out just right for me.</li>
            <li> but I go right back to either wedges or the BB for soft,,pliable applicators.</li>
            <li> They all seem more stiff than I&#x27;d prefer in a makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> let dry, not a bad buy at all</li>
            <li> they smell like new rubber balls but only if you put it right on your nose.</li>
            <li> A little harder than normal but still good blenders.</li>
            <li> soft, cute little sponges.</li>
            <li> I needed a new beauty sponge</li>
            <li> and I ordered them brand new .</li>
            <li> I had to soak them in water and soap and leave them over night just to get the brand new smell away.</li>
            <li> and I ordered them brand  new .</li>
            <li> I just ended up going and buying 2 new ones myself.</li>
            <li> These are so reasonable in pricing that its hard for me to see spending more</li>
            <li> They are great wet or dry, but they do not increase in size or change shape when wet as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I would like to compare these to more expensive brands and see if there is a difference in how smooth they apply makeup.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like them they dry to quickly</li>
            <li> the colors all match my makeup products its nothing short of what i expected and for the price phenomenal</li>
            <li> They are not only cheap, but theres 4 of them, so I don&#x27;t have to reuse them on the different shades I apply on my face.</li>
            <li> So far, they&#x27;re soft &amp; seem very durable.</li>
            <li> It will seem like it is taking on a lot of product, but by wetting the sponge the water inside makes a weighted core which keeps most of the wet product your using on the outside of the sponge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the light Blue one and it seems to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t regret buying these (especially since they were really cheap), but they&#x27;re definitely not holy grail</li>
            <li> I love these little puffs!</li>
            <li> I love these little sponges!</li>
            <li> Great quality...a little rough with the first use, so maybe wet it to moisten it a tad bit.</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected it wasn&#x27;t expensive really good since I&#x27;m a beginner !</li>
            <li> Very soft, squishy, and work well for applying foundation/cover-up.</li>
            <li> Very soft</li>
            <li> It blends in the makeup to a T. Looks very natural and it can be reused if you are into saving money.</li>
            <li> I received four very soft beauty blender &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It kind of absorbs the makeup, and theyre stiff even if constantly used.</li>
            <li> Been excited for several days before finally got a chance to put on my makeups.</li>
            <li> and they do the exact same job.</li>
            <li> They are no where near the size of a normal beauty blender.</li>
            <li> it remains the same exact size and it does not blend well at all.</li>
            <li> and when it does the blender itself doesn&#x27;t feel any different from when I first took it out of the package.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> One when you open the bag for the first time it smells rubbery.</li>
            <li> I usually never write a review.</li>
            <li> but they are exactly the same as the ones you would buy at a drug store for $13!!!</li>
            <li> They are really small but cute</li>
            <li> This time was the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> I would rather spend the extra money to have a higher quality tool, but I don&#x27;t worry about losing these on vacation or at school.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re so small but so cute</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re so soft!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off using your finger or small brushes.</li>
            <li> They even came a week early!</li>
            <li> thwyare small but cute.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not expensive and they definitely do their work.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the price on these sponges, I was very iffy about whether or not they were worth the risk, but then I thought it‚Äôs a few bucks!</li>
            <li> Extremely soft and durable!</li>
            <li> These sponges do the exact same this as the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Would work better if I took it to school and used it for an essay :/</li>
            <li> they are soft and feel like normal makeup sponges.</li>
            <li> Yes, they&#x27;re cheap but not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> These beauty blenders are very stiff and not soft, they don&#x27;t apply or blend your foundation or concealers good.</li>
            <li> Did NOT smell at all, were NOT hard but soft like a blender should be.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and squishy, not hard at all</li>
            <li> They dry easily and do not ensure proper application.</li>
            <li> Much more difficult to clean, probably because they are made of a thicker sponge in comparison to the beauty blender products.</li>
            <li> These have become a daily staple in my makeup routine, and are simple to clean.</li>
            <li> I just used one this morning, and although they&#x27;re a little small, they work great for me.</li>
            <li> There a little small but there great</li>
            <li> These are really nice beauty blenders and so much cheaper than other name brand ones, they come in a shipping bag loose with no individual packaging which is why they are so affordable.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, but inexpensive and free shipping, I guess makes it a decent buy.  </li>
            <li> Before the first use, it did have a weird &amp;#34;plastic-like&amp;#34; smell, so I washed with warm water and baby soap.</li>
            <li> Surprised to see that most people said they were small but even if you think so they do give four.</li>
            <li> They arrived early, with no smell and feel very soft and squishy.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the smaller hard to reach place AND the bigger areas, all in one little sponge that takes up a very small amount of real estate (very important when you have lots of makeup).&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Because of their size if using this to apply foundation to entire face, it takes a lot longer and a lot more blending/patting/pressing motions because it covers less surface area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to use less foundation and still cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> I usually have good luck and don&#x27;t end up with what other people do.</li>
            <li> They are secure to hold in my hands, unlike the little tear off wedges.</li>
            <li> Works fine for me, just not as big as expected.</li>
            <li> so you definitely need to play with them a little to make them more spongy.</li>
            <li> Always a top buy on my amazon list, can never have enough of these little guys.</li>
            <li> but for me personally i would spend a little more and just get the beauty blender brand.</li>
            <li> I love the sponges although 2 were hard.</li>
            <li> If you really must try these, be aware that shipping is super slow too!</li>
            <li> and I want to clear up some confusion about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just buy the real thing next time.</li>
            <li> Product is much smaller than anticipated can&#x27;t use for much</li>
            <li> but they did take nearly 3 months to get here</li>
            <li> They blend really well especially when damp.</li>
            <li> Ordered the product from Magetefia and COMPLETELY UNSATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li> I have used my sponges for a week and so far they are holding up and doing everything they are suppose to do.</li>
            <li> wow, i had no idea</li>
            <li> Really helps to get in those tiny places.</li>
            <li> The picture of the sponge being used makes the sponge appear larger than it really is.</li>
            <li> If you are really into makeup I would suggest investing in a actual beauty blender for $20</li>
            <li> they make my make-up process so much easier especially applying my primer n concealers.</li>
            <li> There soft on the face</li>
            <li> I got different colors than the picture, but that really doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> They just completely absorb your makeup,  leaving none on your face.</li>
            <li> and if I am in a rush and I use them without wetting them they are still soft.</li>
            <li> Soft on skin.</li>
            <li> they are also smaller than the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone looking for a professional finish in its makeup.</li>
            <li> Foundation did not apply seamlessly.</li>
            <li> This product completely exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying the real one later.</li>
            <li> So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really compare, I&#x27;m not a makeup artist so just to do a simple thing like putting on makeup</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on these sponges.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old gave them five stars...</li>
            <li> and I was surprised at the difference it made from just using a makeup brush.</li>
            <li> I was surprised</li>
            <li> The sponges are soooo soft</li>
            <li> Really wish they were bigger</li>
            <li> These beauty blender things really arent a big deal.</li>
            <li> I actually think it takes away the make up rather than put it on your face because it is a sponge so is taken up your product so for me I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend using it</li>
            <li> Your Makeup blender has to be soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> They are soft and durable.</li>
            <li> but they were perfectly soft.</li>
            <li> These actually work really well at blending &amp; highlighting makeup.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret the purchase because the 4pc set was only $3.50 and the shape is very ergonomic for reaching nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> When I got my beauty blenders I was surprised to see they were mini ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even soft</li>
            <li> They are soft and blend makeup</li>
            <li> The sponges do not get soft at all...</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering the Real Techniques miracle complexion sponge 3 days later.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> The package was marked that it was a phone case.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get 4 different colors, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter to me</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t not have it near my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I washed immediately with DrBronners lavender (organic and naturally antibacterial) and air dried in hanging mesh bag (which I do EVERY time I use a b.blender) and no odor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently only using the cream colored egg shape and love it.</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft.</li>
            <li> This product is so SOFT.</li>
            <li> then I know that the money spent was worth it.</li>
            <li> I actually bought these to use with clay sculpturing; they work fine for smoothing and wiping away wet materials!</li>
            <li> but thats due to the international shipping which l was totally fine with.</li>
            <li> Not for anyone with big pores, fine lines, or other skin problems.</li>
            <li> I wasted so much product because it goes right into the sponge</li>
            <li> Kinda stiff, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting super high quality for the price.</li>
            <li> They are small and wash easily with out falling apart.</li>
            <li> I read a review saying the sponges doesn&#x27;t come back to its original shape once wet</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not as easy to blend with even after dampening them because they&#x27;re so small and not quite as pliable.</li>
            <li> They were dramatically smaller than the original beauty blender and material was harder.</li>
            <li> Arrived more than a week early but is very small and color is faded.</li>
            <li> At first they are rather hard and not very spongy, but the more I washed them, used them, and played around with them, the squishier they got.</li>
            <li> no wonder it&#x27;s so cheap, seriously just save your time and money and buy a real beauty blender</li>
            <li> Smell a little funny but doesn&#x27;t bother you to much</li>
            <li> They blend your makeup in really good, so you aren&#x27;t left with any harsh lines or dark spots of makeup.</li>
            <li> But they are very small, they work ok.</li>
            <li> I dont feel i got what i payed for, they&#x27;re okay sponges, but a little too small, &amp; not the right material.</li>
            <li> Really small and don&#x27;t work quite like a blender,  but for price its fine.</li>
            <li> After using this product to blend in my foundation a few times, I realized I need to clean the blender.</li>
            <li> So hard to clean!</li>
            <li> A sponge is a sponge and quality is key but they have the same exact results.</li>
            <li> The only cons are that they u have to soak them in water because it absorbs really quick and that they are pretty small.</li>
            <li> make sure you wet them down when you use them.</li>
            <li> I got these earlier than the predicted time and they look just like the high end ones.</li>
            <li> Kudos to them for making such a high quality product.</li>
            <li> these come in very handy and are just like my expensive ones that I carry!</li>
            <li> I should have just paid the money and gotten the usual beauty blender and not tried to cheap out.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as soft, and don&#x27;t absorb as much as the more expensive beauty blenders, buy they defiantly get the job done.</li>
            <li> Its not good to keep 1 beauty blender for 2 months or more even though you may wash it out because bacteria can still build up.</li>
            <li> but they work really well , as what i dont like is the really long delivery wont be ordering from here again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> You have to wet them first but still to ruff</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> They bled the first time that I washed them, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> though these would be the same as a normal beauty blender</li>
            <li> the sponges work find just have to wet them first</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> applying wet or oil based products, dampen sponge with water first.</li>
            <li> I will probably go back to the normal sponges.</li>
            <li> But the second time I ordered them I got them and they were half the size of the original ones I ordered.</li>
            <li> They blend my concealer better than any other blending method I have previously used.  </li>
            <li> are smaller than than the original but bigger than expected, still works well thank you</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE LITTLE MAKE UP BLENDERS!!!</li>
            <li> really well dry</li>
            <li> Two stars because low price and reasonable shipping speed even if this product didn&#x27;t work for me personally</li>
            <li> They last a pretty long whole&lt;br /&gt;Also.</li>
            <li> I hoped that the quality was good but it only mediocre.</li>
            <li> So cheap and definitely worth buying, except when it came there&#x27;s a weird smell but not a problem to me</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they aren&#x27;t nearly as good as the actual makeup sponge</li>
            <li> love them so much, but the blenders are a little small.</li>
            <li> I have seen these at other places for a  higher price,</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re stiff, but work better when wet.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to clean these.</li>
            <li> They are decent sponges, The only flaw is that I wish they were a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> I was expecting full size products and you get like little inch big sponges.</li>
            <li> I expected them to be a little bit bigger, but they&#x27;re ok</li>
            <li> I suggest you buy them and use a bit of baby shampoo to wash them and wring them out and let them dry, although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary many of these products are of the same quality but costs are cut due to not having to pay to make and ship plastic individual boxes per sponge,thus saving us customers money.</li>
            <li> But they do not last you a long time, they tear when you use them to much, and soak up all the product in then</li>
            <li> They are rough and do not blend very well.  </li>
            <li> These are really soft and would definitely buy again if needed so.</li>
            <li> I did not really expect much</li>
            <li> Not as soft as i thought they would be, Or absorbent, same size with or without water... but</li>
            <li> and they really stink when you wet them.</li>
            <li> only used one so far, i have to wash it to know wat</li>
            <li> then i expected they are very teeny tinny</li>
            <li> Can barely hold between my fingers.</li>
            <li> They are much smaller than expected, but they are very plush and soft.</li>
            <li> i even tried to wet it to see if it would apply easier and that didnt help much.</li>
            <li> The picture shows the four sponges I purchased and my old one from ULTA in the middle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since gotten a different brand from the store and its so soft and covers my pores so well.</li>
            <li> When compared to the actual beauty blender it is just as soft.  </li>
            <li> Yes they don&#x27;t enlarge much when wet</li>
            <li> The actaul beauty blender is FAR bigger than these</li>
            <li> The only one I got was the hot pink one - and it took forever to receive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, there is nothing about this product that&#x27;s even useful.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, there is nothing about this product that&#x27;s even useful.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I loved the price, but wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the time it would take to get to me.</li>
            <li> The colors are random but it honestly doesn&#x27;t matter because they&#x27;ll get covered in the product anyway.</li>
            <li> Only downside is they are a little bit small but what do you expect for cheap right?</li>
            <li> The sponges are almost impossible to clean and cracked very quickly.</li>
            <li> Right now I feel like it a waste to just throw away these sponges</li>
            <li> Super small.</li>
            <li> And even though they&#x27;re super small there&#x27;s 4 of them</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t absorb too much makeup like other sponges.</li>
            <li> Hard to clean, but they blend so well.</li>
            <li> They work well though, but are really hard to clean.</li>
            <li> Other than the almost one month wait I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The are a little more firm then the beauty blenders .</li>
            <li> if your young and you like to try out new things and or find other uses for them</li>
            <li> Nice little sponges, thick, durable, they do not plump up much when wet, overall does the job of blending makeup.</li>
            <li> Very affordable,delivered two weeks earlier then expected date.</li>
            <li> smaller than expected and very rubbery feel</li>
            <li> They are quite smaller than I anticipated, and also have kind of a weird smell.</li>
            <li> They are okay for the price, but they&#x27;re a little stiff and they don&#x27;t absorb water to make it simpler to blend, also they seem to take all the product off my face and leave none on.</li>
            <li> These sponges are super hard and super tiny only 1.5 inches long 1 inch wide.</li>
            <li> Only received the dark pink and the light blue.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very small, only over an inch tall, but it&#x27;s in the description, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting huge ones.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that they are hard to clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only using two of this and gave the other ones away to my friend she absolutely loves them</li>
            <li> However, if you use these for foundation weekly, they will get dirty pretty fast and don&#x27;t dry quickly if you wash yours.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the teardrop shaped ones for concealer and the other shape for my cream blush.</li>
            <li> You can tell high quality sponges by how much they expand once wet, and these don&#x27;t expand at all, just stay a little moist.</li>
            <li> They are a bit stiff at first.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and returned the one beauty sponge I fort for 15$. This whole package was less then 5$.</li>
            <li> Not sure the point of different shapes, but fun</li>
            <li> My BB cream was completely absorbed by the blenders and only applied a small amount to my face.</li>
            <li> The only draw back from this product is that they are hard to clean, but all of these puffy blenders are the same in that way.</li>
            <li> at first the product is a little hard but after a few uses when damp it starts to get softer and more sponglike.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, because these things are super tiny and hard as rocks.</li>
            <li> These sponges are super tiny and hard.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay they apply make up better than my fingers so its not so bad they are small though</li>
            <li> Mine came two light pink and two dark pink, not multicolored like the picture.</li>
            <li> Theyre also super affordable and i mean its four of them .</li>
            <li> They are super small!</li>
            <li> Use them only a few times and not very dirty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great buy and isn&#x27;t expensive in the slightest!!</li>
            <li> At the beginning they feel a little hard but after washing it and using it more it starts to adjust to your face</li>
            <li> These little sponges are cute but they&#x27;re really hard.</li>
            <li> JUST A LITTLE TO HARD OTHERWISE OK</li>
            <li> Very affordable,  shippng takes a little while</li>
            <li> Cute little puffs, but they leave tiny pieces on your face if you rub too hard...</li>
            <li> this product smells really bad whenyou use it an it doesn&#x27;t even work for good use, it dont even grow with water</li>
            <li> these suckers are so dense they don&#x27;t really absorb water, they don&#x27;t get soft or even expand.</li>
            <li> These blenders did what was intended, the only con was that they shipped slow, but was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> They are very hard and do not do justice to the original.</li>
            <li> Use a little bit of olive oil and a little bit of dish soap in your hand and all the makeup will come right out!</li>
            <li> Way too stiff to blend makeup very well</li>
            <li> Extreme soft.  </li>
            <li> I orden this and ready past 2 months and nothing need my money back</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t last long with teen girls applying makeup twice a day</li>
            <li> They are a little bit stiffer than a normal beauty blender, but i don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li> A little in the hard side but works fine</li>
            <li> The sponges are a little hard but for the price they work fine and the shape does allow you to get around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Which, means that when I put on my makeups in my usual ways (gently padding with the blender), it makes me want to throw the blender away.</li>
            <li> Fast ship but items are too small.</li>
            <li> Small and very dense</li>
            <li> small in size compared to the real beauty blender (which ive never owned).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small and very time consuming to use</li>
            <li> I only wanted them to spread foundation, but the feel was not soft on l to the touch.</li>
            <li> How long does it last?</li>
            <li> They were smaller than expected, but I found it is actually easier to apply makeup with the smaller sponges.</li>
            <li> I ordered these make up sponges because the flat one kept leaving streaks and couldn&#x27;t get in the crevices of my nose and eyes  </li>
            <li> ONLY DOWNFALL IS they took a long time to come in the mail  </li>
            <li> Two it did not have the one with the flat angled bottom, that&#x27;s probably partly my mistake for not looking for that option.</li>
            <li> For a long time this was the only blending sponge that I used</li>
            <li> Definitely a good price for the item but disappointed in the size.</li>
            <li> very hard almost a soft plastic, leaves makeup blotchy but 4 for the price is reasonable</li>
            <li> The texture is a little harder compared to the real beauty blender though...</li>
            <li> After several long weeks of waiting for these, I couldn&#x27;t use them to apply makeup!</li>
            <li> and you want them to last as long as they can!</li>
            <li> I am pretty disappointed though, can&#x27;t say I blame them for a lackluster product when it was this cheap though.</li>
            <li> I am experimenting with them and trying them with different products, dry and damp, to see if they will work for me</li>
            <li> My personal suggestion is to keep one of the sponges dry when setting makeup concealer under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does expand slightly in water and gets almost as soft.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I had expected and the pores are larger than my beauty blender.  </li>
            <li> It is a little smaller than the regular sponges we see in beauty stores, but this gets the areas that the bigger sponges can&#x27;t really especially under the eye</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, very hard to clean..</li>
            <li> I actually like them better than my expensive ones!</li>
            <li> It is a real company, it works (almost) as well as the Beauty Blender, and is only 8$ for a decent sized sponge that you can trust on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a professional stylist and figured it wasn&#x27;t a bad price to experiment with cheaper brand</li>
            <li> * if you rub this too hard, when cleaning it, then it will break... not easy to clean, the color stains the blender after use</li>
            <li> it took ENTIRELY TOO LONG!!!</li>
            <li> It is kind of painful even.</li>
            <li> Sucks up the foundation way to much in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My only concern was that it came from China marked &amp;#34;Cell phone case&amp;#34; ... not sure what to make of that.</li>
            <li> These are incredibly small, I was expecting a normal sized beauty blender, not a miniature one.</li>
            <li> these are smaller then expected.  </li>
            <li> but they work well not too firm but not too soft.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but the quality of the sponges makes up for that</li>
            <li> Received earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It came in earlier than expected and the colors do look like how they are shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> It took FOREVER for me to receive them and they are much smaller then expected</li>
            <li> does not expand when wet like a proper beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Product was much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> a couple days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Not surprised if they were used.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> These are a lot smaller than I&#x27;d expected them to be</li>
            <li> The beauty blenders were also a lot smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe it took me this long.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> I expected them to be the larger blenders.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but such is life with online shopping.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Took a really long time to get these after I ordered them.</li>
            <li> Came a couple weeks earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I never use it damp so the fact that it doesn&#x27;t double in size when wet doesnt bother me.</li>
            <li> (Even though I made it wet, pshh it&#x27;s the same size.)</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t wet them so that they expand like regular beauty blenders</li>
            <li> They were entirely too rubbery, even when I wet them.</li>
            <li> I had to wait a long time, I almost forgot I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> After one wash, the lighter ones began to develop strange, moldly looking spots.</li>
            <li> , however they are smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time because it came from overseas.</li>
            <li> these were smaller than i expected.</li>
            <li> One goes a long way..</li>
            <li> And when wet they do not get bigger .</li>
            <li> These sponges are firm but also soft.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> They are so much smaller than what I expected</li>
            <li> d take so long to come. /:</li>
            <li> These were a lot smaller than expected..</li>
            <li> took a bit long but like them</li>
            <li> Different material then expected.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money ;-(</li>
            <li> They shipped from China and it took too long.</li>
            <li> I expected them to come in a big size</li>
            <li> Not soft doesn&#x27;t blend make up well</li>
            <li> They did take long to get here but also came way before the estimated arrival date.</li>
            <li> Long shipping time ...</li>
            <li> It just took a long time to get here.  </li>
            <li> They did take a long time to come in though.</li>
            <li> They are soft to the touch, yet firm on your face.</li>
            <li> The shipping took so long, literally so long.</li>
            <li> it came from China and it was delivered earlier than that expected date.</li>
            <li> Washing removed the strange smell and some of the color from the sponges.</li>
            <li> Wish I had ordered these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> To firm I thought they would be soft like my beauty blender</li>
            <li> I just wish the shipping wouldn&#x27;t have taken so long.</li>
            <li> i know it was a long shot with this product</li>
            <li> They are not soft at all.</li>
            <li> The 4 that arrived to me were blue, purple, fuchsia and pink.</li>
            <li> I like my beauty sponges, even though it took sooo long getting here.</li>
            <li> However shipping time was too long.</li>
            <li> Received them earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> It absorbs a lot of foundation and is not soft.</li>
            <li> They are way too small, like miniatures of the normal makeup blenders.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Smaller than what I expected.</li>
            <li> but if you can wait that long then go ahead and purchase this item now.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get bigger when they&#x27;re wet</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> PICTURE SHOWS ONE OF EACH COLOR, but not clear on written description</li>
            <li> If the foundation is thick, it does not blend out very well</li>
            <li> well its not what I expected they are pretty hard, and not very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> What I got were the same shape only half that size.  </li>
            <li> they last a long time but get stiff if you do not clean them, color is not as vibrant as pictured.</li>
            <li> I needed some new beauty blenders and I had a little extra money left to spend, so I ordered these little guys!</li>
            <li> Material is very stiff, doesn&#x27;t feel smooth on skin, absorbs too much product, terrible to clean.</li>
            <li> Way smaller than I expected!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other type of foundation application.</li>
            <li> Also I only got one egg shaped one and three of the other ones</li>
            <li> They are smaller than I expected, but still does the job!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re smaller than the other ones found in stores plus they don&#x27;t work as well&lt;</li>
            <li> They took a very long time</li>
            <li> Had to wait a very long time for the product but considering the price I wasn&#x27;t too upset about it.  </li>
            <li> The wait was very long though.</li>
            <li> They did take a VERY long time to get here, but they do ship from either China or Korea.</li>
            <li> They also are extremely difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> They even absorbs powder foundation when use dry.</li>
            <li> Wash after each use and allow to air dry.</li>
            <li> Do not place in a container or wrap in a towel when allowing the sponge to dry.</li>
            <li> Just ALWAYS wash immediately after use and use a mesh lingerie bag to hang/ air dry.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t puff up at all and are made of some plastic imitation martial.  </li>
            <li> WE got the pink ones and they are a bit smaller than we expected</li>
            <li> as soft as their expensive counterparts, don&#x27;t absorb much water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Delivery took so long, also they are really tiny not the average size makeup blender.</li>
            <li> i use this blender every single day for blending out my foundation and concealer.</li>
            <li> They came in a bit early but the size is extremely small, maybe the size of a thumb, i do not recommend buying this based on my experience.</li>
            <li> Not as big as I thought they were and don&#x27;t expand when wet like other beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t even work, and were much smaller than average</li>
            <li> When you wet them they don&#x27;t get larger like other sponges.</li>
            <li> To use you have to soak them in water and then squeeze out all the water you can, using a towel can help squeeze out the last bit of water (do not twist them to wring out water, that ruins them), and then use a foundation or concealer the</li>
            <li> I just received my sponges in the mail today, and I&#x27;m honestly surprised they&#x27;re so small.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I wanted to buy the famous beauty blender, although its very expensive.</li>
            <li> i use the for my foundation and loose powder and blush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this took forever to come like over 30 days , came unwrapped and just loose in the package.</li>
            <li> After drying, the sponges shrink down a bit, but not to their initial size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shipping took a long time!!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t even expand under water no matter how long you put it under the faucet!!</li>
            <li> They are very plush and not plasticky or hard at all!</li>
            <li> Very long to deliver but got what I expected.</li>
            <li> (I know it&#x27;s coming from a very long way, so to be expected)  </li>
            <li> I have head that there are many products that are impossible to apply with hands, so a blender or a brush must be used, but I haven&#x27;t had that</li>
            <li> Can also be used wet or dry</li>
            <li> The sponges are way to hard and very small but still can be used for concealer or clean up uses for makeup fallout.</li>
            <li> There is a slight chemical smell that could be overlooked if the product worked well enough for me, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as the really expensive makeup blenders.</li>
            <li> They work the same exact way as the expensive ones from the dept stores.</li>
            <li> but If I can get 4 of them for less then $3 at do almost the same thing, no noticeable difference I&#x27;m using them!</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick but the sponges are basically useless.</li>
            <li> Its very dry even when soaked.</li>
            <li> i liked them the only thing is that they do smell bad when you receive it!</li>
            <li> Horrible super rough and cheap not even wetting them</li>
            <li> First, This product took well over a month to arrive at my home.&lt;br /&gt;Second, They were packaged very poorly, and there were only 3 pink tear shaped sponges when there should have been 4.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I guess they last a little longer.</li>
            <li> I did expect  it to take a little longer for and international delivery though.  </li>
            <li> That 1 little teeny tiny</li>
            <li> It does have a little smell when you open the bag, but that seemed to go away.</li>
            <li> and I end up having areas that aren&#x27;t covered as well as others, even if I only use a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> They are a little smaller than what I thought they would be</li>
            <li> I thought these weRe a little bigger.</li>
            <li> but they are a little smaller</li>
            <li> After some YouTube comparison videos I&#x27;ve learned that these little guys actual stink.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but I expected for them to be a little larger than they are.</li>
            <li> I expected them to be a little bit bigger</li>
            <li> Little bit smaller than what was expected</li>
            <li> Unlike my old blender, they DON&#x27;T grow with water, which means they&#x27;re just HARD and INELASTIC.</li>
            <li> Really hard and do not get soft and blend makeup well.</li>
            <li> Not too hard or soft.  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t as bad.. good for the price at least.</li>
            <li> I thought the beauty sponges were going to be horrible because they&#x27;re knock offs, but they work great.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re crazy cheap like $6-$7.</li>
            <li> Because they are so small, it takes extra long to apply your face and they tend to smear foundation a bit too.</li>
            <li> I am back on using my real technique brushes, no more sponges!!!!!</li>
            <li> The teardrop shapes I have to say feel much harder than the gourd shapes.</li>
            <li> I expected that these sponges came in sealed for hygienic purposes.</li>
            <li> I notice absolutely no difference between these and the beautyblender.</li>
            <li> They might work but they are not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I even received them before the expected date.</li>
            <li> Not really what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I wish they expanded when wet, but I guess I get what I pay for.</li>
            <li> then I expected though.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re all pink.</li>
            <li> These are so dense and rough...</li>
            <li> and when you try to wet them, they absorb nothing.</li>
            <li> These sponges don&#x27;t expand at all when wet, which tells you a lot about the product.</li>
            <li> Came as expected.</li>
            <li> I did wet the sponge and squeezed the water out and blended.</li>
            <li> &amp; i did wet them.</li>
            <li> I just wet and use</li>
            <li> They work as expected.  </li>
            <li> Idk if I&#x27;m maybe using them too wet but to me it feels damp</li>
            <li> at I expected</li>
            <li> I should not really be complaining.</li>
            <li> and it gets harder to wash the makeup out.</li>
            <li> , I thought maybe if I just get them wet</li>
            <li> they are not fast on delivering it</li>
            <li> I received this 2 days ago and they were just as expected.</li>
            <li> Delivery was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t grow when wet .Using</li>
            <li> Took longer than expected.</li>
            <li> It did take a longer time to arrive than expected.</li>
            <li> All I had to do was wet and use.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> My blenders came in the mail well before expected.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money big regret rather stick tobrushes or 30 dollar sponges</li>
            <li> I received them before expected date.</li>
            <li> ..received in expected time</li>
            <li> These are sooo tinny werent worth it /: sorry</li>
            <li> not what i expected, i thought it would expand when wet</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and not what I expected</li>
            <li> Expected time delivery</li>
            <li> and I received products before its expected time</li>
            <li> I always use mine wet</li>
            <li> not what I expected... had to give them away</li>
            <li> You do need to get them wet before use.</li>
            <li> I tried to wet and soak them in water but nothing works.</li>
            <li> Also was delivered before expected date.</li>
            <li> Not a regret for only a few dollars, but will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I suggest that if you are really into makeup but tired of blending your makeup with your finger that you go and buy this off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as I expected it too .</li>
            <li> shipping was as expected</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t grow when you wet them</li>
            <li> product quality not as expected</li>
            <li> Not what i expected.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d spend that kinda cash on a sponge when these seem to do the job for only a few bucks.</li>
            <li> These were such a waste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> They work as expected.</li>
            <li> but I guess I expected that considering it was $4</li>
            <li> They were really dense and stiff so it was hard to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> I mean I know its a dupe from the real legit ones, but if I&#x27;m going to use them everyday and wash them often</li>
            <li> Hello thankyou for my delivery it took a bit long about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> and I really never noticed a difference other than the shape of the sponge.</li>
            <li> And they are very firm like they will last for a long while!!</li>
            <li> i got the actual colors and the size isnt too bad and there was no bad smell to them.</li>
            <li> Not worth the trouble to return such a thing, in the trash they went.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought these sponges and complained that they were super stiff and hard.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a little long</li>
            <li> These took a little long to ship</li>
            <li> Just like a any other make up blender,</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying these again if need be because I already lost two of them :/</li>
            <li> Arrived way sooner then expected date!</li>
            <li> Only downfall was the size they were too small</li>
            <li> Other than that, they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Theses do not expand when you wet them!</li>
            <li> (NO THANKS!)</li>
            <li> you can use one side for about 3 months and the other side for 3 months.</li>
            <li> but it was deliver before the due date.</li>
            <li> But looking at some of the pictures other people who wrote a review posted looked like there were some in the size that I was wanting.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I will use any other blending tool for putting on foundation</li>
            <li> just what i expected!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about ordering these.</li>
            <li> Other than that they seem to work</li>
            <li> Not sure what you would actually use the for.</li>
            <li> Extremely small, not the standard size.</li>
            <li> Does not work how I expected it to!</li>
            <li> They work like any other beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Work like any other sponge lol&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> Other than that.</li>
            <li> Maybe the seller just used other seller&#x27;s photo.</li>
            <li> Unlike a lot of other dupes out there (target, ulta)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waitin on mines to come other</li>
            <li> just as well as the expensive ones ;)&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> these are very stiff even if u wet it and doesn&#x27;t blend makeup the same.  </li>
            <li> you cant really press hard on your skin to blend it in because they are hard and not squishy like they should be for makeup.</li>
            <li> its not like the original beauty blender in black its stains and get dirty and get holes</li>
            <li> And they had a strong bad odor.</li>
            <li> So I put the pink one in the sink and washed water through it, and after a few minutes my hand was pink and the sponge was colorless.</li>
            <li> It was such a reasonable price that I was almost afraid it would fall apart.  </li>
            <li> It is common for these to grow mold especially since you do need to wet them</li>
            <li> I wet one, and it didn&#x27;t get any bigger, so that sucks.</li>
            <li> They are really hard and don&#x27;t get big when you get them wet, sucked not worth it</li>
            <li> This product is very stiff and not at all similar to a brand name beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Only bad thing about them, they aren&#x27;t as big as an actual beauty blender, just a tad bit smaller.</li>
            <li> It came in a little quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> I wet them so it can be a little softer</li>
            <li> I have a few spots on my face which typically look dry after I put on foundation</li>
            <li> I received two tear drop ones and two of the other oddly shaped sponges.</li>
            <li> I received 4 very tiny hard sponges.</li>
            <li> They are so tiny and hard.</li>
            <li> They are TINY and HARD.</li>
            <li> They are smaller, and never seem to soften up like BB&#x27;s do, they just stay hard as a rock and don&#x27;t absorb water at all.</li>
            <li> The second time I ordered them they are hard as a rock</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too spongy, hard actually and did not blend on my face too well</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t, it says the same size and a bit hard not that bouncy.</li>
            <li> The sponges I got are a bit hard but work well enough.</li>
            <li> Usually when u wet your beauty blender it usually gets a lil big</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the wait or price.</li>
            <li> Really, for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the delivery time.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few more times on seperate days to give it a chance but was disappointed every time.</li>
            <li> Only complaint was that it took well over a month to arrive...</li>
            <li> A lot of people were saying it&#x27;s not worth</li>
            <li> that would be my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Mold bb horror stories on youtube are not worth it, so protect your face</li>
            <li> Works extremely well!</li>
            <li> that I got all the same colors, and the shipping was a little too slow for me.</li>
            <li> Third thing, the sponge soak up all my foundation ( my foundation has very small particles).</li>
            <li> Due to the fact that it was just a few dollars, I just threw them in the trash.</li>
            <li> About half the size of the Beauty Blenders.</li>
            <li> Except that you get four of these for less than 1/4 the price of a beautyblender.</li>
            <li> less than 3$ hell</li>
            <li> But overall work well enough to blend out any weird textures when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> but they are about half the size of a kiwi (the fruit).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for about half a year</li>
            <li> I reccomend using these slightly damp because it soaks up much less of your makeup.</li>
            <li> Do have a slight smell</li>
            <li> Needless to say this product is well made, sturdy enough to hold up to daily use.</li>
            <li> Bought these sponges &amp; they arrived in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> is not watery because the sponge will soak up a watery foundation or a tinted moisturizer depositing less product on your face.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a very long time  and came in a ripped up small little package.</li>
            <li> I was concerned they would be stiff from other reviews</li>
            <li> I have spent twenty bucks on these in the past so to get four for less than a dollar</li>
            <li> , The only thing about these are that they come a little hard or stiff</li>
            <li> They are small and harder than the ones from Sephora.</li>
            <li> theyre small and harder to use.</li>
            <li> these are so small even when you wet</li>
            <li> I found that they left mine patchy, not a good look.</li>
            <li> the sponges are too small and they are very stiff even when you damp them so they don&#x27;t blend your makeup properly.</li>
            <li> They smell a little odd</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really small, so they&#x27;re a little tougher than I had expected.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit too hard to use dry.</li>
            <li> They smell really weird and they are pretty hard.</li>
            <li> Stiff sponges not worth even the 2 dollars.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about these because of the reviews and just how cheap they were but they definitely proved me wrong!</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed, thought that the sponge would be a lot bigger also it didn&#x27;t blend much just took off my foundation and concealer</li>
            <li> Despite all the negative reviews I decided to give these a try the 2 shaped like a tear drop are really bad , they are so stiff they cant blend makeup or apply it smoothly and do not soak in water or change in size /: but the other 2 they are not as bad they actually blend decently they don&#x27;t come close to compare to the beauty blender</li>
            <li> u can prolong washing them for a little longer, which is helpful.</li>
            <li> I tried wetting them to see if they&#x27;d grow or even get a little softer and they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> they get into every little spot on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them a little over a month</li>
            <li> Add a little water to the beauty blender</li>
            <li> so theyr are small i think am just going to buy other ones</li>
            <li> Doesnt bounce little beauty blender</li>
            <li> For the price, these little blenders are a steal.</li>
            <li> I buy these now instead of the little drugstore make up</li>
            <li> Which seemed a little unsanitary to me.</li>
            <li> Delivery took a little longer.</li>
            <li> Does not hold odors but may stain a little from liquid foundation application.</li>
            <li> Very hard and solid and not spongey at all, they soaked up the makeup rather than blend it.  </li>
            <li> Last thing, it is very hard.</li>
            <li> Beauty blenders are a little on the firm in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Honestly I&#x27;ve only used twice and they are a lil tough I may need to squeeze them soften them up a bit</li>
            <li> Too hard to blend, and not very spongy.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re hard, they don&#x27;t expand when wet</li>
            <li> i thought they will be very awful quality because they are cheap, but actually they are not!</li>
            <li> using these I waste so much concealer its crazy.</li>
            <li> Were smaller than expected, and they have this weird balloon smell to them.</li>
            <li> At my local drugstore, they cost approximately $12.00 for one sponge.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your $2</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on these.</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive ones and they are not as soft and flexible as these.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying your makeup with these, just smoothing out any harsh lines from brushes.</li>
            <li> Please dnt waste ur money, they took about 50 days to come</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money aside</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Too firm but works</li>
            <li> Almost like the Micro Beauty blender (the green one&#x27;s, for under the eye).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing away the two firm ones, and I end up throwing away the torn one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> and it wouldnt come out even with heavy duty cleaning.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t be startled if one starts to grow some green hair.</li>
            <li> Hate how they smell alot like cheap rubber or something.</li>
            <li> but still it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I received my beauty blenders a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I bought this just to have a few extras laying in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of using beauty blenders for foundation</li>
            <li> When I got this package they were in a little ziploc like bag... very odd.</li>
            <li> These however do not grow in size when you get them wet, and thus the make-up application is not nearly as good as the ones I have had previously.</li>
            <li> but I used half the amount of foundation when I used these sponges compared to others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> They perform the same as other expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Other reviews said they had a smell or were hard</li>
            <li> They were very small not like I expected</li>
            <li> Stiff to use.</li>
            <li> In addition, it&#x27;s just as stiff as the f21 one</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too stiff and they suck up all the product.</li>
            <li> They are stiff and do not absorb water well.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;They are really stiff</li>
            <li> sponges are too stiff</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not bouncy and they&#x27;re a bit to stiff</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sort of stiff and didn&#x27;t soften like the name brand beauty blender I bought.</li>
            <li> Very small took 3 weeks to get,they smell bad i houd have bought the original</li>
            <li> They are a little on the small side</li>
            <li> Had a really awful strong synthetic smell to it, had to soak it for 2 days before using it n even after that it still smell!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I can say about the sponges are that they are a lot smaller than I imagined.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package I got really sad because it&#x27;s really not what I expected.</li>
            <li> They are way more stiff and drain a insane amount of makeup.</li>
            <li> Very hard, doesn&#x27;t blend makeup well, doesn&#x27;t expand at all when wet</li>
            <li> Very hard material and doesn&#x27;t expand when wet.</li>
            <li> Very little, read measurements before you buy.</li>
            <li> They have very little give even when dampened.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had listened to all of the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> but you know, you get what you paid for :/</li>
            <li> They are too small to hold.</li>
            <li> , well this one didn&#x27;t it&#x27;s small and stayed small.</li>
            <li> Way to small for me.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it that small</li>
            <li> but they were small</li>
            <li> i recvd but these are not authentic beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I gave them 2 stars because they are so small.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be so small.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not really appropriate question for this product.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if im using it well</li>
            <li> Even though they are small</li>
            <li> You do not have to spend all that money on a Beauty blender (like i did int the past)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small and smell of plastic.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE SO SMALL</li>
            <li> They are really small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen small blenders like this.</li>
            <li> but the one I reveived was really, really small.</li>
            <li> and they are too small</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on this!</li>
            <li> But they were unbelievably small.</li>
            <li> Too small and rigid.</li>
            <li> I tossed them the second I got them because they&#x27;re useless.</li>
            <li> Water droplets, let you put on your make-up with ease, no more tugging&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually when you soak and squeeze a sponge like this it should expand.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s to small .</li>
            <li> fairly small, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of people complaining about the size too but its not even that small.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s already been a few months!</li>
            <li> but they are actually small</li>
            <li> Why spend $10+ on sponges, when you can get 4 sponges for just a few dollars!</li>
            <li> Too too small.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unbelievable</li>
            <li> However, they are extremely small.</li>
            <li> I was going to complain, but because they are small I can use it on the corner of my eyes and the sides of my nose.</li>
            <li> The sponges are small.</li>
            <li> Really small for traveling</li>
            <li> they are so small</li>
            <li> I thought they were to small and the shipping takes almost for ever</li>
            <li> No more using my fingers or a brush that will leave my foundation with streaks‚Ä¶</li>
            <li> It smells awful and it soaks up more foundation than you put on your face.</li>
            <li> It took me almost a month to get them. :/</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will definitely be ordering from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Totally beats buying the expensive beauty blender.</li>
            <li> but, they are small</li>
            <li> The are small but gets the job done</li>
            <li> they are small</li>
            <li> Really small and the material they are made of doesn&#x27;t get spongey after running it under water</li>
            <li> They are quite small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product causes irritation (question was asked when reviewing)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> excessively)..</li>
            <li> is the one with amazon prime shipping, but I am not sure anymore.</li>
            <li> they are small</li>
            <li> but I got a small face so that works.</li>
            <li> Took a few weeks to get here as well, but at least I got them.</li>
            <li> These blenders are extremely small.</li>
            <li> The quality is very poor, and the sponges are so much smaller than what I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> I noticed that two our of the four were very firm to the touch.</li>

            <li> The only thing bad is it took 2-3 weeks for me to receive them.</li>
            <li> These Beauty blenders sucked so bad they&#x27;re way smaller than they appear in the picture which isn&#x27;t mention in the post</li>

            <li> Not good</li>

            <li> They are solid and painful to use on your face.</li>
            <li> I wish I had taken a photo of the spots, but I was so disgusted I just tossed &#x27;em right away.  </li>

            <li> When I received the package, I opened it and the first thing I noticed was a smell it smelled horrible.</li>

            <li> , don;t get me wrong, just small.</li>
            <li> These felt very hard and rubbery, and wetting it didn&#x27;t make it any softer.</li>
            <li> Plus the consistency is VERY HARD.</li>
            <li> They were very hard</li>
            <li> These sponges are very hard on your face, they also do not expand when put in water.</li>
            <li> Also They Are Very Hard</li>
            <li> The product took over a month to come in and was very hard</li>
            <li> They are so small!!</li>
            <li> Probably the worst beauty purchase I&#x27;ve ever made, they went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> They make my makeup look worse.</li>
            <li> These would work for thin foundations and thin concealers</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> and the worse thing is the smell of the sponge when you apply foundation.</li>
            <li> IT JUST TAKES A LONG TIME TO SHIP :(</li>
            <li> Poor.</li>

            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> I JUST opened the package and one of these sponges is covered in glue from the poor packaging.</li>
            <li> Not  happy  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too grippy and it just made my foundation look sloppy.</li>
            <li> STUPID long shipping time.</li>
            <li> These were extremely small and disappointing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this product, bad quality, can&#x27;t put my make up with anyone.</li>
            <li> They are so hard!!</li>
            <li> Although I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so tough!</li>
            <li> Also was very disappointed to see that the tan beauty sponge was actually stained</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they suck.</li>
            <li> and they weren&#x27;t that expensive</li>
            <li> Just like the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> They did not expand at all, therefore they were useless to me.</li>
            <li> Weird?</li>
            <li> Works just like the expensive beauty blender.</li>
            <li> #fail</li>
            <li> i was skeptical to buy these.</li>
            <li> these work just as well as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> and they have a weird smell.</li>
            <li> As with a lot of things on Amazon you have to be cautious you&#x27;re not being duped into buying fake merchandise from China.</li>
            <li> You can buy sponges that are 4 times as expensive..</li>
            <li> I was hoping reviewers were wrong.</li>
            <li> And I used them around my mouth and when I ate my food later I could taste it around my lips and it was DISGUSTING.</li>
            <li> I had to throw them away because they are useless.</li>
            <li> Sorry for being so blunt but my goodness</li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> i thought that i would buy this product as a alternative to the beauty blender which is expensive</li>
            <li> sorry...  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased them.</li>
            <li> But I guess I could be using them wrong..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to say, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Is ƒ±t fake account?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get them, very poor</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> They are soooooo small its stupid.</li>
            <li> Negative  stars on this completely useless! !</li>
            <li> Ridiculous and stupid....</li>
            <li> these beauty blenders are crap, please do not order, you will be very disappointed, they are tiny and smear your makeup, please save your money by not purchasing this item</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend them they were awfully dirty when I got them they looked used</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend them they were dirty when I got them they looked used</li>
            <li> Majorly disappointing.</li>
            <li> i was rather disappointing.</li>
            <li> I had to throw one away because it was damaged and dirty.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and work just like the expensive sponges!</li>
            <li> There is no difference between the expensive sponges and these except the price!</li>
            <li> Makeup blenders (name brand ones) can be very expensive</li>
            <li> not how the sponge is supposed to be and smells bad.</li>
            <li> They do smell bad but after I use one of them I just threw it away because I think they are just disposable sponges</li>
            <li> It applies the foundation really bad</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> They literally smell so bad you cant use them on your face</li>
            <li> Bad idea.  </li>
            <li> Shipping took forever plus bad quality</li>
            <li> They came from China, so I&#x27;m not overly shocked now why they took a month to ship.</li>
            <li> Grr these smell and broke out my skin.</li>
            <li> I was in a rush this morning and used the Beauty Blender shaped one, but was really frustrated when it was not expanding when I was running it under water.</li>
            <li> Horrible way too hard!!</li>
            <li> However, sooooo disappointed.</li>
            <li> so I tried these instead and was seriously disappointed.</li>

            <li> but they are small!!!!!</li>
            <li> These were very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Although it did get here at the end, the product itself is very disappointing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not bad for what i paid . It soaks up the foundation alot but i still like it . I just ordered the beauty blender to see the comparison :) would still recommend!</li>
            <li> Mini sponges lol I love them</li>
            <li> They are really hard and don&#x27;t get big when you get them wet, sucked not worth it</li>
            <li> Thought they would be the normal size blenders but they were the minis and I&#x27;m OK with that for the price and they work well</li>
            <li> Very long to deliver but got what I expected.</li>
            <li> Im happy with my product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but I expected for them to be a little larger than they are. Also it took awhile for the package to come in.</li>
            <li> These are incredibly small, I was expecting a normal sized beauty blender, not a miniature one. They also will not hold water/ will not double in size when run under water like they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> Great quality! This is an example of how some knock off&#x27;s can be equal to the original. Tried it because they were so cheap. I&#x27;m so glad I did. Time to get my blend on!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> These little sponges work wonderfully at a REALLY fair price. At my local drugstore, they cost approximately $12.00 for one sponge. This is a pack of four for only about 16% of that price. I love them and will definitely be getting more when I need them.</li>
            <li> These sponges are fine but THEY ARE WAY SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE! probably 1/3 size of the real beauty blender. but you know, you get what you paid for :/</li>
            <li> Horrible &amp;#34;beauty sponges&amp;#34;! They don&#x27;t absorb water and when you put liquid foundation on them it just sticks on the sponge. They smell horrible as well.</li>
            <li> These were mis-leading. They are TINY! I was expecting full size products and you get like little inch big sponges. I mean they can be used under the eye- but that is about it. They are too small to hold.</li>
            <li> These little sponges are pretty amazing. The teardrop shapes I have to say feel much harder than the gourd shapes. I feel like the gourd shaped sponges are easier to blend and apply makeup with. Overall, great sponges. I will be buying this same product many times.</li>
            <li> These sponges came from HongKong, with cute packages. Been excited for several days before finally got a chance to put on my makeups. However, sooooo disappointed. Unlike my old blender, they DON&#x27;T grow with water, which means they&#x27;re just HARD and INELASTIC. Which, means that when I put on my makeups in my usual ways (gently padding with the blender), it makes me want to throw the blender away. Still, it&#x27;s very cheap. If you just use your blender like a sponge, with less padding and more wiping, you might find it good.</li>
            <li> The colors were pretty accurate but when they arrived they were all smashed into an envelope which makes me question the sanitation of the products. They are also much bigger than I&#x27;d imagined. However, they are very nice products for the cost and I like them!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re worth it for the price. Nothing compared to the beauty blender but good enough.</li>
            <li> I hated it ! I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I knew it was like this. Usually when u wet your beauty blender it usually gets a lil big , well this one didn&#x27;t it&#x27;s small and stayed small.</li>
            <li> I was nervous when I first used the first sponge (sent with 4), but after 2 or 3 times using it, my makeup was going on smooth and flawless! These are wonderful sponges and would buy/recommend them to anybody!</li>
            <li> Very good :) and came on time!</li>
            <li> These are so not &#x27;Pro&#x27; I needed a new beauty sponge so I bought this set thinking it was a good deal... Unfortunately they suck. They are hard and make up does not go on silky... Do Not Buy.</li>
            <li> I have wrote a review before but they sent me another package so I am happy that they did. So don&#x27;t get upset if you don&#x27;t get it just let them no an they will make sure you get what you ordered, that is what is good about them cuz they want there costumers happy.  I do like what I got an I would order again. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I gave  3 star review cause these are smaller then expected.  They still work but are very small. Way to small for me.  Wish they would have mentioned mini in their discription. Other wise I would have not purchased. I use them for concealer so I guess they are OK but for full application coverage don&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> Love these things they are great</li>
            <li> Very good for the price!! :)</li>
            <li> I orden this and ready past 2 months and nothing need my money back</li>
            <li> Small, but perfect for traveling light!</li>
            <li> Great product - good quality and value</li>
            <li> The shipping took a bit of time, but these babies are worth it. They work just as well as the high dollar ones you find in stores. The application was clean and streak free. The blending that they provided was perfect. The colors are bright and beautiful. I will definitely be buying this product again. The only draw back from this product is that they are hard to clean, but all of these puffy blenders are the same in that way.</li>
            <li> I expected that these sponges came in sealed for hygienic purposes. Now I am not confident using this without cleaning/washing it first</li>
            <li> I ordered these three weeks ago and just got them. I am pretty disappointed though, can&#x27;t say I blame them for a lackluster product when it was this cheap though. The sponges are TINY! I&#x27;ve used beauty blenders before and know what they should expand to when damp, these do not have any give in them. Because they are so small, it takes extra long to apply your face and they tend to smear foundation a bit too. I&#x27;ll just buy the real thing next time. It&#x27;s not worth the wait or price. Oh, and it also comes from China I&#x27;m fairly certain, so when it gives you a delivery date of five weeks out, believe it.</li>
            <li> smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> Got here pretty quickly and exactly as pictured! Got a good mix- two of each shape in two different colors.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but also super cute in fun shapes and sizes. The smallness actually helps get in the nooks and crannies better.</li>
            <li> Got mine today which is two days before it was supposed to come. I love them and I&#x27;m so excited to use them!!</li>
            <li> Product is much smaller than anticipated can&#x27;t use for much</li>
            <li> good set. the different shapes are all useful</li>
            <li> They are so hard!! Impossible to blend with!</li>
            <li> loved it, perfect size, was delivered before expected time</li>
            <li> Super affordable blending sponges!</li>
            <li> i got only 3 but its better than nothing. my first time using these and they are good size will purchase  more in the future :) i recommend!</li>
            <li> The colors weren&#x27;t the same that in the picture, but it doesn&#x27;t carel. I really love them! They are great for The makeup, the perfect size. They arrived on time!! I recommended them...</li>
            <li> Great price for the pack</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay it&#x27;s useful, it does its job</li>
            <li> These are really amazing. They&#x27;re soft, and when you get the wet they work even better. The only con is that it gets permanently stained by makeup, even after you wash it.</li>
            <li> They are great and was here on time...</li>
            <li> great products for a great price, no need to spend all that money on a beauty blender. honestly have tried them both and they do the exact same job. definitely recommend these. plus you get 4 of them. u can prolong washing them for a little longer, which is helpful.</li>
            <li> You have to wet them first but still to ruff</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I expected. Great quality...a little rough with the first use, so maybe wet it to moisten it a tad bit. packaged correctly. Before the first use, it did have a weird &amp;#34;plastic-like&amp;#34; smell, so I washed with warm water and baby soap. Other than that, this was a great buy. A lot cheaper than the sponges I bought from a makeup store.</li>
            <li> I like the quality and will recommend this product. Delivery was as offered.</li>
            <li> Love these they work really good and they weren&#x27;t that expensive</li>
            <li> Works really! Just like a any other make up blender, super easy to use and to clean great product overall. Shipping was also really fast which is also a plus!</li>
            <li> Love these for setting powder or concealer</li>
            <li> These are tiny. About half the size of the Beauty Blenders. They don&#x27;t do much good because they are so small.</li>
            <li> Did not seem flexible.Stiff to use.</li>
            <li> i waited for these sponges to come in the mail for over a month and i just recieved them. However even though it says 4 pc i only received 3. So somebody stole one of em and it was the cute blue one that i wanted the most. Figures. However the seller did send me some more after I let her know! So overall I do like them and they are super fun colors. They do help apply the makeup evenly!</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. Does blending well and the colors are really cute :)</li>
            <li> Best!!! Cheap but very good quality. In stores over here in USA one blender costs about $4.00...so...</li>
            <li> They are very dense. Use them only a few times and not very dirty. However, if you use these for foundation weekly, they will get dirty pretty fast and don&#x27;t dry quickly if you wash yours. They do come in the shapes pictures and are about the size of a golf ball.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges!!!! they get the job done!!!!</li>
            <li> So tiny.  I received 4 very tiny hard sponges. They are okay for consealers...but not full foundation. I tried wetting them to see if they&#x27;d grow or even get a little softer and they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> These sponges are quite smaller than the actual beauty blender or the f21 knock off one. In addition, it&#x27;s just as stiff as the f21 one but it still blends out your makeup evenly. You get what you pay for and I&#x27;m not complaining!</li>
            <li> I ordered these beauty blenders to apply concealer to my face. It took awhile for me to receive them in the mail, but once they came I was excited! They are little, but they&#x27;re a good size for your face. They are a great price! Really cheap! They help applying makeup to your face way easier, leaving almost an air brushed look. They blend your makeup in really good, so you aren&#x27;t left with any harsh lines or dark spots of makeup.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t quite as bright, but I don&#x27;t care. They work well when blending makeup and that is all that matters.</li>
            <li> Way smaller than I expected! But very cute and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> These beauty sponges work great and all only has a foul smell first time , so I recommend you wash in sink</li>
            <li> too smallÔºåcannot change big after soaking</li>
            <li> not how the sponge is supposed to be and smells bad.</li>
            <li> I love these! They came really fast in the mail. They are small and wash easily with out falling apart. Decent quality and you get a pack of 4 which is even better. Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Loved these. Super soft and awesome :)</li>
            <li> My wife is in love with them</li>
            <li> Just like the expensive ones. Took a while to get here but can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> Came fast! Really handy little things. Great for their price. :)</li>
            <li> It it what it is... a sponge. Of course this is NOT the ORIGINAL BEAUTY BLENDER,  but it will do the job. My suggestions, and it is probably best to place the make up on your face with your fingers to emulsify the product and then use the blender to provide a photo finish look. This way you are not losing the most of your product with the applicator. I know that may defeat the purpose, but with this tool... it might be best.</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than expected-they are mini sponges but they work well not too firm but not too soft.</li>
            <li> The perfect size and very useful.</li>
            <li> They are pretty cool for the price...</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast yes but i probably should have listened to the reviews... Hard on skin and funky smell. Good enough for a few uses and in case of emergencies.</li>
            <li> Just got mine in.. Absolutely love... And the price is even better !!!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but the quality of the sponges makes up for that</li>
            <li> Small but works great</li>
            <li> These are just alright. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I really like them! They blend just as good as a beauty blender in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I received mine today and they&#x27;re not the best thing in the world. They don&#x27;t expand in the water. The one I got from Walmart works way better than these</li>
            <li> These are great. Just the right amount of softness and resiliency. And CHEAP!</li>
            <li> Great product, I love them, great quality</li>
            <li> makes beating my face so much easier</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. It does the job</li>
            <li> Purchased for my granddaughters for Christmas.  They loved the Pro Beauty makeup blender.</li>
            <li> These things dont expand and they soak up every ounce of your makeup. UGH</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Will totally recommend.</li>
            <li> Just recieved. Took a while to get. But they seem great! Will update if after using, they aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like these at all. They were really dense and stiff so it was hard to apply my foundation. I couldn&#x27;t even get my foundation to spread evenly</li>
            <li> Great for blending last forever too!</li>
            <li> I think these are terrible. My foundation just stayed on the sponge. It did not &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34; off my skin when applying, unlike the real deal sponges. The only redeeming quality is that my nephew likes to play with them. Guess he got himself some new toys!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the smell, it was horrible. I hoped that the quality was good but it only mediocre. It does make your face smell of the sponge and I, personally, can&#x27;t deal with the smell.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it that small</li>
            <li> Loooooove came a little later but great product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your $2 these things are a joke. They will absorb your foundation, &amp; are tiny. They are no where near the size of a normal beauty blender. They also smell like chemicals. Wish I could get my money back. I&#x27;d buy myself a god damn McChicken.</li>
            <li> Once you get past the initial smell, they&#x27;re pretty good little blenders, especially if you&#x27;re in between purchasing some of more substance. They&#x27;re stiff, but work better when wet. You get what you paid for!</li>
            <li> love it easy to manage.</li>
            <li> very nice colors and quality</li>
            <li> These good enough for travel, very tiny, but I don&#x27;t like how much it absorbs product. I feel like it absorbs more product than what it leaves on your skin. I don&#x27;t like wasting my product.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this!! It works really well it made my skin look so clean almost as if it were air brushed.</li>
            <li> These took forever to arrive and when they did, they were way smaller than the photo. The material this is made out of is hard, not at all like any blender I&#x27;ve ever used. Very disappointed - will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for, based on the price i know it wasn&#x27;t going to be good the real thing.These beauty blenders are very stiff and not soft, they don&#x27;t apply or blend your foundation or concealers good. It leaves patches on your face.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re perfect! Thanks.</li>
            <li> I thought the beauty sponges were going to be horrible because they&#x27;re knock offs, but they work great. Just as good as any high end beauty sponges. I will definitely be buying these again if need be because I already lost two of them :/</li>
            <li> They worked awesome just as good even better then the more expensive brand ones</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, but inexpensive and free shipping, I guess makes it a decent buy.  Although I won&#x27;t be purchasing them again because I don&#x27;t like how dense they are. They are a lot more dense than the original beauty blender.  Because of their size if using this to apply foundation to entire face, it takes a lot longer and a lot more blending/patting/pressing motions because it covers less surface area.  If they were larger or closer to the consistency of the original Beauty Blender then I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> They are so small!! And smell like chemicals.. But I still use them. Just clean them well before using them</li>
            <li> Gotta love my new beauty blenders! Great price &amp; quality, definitely buying more!</li>
            <li> my skin looks flawless, better than any brush!</li>
            <li> Great beauty blenders, does not leave makeup cakey at all. Blends very well, I also love how cute the colors are.</li>
            <li> I like the way these apply foundation.  It goes on smoothly.  My only concern is that they are hard to clean.  the foundation soaks into the sponge and it&#x27;s hard to get out.</li>
            <li> Worth the wait on shipping. I have had the beautyblender but it was time for a replacement. Not wanting to spend an arm and a leg I decided to give these a try. I am so glad that I did! I notice absolutely no difference between these and the beautyblender. Except that you get four of these for less than 1/4 the price of a beautyblender.</li>
            <li> A little in the hard side but works fine</li>
            <li> They are small and harder than the ones from Sephora.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, there is nothing about this product that&#x27;s even useful. I have them to my kids to throw around. I don&#x27;t recommend them they were awfully dirty when I got them they looked used and I ordered them brand new .</li>
            <li> BUY THESE! Great price, if you don&#x27;t need it right away and can wait the shipping date it is SO WORTH IT! I purchase like 5 packs at a time!</li>
            <li> Apply foundation well. Glad i got them. i wash them then apply hand sanitizer to keep them fresh.</li>
            <li> I had been a cheapskate and didn&#x27;t want to pay the high prices for the brand name beauty blenders, so I opted for these instead. I had one real beauty blender given to me as a gift that wirked amazing, when you wet the sponge and wring it out for use it expanded considerably. These DO NOT. They did not expand at all, therefore they were useless to me. Not worth the trouble to return such a thing, in the trash they went.</li>
            <li> They work great and look exactly like the picture however they take a while to come</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t got this product and i bought it last month</li>
            <li> Good product for a lesser price than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> They came in a bit early but the size is extremely small, maybe the size of a thumb, i do not recommend buying this based on my experience.</li>
            <li> I love these little puffs! They help me to put on my make-up flawlessly! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Received earlier than expected. Good blenders</li>
            <li> They fit in the palm of my hand even when damp. They smell and they just don&#x27;t blend . It&#x27;s cheap. You get what you pay for . Probably the worst beauty purchase I&#x27;ve ever made, they went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> It came in earlier than expected and the colors do look like how they are shown in the picture. Applying foundation is easier for me now because i can apply it in the corners of my face alot better. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> when i saw the picture they looked like a normal size beauty blender. when i got the package, it could fit in the palm of my hand. i opened it amd it smelled like a meat locker. they are so small it is hard to hold in my hand. they do not blend nor absorb makeup.mdo not recomend these at all. if i could give it zero stars i would.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t wash off as easy with soap n water used twice only works great when first used</li>
            <li> I expected them to be a little bit bigger</li>
            <li> These sponges are very dense and user friendly.</li>
            <li> Size mini ... that&#x27;s the only problem</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I had expected and the pores are larger than my beauty blender.  I wont buy these again.</li>
            <li> Just as expected and SUPER soft!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are.perfect for applying makeup. Helps you not look like you&#x27;re wearing any</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of these. They blend flawlessly when damp and create beautiful coverage with any foundation and concealer.</li>
            <li> You get amazing colors and they work good &amp; last long</li>
            <li> It took FOREVER for me to receive them and they are much smaller then expected</li>
            <li> The picture posted makes the sponges look like regular two inch by one inch beauty blender sponges.  What I got were the same shape only half that size.  They might work but they are not what I expected.  They will blend but I will most likely end up buying a regular palm sized sponge from Wal Mart.</li>
            <li> Arrived way sooner then expected date! Blends makeup beautifully ! Definitely recommend !! I absolutely LOOOVVEEEEE these!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about these because of the reviews and just how cheap they were but they definitely proved me wrong! It came in a little quicker than I expected. I read a review saying the sponges doesn&#x27;t come back to its original shape once wet but mine did! All of them. They are really good for putting on foundation because it makes it look so natural. I haven&#x27;t tried it for contouring yet but when I so, I&#x27;ll write another review if possible. I&#x27;ve never used a beauty blender before so I can&#x27;t compare it but for the price, I can say it&#x27;s a really good deal.</li>
            <li> Thought they would be 4 regular sized beauty sponges but it is actually a mini set of 4. I still like the product though! Worked very well!</li>
            <li> I love them and it was fast delivery</li>
            <li> these are a must have for any makeup fanatic! They don&#x27;t absorb makeup and they are just the right size and price.</li>
            <li> I think the people complaining about these don&#x27;t know proper use. The first couple times you use a new one, you&#x27;ll need to use a lot more water than normal. But after those the regular water use will be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Squeeze the sponge under running water a couple time to get it plump-then squeeze out all the extra water before using.&lt;br /&gt;I love this set because it allows me to use a new sponge every couple months-better for your skin!  I&#x27;m definitely placing another order once I&#x27;m on my last one.</li>
            <li> took a while to arrive, but good</li>
            <li> These are just alright. They are quite smaller than I anticipated, and also have kind of a weird smell. They don&#x27;t really absorb water when you get them wet, but honestly you get what you pay for when it comes to a beauty blender.</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected it wasn&#x27;t expensive really good since I&#x27;m a beginner ! thank you !</li>
            <li> Does it bring all or just one?</li>
            <li> Very SMALL. I felt duped, lol, however I am happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I like them but they were small</li>
            <li> Not as spongy as I thought they would be but still gets the job done</li>
            <li> I bought these to apply my foundation with, my favorite is the egg shaped makeup sponge. I use it daily in applying my foundation. I love that it has a pointed tip to easier apply foundation around my eyes. These are a great product especially for the price, don&#x27;t pay 3 times as much for one sponge when you can get a great quality here.</li>
            <li> I loved love! Good quality!</li>
            <li> love this, it easy for me to apply my foundation. I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product with discount or free in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Beauty blenders are a little on the firm in my opinion. Not the greatest for blending, just okay.</li>
            <li> These make up blenders actually worked out just right for me. I blends products on smoothly just like the original beauty blender, and for the price and quantity I can not complain at all.</li>
            <li> Nice ones.. Though I like a regular shape one. Buy seperately if you like regular shaped ones.</li>
            <li> Great quality product &amp; fast shipping from overseas</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very cute. I will admit they do not work as well as my main beauty blender I have purchased from a store in the mall but these still work. I feel like they soak up more of my foundation than they should but I think they&#x27;ll work better once I get them broken in more. I&#x27;m glad with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Mini ones but still work good.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be bigger</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re smaller than the original blending sponges but I love them they&#x27;re perfect for hard areas to blend! Thank u! Shipping took a little long but I wasn&#x27;t in a rush to have them so it worked out but if you&#x27;re needing them ASAP then I don&#x27;t recommend u ordering them</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> Perfect other than they are much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> great price, and great traveling sizes</li>
            <li> These sponges are great for applying concealer even loose powder! Totally recommend them! The pricevu cant beat just one it costs u 4-5 bucks!</li>
            <li> does not expand when wet like a proper beauty blender. it remains the same exact size and it does not blend well at all. dont bother with this one people.</li>
            <li> they work great but they did take nearly 3 months to get here</li>
            <li> i recvd but these are not authentic beauty blender. the original is very soft and blends makeup. these are very stiff even if u wet it and doesn&#x27;t blend makeup the same.  also size is smaller than u would think</li>
            <li> Amazing sponges! They work great and for such a great price!! Absolutely love them!! Just took a while to get here but there worth it</li>
            <li> Loved the item and the price. I even received them before the expected date. Thank you!</li>
            <li> These are very well made an dense yet soft on the face. I purchased these to replace my other beauty blender and I am pleased with my choice. I was given this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. They are smaller than I had anticipated but I have grown to like their smaller frame. They feel nice in my hand and I am no longer tied down to a pricy beauty sponge which makes for healthier skin. The application of my foundation and concealer is build able and even with this blenders. I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more in the near future.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this product and loves it.  Much cheaper than the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> They perform the same as other expensive brands. They bled the first time that I washed them, but that is to be expected. They did so great that my Sister got a set for herself &amp; my young little friend that helps me sometimes with laundry &amp; house chores took my spare set. We are very impressed. And Costumer Service is great! I wish more companies would treat their clients with such respect. Thank you Leegoal!!!</li>
            <li> I know buying a lot of a product like this their is a chance you can get all 4 of the same one. Well I got 4 total but only 2 different ones. They were very small but work well when run under water.</li>
            <li> Very little, read measurements before you buy.</li>
            <li> These blenders are actually much softer and easier to blend with then some drug store brands. They are very plush and not plasticky or hard at all! The only thing bad is it took 2-3 weeks for me to receive them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these.</li>
            <li> When these blenders arrived they smelled terrible. I soaked them in water soap and vinegar for a day and still the smell lingered. I just threw them away.</li>
            <li> Product was much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Smaller than the picture appears but it does a good job</li>
            <li> Smell is horrible just wasted my money cheap and bad quality</li>
            <li> Awesome buy-- but I only got three in my pack, not four. Also, they don&#x27;t come individually wrapped-- so be sure to wash them before use.</li>
            <li> Beauty blender for the win.</li>
            <li> Works well to apply make up</li>
            <li> these sponges are just okay. they are not a dupe for the beauty blender so dont expect that.. their pretty small and good for things like concealer</li>
            <li> I love sponges and I love this one also. It handles my make up well and blends perfectly like any other high price one.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know they were minis. They don&#x27;t react with water, but they&#x27;re okay for concealer use.</li>
            <li> They work really well and their washable so I would recommend to wash them before use.</li>
            <li> They were just as pictured and came a couple days earlier than expected. Only problem was that they were not individually wrapped in the package so I felt like I had to wash them before I used them. All-in-all good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited for 3 weeks, and today they just arrived. Love them already ! They don&#x27;t feel too soft or hard, texture is just great. I mean 4 for less than 3$ hell yea I can honestly compare these to the ones at ulta</li>
            <li> The sponges work great and the prices are awesome! The only thing that I will say is: they take a while to arrive. A great tip is to use a water mist or a setting spray on the sponges so that the product will move and blend more easily. The sponges are reusable and you can clean them with makeup brush cleaner or run them under warm water and let them air dry ! Happy makeup-ing !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve realized I&#x27;m not a fan of sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know how to used them, I suppose they are fine.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would be a nice dupe for the higher end sponges and it was not. It is too dense of a material to really blend easily. You can tell high quality sponges by how much they expand once wet, and these don&#x27;t expand at all, just stay a little moist. Not what I was looking for, but I can still use them for blending out some cream products to get use for my money.</li>
            <li> Alright, I am definitely sure you makeup artists out there are familiar with the beauty blender worldly known at seohora. I cannot stress this enough, IT IS THE SAMETHING! I love it&#x27;s spongey quality and there is just no way you can&#x27;t tell the difference from the one at seohora from this one. Where did the beauty blender sponge from sephora derive from to cost so much? A sponge is a sponge and quality is key but they have the same exact results.</li>
            <li> I found that dabbing with my (clean!) fingers makes for a better texture than using these sponges on my skin. I use a cream to powder hybrid foundation.</li>
            <li> I love them!! They blend really well especially when damp. Only downfall was the size they were too small</li>
            <li> Weird? Not really what I was expecting. Can do the same with a triangle sponge - I guess they last a little longer.</li>
            <li> These are so much better to use when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> It absorbs all the foundation I applied on my face. Not a good buy.</li>
            <li> Thought it would have been bigger these are minis</li>
            <li> Ordered the product from Magetefia and COMPLETELY UNSATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The product that came was dirty.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Extreme soft.  As if they are used.  Not surprised if they were used.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Packaged very poorly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:</li>
            <li> I have used my sponges for a week and so far they are holding up and doing everything they are suppose to do. I love the way my make up goes on, much better than the regular sponges and brushes.  I didn&#x27;t think it would really make a difference but it does.  Just make sure you wet the sponge first.  Mine are not falling apart nor are the colors bleeding.  I highly recommend these sponges.</li>
            <li> Nice polish when u apply it and nice colors to</li>
            <li> there a great product just like the real thing and there small enough to carry around in your bag</li>
            <li> These are a lot smaller than I&#x27;d expected them to be (perhaps I missed the measurements in the description?). They still work, and are great for getting into nooks and crannies (e.g. between the eyes and nose). I thought they&#x27;d be a lot softer than they are-even when damp, they&#x27;re quite stiff-but again, they get the job done. They arrived on time, in perfect condition. Really, for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I took a pic to show you guys, but my phone isn&#x27;t letting me upload!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased an actual Beauty Blender before as I am unwilling to spend $20 on a sponge, but have purchased knock-offs before that I really loved. I last bought the Pueen beauty-blender knock off via Amazon and was really impressed. When it came time to replace them, I could no longer find them on Amazon so I tried these instead and was seriously disappointed. The original Beauty Blender is supposed to grow considerably in size when wet, changing it&#x27;s texture and allowing for the flawless finish it boasts. The Pueen knock-offs I bought did just that. These however do not grow in size when you get them wet, and thus the make-up application is not nearly as good as the ones I have had previously. I am giving them 2 stars simply because they were reasonably priced and arrived quickly. I would not purchase them again. I recommend looking into another brand.</li>
            <li> Works just like the expensive beauty blender.</li>
            <li> These are hard sponge material and they do not expand. I went to big lots and bought one for $3.50 and those are comparable to the Beauty Blender brand. But these aren&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll use them for some quick blending when I&#x27;m in a hurry but it takes more effort.</li>
            <li> only received 1 &amp; it says 4 pack</li>
            <li> 1/4 the size of the authentic ones  - and don&#x27;t expand at all when wet.  Wierd odor that makes me nervous to use them.</li>
            <li> These sponges are amazing!!!! I will never go back to any other type of foundation application. I will definitely be purchasing these again.</li>
            <li> Super small. Not as big as I thought they were and don&#x27;t expand when wet like other beauty blenders. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> they weren&#x27;t like a beauty blender at all. the weren&#x27;t spongy when you damped them &amp; didn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I expected to get 2 of one kind and 2 of the other kind. However, I received 4 of the water droplet shape. The beauty blenders were also a lot smaller than expected. Other than that, they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Not Assorted, But Still Works Perfectly.</li>
            <li> 2 stars bc they&#x27;re too small and leave a smell on my face like the smell of a balloon lol but they work fine just wish they were a lil bigger.</li>
            <li> did not last long :( they fell a part in like 2 months</li>
            <li> I love them sooo smooth</li>
            <li> They blend beautifully</li>
            <li> You are better off spending the extra money on a nicer one. The sponge sucked up all my fountain no matter how lightly I blotted. Does not blend well and it ends up taking off all your fountain. Shipping took a very long time  and came in a ripped up small little package. I do NOT recommend buying these. Get the real deal :-)</li>
            <li> This came from China about 2 months after I bought it.  They are rough and do not blend very well.  I used it once and threw them away.  Spend the extra money for the RealTechniques ones.</li>
            <li> good quality and price</li>
            <li> It says 4 PC and I only got one... #fail</li>
            <li> stupidest thing i ever bought</li>
            <li> Great value for sponges.</li>
            <li> wow, i had no idea how much better foundation goes on using a sponge. can&#x27;t believe it took me this long.  i&#x27;ll never apply with my fingers again. Use a sponge, better coverage, seamless blending for foundation, cover up, etc.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THESE! If you want a sponge to apply your makeup stick with the original beauty blender, That will set you back $15-$20 depending on where you buy it. Or i would HIGHLY recommend getting a &amp;#34;Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Sponge&amp;#34; In some cases people will argue that it is better than the beauty blender and the best part is, it&#x27;s a fraction of the price, I got mine at walmart for like $4 and it works great. I still believe the original beauty blender is just a tiny tiny tiny bit better but not enough for me to continue buying it at that price. The cheaper one gives you the same finish and the design is amazing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these amazing for contouring and applying foundation powders, creams, and liquid. Easy to clean. Can also be used wet or dry</li>
            <li> Love using these to apply my make up!</li>
            <li> Great sponges it just takes a while to get shipped to you but for the price it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I gave them 2 stars because they are so small. The application is good but I kept dropping it. I would not repurchase this product</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged arrived as stated</li>
            <li> These are colorful, dense sponges. They are secure to hold in my hands, unlike the little tear off wedges. The only reason I gave 4 üåüüåüüåüüåü and not 5 üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü, is because a pamphlet showing what each was good for would have been helpful to me. I&#x27;m sure each shape is for a different purpose.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical to buy these. they are surprisingly very sturdy and do a great job at applying liquid foundation. i would recommend these.</li>
            <li> They are sooo small lol</li>
            <li> They have a horrible smell like fish I end up throwing them away!!</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Why pay $30 for 1, these work just as well!</li>
            <li> Good but has a strong smell</li>
            <li> I had ordered these before and I loved them! But the second time I ordered them I got them and they were half the size of the original ones I ordered. They work a lot better with the bigger size I received from my first order.</li>
            <li> I waited a while for them. They were minis! I expected them to be the larger blenders. And they had a strong bad odor. While cleaning one of them, it broke. For the price, they&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li> This are cute and enjoy being able to get into small areas. I did expect them to be a tad larger</li>
            <li> Hoping this was a good dupe for BB....not at all. Stiff sponges not worth even the 2 dollars.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. Work great and get the job done perfectly.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really small, so they&#x27;re a little tougher than I had expected. They&#x27;re not as easy to blend with even after dampening them because they&#x27;re so small and not quite as pliable. It&#x27;s okay, but I wish I had just dished out a little more and bought the one in the store. It probably would have been easier to blend with.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be so small. They do the trick though.</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT!!! They work just the same as a $25 BEAUTY BLENDER, plus you get four of them!!!! Damp the sponge and apply your liquid makeup for amazing smoothness and soft looking skin. Wish I ordered more!!!!</li>
            <li> I actually bought these to use with clay sculpturing; they work fine for smoothing and wiping away wet materials!</li>
            <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;I even gave some to my family and they loved it too</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so in love with this beauty blender they are so easy to use</li>
            <li> They are great for makeup but it is super hard. I wet them so it can be a little softer</li>
            <li> these work just as well as the expensive ones. make sure you wet them down when you use them. thats how these things work.</li>
            <li> These are mini sized. Still very useful. They get the job done.</li>
            <li> Great for makeup application.</li>
            <li> They came sooner than I expected and they were the perfect size I wanted. They are also very soft and don&#x27;t smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> Theses do not expand when you wet them! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Nice sponges. They clean really and help to apply make evenly. I use these for bronzer and they work better than the brush I have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the size that I was I in satisfied with, it was the texture. Too hard to blend, and not very spongy. More of a plastic/ rubber feeling to them</li>
            <li> I wrote a review before but I decided to change it because i was going based off my first impression. I&#x27;ve used the purple one a couple of times and I have to say that with a couple more dollars you could definitely get a better one. It&#x27;s not terrible but it&#x27;s not the best. For example it doesn&#x27;t soak up water well and when it does the blender itself doesn&#x27;t feel any different from when I first took it out of the package. It&#x27;s very dense rather than soft and squishy.</li>
            <li> I ordered blending sponges and got really hard sponges instead. I only wanted them to spread foundation, but the feel was not soft on l to the touch. I got two of the tear drop ones and two of the blue shaped ones.. I wish they expanded when wet, but I guess I get what I pay for.</li>
            <li> they were very small and my product didnt go on well</li>
            <li> the puffs work great but they arent normal size. theyre small and harder to use. i dont think i would recommend them</li>
            <li> Love it works so well better than the 14.99 ones. Reusable and easy to wash. Blends makeup really well !</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but such is life with online shopping. Still use in a pinch but prefer a more absorbent sponge and a different texture to create an airbrush effect.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the one in stores works just as good.</li>
            <li> Works great! They don&#x27;t fall apart easily like other make-up sponges. Easy to wash &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> Very good product and can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> Work great, are a lot smaller then I expected though.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply? I guess so LOL... How long does it last? Not really appropriate question for this product. My only concern was that it came from China marked &amp;#34;Cell phone case&amp;#34; ... not sure what to make of that. Otherwise I would say product is &amp;#34;as expected&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Horrible way too hard!!</li>
            <li> Great value. gets the job done perfectly</li>
            <li> Great for contouring and blending. They are a little smaller than the ones I bought in the store, but this makes them perfect for blending smaller areas like the nose and can still be used for the temples, cheekbones and anywhere else. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, because these things are super tiny and hard as rocks. I should have just paid the money and gotten the usual beauty blender and not tried to cheap out.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Super affordable and works amazing. I love these things to death. They are trying to sell only one applicator for over 10 dollars at Target and these are even better. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> These are really nice makeup sponges. In my opinion they blend flawlessly and so worth the couple bucks you pay. Don&#x27;t waste money on the high priced sponges when these little babies do just as awesome.</li>
            <li> Comes as shown but they&#x27;re all pink. I was expecting the different colors so I was disappointed from that but they do the job.</li>
            <li> These took a little long to ship but they are a great product</li>
            <li> These are so dense and rough... they do nothing to help apply products. They feel almost like they scratch my face (NO THANKS!) and when you try to wet them, they absorb nothing. NOT a Beauty Blender dupe!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  Lovely colors and great quality</li>
            <li> Just no. They&#x27;re too stiff and they suck up all the product.</li>
            <li> They are good for the price you pay for them. But I noticed they don&#x27;t expand like a normal cosmetic sponge when soaked in water. But overall work well enough to blend out any weird textures when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> VERY hard, not useful at all.</li>
            <li> Poor quality and not very good for makeup application.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of identical sponges from a different seller and they were a fantastic dupe for the Beauty Blender. I bought this set to give to a friend and am disappointed in the quality. These sponges don&#x27;t expand at all when wet, which tells you a lot about the product. They leave streaks. They make my makeup look worse. Buy from bundlemonster instead for a great dupe. Don&#x27;t waste your time on these.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied üòÉ So so happy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I wanted to buy the famous beauty blender, although its very expensive. So i decided to purchase these and they have great foundation application, The only thing about these are that they come a little hard or stiff so you definitely need to play with them a little to make them more spongy. Maybe try using them damp. Overall these makeup blenders are great for the price</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, there is nothing about this product that&#x27;s even useful. I have them to my kids to throw around.</li>
            <li> Just like the regular beauty blender but a little better! I love the variety and the colors. Really helps to get in those tiny places. I would buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> Good until you have to wash or reuse them.</li>
            <li> Excellent product just what I needed and for the price whoo buy two thumbs up üëçüëç</li>
            <li> Great beauty blender but they are about half the size of a kiwi (the fruit). I&#x27;ve had them for about half a year and I&#x27;ve only used 2 out of the four. you can use one side for about 3 months and the other side for 3 months. Pretty good deal!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> I love these and they&#x27;re a great price. Super fast shipping and they work well.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected and they have a weird smell.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, very satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen these puffs at the store but way over priced. These are great and I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> These are ok, I thought they would be bigger. But they are very small, they work ok. Maybe if they were bigger. I would not buy again or recommend them.</li>
            <li> These are great! Only downside is they are a little bit small but what do you expect for cheap right? I would definitely buy these again!(;</li>
            <li> Not as thick as hoped for but gets the job done</li>
            <li> Took a really long time to get these after I ordered them. The sponges are great though!</li>
            <li> they all work well but the only thing is that they are a bit more dense but they still give a flawless finish with just a tad of water. Also I only got one egg shaped one and three of the other ones</li>
            <li> Fast ship but items are too small.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of these things. The smell did not go away after washing.</li>
            <li> These work great for blending! I was really happy with the product and the price! You go to Walgreens and have to pay $8 for just one!!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good for price.  But keep in mind they are  very small</li>
            <li> My second time ordering these and I still love them, very good price</li>
            <li> Arrived more than a week early but is very small and color is faded.</li>
            <li> Just received them today. Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I use powders only and this has a very smooth finish on my skin.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than I would like but still great for use</li>
            <li> So cute and will last a long time. I have only been using one and it&#x27;s perfect. I still have three more and they&#x27;ll last quite a long time. Arrived early which was amazing!</li>
            <li> Although the shipping took some time, I was very satisfied with the product. It was definitely a great deal for the price! I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I ordered these on 6/27/15 and they arrived on 7/8/15. Not bad considering they said it wouldn&#x27;t arrive until at least the 23rd of July. I just used one this morning, and although they&#x27;re a little small, they work great for me. Worth the price, especially for a four count. They came in a clear Ziploc bag, in good condition.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if im using it well but otherwise its a very sturdy product, I was expecting it to be softer. So I ordered a different kind that I saw some girls on youtube use in there tutorial. But this product is okay. The makeup washes out easy out of the sponge.</li>
            <li> Fraud! I ordered 3 sets of 4 sponges (total: 12 sponges) and only received 3 sponges.</li>
            <li> I loved them, they are small but don&#x27;t need anything bigger! And they are very firm like they will last for a long while!!</li>
            <li> The shipping took a long time!! But the product is great.</li>
            <li> While the product itself is a wonderful texture and density, I have to say that they are a lot smaller than I had expected them to be. The picture of the sponge being used makes the sponge appear larger than it really is.</li>
            <li> Even though they are small I love them they get into every little spot on my face</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t like the beauty blender, which is what I was hoping for. They still get the job done though! So they are worth the price.</li>
            <li> They work well for foundation. I gave one to my mom because she uses cream blush. It&#x27;s much easier to apply rather than rubbing it on your face. She just rolles and pats it on.</li>
            <li> They are decent sponges, The only flaw is that I wish they were a bit bigger. Other than that they are okay</li>
            <li> Really small and don&#x27;t work quite like a blender,  but for price its fine.</li>
            <li> These just soak in your foundation. I wasted so much product because it goes right into the sponge</li>
            <li> Perfect! Same as beautyblender ! I loved it ! Great price and does work the same way others sponges work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to apply the make up.</li>
            <li> As described, love it.</li>
            <li> YES! worth the buck! I mean I know its a dupe from the real legit ones, but if I&#x27;m going to use them everyday and wash them often then i&#x27;d rather invest in something cheaper that way if they do tear or become soggy then I know that the money spent was worth it. I have tried expensive ones and they are not as soft and flexible as these.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges. They blend my concealer better than any other blending method I have previously used.  I would definitely recommend this item.  The only complaint I have is the delivery time.  I think it took about a month to receive my order.  I did expect  it to take a little longer for and international delivery though.  Overall, I am pleased and would definitely order this item again.</li>
            <li> Just received these in the mail and they are sooooo tiny. I&#x27;ve ordered these before and they were a lot bigger. I&#x27;m very  disappointed with this order because had I known they were &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; I would&#x27;ve never purchased them.</li>
            <li> Love! ... these come in very handy and are just like my expensive ones that I carry! very good deal!</li>
            <li> Many of the questions asked to review the product are irrelevant. This is not a cosmetic, it is a cosmetic sponge. The product is fine for the price, but clearly not the beauty blender brand quality. For as inexpensive as they are, and if you&#x27;re willing to wait for the shipping, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great blending sponges.I can not find these anywhere but online.Very affordable,delivered two weeks earlier then expected date.Will buy again.</li>
            <li> These sponges are really small and they don&#x27;t blend pretty well, they&#x27;re are OK for the price but would not buy them again.</li>
            <li> So luv these i use the for my foundation and loose powder and blush.&lt;br /&gt; Makes ur n makeup look effortless n flawless best invention by far. Good price on them too</li>
            <li> Nice sponges...OK for price.</li>
            <li> I am in love with these blenders. You do not have to spend all that money on a Beauty blender (like i did int the past) these babies did the same as my original blender. No smell love the colors and most of worked perfect with foundation and concelars.very happy i give a 10 out of 10</li>
            <li> They are stiff and do not absorb water well. They dry easily and do not ensure proper application.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t very good quality but they still work. You get what you pay for I guess</li>
            <li> They ok. I though these would be the same as a normal beauty blender but they are significantly smalled and denser. If you are really into makeup I would suggest investing in a actual beauty blender for $20</li>
            <li> pretty nice for concealer , way smaller then I expected but still quite nice .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a great sponge. They&#x27;re small and smell of plastic. Doesn&#x27;t expand when put under water. You get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied..held no moisture</li>
            <li> If you want a good beauty blender I wouldn&#x27;t recommend very cheaply made and tore as soon as I tried to put my makeup on... I also bought two packs big mistake</li>
            <li> Not good quality at all.</li>
            <li> So awesome! Got two of each shape, purple, blue, peach, and yellow. I love them! Came a couple weeks earlier than expected. Work great, look super cute. I love them. So worth the couple bucks.</li>
            <li> The smooth makeup powder puff is just a cheaper brand of the beauty blender. I have both this one and the beauty blender and I really never noticed a difference other than the shape of the sponge.These are nice little applicators for applying foundation to make sure it goes one evevnly,I would definitely purchase more of these. These came in a pack of 4 which with the beauty blender you only get one. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE!! THEY ARE SO SMALL I CAN FIT TWO IN MY PALM!!</li>
            <li> I like this item, it came with four I gave one to my sister, daughter, friend and kept one, found it very useful  and they also liked item. If given the opportunity I would repurchase  and would also recommend this item.  I&#x27;ve washed let dry, not a bad buy at all</li>
            <li> Great price for a good item.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE! I got such a fair and great price on them and I got 4! In retail stores there like $15.00! They were great and I just love them!</li>
            <li> Pretty decent sponges, I&#x27;ve personally never used the actual beauty blender so I can&#x27;t compare it to that. I never use it damp so the fact that it doesn&#x27;t double in size when wet doesnt bother me. It works well for applying my liquid foundation but I prefer a flat top brush to the sponge method anyway.</li>
            <li> I loveit! *O* &amp;#60;3&#x27;...!</li>
            <li> They are really small</li>
            <li> great product and super cheap price</li>
            <li> These are really very efficient for application and the price is fantastic.  The quality is comparable to those purchased at a high end makeup store and the cost is so low one can discard rather than spending time in cleaning which gives you a better and more healthy applicator.  Colors are definitely bright and cheerful.</li>
            <li> i NEED MORRRREEE I LOVE THEM!!! THIS PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AND I WILL PURCHASE MORE SOON.</li>
            <li> Came as expected. Shipping took well over a month so I was disappointed with that.</li>
            <li> I got it today after waiting for like more than two weeks. I&#x27;m disappointed with these sponges. I&#x27;ve never seen small blenders like this. They are so tiny and hard. I hate the feeling when it touches my face. I rather buy bunch of free latex at CVS or walmart or I rather pay 5-15 dollars for one blender but perfect one. This isn&#x27;t worth it. I will just use them for only a week for each and throw them away. (Even though I made it wet, pshh it&#x27;s the same size.) Seriously, DO NOT BUY IT.</li>
            <li> These were very cheap and basically you get what you pay for.  I don&#x27;t know if they do any better job than the disposable sponge applicators.  You can wash these but I haven&#x27;t yet at this time.  I would like to compare these to more expensive brands and see if there is a difference in how smooth they apply makeup.  These are sent from China so would like to compare similar ones made in the U.S.A.</li>
            <li> They were smaller than expected, but I found it is actually easier to apply makeup with the smaller sponges.</li>
            <li> These are cool. I like the colors as well.</li>
            <li> These Beauty blenders sucked so bad they&#x27;re way smaller than they appear in the picture which isn&#x27;t mention in the post so you assume you&#x27;re getting 4 full sized beauty blenders but you&#x27;re not and you can&#x27;t wet them so that they expand like regular beauty blenders these beauty blenders are garbage and a waist of money yes they are cheap but I&#x27;ve bought knock off beauty blenders from Walmart and they work great so I thought these would also work great but that don&#x27;t they suck and now I still have no beauty blenders to use</li>
            <li> These beauty blenders were exactly what I was looking for and at such a great price, there&#x27;s no mistake buying this product. Love the colors, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try the blending sponge but because I didn&#x27;t know if I would like the real sponge I ordered these, and I love them! I had to soak them in water and soap and leave them over night just to get the brand new smell away. These are really soft and would definitely buy again if needed so.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for my new toys. I love them. I would so buy these bushes again . Thank you</li>
            <li> These things STINK.  I had to air them out for a loooong time before I would even attempt to try them. They do not apply foundation easily and effortlessly as they are supposed to.  I will continue using my sponges from the big box store and throw these away.  Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> Too hard and don&#x27;t blend well</li>
            <li> Very small.  That 1 little teeny tiny spongeTook forever to arrive. I ended up buying one from a beauty supply store</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I thought they would be. But it&#x27;s still a nice but at a cool price</li>
            <li> These bad boys last forever and I love them. They make it easier applying foundation and they&#x27;re very, very unique!</li>
            <li> Does what they&#x27;re supposed to</li>
            <li> These are amazing and they work just as well as one you&#x27;d buy at Sephora paying 20.00 each! As normal dip into water squeeze excess water dab onto foundation, dab lightly in the eye ducts, nose all over face, these are true to color and work as well as you&#x27;d pay 20.00 each! I strongly recommend this product and from this seller as they shipped fast coming from China. Great Product! Good bye Sephora as far as makeup sponges!</li>
            <li> The size is so tiny. When I opened the package I got really sad because it&#x27;s really not what I expected. When you watch it in the picture you figure it&#x27;s the regular size but the one I reveived was really, really small. It&#x27;s definitely not what you&#x27;ll expect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one of the sponges, does what it&#x27;s made to do. I did wet the sponge and squeezed the water out and blended. Worked well.</li>
            <li> these sponges work really well for me. they blend the foundation so good, make it look real natural in my opinion. I love them.</li>
            <li> I loooooove my blenders....they make my make-up process so much easier especially applying my primer n concealers. There soft on the face</li>
            <li> These sponges are really great. I use this to apply my concealer and it gives it a matte finish. I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see these little sponge puffs as blenders but more so as appliers for foundation and concealer. They don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; anything in but they do smooth it out. It&#x27;s a great purchase if you don&#x27;t want to use your fingers</li>
            <li> These put my foundation on so evenly and flawlessly.  Amazing.  I am getting more to give to my customers. I believe they are just as good as the high dollar ones.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a blender like this and I like it! I got different colors than the picture, but that really doesn&#x27;t matter. So far I have only used to almond shaped ones, but they work well to blend in my BB cream, much better than just my fingers. I like the point for getting under my eyes and around my nose. I have a few spots on my face which typically look dry after I put on foundation but this applies it well and I haven&#x27;t had any issues. They are great wet or dry, but they do not increase in size or change shape when wet as others have mentioned. I am fine with this - I don&#x27;t know what being larger would help anyway.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that the sponges were cheap, but you are definitely getting what you paid for. The sponges are a lot smaller than the ones you can get at Target or Ulta. Also, it took forever for the sponges to come, I almost forgot I ordered them.</li>
            <li> I did not really expect much but I thought these would be similar to the mini beauty blenders. These felt very hard and rubbery, and wetting it didn&#x27;t make it any softer. These would work for thin foundations and thin concealers but I would rather use brushes for anything thicker.</li>
            <li> IT DRAAAGGEDDD Gettin Here.</li>
            <li> Love these help your make-up hose on so good and make you look gorgeous I had to get some more...</li>
            <li> Not as soft as i thought they would be, Or absorbent, same size with or without water... but still good i guess..... Same as the ones you find at marshalls, tj-maxx etc.... At least i have.</li>
            <li> These are great! I love them and I use them all the time. These are small in size but are still perfect to use and are portable since they are tiny. I recommend anyone who applies make-up on the regular to purchase these. Such a low price for such a great product. And the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like them they dry to quickly and they are too small</li>
            <li> Love them.. Totally worth it</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, but these aren&#x27;t even worth the $3.00. Just awful. They don&#x27;t puff up at all and are made of some plastic imitation martial.  They just completely absorb your makeup,  leaving none on your face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend them they were dirty when I got them they looked used and I ordered them brand  new .</li>
            <li> I just got my beauty blenders April 8th 2015. I was really happy i got the actual colors and the size isnt too bad and there was no bad smell to them. i am dissapointed because they did not work like i thought the would at all. &amp; i did wet them. I&#x27;ll give them a few more days to see how they work! Will update soon.</li>
            <li> Loved them there just great for your contore!</li>
            <li> Love them  going to get more!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible! Never again!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately with this it&#x27;s better to go with the name beans</li>
            <li> Negative  stars on this completely useless! ! Doesn&#x27;t absorb s***  and doesn&#x27;t blend a thing</li>
            <li> Came with four! Soft &amp; i loved it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price! Make up goes on great. It leaves the make up somewhat like an airbrush finish. Especially with the mousse type of foundation. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the power foundation.</li>
            <li> For price paid it&#x27;s great quality. Although after a while &amp; extensive use expect them to begin to tear &amp; fall apart. But beats splurging on a beauty blender, I own one already &amp; this is a good alternative on the days you want to give it a break. Always a top buy on my amazon list, can never have enough of these little guys.</li>
            <li> Awesome love these. I very happy that it comes with a variety of shapes.! I just wet and use and if I am in a rush and I use them without wetting them they are still soft.</li>
            <li> Tiny tiny. But does it&#x27;s job !:)</li>
            <li> Nice application, doesn&#x27;t glide over the skin as well as actual beauty blender but I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Though they did come with a pretty gross smell that took several washes with a strong scented soap to get out.</li>
            <li> Very well. Will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Hello thankyou for my delivery it took a bit long about a week and a half. but it was deliver before the due date. For the price I think its amazing just like one I paid $10 for its very soft. Thanks again I look it use it everyday easy to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic product, honestly I prefer these to the name brand. Great price and they&#x27;ve lasted 4 months + already.</li>
            <li> I liked how soft they where only thing is thst they where so tiny but i liked it any ways because its just for the face sn the face isnt big</li>
            <li> Love these blenders, good quality at a great price. Wet them before you use them, wash them weekly, they are really a very good product. I will definitely buy them again. My only con for them would be the shipping, it takes forever so plan ahead when purchasing these.</li>
            <li> These work very well, but they do have a strong odor to them. I washed them a few times with dish soap and warm water and the smell is most gone. Can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
            <li> After several long weeks of waiting for these, I couldn&#x27;t use them to apply makeup! They were entirely too rubbery, even when I wet them. I thought the price was too good to be true...and it really was. I&#x27;m hoping I can use them for a DIY painted project.</li>
            <li> i use this blender every single day for blending out my foundation and concealer. at first the product is a little hard but after a few uses when damp it starts to get softer and more sponglike. i love this product and totally recommend this to anyone who cant afford the beautyblender.-XOAuriBeauty&lt;br /&gt;XOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> I had to wait a long time, I almost forgot I purchased this product. Although I love the very low price! The product does what it says</li>
            <li> They work as expected.  Nothing special...</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Honestly I&#x27;ve only used twice and they are a lil tough I may need to squeeze them soften them up a bit cause they feel hard. But no real complaint it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m rating it 5 stars but it&#x27;s not a beauty blender replica if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re searching for.</li>
            <li> Received them on time! Great product. Soft on skin.</li>
            <li> I have spent twenty bucks on these in the past so to get four for less than a dollar a piece seemed too good to be true. Surprisingly they arrived and I love them! As good of a quality as the ones I buy at Ulta, but for so much less! I&#x27;ve had them a little over a month and they are holding up beautifully. I will order more and appreciated how quickly they came.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to use this with my make up its make good looked good to use with my make happy I got this</li>
            <li> When I opened them there was an intense chemical smell. It took three washes to get them smelling somewhat normal. After one wash, the lighter ones began to develop strange, moldly looking spots. The spotting was near immediate when I put them in warm water. I used one of the pink ones (with no spots) on my face, but I&#x27;m not so sure I want to use it again. I wish I had taken a photo of the spots, but I was so disgusted I just tossed &#x27;em right away.  They also tear extremely easily with a gentle squeeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it two stars because yes it was a much easier blend than using my fingers, but you have to wonder if you&#x27;re getting something else on your face that you didn&#x27;t want anywhere near your skin. Skip this and by a Real Techniques dupe. It is a real company, it works (almost) as well as the Beauty Blender, and is only 8$ for a decent sized sponge that you can trust on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a professional stylist and figured it wasn&#x27;t a bad price to experiment with cheaper brand just so I could write home about it, and the results are just not good.</li>
            <li> They took a very long time but I love them. Just as I imagined. :)</li>
            <li> Idk if I&#x27;m maybe using them too wet but to me it feels damp I wring out the water and when I start to pay it absorbs most of the product on my face. For example my concealer for my contour.</li>
            <li> sponges are okay- they last a long time but get stiff if you do not clean them, color is not as vibrant as pictured.</li>
            <li> I love these..and that fact that you get for for the price..you just can&#x27;t beat it!!</li>
            <li> Size was smaller than original beauty blender but girlfriend liked them.</li>
            <li> Way too stiff to blend makeup very well</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original make up blender, but it&#x27;s fine for me. They do smell bad but after I use one of them I just threw it away because I think they are just disposable sponges and they do stain. The price do reflect the quality!</li>
            <li> They are cute, colourful and very easy to through into your makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet washed them, so will not comment on that.  But they are good for the price you pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipment took sometime.</li>
            <li> First, This product took well over a month to arrive at my home.&lt;br /&gt;Second, They were packaged very poorly, and there were only 3 pink tear shaped sponges when there should have been 4.&lt;br /&gt;Third, The sponges are hard and not supple as they should be&lt;br /&gt;Forth, The sponges do not expand when exposed to water.&lt;br /&gt;DON‚ÄôT WAST YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> I ordered these make up sponges because the flat one kept leaving streaks and couldn&#x27;t get in the crevices of my nose and eyes  They work amazing  Its a good material and they last forever&lt;br /&gt;THE ONLY DOWNFALL IS they took a long time to come in the mail  But they were worth the wait</li>
            <li> These are A M A Z I N G point blank period. üòè</li>
            <li> I purchased this and returned the one beauty sponge I fort for 15$. This whole package was less then 5$. After using it for a week I think it works the same as any sponge. The are only 2 negatives. One when you open the bag for the first time it smells rubbery. Two it did not have the one with the flat angled bottom, that&#x27;s probably partly my mistake for not looking for that option.</li>
            <li> Beauty blenders are so helpful and they make the foundation blend in v well. They are like 20$ every where else but on Amazon they are just 2$ and they work magicles !!</li>
            <li> Only received one! Not a four pack! Don&#x27;t waste your time on this!</li>
            <li> Honestly I was not impressed. They are very hard and do not do justice to the original.</li>
            <li> These are terrible. The way they are photographed they look much bigger. They are TINY and HARD. Get a real Beauty Blender. As with a lot of things on Amazon you have to be cautious you&#x27;re not being duped into buying fake merchandise from China.</li>
            <li> I usually never write a review. But I&#x27;m not a happy camper. So I ordered these sponges and it took at month to get here. Not a big deal, but when I got them they were wayyyyyy smaller than I was expecting. So I emailed they supplier and they told me that the ones I got were the only size they come in. But looking at some of the pictures other people who wrote a review posted looked like there were some in the size that I was wanting. And they have still not responded to me. So do not buy these. They aren&#x27;t big enough to do anything on you face.</li>
            <li> Not bad, work well, however they are smaller than expected. Still I would recommend them for the price.</li>
            <li> cute little sponges. makes it easy to apply foundation.</li>
            <li> Other than the long shipping time, this product is great. If you buy these in the store they will run you about $25 each. So it was a great buy and worth the wait! Blends concealer, foundation, etc evenly and with no lines or smudges.</li>
            <li> Love them.... they took forever to get here though.</li>
            <li> Mine came two light pink and two dark pink, not multicolored like the picture. Very small in size.</li>
            <li> They are small but cute! It arrived 2 weeks than estimated! I haven&#x27;t used them yet but they are exactly the same as the ones you would buy at a drug store for $13!!! This is so cheap and for a great deal!</li>
            <li> They came in perfect condition in their plastic Baggie and have different variations of &amp;#34;hardness&amp;#34; to get the kind of look you want. Very pleased. Felt just like $5 store bought sponges.</li>
            <li> Works well... The texture is a little harder compared to the real beauty blender though...they are also smaller than the real beauty blender. I think they work well for the price. Just wish the texture was similar more to the real beaut blender...</li>
            <li> There good but way smaller then at I expected</li>
            <li> Anyone who has reviewed these saying these are just like the Beauty blender or even better is obviously lying. These may look like a beauty blender sponge, but they feel nothing like it. They are way more stiff and drain a insane amount of makeup. INSANE AMOUNT. It doesn&#x27;t leave you a smooth finish and feel on your skin. Its very dry even when soaked. I mean its about $5 so what can you expect! Just wanted to warn people. Doesn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try but for me personally i would spend a little more and just get the beauty blender brand. Which is way over priced but worth it because the finish it leaves.</li>
            <li> SOOOO CUTTEE!! and they apply my foundation smoothly. Love them! I kept two and gave two to my sister.</li>
            <li> When I bought these, I was so excited to have something like the popular beauty blenders from Sephora! I loved the price, but wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the time it would take to get to me. I took about 3 weeks. When I first started using them, I thought they were basic make up sponges, but you really have to break it in for it to work better. I wash mine regularly, and they are much softer and great for foundation application!</li>
            <li> It took a while to arrive but ok. They are really small but cute nd I think they&#x27;ll work fine!! üòÄ</li>
            <li> Thought they would be bigger, but they are a good size. Took a month to get here though. But it works good!!</li>
            <li> Spong was on the hard side. Overall cheap but u get for what u pay for. If you want to go the cheap route then this would do</li>
            <li> they are not big at all. I thought they would be much bigger then they were.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time because it came from overseas. Seem to be just as good as the high-dollar name brand ones here. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase!</li>
            <li> the shipment got really really late. when i applied foundation with it, the smell was really horrible  i regret to buy it. It applies the foundation really bad and the worse thing is the smell of the sponge when you apply foundation. DO NOT BUY IT</li>
            <li> I should not really be complaining. But I was expecting it to be, I don&#x27;t know, better perhaps? It&#x27;s alright. Although I am a little disappointed. When I got them today(2-25-14) I was so excited. But they were unbelievably small. I thought maybe it expands if I soak it or maybe I just need I break them in. It didnt expand nor did it leave a flawless cover. It&#x27;s too grippy and it just made my foundation look sloppy. However I decided not to be a party pooper and make the best of it. It&#x27;s works pretty great as a nail polish remover. Buh the acetone eats it pretty fast. And it&#x27;s great for removing eyemakeup . So umm improve would be my suggestion if you purchase this. :)</li>
            <li> if you are trying to buy the beauty blender just do so these are so small even when you wet they do not expand at all not a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good middle of the line make-up sponge. I&#x27;m no fashionista but I use this to apply my BB Cream daily. It does the job beautifully for what I need.</li>
            <li> They smell a little odd but they&#x27;re awesome!</li>
            <li> At first i wasnt sure if i should have ordered these beauty blenders but once i recieved them and used them they did the job. Theyre also super affordable and i mean its four of them . Defenitely recomend them ! :)</li>
            <li> Great quality and price ,the only problem shipping took 6-8 wks</li>
            <li> Not sure the point of different shapes, but fun</li>
            <li> I expected them to be a little bit bigger, but they&#x27;re ok</li>
            <li> I expect it will be bigger..</li>
            <li> They are omay, they are a lot smaller then I thought they would be</li>
            <li> Good shape and gets into hard to reach places. Leaves makeup flawless. Fast shipping and assorted colors makes applying makeup fun.</li>
            <li> They blend so flawlessly. Better than the brushes i have! Although they so get really dirty, im still on my second 1. Very good for the price that i paid. Shipping was very quick also !</li>
            <li> I love how soft these are compared to beauty blenders. I prefer them to be more gentle.</li>
            <li> This is not the original beauty blender üíî&lt;br /&gt;They are really stiff</li>
            <li> Fabulous job the product was great the colors all match my makeup products its nothing short of what i expected and for the price phenomenal they work excelent!</li>
            <li> These seriously work amazing just need to wet them first and your foundation turns out amazing!  Wish I had these for my wedding</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one to order things online to give them a try even if the reviews are awful... I usually have good luck and don&#x27;t end up with what other people do. This time was the exact opposite. These sponges are tiny. They don&#x27;t put any makeup on your face. It all just absorbs into the sponge and stains it. However, One day I couldn&#x27;t find an eye shadow brush and I was in a hurry so I just grabbed a sponge and tried it... It works great for eye shadow but I&#x27;d rather it worked for the purpose I bought it for.</li>
            <li> Too small and rigid. Not soft like the original</li>
            <li> I got exactly what i thought i would and it is a very good quality. worth the purchase for me.</li>
            <li> these were smaller than i expected. much smaller they should have been called &amp;#34;baby sponges&amp;#34; lol. but i like them a lot. they are very easy to work with</li>
            <li> They are smaller than the regular ones</li>
            <li> You can buy sponges that are 4 times as expensive..but if you like to save money and look fabulous while doing it..then order these sponges. They are easy to use..They came in a pack of 4..One goes a long way..This product arrived way faster than estimated. I watched several &amp;#34;You tube&amp;#34; instructions for proper use. I&#x27;m a happy camper..and my makeup is so much fun to apply with the sponges.</li>
            <li> The only way these are like Beauty Blenders is the shape. They are smaller, and never seem to soften up like BB&#x27;s do, they just stay hard as a rock and don&#x27;t absorb water at all. You get what you pay for I suppose. Boo.</li>
            <li> I dislike these sponges because they absorb too much product and have a very unpleasant smell to them.  I threw them out.</li>
            <li> I love this product because iIt blends makeup really well for a flawless finish. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> They smelled funny had to wash a few times before it actually smelled good, but they do the job for concealer but they are small!!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them!!!</li>
            <li> Would recommend to my friends, works great for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t worth it. the sponges are too small and they are very stiff even when you damp them so they don&#x27;t blend your makeup properly. It actually makes all the product absorb into the sponge and not on to your face.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone looking for a professional finish in its makeup. I like it, and works very good.</li>
            <li> The sponges are way to hard and very small but still can be used for concealer or clean up uses for makeup fallout.</li>
            <li> These little things are so cute. They are very soft too and very colorful. It blends my make-up nicely and i have no problem with it. It is a little smaller than the regular sponges we see in beauty stores, but this gets the areas that the bigger sponges can&#x27;t really especially under the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: i got this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> Very small took 3 weeks to get,they smell bad i houd have bought the original</li>
            <li> Use every day! Great Quality! Great price!</li>
            <li> Nice reasonable price, my daughter loved them now I need to buy some for myself</li>
            <li> Not good these are super mini make up sponges and actually leave &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; on your face when you use them meaning they bleed I used the blue one amd I had blue streaks on my face I even washed them before I used them. Don&#x27;t buy them</li>
            <li> Smelled a little...weird... But were super affordable and soft!</li>
            <li> good for the price, the material they are made of is more dense than others I have bought from make up stores such as ulta, whether that is a good or bad thing, I think, is based on personal preference</li>
            <li> I thought these were a knock-off Beauty Blender, but they weren&#x27;t. The color is spot on (if you care about that) and they&#x27;re soft, but they don&#x27;t expand with water and they don&#x27;t bounce on your skin nicely, in my opinion. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying your makeup with these, just smoothing out any harsh lines from brushes. Plus, if you have dry skin, they don&#x27;t feel too nice being rubbed on your face. Honestly, $1 makeup sponges from the Dollar Store are much better than these considering they expand with water and you can apply and blend with them. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> These are so cute and easy to use. I&#x27;m very glad I picked them up for my daughter. WE got the pink ones and they are a bit smaller than we expected but they work great!!! It&#x27;s a very good price for what you get:)</li>
            <li> This was descent.  Worked ok for applying my makeup.  It does have a little smell when you open the bag, but that seemed to go away.</li>
            <li> Good product, great value.</li>
            <li> It was such a nice deal. But two of them were hard and not squishy at all. But still love them!</li>
            <li> Beware! These sponges aren&#x27;t the normal beauty blender size. They are super small! Plus the consistency is VERY HARD. You can&#x27;t blend anything because of how hard they are. I tossed them the second I got them because they&#x27;re useless.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It is easy to clean and use. It is great for contouring or just applying foundation. Order was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I love these! For the price this is seriously insane.</li>
            <li> I really liked the set, but it took a really long time to get them.  They are sturdy and I like the variety in the pack for different makeup uses.</li>
            <li> Its okay I guess ,they are super small though. And when wet they do not get bigger . Material is very rubbery-like . Nothing like my beauty blender .</li>
            <li> They are soooooo small its stupid. Its for my face not a miniature barbie doll.</li>
            <li> Material is very stiff, doesn&#x27;t feel smooth on skin, absorbs too much product, terrible to clean. Very disappointing! Would not recommend it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved these!  Very easy to use, and you use less makeup than putting the foundation on with your fingers.</li>
            <li> this is not the best smelling stuff</li>
            <li> These blenders are pretty cool, if only i would get better at this blending thing! :) #makeupissues</li>
            <li> I am very happy about the product.  These sponges are firm but also soft.  Great quality.  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> These are a must have for contouring.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be softer more spongy</li>
            <li> I ordered these and I only received 1 out of 4 sponges. Wth? Where are the rest?</li>
            <li> Love them just wish they came  in the set and not all 4 the same</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, very hard to clean..</li>
            <li> My daughter bought these sponges and complained that they were super stiff and hard. Not what she was expecting and would rather spend $20 for the real thing.</li>
            <li> I really love these blending sponges they really work great and I&#x27;ll be buying them again don&#x27;t think I will use any other blending tool for putting on foundation that&#x27;s how great they work.</li>
            <li> It says 4 pieces but you only receive 1</li>
            <li> Love this product. Glides well on your skin and blends well. It works a lot better than some high end blending brush.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more soon!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected. But it was okay for its price. Like they say you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> 100% eficiente y Execlente</li>
            <li> product is good. but I only received one when advertised as 4 pieces.</li>
            <li> Surprised to see that most people said they were small but even if you think so they do give four. Until i got the sponges i used brushes that left streakmarks and now these blend my makeup perfectly!! Ive  had for months now and the egg shaped ones seem to dry up quicker now but other than that extremely happy with them</li>
            <li> awesome deal for cheap!</li>
            <li> It was to be a 4 piece only got 1.</li>
            <li> theses are made out of a nastyf, stiff material that make it very hard to blend make up . youre better off buying the real deal for a more expensive price than these knockoffs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a complainer, but these were cheap for a reason. These are not sponges. People say they are hard because these are rubber. So if you want the real thing, you are going to have to shop elsewhere. You can probably use these, but they will be more damaging to your face as you want to be gentle when applying makeup so as not to cause any wrinkles, etc. Too bad. I was hoping reviewers were wrong.</li>
            <li> Good sponges, they are very small! They do their purpose but the first few times you use them they suck up a lot of makeup! After that they seem to blend well when they&#x27;re &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a re-purches. Ive ordered these before. They work great for what you pay. The last ones lasted almost a year. About 2-4months each. After a while they do starts to fall apart and it gets harder to wash the makeup out. But for the price your paying for 4 sponges I think its worth it.</li>
            <li> sponges are too stiff</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE COLORS AND PRODUCT. DEFINITELY ORDERING SOME FOR MY FRIENDS. IT JUST TAKES A LONG TIME TO SHIP :(</li>
            <li> The sponges came within 2 weeks of ordering them! They are great for liquid makeup and are good quality for the price. I suggest this to anyone  who needs something light and simple to apply makeup with. A great buy!</li>
            <li> smaller than expected and very rubbery feel</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for beginners at make up</li>
            <li> These are perfect for foundation. I also use one for lipstick to create blended ombre lips. (:</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I anticipated. But shipping was speedy.</li>
            <li> I got this product because i heard so many people rave about this and say how much they adore it and how much better it is then anything else, well its not what I expected they are pretty hard, and not very gentle on the skin yes they blend in the makeup but it takes forever. you cant really press hard on your skin to blend it in because they are hard and not squishy like they should be for makeup. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this stick with a brush.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very smooth and make my makeup feel and look so flawless! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a bunch!</li>
            <li> They were very hard I couldn&#x27;t work with them  as a makeup artist...unblendable just wack. Please dnt waste ur money, they took about 50 days to come</li>
            <li> Water droplets, let you put on your make-up with ease, no more tugging&lt;br /&gt;or pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creams and make-up glide smoothly across  your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received four water droplets in four different colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came on time and was packaged nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these on amazon.com</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. When I first got them I was soo excited thinking I would never ave to buy a beauty blender again because there was four. I opened the package and there was four but they were tiny, I thought maybe if I just get them wet they would grow and get softer. So I put the pink one in the sink and washed water through it, and after a few minutes my hand was pink and the sponge was colorless. This is an un effective product that absorbs more makeup than it applies. Do not waste your time or money on this cheap product!</li>
            <li> Love this Product and the price is great!!! It works great!!!! My wife Loved It!! Will be purchasing More of them!!!!!</li>
            <li> If I could give a zero, I would. This was not a set 4 but just 1. The only one I got was the hot pink one - and it took forever to receive. Poor.</li>
            <li> Sponge is to hard and doesnt soften up over time.</li>
            <li> these worked really good and apply my makeup flawlessly</li>
            <li> I got these in the mail and it only took about 2 weeks.. I was pretty excited for them and they blended ALRIGHT like not the best but not the worst. They&#x27;re kinda too hard and they smell. And I used them around my mouth and when I ate my food later I could taste it around my lips and it was DISGUSTING. like sooo gross. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> these really suck. They are so much smaller than what I expected and they really stink when you wet them. Usually when you soak and squeeze a sponge like this it should expand. These don&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t even blend the makeup it just makes it gross.</li>
            <li> I have used many blenders I my life and this product sucks it&#x27;s to small . It didn&#x27;t come earlier than I thought but they suck</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these. They&#x27;re really poor quality and don&#x27;t absorb water like they should. They also are extremely difficult to clean. Majorly disappointing.</li>
            <li> Rubbish. Don&#x27;t work at all. Splurge and buy the real deal. If you really must try these, be aware that shipping is super slow too! I&#x27;ve tried using all four of them and they just don&#x27;t blend... the smear foundation. I&#x27;ve tried using them with water, they don&#x27;t expand and I end up using by hands or a foundation brush to blend.</li>
            <li> This product is very stiff and not at all similar to a brand name beauty blender. It is cheap, but I was still expecting more. The sponge would not absorb water. The sponges are almost impossible to clean and cracked very quickly. I would not repurchase them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re much smaller than I expected and smelled like nasty chemicals. Glad I only paid $2.50 for them. They came from China, so I&#x27;m not overly shocked now why they took a month to ship. I ended up throwing them away.</li>
            <li> nothing like the real beauty blenders. it doesn&#x27;t absorb water or blend well.</li>
            <li> I received these sponges and since they were so cheap, my expectations weren&#x27;t very high. I&#x27;m sure they work for some people, but I just felt like they would NOT soak up water. Not like the beauty blender I bought did. Since they wouldn&#x27;t soak water, I couldn&#x27;t apply my make up with them. There is a slight chemical smell that could be overlooked if the product worked well enough for me, but it didn&#x27;t. Two stars because low price and reasonable shipping speed even if this product didn&#x27;t work for me personally</li>
            <li> it was ok not worth the hype</li>
            <li> Horrible they suck up all the foundation</li>
            <li> Good quality and a very convenient shape. It is so convenient to be able to use the same applicator for the whole face</li>
            <li> Very soft And easy to clean. It shipped quicker than stated which was wonderful because I needed them. I love the different shapes as well.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for ... I have no idea what the &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; quality sponges feel like but these get the job done and for the price I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Ive been waiting since christmas for these to come. its now a week from February. i like them a lot, but i didnt know theyd take so long to come. /:</li>
            <li> Took forever to get them, very poor</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay they apply make up better than my fingers so its not so bad they are small though</li>
            <li> I love these!! They do such a wonderful job &amp; the price is amazing!!! For sure ordering again, Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> At the beginning they feel a little hard but after washing it and using it more it starts to adjust to your face I Loove it now.!</li>
            <li> the sponges work find just have to wet them first</li>
            <li> I know these things are a little frustrating! But, I have figured out away to make this soft and amazing to use!! Check out my YouTube page at Laine Mapp [...]or click the link if it is shown. To figure out how to work with them also, Yu could win some!!! Peace and love ladies</li>
            <li> They are okay for the price, but they&#x27;re a little stiff and they don&#x27;t absorb water to make it simpler to blend, also they seem to take all the product off my face and leave none on. maybe it&#x27;s just the ones I got.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered these they were squishy like a blender sponge. The second time I ordered them they are hard as a rock and I will not purchase them again. I had to throw them away because they are useless.</li>
            <li> very soft, not sure of the material but feels like memory foam, beautiful colors, shipped pretty fast</li>
            <li> I only received one and not all four. However I did enjoy the quality of it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these expecting they are beauty blenders.  They are a basic sponge in cute colors.</li>
            <li> only used one so far, i have to wash it to know wat the quality is like. but i tink its great value</li>
            <li> When it comes to blenders for my make up, I only use sponges. Let&#x27;s face it not the highest quality but enough to do the every day job. I personally use a cream based contouring kit as a regular part of my day make up and this gets the job done just fine. They are not only cheap, but theres 4 of them, so I don&#x27;t have to reuse them on the different shades I apply on my face. I would rather save money on sponges and save it for higher end make up. :) Would definitely recommend, good enough product for a very good price.</li>
            <li> this product smells really bad whenyou use it an it doesn&#x27;t even work for good use, it dont even grow with water how it suppose to an i only use it once an it started dissolving falling apart...Dont waste your money aside they are not fast on delivering it</li>
            <li> They are smaller than I expected, but still does the job!</li>
            <li> Great price for these sponges , they get the job done</li>
            <li> So cheap and definitely worth buying, except when it came there&#x27;s a weird smell but not a problem to me</li>
            <li> They work well for the price, kinda smell funny.</li>
            <li> Grr these smell and broke out my skin. I threw them away</li>
            <li> These sponges are super tiny and hard. Its like your hitting your face with a hard sponge when applying make up. Get the beauty blender its awesome, after buying these I was not about to buy another scam sponge.</li>
            <li> These were a lot smaller than expected.. They were dramatically smaller than the original beauty blender and material was harder. Foundation did not apply seamlessly.</li>
            <li> They were very small not like I expected but hey what can you do for that price I would get four more</li>
            <li> I always read the reviews for the items I buy here. For the most part, they sounded pretty good but I honestly think that this was a mistake to buy. They were VERY small and didn&#x27;t grow as I put it under water. All these did was soak up my makeup and did nothing. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because they were very cheap so it wasn&#x27;t a huge loss.</li>
            <li> Not anything close to a beauty blender very very stiff</li>
            <li> took a bit long but like them</li>
            <li> These are so cute and work really really well. For the price and the shipping time and everything, deft worth it. If you need it asap, the shipping takes time but thats due to the international shipping which l was totally fine with. Very light weight and would recommend than buying a $20 &amp;#34;original blender&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> these beauty blenders are crap, please do not order, you will be very disappointed, they are tiny and smear your makeup, please save your money by not purchasing this item</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as the really expensive makeup blenders. They hold up really well and don&#x27;t piece apart</li>
            <li> Work so good took a while to get to me but worth the wait!! Smell a little funny but doesn&#x27;t bother you to much</li>
            <li> These are really nice beauty blenders and so much cheaper than other name brand ones, they come in a shipping bag loose with no individual packaging which is why they are so affordable. If you feel it isn&#x27;t sanitary but still want to try them out I suggest you buy them and use a bit of baby shampoo to wash them and wring them out and let them dry, although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary many of these products are of the same quality but costs are cut due to not having to pay to make and ship plastic individual boxes per sponge,thus saving us customers money.</li>
            <li> Different material then expected.</li>
            <li> I like the colors and texture they are nice to use</li>
            <li> the real beauty blender is extremely soft and airy, easy to press together and works perfect for applying foundation. because its so light weight it easily molds to the face and that is what makes it apply the flawless/airbrushed coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these beauty blenders were too hard and dense. i felt like i literally had to punch them onto my face for them to budge. i feel like they soak up the product more than they&#x27;re supposed to and i didn&#x27;t like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i guess its worth the price.</li>
            <li> When I bought these, I wasn&#x27;t into makeup as much as I am now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They blended pretty well but I always dropped them on the ground and just ended up throwing them away.</li>
            <li> Smaller and doesn&#x27;t absorb water. But it does distribute the makeup nicely. It took 2 months to get here.&lt;br /&gt;But it really does work well.&lt;br /&gt;Would order again.</li>
            <li> fairly small, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Awesome and does the job but a lil hard</li>
            <li> These are great sponges, I was just a little upset that I got all the same colors, and the shipping was a little too slow for me.</li>
            <li> Love them! 4small sponges, nice colors , &amp; fast shipping . The only reason they don&#x27;t get all stars is because I revived mines packaged in the mailing bag if it would of been packaged in a different bag besides the mailing one , that would of been great! Over all I love the sponges they blend good!</li>
            <li> Great! just what i expected!</li>
            <li> I love these beauty blenders. They work really well with giving my face a smooth airbrushed look. It will take a while to come.</li>
            <li> While they are as advertised, the blenders did not help with the application of foundation. My BB cream was completely absorbed by the blenders and only applied a small amount to my face. They&#x27;re cute, but too dense.</li>
            <li> Save yourself time and dint buy this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work better than just a regular make up sponge i was rather disappointing. don&#x27;t buy. you&#x27;ll thank me.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small but amazing. Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> These couldn&#x27;t suck any more......Sorry for being so blunt but my goodness these suckers are so dense they don&#x27;t really absorb water, they don&#x27;t get soft or even expand. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong I don&#x27;t expect &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; or even &amp;#34;real techniques&amp;#34; quality for this price but C&#x27;MON! I could get better from Forever 21. I would suggest anyone looking for a decent blender to keep on looking. I suggest real techniques orange sponge thing. They&#x27;re crazy cheap like $6-$7.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great! Only bad thing about them, they aren&#x27;t as big as an actual beauty blender, just a tad bit smaller. But for the price, they are good!</li>
            <li> Yes, they are makeup sponges. The quality is very poor, and the sponges are so much smaller than what I had anticipated. I would rather spend the extra money to have a higher quality tool, but I don&#x27;t worry about losing these on vacation or at school.</li>
            <li> This product completely exceeded my expectations. In have seen similar products for around 20$ each, this came with 4! these will change the way you blend your makeup forever!</li>
            <li> These were very disappointing.  Very hard and solid and not spongey at all, they soaked up the makeup rather than blend it.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I dont feel i got what i payed for, they&#x27;re okay sponges, but a little too small, &amp; not the right material.</li>
            <li> I ordered these the 14th of July and finally got them in the mail. I was disappointed to open the package and see 4 small sponges. I was thinking that it would be fine and tested to see if it was absorb water, they don&#x27;t. Also was very disappointed to see that the tan beauty sponge was actually stained so I had to get rid of it not even 10 minutes after i had opened the package.</li>
            <li> Sponges are way smaller than the  description leads you to believe. They don&#x27;t work very well for foundation either. Will stick with the real blenders from now on.</li>
            <li> I received this 2 days ago and they were just as expected. They were a great price but the only thing I dislike is that it soaks up all the makeup, making me apply more and more to it. Hardly any makeup goes on my face and I end up applying it with my fingers okay. It&#x27;s a great product for beginners at least.</li>
            <li> Just ok... Kinda hard.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the beauty blender. I ended up buying the real one later. These ones are hard, do not expand, and soak up a lot of product. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> They are a nice firm foam material, but still soft. Mine came with four different colors and shapes. So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it only 3 stars: It took over a month to finally receive them, and once I got them and opened the package they were not in any kind of bag or wrapping, they were just shoved in a envelope and sent out. Not the most sanitary of ways, especially if im using this on my face.</li>
            <li> Very soft and good quality! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super cheap and cute! They do tend to soak up product since they are very dense. There are no pores in these sponges like in the beauty blender (they are quite hard). Wetting them does nothing, they don&#x27;t expand at all. Nonetheless they still blend fine for the price.</li>
            <li> I had been seeing these things everywhere and decided to purchase some for myself. I don&#x27;t use them much anymore, but they are great. I love how easy they are to use, and I love how they make my makeup look so light when I soak them in water before application.</li>
            <li> I do not know if it is the material or what but these do not blend well with certain foundation brands. If the foundation is thick, it does not blend out very well and I end up having areas that aren&#x27;t covered as well as others, even if I only use a little bit at a time. It could be operator error but I have tried and tried many times to correct this issue. I mainly use the teardrop shaped ones for concealer and the other shape for my cream blush. I have also tried applying powder with these and they work great. The material is durable and easy to wash. I also liked that I was able to get 4 for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. 3 reasons.. 1. The smell they have is HORRIBLE! 2. It will leave the smell on your face. 3. Only the smell will stay on your face because it takes OFF the makeup instead of applying it.. So much for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Work really well haven&#x27;t tried a real beauty blender yet to no the difference between them.  These are so reasonable in pricing that its hard for me to see spending more and they work</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product I guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> These feel like a brick! Not even worth sending back because it would cost more to ship than the purchase price.  A complete waste of money ;-(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing like the original beauty blender. I purchased these because they were the cheaper alternative. However, they weren&#x27;t useful at all. I ended up going to buy the Beauty Blender from Sephora, anyway. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste too much money on these.</li>
            <li> These are pretty small sponges. I think they will be fine. They shipped from China and it took too long. If I would have been paying better attention. ( I forgot about the order) I would have cancelled it and just bought some locally.</li>
            <li> This was horrible, cheap s***! dont buy! spend a few more bucks on a better one!</li>
            <li> They are a little harder than the ones at professional make up stores but work just as great!</li>
            <li> Too firm but works alright</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re so small but so cute I got 4 and they&#x27;re so soft! I can&#x27;t wait to try them haha (((:</li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses this sponges to apply her highlight and contour. She says they&#x27;re easy to wash and do a great job blending the makeup.</li>
            <li> these are great just keep in mind these are mini... they are not regular sized so I gave some to my tween sister who has smaller hands and face she loves them</li>
            <li> Got them earlier then I expected which is great. I havent had an actual beauty blender so I can&#x27;t really compare, I&#x27;m not a makeup artist so just to do a simple thing like putting on makeup it works good to me. I see a lot of people complaining about the size too but its not even that small. Basically you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Only received one in the package and ordered 4. Supposed to be getting the rest but it&#x27;s already been a few months!</li>
            <li> Amazing sponges ! They work very good . I love them !</li>
            <li> they are too hard. I don&#x27;t even know how to apply make up with these</li>
            <li> Great i loved them great for blending</li>
            <li> They do exactly what I need them to do.</li>
            <li> Best value on a beauty blender that j have ever found! I received two gourd shaped and two in the oval/ egg shape..  I shared two of them with friends.. we are all happy with these! :-)</li>
            <li> THESE ARE AMAZING!!! they do a great job at applying liquid foundation. It blends so evenly.</li>
            <li> This package does take a while to get to you, only because it is coming from another country. However, the package did arrive before its estimated time :) I have never used the Beauty Blender, but these sponges seems to be an adequate dupe. The only bad thing I can say about the sponges are that they are a lot smaller than I imagined.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize they where mini sized.</li>
            <li> Very hard, doesn&#x27;t blend makeup well, doesn&#x27;t expand at all when wet</li>
            <li> These sponges are smaller than I expected, but the quality is great and so is the price! Delivery was faster than expected. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The sponges were horrible my foundation was liquid and it wouldn&#x27;t even rub in the spokes were like rubber</li>
            <li> Great product and great price!</li>
            <li> I just got them &amp; I love them! They&#x27;re very small, only over an inch tall, but it&#x27;s in the description, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting huge ones. They&#x27;re so cuuuute! Lol after immersing them in water &amp; squeezing them for almost a minute, it didn&#x27;t grow, but I heard that if you put them in warm or barely hot water for 10 minutes, they&#x27;ll soften up. So far, they&#x27;re soft &amp; seem very durable. It&#x27;s almost like it has more &amp;#34;sponginess&amp;#34; than the expensive brand. Overall, I&#x27;m very excited to have gotten them! Just make sure you wait 20-28 days for shipping. Be patient!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this product, bad quality, can&#x27;t put my make up with anyone. I had to put them in the garbage !!! I bought the beauty blender original from another seller here in amazon.com</li>
            <li> Great use for applying foundation!</li>
            <li> Smooth finish when used correctly (moisten the sponge before applying liquid or creme makup) I use these for a flawless airbrush look, comes with 4 (2 egg shape, 2curved sponges) good for the price no doubt</li>
            <li> Had to wait a very long time for the product but considering the price I wasn&#x27;t too upset about it.  The packaging wasn&#x27;t great and it was pretty beat up when it got to me.  (I know it&#x27;s coming from a very long way, so to be expected)  I had to throw one away because it was damaged and dirty.  If the packaging was better this would not happen. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the product and the price was very good.  Worth the wait and I wasn&#x27;t terribly upset about having to toss one considering the cost.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, worked as intended</li>
            <li> They arrive before the Eta however some of the blenders appeared to be used</li>
            <li> They are so cute!!! Unfortunately they aren&#x27;t nearly as good as the actual makeup sponge but it&#x27;s good enough for the price</li>
            <li> Great ,&amp;#34;OFFICIAL&amp;#34;product</li>
            <li> I expected them to come in a big size but they are actually small</li>
            <li> This give nice coverage and is easy to hold in your hand. The colors are fun too! Buy these for your make up kit!</li>
            <li> soft, good quality. Love the colors, they are just as the leader brand but way cheaper. Just awe so me!</li>
            <li> dont about others experience but its similiar to memory foam, blends like butter flawless application gives an airbrushed look to your foundation!!!i need more!!!</li>
            <li> The sponges blend the product nice it&#x27;s just that they&#x27;re so tiny. Almost like the Micro Beauty blender (the green one&#x27;s, for under the eye).</li>
            <li> Not soft doesn&#x27;t blend make up well</li>
            <li> They did take long to get here but also came way before the estimated arrival date. Awesome! They work really well for blending and there texture is awesome. Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> My daughter said they arent absorbent enough for her face makeup, which was her intended use for them. She doesnt use them and she doesnt like them.</li>
            <li> The smallest copy of the beauty blender. They are not sponge-like but are dense and hard.</li>
            <li> Hard, not what I expexcted</li>
            <li> These blenders didn&#x27;t work for me. I tried wetting them and they don&#x27;t expand at all. Then when I try to blend my makeup, even something as light as BB cream, it looks like they pick it up without blending it in. If you want a really good one, I would recommend trying to find some that expand when wet. The more they expand the softer the sponge and the more easily they blend makeup.</li>
            <li> Great Price!! These are just as awesome as the sponges that I spend $10 each! You can&#x27;t beat the price and work just like the expensive sponges! There is no difference between the expensive sponges and these except the price! I&#x27;ve been recommending these to all my friends and family! Why spend $10+ on sponges, when you can get 4 sponges for just a few dollars!</li>
            <li> Long shipping time ... Very small ... But I enjoy them ; works well for my needs</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived on time, and I an very delighted with the product. I would recommend this to my friends, in fact my daughter is planning on purchasing some of them</li>
            <li> These things are awesome! Highly recommended to everyone! They&#x27;re miracle blenders. Really great for blending eye shadow, toner, blush, etc.</li>
            <li> These make blending flawless! As a makeup artist I need something that works without breaking the budget. I am very pleased with these!</li>
            <li> Despite all the negative reviews I decided to give these a try the 2 shaped like a tear drop are really bad , they are so stiff they cant blend makeup or apply it smoothly and do not soak in water or change in size /: but the other 2 they are not as bad they actually blend decently they don&#x27;t come close to compare to the beauty blender but they are pretty good.</li>
            <li> Cute little puffs, but they leave tiny pieces on your face if you rub too hard... Not as excited about them</li>
            <li> Use them every day. Have no complaints. Still trying to figure out the advantages of using these but they do a good job.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good price for the item but disappointed in the size. They should definitely be called &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; beauty blenders. They also did not seem to expand when wet the way most beauty blenders should.</li>
            <li> these took forever to get to me plus they are way smaller then i expected they are very teeny tinny i wasnt that impressed</li>
            <li> Holds to much product</li>
            <li> I love the sponges although 2 were hard. The other two are perfect for blending concealer or foundation</li>
            <li> love these- great price and product</li>
            <li> Super hard...not sponge like at all.</li>
            <li> These sponges are super hard and super tiny only 1.5 inches long 1 inch wide. They don&#x27;t grow when wet .Using it damp absorbs most of your product when apply liquid foundation. They even absorbs powder foundation when use dry. It takes forever to rinse all the soap out of it. Do not waste your money on these sponges. I used the purple one twice and too disappointed to continue to try the rest. I am back on using my real technique brushes, no more sponges!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no professional makeup artist nor a beauty guru, I just love make up! I didn&#x27;t wanna buy the actual beauty blender because it&#x27;s too pricey so I bought these instead. It wasn&#x27;t too spongy, hard actually and did not blend on my face too well.. I guess it was alright for the 4 something dollars I paid but this will definitely not be a repurchase!</li>
            <li> Great product... Great price</li>
            <li> The are great and so affordable</li>
            <li> I LOVE these puffs! They are nearly exactly like Beauty Blender and they work great! Shipping was super fast and I&#x27;m thrilled with my puffs :)</li>
            <li> I use these every day and they are amazing</li>
            <li> Horrible super rough and cheap not even wetting them will make them easier to use. Gave these to my baby brother so he could play with them</li>
            <li> Great substitute for the expensive beauty blender.  I am more inclined to change the sponge when it becomes soiled because it does not cost $20.  I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Work great and they&#x27;re so cheap!</li>
            <li> These sponges are very hard on your face, they also do not expand when put in water. Not all that great.</li>
            <li> Soooo worth the money.  It&#x27;s like getting  them for free and high quality</li>
            <li> Just a knock off. Beauty blender brand works best.</li>
            <li> Makeup blenders (name brand ones) can be very expensive so I was happy to find these.  They are well-made.  I find that they do suck up liquid foundations, which I assumed would happen (they are basically sponges).  However, I feel like they can actually wipe your makeup off rather than blend it.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here.  Only received the dark pink and the light blue.  I received four of each.  DID NOT RECEIVE TEAR DROP SHAPED ONES AT ALL.  PICTURE SHOWS ONE OF EACH COLOR, but not clear on written description so I can&#x27;t complain too much.  Quality is pretty good.  Little bit smaller than what was expected but overall was a good purchase for the price.  It just took a long time to get here.  My 17 year old gave them five stars...I gave them three...so we settled on a four star rating overall.  Will probably purchase from buyer again.</li>
            <li> They are a little smaller than what I thought they would be but I tried the blue egg shaped one today for applying my liquid Mac foundation and I was surprised at the difference it made from just using a makeup brush. I rinsed it in warm water, squeezed it out, dotted my foundation on my face and blended it using the sponge. Good for the price too (though I haven&#x27;t used anything like the beauty blender or sponges like these before)</li>
            <li> Too too small. Can barely hold between my fingers. I am very disappointed!</li>
            <li> They are smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> Excellent little sponges! STUPID long shipping time. Took almost a month to receive this product, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed, thought that the sponge would be a lot bigger also it didn&#x27;t blend much just took off my foundation and concealer</li>
            <li> Very soft, squishy, and work well for applying foundation/cover-up. vibrant colors as well, as shown in picture.</li>
            <li> I never had receive the product. it took ENTIRELY TOO LONG!!! I had to get a refund for this product. this company sucks ass to me.... :/</li>
            <li> I loved these they work great I highly recommend them</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these. It also came in really fast so that&#x27;s a plus (:</li>
            <li> These blenders did what was intended, the only con was that they shipped slow, but was worth the wait. Great value for the cost.</li>
            <li> Crumbles after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Took longer than expected. I just ended up going and buying 2 new ones myself. Package still has not came and I had enough time to move..</li>
            <li> The beauty blenders blead alot the color wares off</li>
            <li> These beauty blenders, do the job you want them to do. But they do not last you a long time, they tear when you use them to much, and soak up all the product in then it changes into the that color even though you might wash it.</li>
            <li> These are great little blenders. I gave two to my sister and kept two for myself. I love them. They did take a long time to come in though.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a beauty blender, but I will very soon. I wasn&#x27;t about to spend 20 dollars on a simple sponge so I tried to shoot for this cheap alternative.&lt;br /&gt;When the arrived they game in a plastic bag and they didn&#x27;t have any smell. They are much smaller than expected, but they are very plush and soft. I like them because they don&#x27;t soak up a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;As for the blending I give it a 8/10. It&#x27;s not perfectly flawless, but it&#x27;s much better than the disposable sponge wedges I was buying before.</li>
            <li> I was surprised they\s didn&#x27;t suck up a bunch of make up, and they worked for evening my make up, impressed for what I payed.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the price! The sponges are soooo soft it&#x27;s unbelievable i am so happy with the product! Buy it you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Product is as describe however since these are shipping from China please allow keep in mind that it will be while for you to receive your shipment</li>
            <li> I like this product considering it comes in 4 for a cheap great price. I use it when damp and I find it works a lot better rather than having it dry. I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick but the sponges are basically useless. They BARELY expand when wet under water and still soak up most of the makeup product. You&#x27;re better off using your finger or small brushes. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Boing boing boing! I love bouncing my makeup on!</li>
            <li> Love these ! They are super easy to clean too!</li>
            <li> Love them way smaller than I expect ed but still gets the Job done</li>
            <li> Just wasn&#x27;t impressed. Will be trying the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> The sponges are a little hard but for the price they work fine and the shape does allow you to get around the eyes. It did take a longer time to arrive than expected.</li>
            <li> I had no idea these beauty blenders were mad for hobbets! They are so tiny!!! They&#x27;re still usable and I guess they&#x27;re prefect for traveling but if you&#x27;re a makeup artist, this isn&#x27;t for you. It will work fine for me because I do my own makeup.</li>
            <li> Great  blendin in very well</li>
            <li> It kind of absorbs the makeup, and theyre stiff even if constantly used. I dont really recommend them.</li>
            <li> It soaks up a lot of the make up which I didn&#x27;t like but it is great for blending.</li>
            <li> They feel soft and mine arrived smelling fine and appearing without marks. However, they are extremely small. Much smaller then the beauty blender. They don&#x27;t seem to blend as well either and some of the colors actually streak onto your skin. Took awhile to ship as well. Definitely would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not the best, they kind of absorb the product weird and distribute it unevenly. I&#x27;d rather use a makeup brush and not have streaks everywhere. Maybe they will work for someone else, though!</li>
            <li> They work wonderful just a smaller size</li>
            <li> These are good for the price. But not the best. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the more expensive type.</li>
            <li> Other reviews said they had a smell or were hard so I was a bit concerned once I ordered these but I took the chance because id rather not spend $20 for only one sponge similar to this from ulta. They arrived early, with no smell and feel very soft and squishy. They have worked well for me with several types of concealors, foundations, bb or cc creams and illuminators. Thanks so much</li>
            <li> Good price but the tear drop looking ones aren&#x27;t the greatest but the other ones work just fine</li>
            <li> Came early and were great.  Daughter loved them.</li>
            <li> Some people might not like this product for it&#x27;s density but I like it becasue it doesn&#x27;t absorb too much makeup like other sponges. My package did get lost in the mail so it too far too long to ship but other than that, this product in my opinion, is great!</li>
            <li> unbelievable price and great product!</li>
            <li> very hard almost a soft plastic, leaves makeup blotchy but 4 for the price is reasonable</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about ordering these. I wanted to get the higher end ones that they sell at the store for ten times more. I got these earlier than the predicted time and they look just like the high end ones. These do not smell funny or like chemicals. All I had to do was wet and use.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THIS BEAUTY BLENDER SET!!!!</li>
            <li> These do not do what they r supposed to do at all.</li>
            <li> The beauty blenders are really nice, their just a smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I was going to complain, but because they are small I can use it on the corner of my eyes and the sides of my nose. So, I&#x27;m satisfied. Very soft and I got all the four in the picture lol.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not bouncy and they&#x27;re a bit to stiff I didn&#x27;t like them</li>
            <li> Love them I totally recommend them</li>
            <li> I thought these weRe a little bigger. The sponges are small. I still like them</li>
            <li> Came in on time. Just what I expected. As described.</li>
            <li> I have had beauty blenders before and this is beyond mini . So tiny, but I guess as a concealer it would work nice!</li>
            <li> This product is more useful after several usages. The liquid make up is absorbed by foam until it is used several times.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t come in like a bag. like when I opened it they were just there and not put into something else.</li>
            <li> Thsee sponges are pretty small. Other than that they seem to work okay. Really wish they were bigger</li>
            <li> My blenders came in the mail well before expected. Did NOT smell at all, were NOT hard but soft like a blender should be. So worth the money! At any beauty store 1 would have cost me $30 but 4 for this price, amazing! I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> The worst ever never buying again. It was a waste of money big regret rather stick tobrushes or 30 dollar sponges</li>
            <li> i thought they will be very awful quality because they are cheap, but actually they are not! it was really a surprise to get those four little things:)</li>
            <li> They r small travel size but for the price it was a good deal excited to use and shipping was faster than expected</li>
            <li> I love these blender sponges. They work the same exact way as the expensive ones from the dept stores. Im so happy with my purchase, I have told all my friends and family about them. You get exactly whats shown in the picture. Kudos to them for making such a high quality product.</li>
            <li> these are perfect! I can&#x27;t believe i got them for such a great price! I have paid up to $16 for one! These are great quality and i will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Hard to clean, but they blend so well. My make up is applied flawlessly and smooth on my skin. Awesome!</li>
            <li> Took a while to come but I love my blenders, works better with loose powders not so much liquid foundations</li>
            <li> I absolutely like this product. Its perfect for contouring and blending concealer for a more even- flawless face.  Its also very easy to clean with a bit of olive oil and dishwash soap.</li>
            <li> Beautiful! love them! I received them before expected date. I really recommend this product</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail, and I love them! They are soft to the touch, yet firm on your face. It blended my make up perfectly! They even came a week early! So worth it! You could go to the store and one of them is almost 2 dollars. I love these little sponges!</li>
            <li> Came so quickly and they work great!</li>
            <li> I love these! I know they&#x27;re super cheap and not the real beauty blender brand but I really do love these. I was surprised how soft they were considering how cheap it is. But I was really impressed when I first opened up the package and then even more impressed when I used it to apply my makeup. It went on smoothly and everything. It doesn&#x27;t matter that these are cheap. They&#x27;re great</li>
            <li> Love these! These have made such a HUGE difference in highlighting &amp; contouring on me &amp; for my clients &amp; very easy to use &amp; easily washable!</li>
            <li> This was the worst beauty blender knockoff I&#x27;ve tried. It soaked up my foundation in an instant and left only splotches on my face. When I tried to rinse it out, it did nothing but soak up the water and bloat up. I tried a few more times on seperate days to give it a chance but was disappointed every time.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend love&#x27;s them and will be ordering more .</li>
            <li> They work as good as the 19.00 ones at the retail store. Just takes a while to get here!</li>
            <li> this took forever to come like over 30 days , came unwrapped and just loose in the package. using these I waste so much concealer its crazy. I did get those  colors and shapes.</li>
            <li> The shipping took so long, literally so long. But beside that they were well packaged and feel nice and put makeup on my face well!!</li>
            <li> just like a tinier version of the beauty blender!! i love it!!!</li>
            <li> This product really sucks. They are really hard and do not work at all. This is THE WORST sponge I have EVER used! Compared to the beauty blender it feels like a rock. Even the sponges at Forever 21 works much better than these. It is kind of painful even. I WOULD NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> love them will be ordering a lot more especially for the price :D</li>
            <li> i still uses my fingers coas it takes up too much of my productsut they nice soft and manageble</li>
            <li> I have already ordered these twice. I absolutely love this set! Very affordable,  shippng takes a little while but well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> i thought that i would buy this product as a alternative to the beauty blender which is expensive and I&#x27;m sorry top say that this disappointed me,  i even tried to wet it to see if it would apply easier and that didnt help much. i guess what did  expect for the price right (shruggs). its just too dense and it doesnt blend makeup well. sorry...  the colors are true to picture .</li>
            <li> These are NOTHING like a beauty blender. They are a hard sponge that does not expand when you place them in water. Not sure what you would actually use the for.</li>
            <li> Eh..its ok. It soaked up all of my foundation when i was trying to apply it though.. These beauty blender things really arent a big deal.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see what the big hype was to using beauty blenders on foundation and concealer. So I gave it a try. I actually think it takes away the make up rather than put it on your face because it is a sponge so is taken up your product so for me I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend using it I like using brushes better to apply my make up because I can clean it and I&#x27;m always not taking up too much make up on the brush. The sender was good as well it came from China and it was delivered earlier than that expected date.</li>
            <li> Just got these yesterday, used them for my make up today.&lt;br /&gt;Did a youtube vlog about them, you can watch it here. its overall a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;c6bWMRhlsOM</li>
            <li> Super cute! Really small for traveling</li>
            <li> are smaller than than the original but bigger than expected, still works well thank you</li>
            <li> Small but still a good buy</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here. Im happy with em thwyare small but cute. Me and my daughter love em.</li>
            <li> Took about a month to receive. Extremely small, not the standard size.</li>
            <li> Nice and cute just needed extras.....i love them so far.</li>
            <li> nice flawless. They&#x27;re not expensive and they definitely do their work. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Not a fan doesn&#x27;t blend well and falls a part when washed and makeup doesn&#x27;t come off of it</li>
            <li> Were smaller than expected, and they have this weird balloon smell to them. It gets the job done though</li>
            <li> They are a hell of alot smaller than I thought.  And you don&#x27;t get all 4 that&#x27;s depicted.</li>
            <li> These were great only thing is that i thought they were big but no they are tiny beauty blenders ,eveb thought they worked great &amp; more easier to reach on under eyes</li>
            <li> I bought the set of four Makeup Blenders, thinking it was going to be a better deal, then buying the Beauty Blender for $20 at Sephora. I was wrong. If you are thinking about buying the Beauty Blender, do it. It is worth the price. I compared the quality of the Beauty Blender, to the Pro Beauty Flawless Makeup Blender. The Beauty Blinder was always the winner. The Pro Beauty Flawless Makeup Blender took several weeks to arrive. When it did arrive, I washed them in a bowl of water. I noticed that two our of the four were very firm to the touch. When you are looking for a good Make up blender, Firmness is something you do not want. Your Makeup blender has to be soft to the touch. When I used the Pro Beauty Flawless Makeup Blender to apply makeup, I noticed that it absorbed more of the product. When I was washing it in the sink, a tare appeared. I ended up throwing away the two firm ones, and I end up throwing away the torn one. I gave the last one away. I would save your money and find another product that works better. I use the Famous Beauty Blender and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was not impress with the quality , no wonder there so cheap in price.</li>
            <li> I thought they were alot more bigger they are so small I bought this flawless from other seller and they were bigger so when I got this from my friend I thought they were to small and the shipping takes almost for ever I understand they are located in China but yeah to</li>
            <li> Just got them, they were not in a bag or anything Sealed? But benefit of the doubt they are clean, no scent of anything on them. Can&#x27;t wait to try em out</li>
            <li> Very soft great for the price</li>
            <li> I washed these in baby shampoo before using. It&#x27;s good practice anyway, but these smelled a bit &#x27;off&#x27; when they arrived. Washing removed the strange smell and some of the color from the sponges. I tested them when they were dry and was pretty happy. I reccomend using these slightly damp because it soaks up much less of your makeup.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the price on these sponges, I was very iffy about whether or not they were worth the risk, but then I thought it‚Äôs a few bucks! When they arrived, I absolutely fell in love with them. They make my makeup blend in so well! No more using my fingers or a brush that will leave my foundation with streaks‚Ä¶ Worth the money, better then the high end department store brands you can buy for $20+ ‚Ä¶</li>
            <li> It is terrible! Do not buy. It smells awful and it soaks up more foundation than you put on your face. I am better off using my hands to apply makeup than with these sponges!!!</li>
            <li> I really like these. They came right on time the blend really well. They are a little on the small side but they work fine.</li>
            <li> These are excellent. Definitely worth the purchase. They are soft and durable. Do have a slight smell but once you wash them, it goes away.</li>
            <li> Very nice sponges. They make your makeup look polished and picture ready.</li>
            <li> These blenders aren&#x27;t quite like the glamour sponge, but the price relfects that. Still, they&#x27;re really great little blenders. They don&#x27;t grow with water like higher priced beauty blenders and they don&#x27;t seem quite as durable. They also stain. I&#x27;ve used both designs and flaws aside, they really are great. If you&#x27;re wanting to try a blender, I definitely recommend these. Such a fantastic deal for 4 of them. I don&#x27;t recommend buying from this seller. It took me almost a month to get them. :/</li>
            <li> not that impressive these Blenders. I was trying to get a good deal and these are so cheap they don&#x27;t absorb any water but work really well dry some of them are so hard you can&#x27;t even squeeze them.in my opinion go to Marshalls and spend $5 on a generic blender</li>
            <li> I needed some new beauty blenders and I had a little extra money left to spend, so I ordered these little guys! They came early in the mail and are in excellent condition. Extremely soft and durable! The colors are vibrant and they are the perfect sizes. I actually like them better than my expensive ones! Needless to say, I will definitely be ordering from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S- If you do order them, don&#x27;t forget to dampen them before putting on makeup with them. It makes all beauty blenders work better, and it makes the blenders a bit bigger, trust me. Also, don&#x27;t forget to wash them regularly. Use a little bit of olive oil and a little bit of dish soap in your hand and all the makeup will come right out!</li>
            <li> They literally smell so bad you cant use them on your face and they break apart after washing them it was horrible ! I just went ahead and spent the extra money and got a beauty blender they work way better !</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried beauty blender before DO NOT TRY THESE! They suck!!! the foundation gets suck and doesn&#x27;t apply on to your skin smoothly. Its suppose to glide and coat your face smoothly. THESE DO NOT DO THAT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> They were more tiny then I imagined but work just as great. Totally beats buying the expensive beauty blender. Great price.</li>
            <li> They worked pretty well, not my favorite beauty tool. Very good quality bending sponge, if you like the beauty blending sponges these are worth getting.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I expected I love them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite a hard sponge, it doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference when you put water on it, but it still does a great job of putting on make up and for the price you get quite a deal. The size is good too, they&#x27;re also considerable large, I was expecting them to be very small but that is not the case. This is probably the best value for these type of sponge, their only &amp;#34;flaw&amp;#34; being they remain hard despite adding water, but it does not make a very big difference. You still get a great finish.</li>
            <li> Good investment it helps apply my foundation ;)</li>
            <li> They blend well but, they are small</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sort of stiff and didn&#x27;t soften like the name brand beauty blender I bought.</li>
            <li> Great love them. Great buy</li>
            <li> I love these! Came faster than expecting and blends makeup great. Awesome price too!</li>
            <li> Love the item, but it took over 2 months to get to me, as the first was lost in the mail.</li>
            <li> Small and very dense but you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Works just as well as the other expensive $8-$20 beauty blenders. Washing is simple. Use is simple. The only thing to worry about is after the second or third wash is that is seems to shed a bit...that could also be from hard use. But all in all, very good.</li>
            <li> I was concerned they would be stiff from other reviews but they were perfectly soft. I have not tried the more expensive brands but I feel like it couldn&#x27;t get much better than this. Great blenders and shapes.</li>
            <li> They blend beautifully!</li>
            <li> There smaller then I thought. But vary soft and the smell isn&#x27;t as bad as people say</li>
            <li> Amazing I love this I recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> These are okay. They blend, but they are no Beauty Blender. Buy them if you need sponges, but don&#x27;t buy it if you&#x27;re looking for a beauty blender Dupes.</li>
            <li> These little sponges are cute but they&#x27;re really hard. I have a Beauty Blender but wanted some extra sponges for makeup application. These were cheap and cute so I bought them. They are NOT like the Beauty Blender. They have very little give even when dampened. I wanted to love them because they&#x27;re do darn cute but I can&#x27;t figure out what to use them for since they don&#x27;t blend well. I am experimenting with them and trying them with different products, dry and damp, to see if they will work for me but I go right back to either wedges or the BB for soft,,pliable applicators. Maybe they will soften up in time and work better for blending. For now though, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these as a Beauty Blender type product. I don&#x27;t know WHAT I would recommend them for to be honest.</li>
            <li> Wish I had ordered these a long time ago. Perfect for the smaller hard to reach place AND the bigger areas, all in one little sponge that takes up a very small amount of real estate (very important when you have lots of makeup).&lt;br /&gt;Love these! Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than what i though but thats on me one of them smelled funny but once i washed them they worked fine .You get what you pay</li>
            <li> Love using them to blend in my contour!</li>
            <li> Great tool for using when applying make up.  Came in good condition.</li>
            <li> I love them, easy to use and blend everything perfectly.</li>
            <li> They are very har, and they do not come in the box</li>
            <li> The are small but gets the job done</li>
            <li> Great sponges, great prices. I&#x27;ll buy it again!!</li>
            <li> Idk if im allergic to the material its made from but my face was breaking out  &amp; my eyes were swollen.... All while I was using the blender , but hey if it works for your skin go ahead .. it didnt for mine.</li>
            <li> good price and the product coming earlier</li>
            <li> I used to smooth out my clay projects. Works great.</li>
            <li> Love these! Glad i didn&#x27;t pay $50 at sephora or somewhere else. Amazing price for an amazing quality sponge.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a big Make-up project (Halloween) and they worked great! I also found a tutorial on how to clean them with dish-soap and olive oil. They still look brand new after clean and continue to blend perfectly.</li>
            <li> There a little small but there great</li>
            <li> Had a really awful strong synthetic smell to it, had to soak it for 2 days before using it n even after that it still smell! Never will I purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Has a really strong odor. I can&#x27;t really wash it out but, it still does the job</li>
            <li> I love these sponges they make your makeup extra smooth and blended when you use em wet. I love the colors and they&#x27;re great for travel size especially cause they came with more than one</li>
            <li> Just what I need it thank you they work good...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only using two of this and gave the other ones away to my friend she absolutely loves them and so do I. :)</li>
            <li> small in size compared to the real beauty blender (which ive never owned). but satisfied. it really helps make your foundation have a smooth finish. LOVE</li>
            <li> I got them today, it takes a long time because its from china, but they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> Great deal.  Add a little water to the beauty blender and you really save on product, and it goes on smoother.  I love these.  Best deal I have found so far.</li>
            <li> Smaller then expected but really loved them ! Arrived on time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay if u don&#x27;t have make up brushes or for really real beginners in makeup. I didn&#x27;t really enjoy it but my little sisters likes them but doesn&#x27;t love them. Sucks up the foundation way to much in my opinion.</li>
            <li> great purchase would buy again</li>
            <li> They are smaller than I thought and smell like rubber. They leave a lingering rubber smell on your face. Plus, they took a month to receive.</li>
            <li> Serves d purpode well...Worth d money. ..received in expected time</li>
            <li> All these do is soak up your makeup. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> these are the perfect size for a good hold on them to apply makeup. the colors are cute, no bad odor, easy to use, cheap, i&#x27;m a happy customer!</li>
            <li> These are great for blending in both foundation and concealer.</li>
            <li> Tmit took a month to get here they are small so you get what you paid for . so theyr are small i think am just going to buy other ones even tho if am going to waist more but they are going to be better</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the price for these 4 sponges!  I ordered several sets and gave them as gifts.  As a makeup artist, I go through sponges constantly - and I didn&#x27;t notice any change in quality from these to other more expensive versions, other than the plastic smell when first opened, but soap and water got it out.  If you use a sponge constantly, going for this economical version is a great option to save $</li>
            <li> If your new to beauty blenders then this is perfect. But you have to wait a month for receive them. And they do not grow that much but they do a very damn good job blending makeup and concealer.</li>
            <li> These actually work really well at blending &amp; highlighting makeup.</li>
            <li> Its hard to clean.. but make up went on smooth... it wasn&#x27;t as bad.. good for the price at least.</li>
            <li> excellent make up blender ,great dupe for the beauty blender that are way more expensive at other make up stores</li>
            <li> My beauty blenders just came in and I love them! They&#x27;re nice, clean and easy to use. Thank you :))</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret the purchase because the 4pc set was only $3.50 and the shape is very ergonomic for reaching nooks and crannies. The quality of the sponges, however, is incomparable to that of the original beauty blender. I have found that concealer does not wash out as it does with my beauty blender, and the sponges hold too much moisture when damp (the beauty blender sponges are meant to be used damp). I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to a friend; you could just hit your local drug store and pick up a 20 pack of disposable wedge sponges and save yourself waiting the 3 weeks for shipping because it&#x27;s coming from china.</li>
            <li> Came in like a.little ziplock bag but for the price what do you expect ovrr all I love them they are a steal</li>
            <li> I gave these as a gift. She loves them. Should have ordered more as the time that I ordered these!</li>
            <li> I find these pretty decent for blending out concealer, but oh lord don&#x27;t even think of using these with your foundation! I found that they left mine patchy, not a good look. I&#x27;ve learnt to only use them for concealer, and use my original beauty blender for my foundation. Style Wurks makes a much better knock off for a couple more bucks, as does Real Techniques.</li>
            <li> These are sooo tinny werent worth it /: sorry</li>
            <li> When I got my beauty blenders I was surprised to see they were mini ones. They work well for me however and for the price was really nice.</li>
            <li> To firm I thought they would be soft like my beauty blender</li>
            <li> I was trying to save money and purchased this.  Bad idea.  All of the sponges are hard and nothing like the beauty blender that I have.  It&#x27;s just a regular sponge they shaped to look like the beauty blender.  It doesn&#x27;t work well at all. I&#x27;m going to throw them all away and buy the real thing I guess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist. As an artist I can not use cheap stuff on my clients faces.This product is horrible. When I received the package, I opened it and the first thing I noticed was a smell it smelled horrible. Second, one of them was damaged and had a stain on it. It was toxic I threw it away immediately. Don&#x27;t waste your money it&#x27;s not like the original beauty blender. Oh and they don&#x27;t even want to credit my money I still have not heard from them. Horrible :(</li>
            <li> not what i expected, i thought it would expand when wet but it doesn&#x27;t, it says the same size and a bit hard not that bouncy. but its still workable. very small in my opinion</li>
            <li> nice and good quality</li>
            <li> Good but can find same product and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it for applying BB cream and it works very well for me!</li>
            <li> Love em and received them much quicker than I thought!</li>
            <li> Horrible! Does not work how I expected it to! It&#x27;s not even soft it&#x27;s so tough!</li>
            <li> It took over a month to come but product was worth it, especially for the price</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel like the authentic beauty blenders. Thought it was a good deal for 4 of them, instead of one for the same price. They work well though, but are really hard to clean. Had to throw two away because they got stained with eyeliner and it wouldnt come out even with heavy duty cleaning. Maybe I&#x27;m better off just buying the original beauty blenders :) These were nice to try though x</li>
            <li> Really small and the material they are made of doesn&#x27;t get spongey after running it under water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and not what I expected</li>
            <li> I will never do my makeup without these after trying them&lt;br /&gt;i made an amazing airbrushed finish with these sponges&lt;br /&gt;they are very soft and clean so well!</li>
            <li> These sponges do the exact same this as the beauty blender. They blend really well for the price. The only cons are that they u have to soak them in water because it absorbs really quick and that they are pretty small. Shipping took forever. It took about 2-3 weeks for it to get here.</li>
            <li> The makeup blender looks just like the photo as advertised. It comes with 4 assorted colors/shapes. I use it to apply makeup on my neck as I figured it didn&#x27;t do much coverage as I wanted it to do. It did light coverage only which made me stick to my concealer brush to blend foundation on my face. Overall, if you are looking for light coverage blending sponges, this may work for you. However, if you are looking to get more coverage, I don&#x27;t suggest this.</li>
            <li> They feel amazing! Super soft and they work pretty well considering the price. Making blending incredibly easy. The colors are random but it honestly doesn&#x27;t matter because they&#x27;ll get covered in the product anyway.</li>
            <li> Doesnt bounce little beauty blender</li>
            <li> They work pretty good but they have a strong smell of latex That&#x27;s very annoying.</li>
            <li> These arrived surprisingly fast, it still says here on Amazon that &amp;#34;it&#x27;s on its way. Expected time delivery May 20th&amp;#34; but.. They&#x27;re here already.&lt;br /&gt;Very soft, cute little sponges. Worth it</li>
            <li> I Really Like This Dupe Beauty Blenders. My favorite ones are the tear drop shape blenders. They help blend out my make up and make it look flawless.</li>
            <li> Love the various shapes as a bonus next to a more affordable price, same product than &amp;#34;branded&amp;#34; items with nothing extra.</li>
            <li> For the price, these little blenders are a steal. They aren&#x27;t as soft, and don&#x27;t absorb as much as the more expensive beauty blenders, buy they defiantly get the job done. I buy these now instead of the little drugstore make up sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;+Price is great, but you do get what you pay for&lt;br /&gt;+Provide a nice finish when used to apply foundation, or in my case BB cream&lt;br /&gt;+You get multiples, different shapes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-Shipping time is slow&lt;br /&gt;-In my opinion they absorb a lot of product&lt;br /&gt;-Aren&#x27;t as soft as their expensive counterparts, don&#x27;t absorb much water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like these. I can&#x27;t bring myself to pay $30 for a sponge, so I&#x27;ve settled with these. I&#x27;m willing to accept the cons for the price break. I&#x27;ve also given these as gifts in little makeup bags for people I&#x27;ve done exchanges with, and they all said they found a good use for them.</li>
            <li> They are the best it was more that what u expect works good totally recommend and good pricing for all three</li>
            <li> I just recive my product really love them. They blend very well when I applie my make up. I really recommend this product, as well as offordable.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product.  It was such a reasonable price that I was almost afraid it would fall apart.  Needless to say this product is well made, sturdy enough to hold up to daily use.</li>
            <li> Good price, good blenders.  Enough sponges that I could give two to my niece and she uses them every day too.</li>
            <li> this product is awesome would recommend it to any and every one, this applies foundation etc perfectly. good buy. and I received products before its expected time</li>
            <li> Very affordable and easy to use! It does come in handy to have more than once at least you&#x27;ll know you will not have to order for a while!</li>
            <li> I love this beauty blenders. They do an amazing job. Bought this to help with my contouring and they worked great!</li>
            <li> its not like the original beauty blender in black its stains and get dirty and get holes but i paid cheap for it so i cant have like great great quality</li>
            <li> I love these! I always restock.</li>
            <li> They work like any other beauty blender. I just wish the shipping wouldn&#x27;t have taken so long. Overall if you want a more inexpensive beauty blender option this is a good choice. Just make sure you don&#x27;t need them right away.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit too hard to use dry. I always use mine wet and I love the results I get, it looks much better than when I apply it with a brush or my fingers.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the real thing.  They soak up all your makeup.  They are very firm and do not soften up.</li>
            <li> They were smaller than expected, but since i need them for concealer, they worked perfectly. They are a little bit stiffer than a normal beauty blender, but i don&#x27;t mind at all. I actually quite prefer it. I reallt love these and I highly reccomend. Once i use these ones (which seems like they will last a while) I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> these are applicators...so I am not applying them...but I use one every day for my eye make up.</li>
            <li> easy to hold. blends well</li>
            <li> Got the mini sponges item description did not specify what size i expect the regular size sponges.. Not happy</li>
            <li> Its a steal 4 for 2$ while just one costs 5 i love them helps makeup be smoother!</li>
            <li> They work fine, but they smell horrible. I would advise washing them before you use them!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with these sponges. The variety of sizes makes for the perfect makeup application tools.</li>
            <li> I love these makeup sponge. You can put any amount of the foundation on the sponge and these is no spillage. Love them</li>
            <li> These came with a horrible smell. They didn&#x27;t even work, and were much smaller than average</li>
            <li> The size was not advertised when I purchased them. So when I received them, they were so small! Not too much bigger than my big toe! I gave them away as baby shower gifts! Great colors though!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Product not very absorbent and breaks easily but also way better than spending fifteen bucks on one at Sephora!!</li>
            <li> took almost 1 month to ship here.....the quality is just ok, but what do u expect from such low price? it is not china after all. oh i miss china, everything is cheaper than usa</li>
            <li> I Would Not Recommend, The Product Came &amp; Soon As I Opened It, It Had a Very Strong Rubber Smell To It. Also They Are Very Hard So I Cannot Use Them. again, I Would Not Recommend!</li>
            <li> not what I expected... had to give them away</li>
            <li> Other than the almost one month wait I really like this product. They are a bit hard at first but the more you use the better they feel. Overall I recommend!</li>
            <li> i know it was a long shot with this product but i tried it anyway. they came in a 2 square inch package with four beauty blendler... you can just take a guess what that would make the size. i put them under water and the would not expand. when they are dry and you first get them they are super dense... its cheap... don&#x27;t but. instead buy cosmetic wedges. those work well. and they expand like beauty blenders. and are lightweight. they&#x27;re great! but THESE are terrible...  ***UPDATE*** if you rub this too hard, when cleaning it, then it will break... not easy to clean, the color stains the blender after use</li>
            <li> Work like any other sponge lol&lt;br /&gt;A beauty blender is a beauty blender . There&#x27;s nothing else to it . They all do the same job . Just the prices vary cAuse of the brand but these work just the same. They worked for me and I loved it. They last a pretty long whole&lt;br /&gt;Also. Just don&#x27;t forget to wash them every  2-3 days when you use these</li>
            <li> Very poor quality. Doesn&#x27;t absorb water at all! Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> These are much smaller than the Beauty Blender which is tiny itself.</li>
            <li> These sponges are great. They aren&#x27;t like the real beauty blender but they are an okay doop. They are soft and blend makeup well. I love the colors. My husband took the tan one to use when cleaning his knifes so theres a multi purpose. Definetly recomend these for makeup lovers on a budget</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t swell like I had thought and took forever to get to me but I do enjoy them a lot</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product! The four came in the package like it says, great size, at an amazing price! Worth the wait for the delivery üëç</li>
            <li> Blends in nicer than the using a brush. It won&#x27;t leave streak marks on your face. And feels better than using your sticky hands.</li>
            <li> Exactly whas was described and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Great deal for knock off blender sponge.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Will order again!</li>
            <li> I love these blenders, works a lot better then a brush! It applies really well and I&#x27;ve washed one, I feel like I could use them forever!</li>
            <li> Nice blenders,they apply my makeup very well, feels nice to my skin. So far the best I&#x27;ve used to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> These blenders work very well when a bit damp and provide great coverage. I&#x27;m able to use less foundation and still cover my entire face. Work just like the original beauty blender!</li>
            <li> Great quality, will definitely buy again. About 2 1/2 inches in height, works REALLY well.</li>
            <li> The blenders are really hard doesn&#x27;t even soak the water -_- And they have a balloon smell that sticks to your skin for awhile</li>
            <li> Ridiculous and stupid....</li>
            <li> The pictures need caption under stating smaller than appear n they don&#x27;t last long with teen girls applying makeup twice a day</li>
            <li> Absolutely love all four for the price! Was not disappointed when I received them. They are quite small but I do enjoy the size since I just use them for my under eye concealer. I am not a huge fan of using beauty blenders for foundation so I was very satisfied w/ the size of them! They aren&#x27;t as hard as people say they are. You do need to get them wet before use. Just soak them in water and squeeze some water out so the sponge is lightly damp and then it is ready to use! I wash my sponges once a week to ensure no bacteria or mold is growing in my sponges. It is common for these to grow mold especially since you do need to wet them and then they are left out to dry on their own. So don&#x27;t be startled if one starts to grow some green hair. Just throw it away and use a new one! That&#x27;s why they give you four! I would also recommend only using one at a time unless you have clients you&#x27;re using these on b/c they do grow mold and you want them to last as long as they can! Great deal for the price in ratio to number of sponges! I received two tear drop ones and two of the other oddly shaped sponges. Extremely satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> They are nice! And work well. The are a little more firm then the beauty blenders . Of course I knew they wouldn&#x27;t be the same. For this price though it is a very good products</li>
            <li> These sponges are everything . I have a $14 dollar sponge already and they both feel identical . Not for applying but blends out makeup like a champ . Go for it !</li>
            <li> I think this is worth it considering the other beauty blenders are very much over priced. It doesn&#x27;t hold too much product, its easy to clean, and most of the time I use my dry. I wear makeup about 3-4 times out of the week so I needed something that was reasonable for the price and quantity. Its not good to keep 1 beauty blender for 2 months or more even though you may wash it out because bacteria can still build up. Overall, I think its worth it for basic and/or daily makeup use, however, special occasions and important events, I use my Soho beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Absorbs all the make up in the sponge, instead of blending it.</li>
            <li> These are the same makeup sponges as on FaceOff</li>
            <li> These were extremely small and disappointing. The only reason they deserve one star is because it came 2 weeks earlier than it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to clean these. I will look it up but they came about 2 days after I ordered them so that made me happy.</li>
            <li> I just clicked on the star in order to post something but besides the colors the product isn&#x27;t what I thought it would be. The sponges do not get soft at all... I tried to wet and soak them in water but nothing works.</li>
            <li> They are too hard. Sorry I purchased them. They are not soft at all.</li>
            <li> It absorbs all the intended foundation for my face. I&#x27;d rather use my fingers to apply.</li>
            <li> Good at blending but kind hard</li>
            <li> cute and little, I like them</li>
            <li> This size sponge is good for blending areas around the eyes and nose.</li>
            <li> Very cute coloring and I like it</li>
            <li> its kinda hard and small</li>
            <li> I love these blenders! I use them to apply my bb cream &amp; concealers &amp; it&#x27;s amazing. Gives my makeup a flawless finish, they&#x27;re soft, doesn&#x27;t absorb too much product when used damp, &amp; easy to clean. Will repurchase &amp; recommend to a friend... Also was delivered before expected date.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much  i love the sponges they are great on blending, I would definitely order more of them.</li>
            <li> Identical to the ones you&#x27;ll pay $8+ for at the store. Love them.  They are well worth what you pay for.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re smaller than the other ones found in stores plus they don&#x27;t work as well&lt;br /&gt;however they do the job</li>
            <li> Perfect size and texture</li>
            <li> These work great! Love em. The 4 that arrived to me were blue, purple, fuchsia and pink. I don&#x27;t really care what the colors are, as long as they worked right and they do. The wait was very long though.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to ship but for the price that was ok.</li>
            <li> Hate how they smell alot like cheap rubber or something.</li>
            <li> They are pretty small, but they work perfect! And they are cheap.</li>
            <li> Cheap material but we get what we pay for</li>
            <li> Good for the price but not the best quality definitely prefer to spend a more and get the beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> The hourglass shaped sponges worked ok, but the teardrop shaped ones doesn&#x27;t blend at all. Not a regret for only a few dollars, but will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Works fine for me, just not as big as expected. I would still recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really liked these for smaller areas on your face but they are a little smaller then I thought they would be</li>
            <li> Product is great, came sooner than expected, should have brought more. 4 for a dollar here, and at rite aid its one for 3.00.</li>
            <li> I like my beauty sponges, even though it took sooo long getting here. I have 2 for my personal cosmetic bag and 2 for my makeup train kit. Wonderful! I will order more in the future</li>
            <li> i liked them the only thing is that they do smell bad when you receive it!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase,the quality of the product is really good. However shipping time was too long.</li>
            <li> Love them !! And I&#x27;m gonna order it again !! )) thank you</li>
            <li> These work well, but definitely don&#x27;t blend as smoothly as a foundation brush. I bought these because I&#x27;ve been wanting to try some different sponges, and I find these to work better than those cheap white wedges you can buy at any store. I think the selling factor on these for me is the shape. It makes them easier and more comfortable to hold while blending makeup. And the colors are very cute as well!</li>
            <li> My daughter likes this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and I didn&#x27;t expect much. Yes, there is a plastic odor that the product has and can be smelled when you start using this product. After using this product to blend in my foundation a few times, I realized I need to clean the blender. Unfortunately, they do not clean well. I tried to get the products out of the blender using soap, olive oil and a mixture of baby shampoo (as they recommend when you clean the original beauty blender) and I noticed the product would not get clean and started coming apart. I would recommend the disposable $1 sponges they sell at the dollar store since you are better off using those.</li>
            <li> It come with all the colors very nice and soft and I love how my makeup comes out with this sponge</li>
            <li> These little guys are cute and blend well! I&#x27;m happy with them so far and it doesn&#x27;t look like they absorb any make-up into them so I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll clean very easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did have a little bit of a weird smell to them when they arrived but I didn&#x27;t really see that as a problem. I&#x27;m sure you can just clean them off if the smell bothers you that much.</li>
            <li> I use this  everyday when I am blending my makeup!! I absolutely love it and am extremely glad that I bought it. I suggest that if you are really into makeup but tired of blending your makeup with your finger that you go and buy this off of Amazon. It&#x27;s a great buy and isn&#x27;t expensive in the slightest!! Well I really hoped this helped!(:</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the sponges that much, my foundation brushes get the job done more efficiently. But I guess I could be using them wrong.. It&#x27;s just I feel like the sponge absorbes a lot of the makeup and doesn&#x27;t apply much of it to my face. My mom who is a makeup artist, loves using them for contouring.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter. They took forever to arrive. I wish I would have just bought them from my local drug store as they would have been cheaper for the same quality.</li>
            <li> For some reason I thought they would be bigger lol but still their great , they&#x27;d be great for patting make up in and blending,</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for the price! Using these is so much easier than using a foundation brush. Definetly recommend</li>
            <li> Hate the chemical smell</li>
            <li> i got them a few weeks after i ordered and I have to say, I&#x27;m impressed! The picture shows the four sponges I purchased and my old one from ULTA in the middle. I like these sponges a lot more! They are softer and because they&#x27;re slightly smaller, I get a more even coverage. I think they are well worth the price :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as I expected it too . It&#x27;s too small and very time consuming to use</li>
            <li> I knew not to expect much from these seeing as they were SO cheap. They do put on liquid foundation well and they blend concealer and highlight okay but they are so hard! When you wet them they don&#x27;t get larger like other sponges. Even the cosmetic wedges get bigger and you can get like 30 for $1.00. I ended up ordering the Real Techniques miracle complexion sponge 3 days later. They do what they&#x27;re supposed to but it kind of hurts just hitting your face over and over with these.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought they&#x27;d be!</li>
            <li> Bought these sponges &amp; they arrived in less than 2 weeks. Ive used them numerous times &amp; they work really good. All you have to do is clean then with warm water &amp; soap when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> shipping was as expected</li>
            <li> I love it!! Gives an airbrushed look!! Good thing I bought 2 sets to use on my clients!!! ALMOST beauty blender duplicates</li>
            <li> A great dupe for beauty blenders. The price is amazing for all the sponges you get. They are a bit stiff at first. I suggest you soak them in warm water with makeup brush cleaner for 20 minutes. Wring/squeeze them out and let them dry on the counter top. They do increase in size but not by much after wetting them. After drying, the sponges shrink down a bit, but not to their initial size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If applying wet or oil based products, dampen sponge with water first. This helps with application of products. It will seem like it is taking on a lot of product, but by wetting the sponge the water inside makes a weighted core which keeps most of the wet product your using on the outside of the sponge. Can also be used with dry/powdered products. You can use the same wetting process as oil based products but coverage will be heaver. My personal suggestion is to keep one of the sponges dry when setting makeup concealer under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When dirty with product, wet them with water and take a dime size of makeup brush cleaner and another dime size of olive oil in your hand. Work these two products into the sponge. You will see the makeup starting to lift. After 30 seconds or so, continue to work the mixture into the sponge while under running warm water. In two minutes all the product should be lifted and you should have a clean sponge. A great buy. I would highly recommend you give them a try.</li>
            <li> This product really covers my makeup very well. It blends in the makeup to a T. Looks very natural and it can be reused if you are into saving money.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal  and a lot cheaper than purchasing it in the stores. Thanks again for the bargain.</li>
            <li> Smells like rubber. Do not buy</li>
            <li> Good price, however this makeup blender absorbs too much of your makeup compared to the beauty blender and its more dense, but overall its ok.</li>
            <li> These are inexpensive and I&#x27;m told work well. My sister uses them. A lot cheaper than beauty blenders. Great value.</li>
            <li> Way to large to apply Foundation and Powder.</li>
            <li> EVEN AFTER I WE THEM THEY WERE A LITTL TO HARD NOW THE CREAM ONE WAS GREAT WET IT AND IT DOES BLENDING VERY WELL SO NOT BAD FOR THE PRICE AT ALL JUST A LITTLE TO HARD OTHERWISE OK</li>
            <li> They blend perfectly I&#x27;m satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Just get a beauty blender</li>
            <li> Great product, smaller than expected and slower shipping than I hoped for.</li>
            <li> I actually really love these! They&#x27;re great! A lot of people say they&#x27;re stuff but honestly mine are great, just like the beauty blender you should get it a little damp, but I will be ordering like 12 more of these because of the price and how great they are!</li>
            <li> Awful, these are super hard! I let them sit in water for 2 hours and they did not change in size or get any softer! I would save my $2 and just go get a real beauty blender!</li>
            <li> For a long time this was the only blending sponge that I used so I had nothing to compare them to. They did good, I thought, blended nice but coverage wasn&#x27;t great or flawless like everyone says about blending sponges. OK, so maybe my skin is just more horrible than anyone else... Or maybe not. After some YouTube comparison videos I&#x27;ve learned that these little guys actual stink. They&#x27;re hard, they don&#x27;t expand when wet and they soak up a lot of foundation. Tips for anyone else who doesn&#x27;t know what I didn&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve since gotten a different brand from the store and its so soft and covers my pores so well. I love it and can&#x27;t believe what I&#x27;ve been missing out on. But if have youthful, even, skin then these will be good for you. Not for anyone with big pores, fine lines, or other skin problems.</li>
            <li> These sponges do the job&lt;br /&gt;But they aren&#x27;t  like the beauty blender and they don&#x27;t grow when you wet them</li>
            <li> GOT MY ITEM A LOT SOONER THAN I THOUGHT AND SOONER THAN THEY PROMISED! LOVED IT! VERY SATISFIED AND HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. IT WORKS FLAWLESS ON MY FACE. I WILL BE GETTING MORE! CAN‚ÄôT BEAT THAT PRICE! THANK YOU!!! &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> HARD!!!!! I&#x27;m not sure if this product causes irritation (question was asked when reviewing)&lt;br /&gt;I bought this blender because the coupon community on instagram really sold this like it was the&lt;br /&gt;cheapest, greatest thing on earth! I&#x27;m sad to say, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a great piece to put in to your collection&lt;br /&gt;to look at and to show off on your vanity for makeup collectors like me. Other than that. If you want to&lt;br /&gt;gift these, I recommend these blenders as stocking stuffers for your pre-teen children wanting to explore&lt;br /&gt;their talents in makeup.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work at all if anything they remove the makeup, no wonder it&#x27;s so cheap, seriously just save your time and money and buy a real beauty blender</li>
            <li> Love! I reorder all the time</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT... THEY ARE SO CHEAP AND SO SOFT, JUST LIKE THE BEAUTY BLENDER AND SOOOO MUCH CHEAPER! WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> They took awhile to be shipped to me but it was worth the wait. the price was really good and theyre really cute. Sure i could go buy the normal white ones but these ones are more fun. good quailty and give my foundation an even spread.</li>
            <li> Off course these sponges never disappoints me. Nice and soft. Me love em!</li>
            <li> Very small in comparison to ones weve purchased at the stores.</li>
            <li> Received them earlier than expected. Very good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Crappy quality, they are very blunt and smelly and I even tried washing them, they don&#x27;t soak up any water, there basically like a fluffy eraser for your face. Would work better if I took it to school and used it for an essay :/</li>
            <li> The sponges I got are a bit hard but work well enough.</li>
            <li> Thought they would come individual wrapped</li>
            <li> You have to understand that these are not going to be the Taj Mahal. They are cheap beauty blenders. Nothing fancy and nothing that you would want to display or something like that. For the price they work very well, they actually had pretty fast shipping for me. I ordered some brushes weeks before these and they still haven&#x27;t arrived and they&#x27;re coming from the same place. All in all I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> product quality not as expected</li>
            <li> like see good  and all I wait&lt;br /&gt;is good I onli have 3 no 4 how see in packe onli 3 idk  why</li>
            <li> Awesome quality and use for the price! Love the colors! Price is cheap but the quality is great for me!</li>
            <li> Get what you pay for. Not a great imitation of the beauty blender... Or maybe I&#x27;m not using it right?</li>
            <li> They came without a blastic cover or bag for each sponge inside the sender backage. Thay were loos inside the bag that the sender  put them in. They should be put in a plastic box cleaned and sentisized  because they are a face sponges!!!</li>
            <li> I got these because they were inexpensive. It took forever to ship and they don&#x27;t really do the job. If you have used a beauty blender or even the real techniques miracle complexion sponge you will be straight up disappointed. The brushes are hard and don&#x27;t hold water well. I will try these out some more but I might just end up tossing them.</li>
            <li> Great bargain! Only complaint was that it took well over a month to arrive...</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do well</li>
            <li> Love these so cute and work great..</li>
            <li> Amazing soft/plush sponges with great blending power. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Need Sponges!?? wow these are so cool and you have soooo many that you don&#x27;t know what to do with em! 4 sponges is way more than enough super easy to wash and is super convenient. Recommended by a Make up Professional and artist as my self! :)</li>
            <li> When compared to the actual beauty blender it is just as soft.  It does not spread the same. Yet I still hv a flawless finish.  Durable, washes clean &amp; hadnt stained after 28 uses</li>
            <li> No need to spend a ton of money on a Beauty Blender when you can get these! These are super dense. I spritz mine with makeup setting spray and blend my foundation. They clean up pretty well with brush cleaner, too!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected. But I love them and I just ordered more.</li>
            <li> I love these with all of my heart, way better than my fingers. And even though they&#x27;re super small there&#x27;s 4 of them so it doesn&#x27;t even matter. Especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It absorbs a lot of foundation and is not soft.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought they would be bigger but its not.</li>
            <li> Not that great. I really soaked these sponges like you&#x27;re supposed to (like excessively)..and used them with different types of makeup. It just didn&#x27;t perform very well for me. Soaked up a lot of product and then didn&#x27;t distribute much at all. I ended up just stippling with my finger instead. I&#x27;ve never used the actual beauty blender from sephora. I wonder if that works better. Over all, the shipping was pretty fast and the price was good but I just didn&#x27;t find it useful for me at all.</li>
            <li> They worked ok but obviously nowhere close to the quality of beauty blenders. Much more difficult to clean, probably because they are made of a thicker sponge in comparison to the beauty blender products.</li>
            <li> I used to have these about to order them once again I love them there way cheaper than the original ones and does just the same thing there is a bit of an odor but it&#x27;s more like a rubbery odor but goes away after so many times of using it able to clean very easy and there super soft! Great product for the price</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT THE SPONGES WOULD BE LIKE A NORMAL SIZE BEAUTY BLENDER‚Ä¶BUT WHEN I OPENED THE PACKAGE THEY WERE TINY‚Ä¶ALMOST AS &amp;#34;TRAVEL SIZE...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheaper product to replace the Beauty Blender and I found it. I wanted to repurchase it; however, this product is definitely NOT the one I have purchased before. I do not know why. Maybe the seller just used other seller&#x27;s photo. It is true that it is very cheap but still it is a waste of money. First, this product took a month to ship to my place. Although it did get here at the end, the product itself is very disappointing. Second thing is that the product has a strong chemical smell. I washed it a couple times but still the smell is there. Third thing, the sponge soak up all my foundation ( my foundation has very small particles). Last thing, it is very hard. It is hard as if a pencil eraser hitting my face.&lt;br /&gt;  I feel like the one I purchased before is the one with amazon prime shipping, but I am not sure anymore. The day I got it I order a beauty blender from sephora right away. I really hope that they would improve their product and shipping time. Right now I feel like it a waste to just throw away these sponges so I am probably going to use them as painting brush soaking sponges, but again they are so hard I do not know whether they can soak effectively.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and price</li>
            <li> i only received ONE? ?</li>
            <li> Thought I would get four different shapes.  Got one.  Other that that, love it.</li>
            <li> These beauty blenders are actually smaller than what I thought they&#x27;d be...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> First off these are super cute! The colors and shapes are adorable (the colors of mine match the picture exactly). They did take a VERY long time to get here, but they do ship from either China or Korea. If you are an impatient person do not get these, instead buy the Real Techniques sponge. Even though these took a long time to arrive I still love them. At first they are rather hard and not very spongy, but the more I washed them, used them, and played around with them, the squishier they got. They are now soft and easy to use. Both shapes are great and work well. They apply makeup perfectly. However, with all beauty blender dupes, you have to use them and care for them properly or they will not work as well! To use you have to soak them in water and then squeeze out all the water you can, using a towel can help squeeze out the last bit of water (do not twist them to wring out water, that ruins them), and then use a foundation or concealer the is not watery because the sponge will soak up a watery foundation or a tinted moisturizer depositing less product on your face. You can still use these types of products, but they will not work as well. To clean them, squeeze water through them and apply either a facial cleanser that can remove makeup, dish soap, or a special beauty blender sponge cleaner, the bar version is supposed to work better than the liquid one. Be sure to thoroughly rinse with water, squeezing to get all of the makeup out, until the water runs clear. Wash after each use and allow to air dry. Do not place in a container or wrap in a towel when allowing the sponge to dry. Some foundations and concealers will stain the sponges, just wash the areas used for applying makeup with soap to insure that they are completely clean. If you take good care of your sponges, then they should last a long time no matter where they were bought. I love these sponges and am very happy that I bought them!</li>
            <li> They are way too small, like miniatures of the normal makeup blenders. They&#x27;re also made of a different material that&#x27;s not as good. I won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> I JUST opened the package and one of these sponges is covered in glue from the poor packaging. The package was marked that it was a phone case. I, honestly, don&#x27;t even have the desire to use this crappy product anymore.</li>
            <li> Packaging was very poor, I was very disappointed also they are much smaller in real...</li>
            <li> Not what i expected. Shipping took forever plus bad quality</li>
            <li> Very good and love to use it</li>
            <li> i know now what happened whit this product,  was lost.</li>
            <li> The product is very small ...</li>
            <li> Great option if you are looking to try sponge application but do not want to invest in a Beauty Blender yet.</li>
            <li> HATE!!! So hard to clean!</li>
            <li> Wash them with water and mild soap every time you use them.Sponge makes the face looks flawless.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product. I read some of the reviews before I made my decision and still took the risk and I&#x27;m glad I did. A lot of people were saying it&#x27;s not worth it might as well get the more expensive ones and whatnot but I had no issues with this product. Yes they don&#x27;t enlarge much when wet but I used half the amount of foundation when I used these sponges compared to others I have used in the past. I would recommend these to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune and yet have a good product :)</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t even inside a package when I opened them up from the carrier envelope. Which seemed a little unsanitary to me.</li>
            <li> They smell really weird and they are pretty hard. Maybe I wasn&#x27;t doing it right but my makeup didn&#x27;t really spread to easily. I gave up after a week and just went back to the disposable makeup swabs</li>
            <li> These are just fine and seem to work just peachy. I honestly have no comparison to the 20.00 beauty blenders but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d spend that kinda cash on a sponge when these seem to do the job for only a few bucks. At this point I wouldn&#x27;t say if I prefer this method over my brushes....I still switch back and forth, but hey it&#x27;s nice to have in my arsenal loll.</li>
            <li> Great deal! These are very soft and perfect for my makeup needs. I&#x27;d recommend buying this 4 pack compared to buying one for about the same price.</li>
            <li> Thought they were biggerüòå</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> They shed a lot. Therefore the quality is just ok. I bought 1 from from target which I like a lo better just more pricey.</li>
            <li> There was only one in shipment.</li>
            <li> Plastic like. Doesn&#x27;t grow with water and is extremely hard</li>
            <li> Works extremely well!</li>
            <li> Smell a little funny and get very dirty very quick but great sponges !!!</li>
            <li> I like the way they work, but they had a funky smell even after I washed them... They did get better with the smell and I use them everytime I do my makeup now! I also wish they were in plastic when they were shipped and not just in the envelope!</li>
            <li> they are small but I got a small face so that works. they are soft and feel like normal makeup sponges. they smell like new rubber balls but only if you put it right on your nose. as far as cleaning, someone said it doesn&#x27;t get clean with soap and water. I don&#x27;t know what soap they used but regular soap doesn&#x27;t clean makeup. clean your sponges with makeup removing face wash. I can even clean my foundation off my hands with regular soap and water. came in two weeks. I believe I chose style 1. that would be my only complaint. i wasn&#x27;t sure what the difference was and what I would be getting.</li>
            <li> The product took over a month to come in and was very hard</li>
            <li> It took a while for it to arive , but it came in the mail ( not ups or anything ) they absorb a lot of makeup , so really your using about 3x more , than if you were just to use your fingers ... But they came in different shapes and colors . Really firm , but would be great for contouring to press the make up in . Not a bad product , but not 5 star worthy .</li>
            <li> Smaller than what I expected.</li>
            <li> Great price for what you get, and the delivery date said weeks out but it arrived before then.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product intending to use them to apply liquid foundation. When I received this product it was damaged and the sponges had been cut into pieces. I attempted to return them, but the seller would not respond to me. One of the sponges was not damaged so I tried to use it. It was a very bad quality sponge. I went to Ulta and bought a large beauty blender and love it! I would not recommend purchasing this product. You really do get what you pay for. These sponges are poorly made and extremely small. I really wish I had listened to all of the bad reviews. Due to the fact that it was just a few dollars, I just threw them in the trash.</li>
            <li> Ordered in March and still have no idea wear they are!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery work great normal beauty blenders are around 20 so they work a little better but If I can get 4 of them for less then $3 at do almost the same thing, no noticeable difference I&#x27;m using them!</li>
            <li> Great price for all 4. Makes my foundation flawless</li>
            <li> Great make-up sponges.</li>
            <li> Took a long time for shipping but the sponges are amazing and a great price</li>
            <li> So this is not a beauty blender dupe. It&#x27;s is really good though. It does expand slightly in water and gets almost as soft. It is much smaller, but I like the size better. Unlike a lot of other dupes out there (target, ulta) this one can be squeezed until just damp, so it leaves a nice airbrushed appearance. It had smaller pores than most other dupes and had a smooth surface. It does tend to soak up product so I suggest you spread the makeup out on your face and use the damp sponge to blend.  I like having several so I only have to wash 1 or 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> These took a long time to ship, but I love these things. They blend my makeup great and they will last a while! I have seen these at other places for a  higher price, so glad I found these one for less.</li>
            <li> I keep buying these! Love them!</li>
            <li> I hear they are good I haven&#x27;t try em yet I&#x27;m waitin on mines to come other than that I can&#x27;t wait to try it üòå</li>
            <li> This is NOT like the Beauty Blender where it expands with water.  I&#x27;ve only tried the light Blue one and it seems to get the job done.  They all seem more stiff than I&#x27;d prefer in a makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap does not blend well</li>
            <li> Amazing, doesn&#x27;t take water like the real one, and it&#x27;s very small but still works (:</li>
            <li> Not  happy  with  this  product.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges.&lt;br /&gt;Work just as well as the expensive ones ;)&lt;br /&gt;Does awesome for blending and applying your make up</li>
            <li> came just as pictured love them ..still learning how to use them</li>
            <li> If I could leave zero stars, I would. These were such a waste.</li>
            <li> Love them want more :)</li>
            <li> Best beauty blenders, have a funky smell but they do the job :) I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the blenders they are true to photo except colors vary. This blender works just as well as my 30.00 beauty blender i will do review on my YT Channel. there is a ruler that shows the sizes an what I recieved</li>
            <li> The sponges don&#x27;t do their job. The materials come off when applying liquid makeup. They don&#x27;t blend my products. I hate this. It sucks. Ladies/Gents, just get the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I just received my sponges in the mail today, and I&#x27;m honestly surprised they&#x27;re so small. I wet one, and it didn&#x27;t get any bigger, so that sucks. But if you&#x27;re thinking of getting the micro BBs then these would be good dupes, that&#x27;s how I think of it. The size of them are the only reason I gave them 4 ‚≠êÔ∏ès. Took a few weeks to get here as well, but at least I got them. I didn&#x27;t get 4 different colors, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter to meüíñ. They&#x27;re soft and squishy, not hard at all so I&#x27;m overall content with my purchase. In 1 pic I&#x27;ll have the sponges I received and in the other ill add the sponge I got from a beauty supply store. I also have two Beauty Blenders already so these were just extra lol. I&#x27;m kinda glad I got all pink, they look cute in my container together üíñ Thank you.</li>
            <li> Gasoline odor. Even after several washes with soap. Can&#x27;t not have it near my skin at all. Returning.</li>
            <li> I received my beauty blenders a few days ago. And they are very soft and very useful. They blend the foundation very good. ! I will be ordering more soon, because four beauty blenders for two dollars is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Omgosh, these are awful! They don&#x27;t even expand under water no matter how long you put it under the faucet!! They are hard and tough. Don&#x27;t ever buy these. It&#x27;s a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The item was not what I went it. It doesn&#x27;t work good. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love them. They work as expected. Great for under eyes. Delivery took a little longer. But overall was happy with my purchase. I mean cant beat that prize.</li>
            <li> I do believe you get what you paid for in some instances. I bought this just to have a few extras laying in my makeup bag. Compared to the one I currently have, they are not as spongy and do not absorb water as good as my current one. They arrived inside a mailing envelope and it was open on the side, which means they were exposed to all bacteria and chemicals while being shipped from Japan. Not sure if I&#x27;ll use it since there were not packaged effectively.</li>
            <li> Nice little sponges, thick, durable, they do not plump up much when wet, overall does the job of blending makeup.</li>
            <li> love them so much, but the blenders are a little small. great deal.</li>
            <li> This is no &amp;#34;Blender&amp;#34; that I was expecting. I have the &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; that I have bought from Sephora and these are in NO WAY comparable. I just threw them away because they are of no use to me.</li>
            <li> The price is great but the image that they use makes it seem like the blenders are the size of the one that you&#x27;d get from CVS, target, ulta or sephora. These blenders are extremely small. The texture is really soft but there was a very distinct smell when I took them out of the packaging which gave me a headache and it overwhelms my whole bedroom. I doubt I&#x27;ll use them though because it seems really chemically which is weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came a lot faster than anticipated.</li>
            <li> I honestly bought these because I wanted to try a beauty blender without the original&#x27;s ridiculous price tag. That being said, I have never tried the original so I cannot compare these sponges to that one. I thought that these applied Korean BB and CC Creams well (better than the average drugstore triangle sponge), but they also absorb a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use these occasionally, but my mainstay is still just using my hands to apply product as I find they work just as well. I have head that there are many products that are impossible to apply with hands, so a blender or a brush must be used, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t regret buying these (especially since they were really cheap), but they&#x27;re definitely not holy grail and I can do without them.</li>
            <li> this is a product so diferent from the picture.....tiny tiny tinyyyyy!!!! look like a toy for kids!!</li>
            <li> Didnt expect them to be minis but I love them</li>
            <li> Very hard material and doesn&#x27;t expand when wet. Yes, they&#x27;re cheap but not worth it at all. I went and bought the real beauty blender for 20 bucks rather spend the money on something better. Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I thought. It&#x27;s not bad, don;t get me wrong, just small.</li>
            <li> Pros Cheap,Soft,Pretty,Reaches into Certain Areas, easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Cons There very small, takes longrow inger to blend, they won&#x27;t grow in water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok so for the price its great if your young and you like to try out new things and or find other uses for them I&#x27;m sure they would be awesome with dry products rather than wet products. I dont recommend then if your looking for the ultimate dupe for a BB but there fun and cute for a girl starting out if shed patient.</li>
            <li> My niece told me about this product because I was looking for something different to use to blend my foundation in. It blends in very well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Such a great deal, and I love that I got BOTH shapes. These have become a daily staple in my makeup routine, and are simple to clean. I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this listing, I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are very stiff and do not do a good job of blending anything.  The product this imitating is far superior and also expands when you wet it prior to using it.  This doesnt expand and stays hard as a rock.  Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love this sponges they are just great, soft and perfect size!!</li>
            <li> its as genuine as it gets its lovely</li>
            <li> Weeks and weeks waiting on this product</li>
            <li> I decided to order these after watching gossmakeupartist on youtube rant about overpriced &amp;#34;brand name&amp;#34; bblenders.&lt;br /&gt;Took forever to arrive, I forgot I had ordered. However, for the price it is hard to complain.&lt;br /&gt;All 4 in good shape. I washed immediately with DrBronners lavender (organic and naturally antibacterial) and air dried in hanging mesh bag (which I do EVERY time I use a b.blender) and no odor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently only using the cream colored egg shape and love it. Swells slightly soaked in water and applies liquid beautifully. Really impressed. No staining from bareminerals bareskin serum foundation. I accidentally over applied (that bottle can dispense erratically) and this bb saved my face after blotting excess off with a cloth and just rolling bb rinsed clean over everything a couple of times for flawlessness.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the buy. Just ALWAYS wash immediately after use and use a mesh lingerie bag to hang/ air dry. Mold bb horror stories on youtube are not worth it, so protect your face</li>
            <li> I thought they were bigger, but I love them either way.</li>
            <li> Its already 2 month sƒ±nce ƒ± ordered the product but dƒ±dn&#x27;t get anythƒ±ng. Is ƒ±t fake account?</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a dupe for the beauty blender, this is not it. Really hard and do not get soft and blend makeup well.</li>
            <li> Cheap product but I guess you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> its not a regular sized beauty blender it is much smaller. They are very soft and able to blend makeup in easily. Good for the price</li>
            <li> When I got this package they were in a little ziploc like bag... very odd. also they smelled like fish! they are very stiff and hard to use. soak up all of my foundation. DONT BUY, for $6 you can buy the sponge from real techniques !</li>
            <li> Love them.! Suppost to use with water but I honestly think results are better without water. Love how the price is great for a total of 4 of them. Pshh why not? Instead of paying so much for 1 at a stre</li>
            <li> They came really fast. They are extremely soft. They are the same color and shapes in the picture. This is a must have if you love doing makeup. I can&#x27;t wait to use them! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> They work great for the price!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t grow like original beauty blenders but I guess I expected that considering it was $4</li>
            <li> Love my sponges it gives my make up a nice feel and smooth look even though it took long to come I was happy with my purchase and looking forward to buying some more</li>
            <li> I just received mine today and I want to clear up some confusion about this product. I received four very soft beauty blender &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34;. For the price of this item it is an extremely very good product for anyone to have as either some back-up beauty blenders or as your main beauty blender. Yes you will have to wait around a month to receive this item because it does ship from overseas but if you can wait that long then go ahead and purchase this item now. If you cannot wait then pay ten dollars or up for another blending product which has a brand name attached to it. If your like me then you will want the biggest bang for your buck and order two sets of these and receive 8 blenders....8 for the price of 1 brand name. Um I will not need any more anytime soon that&#x27;s for sure. Its a no brainer.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for an awesome price. I don&#x27;t even need to clean it. For this price it&#x27;s a use and toss.</li>
            <li> I hate it... They don&#x27;t get bigger when they&#x27;re wet so they don&#x27;t apply makeup at all</li>
            <li> My wife loved the product</li>
            <li> kind of hard, but cute colors</li>
            <li> love these not as fantastic as the original beauty blender but they work really well , as what i dont like is the really long delivery wont be ordering from here again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE LITTLE MAKE UP BLENDERS!!! I ordered these back in summer and now I made another purchase for more of them. They blend your make up real good and also covers up flaws and they blend so easily. I will keep on ordering more and more cant ever have enuff of these great blenders!!</li>
            <li> It was a good product</li>
            <li> Kinda stiff, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting super high quality for the price. I expect they&#x27;ll last quite a while. I just did a play and used the egg-shaped one to apply the heavy-duty stage makeup. Worked just fine!</li>
            <li> The Delivery took so long, also they are really tiny not the average size makeup blender.</li>
            <li> Not too hard or soft.  Able to maneuver and blend product effortlessly.  Cleans easily and air dries quick.  Does not hold odors but may stain a little from liquid foundation application.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the best. I will probably go back to the normal sponges.</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic</li>
            <li> This product is so SOFT. It works great for blending and just in general makeup application. ANY makeup user needs to have this set of blending sponges.</li>
            <li> Super clean, very soft and spongy, nicely sealed packaging that delivered on time. Overall, incredibly pleased, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> The pieces look good and come in pretty colors, it blends well too. I gave 3 starts because I think they absorb too much of my foundation and I end up using more product to get a good face coverage.</li>
            <li> The sponges were hard and didn&#x27;t expand in water  And for the cherry on top they took 2 months to ship  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wasting my money on them</li>
            <li> Great blending items!</li>
            <li> A little harder than normal but still good blenders.</li>
            <li> Never used real one but these do the job n there big</li>
            <li> They are solid and painful to use on your face.</li>
            <li> Like then.  Thank you :)</li>
            <li> So small! The actaul beauty blender is FAR bigger than these and like everyone says its sponge is very different. I won&#x27;t be buying these again. I would much rather just buy the beauty blender and know what I&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li> I advise you to not purchase from this vendor. ....they are mini sponges not as big as your thumb....</li>
            <li> Please note: I have never used the real Beauty Blender, I got these as replacements for the sponges I had been buying at TJ Maxx. $4 for 4 instead of $4 for 1-- I thought I was getting a deal! I was in a rush this morning and used the Beauty Blender shaped one, but was really frustrated when it was not expanding when I was running it under water. When I tried to blend out my foundation, it took most of it off my face and felt like I was smashing my skin with a rock. Maybe they need more time to wear in? I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
