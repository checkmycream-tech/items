            <li>SEVEN LOVELY SCENTS.  </li>
            <li>Love these soaps and use them in my bathrooms as well as kitchen.  </li>
            <li>Perfect sampler pack for gifts or for trying out different scents.</li>
            <li>OK if you just want a sample.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, and if I had the foresight to keep a \\&quot;go</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase more than once.</li>
            <li>I even bought a large bar of the rose scent</li>
            <li>These soaps are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Cute little soaps at a great add-on price as a Prime Member.</li>
            <li>no these are tiny 1x1 and thin soaps,, smell great, packaged great, they are wonderful tiny soaps...</li>
            <li>Now to figure out the scents I like to purchase full size bars.</li>
            <li>it was good enough for me!</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t care for soap, but she LOVED it.</li>
            <li>They will be good for a guest bath, but not necessarily for the shower!</li>
            <li>i didnt want to pay full price for a full sized one and end up not liking it.</li>
            <li>A truly good soap will leave a pleasant aroma in a bathroom at least when it&#x27;s first opened</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent for such beautiful cleansing soap</li>
            <li>Bought it to sample the other scents of Pre de Provence that I haven&#x27;t tried, and for that it worked out great.  </li>
            <li>This assortment of small soaps is good as a hostess gift or gift for someone that you aren&#x27;t sure of what they want or need.  </li>
            <li>for the price I would say its worth it.</li>
            <li>its nice to try out the different soaps.</li>
            <li>Well, pretty and nice, but tiny.</li>
            <li>The small soap pack for your bathroom has a great smell.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t actually used these soaps yet but have totally enjoyed the scents....</li>
            <li>We have been struggling with dry skin issues which have greatly improved  with regular use of this hand soap.</li>
            <li>Smells great throughout the room, but  are very small</li>
            <li>but these don&#x27;t have much scent at all.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to read the description carefully</li>
            <li>Hell I can get stuff like this cheap and bigger bars at walmart,</li>
            <li>they really smell good, but are very small and way over priced for their size...</li>
            <li>They are small little soaps perfect for a guest bathroom.</li>
            <li>They both loves the different scents and were excited to try them out.  </li>
            <li>Small soaps that smell quite nice.</li>
            <li>Perhaps these samples were very very old, or perhaps they were bogus.</li>
            <li>I said what the heck and tried one, Wow!</li>
            <li>They are probably 1.5 x 1.5 inch squares about 3/4 inches thick at most.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty, but they do not act or smell much at all like the soaps I&#x27;ve always bought previously.  </li>
            <li>Like others have stated before these soaps are tiny and unfortunately super tiny just thought they would have been a lot bigger.</li>
            <li>It gives you an opportunity to try these fantastic soaps without commiting to their usual premium prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>They last a long time and are pretty too.</li>
            <li>Yes, these things are small, but that is OK as long as you know going in.</li>
            <li>This product is usually found in special gift shops.</li>
            <li>They are small enough to fit in your hand, but do the job.</li>
            <li>I give 2 stars because they are fine soaps, just very small.</li>
            <li>White spots on the soaps and white on the edges makes the soaps look battered and old..  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I spent that much money for this mini tiny soaps.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re enriched with natural shea Butter to cleanse and soften and infused with pure essential oils to add delicate aroma...</li>

            <li> For each 25-gram sampler bar in this package, I could get at least a week&#x27;s use (usually a couple of days more) as a bath soap.  </li>
            <li> Last long time.</li>
            <li> This works out for at least 7 weeks&#x27; worth of soapy goodness, at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to go on an unexpected trip and in my hasty packing I grabbed one of these for the trip, since hotel soap is hit-and-miss with me.  </li>
            <li> Tiny little soaps.  </li>
            <li> other reviewers mentioned, these are small, but a bar of Pre de Provence seems to last longer than other soap bars of the same size.  </li>
            <li> Although small, they seem like they will last a longer than you might expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I orrdered the mixed pack of small bars.</li>
            <li> one other whose name I forgot,</li>
            <li> I bought these in order to try the different scents this company offers but was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Not worth money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money for little soap.</li>
            <li> This package is actually small soaps (about 2x2 inches), so they are not really usable except as hand soaps.</li>
            <li> I got these for a little gift basket we prepared for our mother-in-law, and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Green Tea</li>
            <li> I bought these knowing they were very small after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> they are way too small</li>
            <li> The picture has no size reference to show how small they are.</li>
            <li> After mom past 2 years ago I packed them in box.</li>
            <li> I rediscovered them this past Xmas.</li>
            <li> : these soaps are VERY SMALL (I&#x27;d say 1 inch by 1 inch).  </li>
            <li> The soap was very small.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t try the soaps yet but they are very small.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with the packaging, but still I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> For the money ill try something else.</li>

            <li> this is the BEST soap.  The scents are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I bought these in order to try the different scents this company offers but was not impressed.  A truly good soap will leave a pleasant aroma in a bathroom at least when it&#x27;s first opened but these don&#x27;t have much scent at all.  I even bought a large bar of the rose scent but it just didn&#x27;t do what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I was expecting standard bar soaps.  This package is actually small soaps (about 2x2 inches), so they are not really usable except as hand soaps.</li>
            <li> This is a nice gift item. I was a little disappointed with the packaging, but still I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Pre de Provence Soap, Set of Seven, I got these Soaps for a Gift, They are seven of them and come in different scents like, Milk Honey Almond Linden Pomegrante (pomegranate) these are best-selling soaps triple milled in Provence using the old-world methods. They&#x27;re enriched with natural shea Butter to cleanse and soften and infused with pure essential oils to add delicate aroma...but you know what? ...they are way too small, I did not buy them here I got them somewhere else so it was easier to returned. ...Thank You D.D.</li>
            <li> These soaps smell SOO good. They are small little soaps perfect for a guest bathroom. They are wonderfully colored and would look nice on a tray in a bathroom.  I loved all the scents.</li>
            <li> This soap is small, but perfect for a guest bathroom or to give out as samples for people to learn which one they like best.  The Almond is my favorite but I got this for my friends to be able to see more that they offer</li>
            <li> My son received this item as a present.  I assume he has enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> These soaps smell great, and this package makes a nice gift.      Be sure to read the description carefully (I didn&#x27;t): these soaps are VERY SMALL (I&#x27;d say 1 inch by 1 inch).  I was expecting something a bit bigger.  If I had known, I might have bought some of their full-size bar soaps and wrapped them myself instead.</li>
            <li> Not worth money. The soap was very small. they smelt good. Not worth the money for little soap. It would make a great gift I guess.</li>
            <li> Cute little soaps at a great add-on price as a Prime Member. Now to figure out the scents I like to purchase full size bars.</li>
            <li> This was a nice gift.</li>
            <li> Small soaps that smell quite nice. It gives you an opportunity to try these fantastic soaps without commiting to their usual premium prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note-soaps are sample size. Maybe two weeks of showers per bar.</li>
            <li> I was going to include this in a gift but it looks shabby.  White spots on the soaps and white on the edges makes the soaps look battered and old..  The scent of the soaps is very nice and this is a good way to find out which scents one prefers but the price is too high for the product. I will buy Pre de Provence soap  in the future.</li>
            <li> Like others have stated before these soaps are tiny and unfortunately super tiny just thought they would have been a lot bigger. Think that they should have stated how big they are and also maybe put a quarter next to it so give reference.</li>
            <li> While they look the same, these soaps do not smell the same.  I&#x27;ve been ordering this brand for years from another web site and know what each piece should smell like.  They are pretty, but they do not act or smell much at all like the soaps I&#x27;ve always bought previously.  I would not recommend this product.  Perhaps these samples were very very old, or perhaps they were bogus.</li>
            <li> These soaps are fantastic.  We have been struggling with dry skin issues which have greatly improved  with regular use of this hand soap.</li>
            <li> SEVEN LOVELY SCENTS.  RECOMMEND AS THE PERFECT SIZE AS A HOSTESS GIFT,&lt;br /&gt;WHEN YOU DON&#x27;T WANT TO TAKE A BOTTLE OF WINE!</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a gift for my mother and she loved it, it arrived in a timely fashion and they look and smell awesome.</li>
            <li> they really smell good, but are very small and way over priced for their size...I will not order them again unless they make them larger and reduce the price.</li>
            <li> Love these soaps and use them in my bathrooms as well as kitchen.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by their diminutive size.  They last a long time and are pretty too.</li>
            <li> I got two sets of these for Christmas to give as gifts, one for my mother and one for my fiancee.  They both loves the different scents and were excited to try them out.  Please take note of the size of each bar.  They are probably 1.5 x 1.5 inch squares about 3/4 inches thick at most.  Although small, they seem like they will last a longer than you might expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  Perfect sampler pack for gifts or for trying out different scents.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used these soaps yet but have totally enjoyed the scents....the bathroom smells delicious and they&#x27;re the perfect size for the guest bathroom soap dish.  I&#x27;m going to order more for the master bath!  One note....all the soaps are in one cellophane wrap, not individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> the size was way smaller than the pictures made it out to be.. i was thinking 2x2 no these are tiny 1x1 and thin soaps,, smell great, packaged great, they are wonderful tiny soaps...</li>
            <li> I got these for a little gift basket we prepared for our mother-in-law, and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just wanted to tell all of you that it is a TINY soap. Well, pretty and nice, but tiny.</li>
            <li> The soaps are nice and lather up well.</li>
            <li> Tiny little soaps.  OK if you just want a sample.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality; perfect travel size.</li>
            <li> Love the smells and makes a great gift. Last long time. This product is usually found in special gift shops. So is great to buy it on line.</li>
            <li> These bars are 1.5 in square. The picture has no size reference to show how small they are. I give 2 stars because they are fine soaps, just very small.</li>
            <li> Yes, these things are small, but that is OK as long as you know going in. We used them for the bathrooms in a weekend rental and they worked great.</li>
            <li> This soap is smaller than the bars you get at hotels. For the money ill try something else. I cannot see spending the money and the scents are not that great. Hell I can get stuff like this cheap and bigger bars at walmart, Im looking for good soaps like the bee and flower line, that I will buy again</li>
            <li> The small soap pack for your bathroom has a great smell. They are small enough to fit in your hand, but do the job. for the price I would say its worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought these knowing they were very small after reading other reviews. So, you can&#x27;t say I wasn&#x27;t forewarned! They smell nice though.</li>
            <li> Tiny, maybe 2X2 if that big.</li>
            <li> Someone gave my mom 2 bars of these soaps 5 years ago . After mom past 2 years ago I packed them in box. I rediscovered them this past Xmas. I am 52 year old man , one who did not take a great deal thought and  time on soap research ! If it didn&#x27;t make me itch it was good enough for me! I said what the heck and tried one, Wow! Great lather  nice fragrance . They are a bit pricey so I orrdered the mixed pack of small bars. About the size of hotel soaps , one bar lasts about 2 to 3 times of a regular bar.</li>
            <li> I probably didn&#x27;t read the details well enough, but these soaps were surprisingly tiny when I received them.  They do smell good, though.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t try the soaps yet but they are very small. I can&#x27;t believe I spent that much money for this mini tiny soaps.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because my mom loves soap. I personally don&#x27;t care for soap, but she LOVED it. It&#x27;s a decent for such beautiful cleansing soap and I recommend it to all you gals.</li>
            <li> Bought it to sample the other scents of Pre de Provence that I haven&#x27;t tried, and for that it worked out great.  The package I received included:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Lavender&lt;br /&gt;- Linden&lt;br /&gt;- Grenade Pomegranate&lt;br /&gt;- Green Tea&lt;br /&gt;- Honey Almond&lt;br /&gt;- Milk&lt;br /&gt;- one other whose name I forgot, but it&#x27;s yellow and smells like a citrus-like candy (to me, smells like Smarties taste), if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging notes:  The soaps themselves are not individually wrapped, if that matters to you; for me this did not affect \\&quot;performance\\&quot; of soap.  The 7 bars are wrapped in cellophane and comes with a cute bow, all nice and gifty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers mentioned, these are small, but a bar of Pre de Provence seems to last longer than other soap bars of the same size.  For each 25-gram sampler bar in this package, I could get at least a week&#x27;s use (usually a couple of days more) as a bath soap.  This works out for at least 7 weeks&#x27; worth of soapy goodness, at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to go on an unexpected trip and in my hasty packing I grabbed one of these for the trip, since hotel soap is hit-and-miss with me.  I&#x27;m glad I did, and if I had the foresight to keep a \\&quot;go bag\\&quot; packed for future emergency trips, I&#x27;d pack these.</li>
            <li> These are guest size type soaps.  I anticipated they would be larger soaps.  The fragrances and colors are nice, though.  They will be good for a guest bath, but not necessarily for the shower!</li>
            <li> Smells great throughout the room, but  are very small</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought.  size : 3cm*3cm  But  i received this item 8 days in advance and i&#x27;m very happy about this .</li>
            <li> This assortment of small soaps is good as a hostess gift or gift for someone that you aren&#x27;t sure of what they want or need.  Priced well.</li>
            <li> soaps are smaller than the palm of my hand. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase more than once. its nice to try out the different soaps. i didnt want to pay full price for a full sized one and end up not liking it. Theyre good travel size too.</li>
