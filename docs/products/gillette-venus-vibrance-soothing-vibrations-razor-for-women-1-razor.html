            <li>I&#x27;ve used this razor for years..with excellent results.</li>
            <li>I was VERY happy to receive the package it came in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this razor.  </li>
            <li>Great for legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one for my wife and she was really happy about the product.</li>
            <li>Was so happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My trusty Vibrance has continued to give me a great shave, but eventually the vibration part died...</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s what makes it so great.</li>
            <li>I use this handle with the breeze/spa breeze/olay/pro skin cartridges (no need for seperate gel/cream) and I could not be happier - a great way to have a pampered shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette</li>
            <li>I loved this vibrating head razor, but it is out of production.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m glad I found this here!</li>
            <li>it really was the best razor ever.</li>
            <li>Another great prouduct with a short life span, but I am happy I found the ones on clearance.</li>
            <li>Venus razors work excellently, so when this new version came out I was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>I find lady blades to be stronger and more durable than man blades.  </li>
            <li>But I am glad that I found it here.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I never have any irritations, hair bumps, or complaints :)</li>
            <li>I love the Venus Vibrance.</li>
            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>Leaves it as smooth as a wax job!  </li>
            <li>but I personally love this one better &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all the Venus women&#x27;s razors and this is my favorite out of them all.</li>
            <li>It leaves my legs smooth!</li>
            <li>I was VERY excited to find one on Amazon.</li>
            <li>after manscaping, clean up is a snap!  </li>
            <li>It is identical to the non-power Venus or Divine razors that are still available.  </li>
            <li>if you wanna make your private life more fun, this is a great gift for your lovers.</li>
            <li>They work just as well and are cheaper and still readily available.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m VERY pleased with my new Vibrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She personally like the product and really good.</li>
            <li>Not bad, considering it was 4-5 years old.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and it great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Luckily for me, no one ever pays attention to my shopping cart.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it online, but Gillette, please bring this razor back...</li>
            <li>I have been lucky to find 3 or 4 on clearance racks since and bought them up.</li>
            <li>I think it does a great job, better than the regular one (which is a big compliment).</li>
            <li>So I wouldn&#x27;t pay any more for it than for a normal razor.</li>
            <li>Cuts very close and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice sharp razor that is easy to hold and has moisturizer on it, but the vibration doesn&#x27;t seem to add to getting a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>Despite the marketing, \\&quot;results in fewer nicks and cuts\\&quot; my face looks like a fresh cut steak that was ground into hamburger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love this razor and unlike many other reviewers I have found the vibration to be quite useful.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product,so smooth,noiseless.very easy to use also less efforts required to remove hair......</li>
            <li>I quickly hid it in the bottom of my cart, underneath the motor oil and next to the latest issue of Men&#x27;s Health.  </li>
            <li>I loved the fact that the replacements are so cheap and they last for a long time.</li>
            <li>The vibrations are distracting and when shaving around the corners of the nose and the contours of the chin you are more likely to cut yourself than get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I just brought the venus vibrance razor last month and love it.</li>
            <li>It leave your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find the Venus Vibrance on Amazon because I had become unable to find it in stores.</li>
            <li>I am sad though...since Gillette has discontinued this excellent product.</li>
            <li>So not only do we have a \\&quot;power\\&quot; razor that has no power, but the company decided to charge even more for replacement razor cartridges.  </li>
            <li>There was a period of time I had to use the same top for about a month or two</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s just a fun shaver in the pink coloring and easy to place wall mount.</li>
            <li>Nothing says, \\&quot;Ladies, I&#x27;m ready to party\\&quot; like a manscaped arrow pointing to your junk.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very lightweight, a trait of the Venus line.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m very upset because I have now found the replacement blades again</li>
            <li>There is not that much difference in the quality of leg shaving, but I find the vibrations really make a different for shaving my armpits, and although I&#x27;ve tried half-a-dozen others, I have not found any other razor, either manual or power, that does as good a job as the Venus Vibrance.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely sure that the vibrations help keep me from getting knicked and in addition, this razor (with the vibration on) gets closer than any other razor that I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I stood completely naked in front of a full length mirror</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true -- I do get about the same use from it when it&#x27;s turned on or off.</li>
            <li>I love this razor because it seems to help me cut down on nicks and irritation.</li>
            <li>I would recommend Venus brand razors in a heartbeat, but I do NOT recommend this particular version.</li>
            <li>Nay, in fact I highly recommend using this for manscaping.  </li>
            <li>The UK still sells them, I suppose you can order from there and just pay high shipping.    </li>
            <li>Provides a smooth shave with absolutely no risks of nicks .Unfortunately</li>
            <li>Trust me ladies, stick to schlick-schlicking the normal way</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched every store I could think of in the area for a new one...and nothing.</li>
            <li>Also, I usually use the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; venus refills instead of paying more for the \\&quot;vibrance\\&quot; refills.</li>
            <li>How classy is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I got this in the mail when I was 16 years old as a promotion.</li>
            <li>I thought I had to use the corresponding cartridges, but finally I inserted one of the old Venus cartridge heads and it worked exactly the same.   </li>
            <li>Bought this to replace exact same razor that I purchased back in 2005.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually considered buying another one for when this new one dies.</li>
            <li>The battery lasted quite a long time, but as soon as I replaced it the razor stopped working properly (not that it mattered, since it didn&#x27;t do anything in the first place).  </li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and will try just about anything to keep the red bumps and ingrown hairs at bay.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like vibrators, and Venus razors are amazing.  </li>
            <li>The power button on my old razor finally stopped working, and this is no longer sold in stores in the U.S.  </li>
            <li>When using other razors I have to shave more slowly</li>
            <li>I bought it last year when my trusty old regular Venus broke after several years and was instantly smitten.</li>

            <li> The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because, of course, now it is difficult, if not impossible, to get new razor heads for it.</li>
            <li> Granted, I only shave 2-3 times/week, but I think six years is still a long time for a razor to last.  </li>
            <li> My old Venus lasted a few years</li>
            <li> --maybe I&#x27;m just a no-fuss girl who really doesn&#x27;t notice subtle differences in the quality of leg-shaving.  </li>
            <li> I have used other Gillette razors but they don&#x27;t compare to the Venus Vibrance.</li>
            <li> It was such a clean shave without my cutting myself at all!  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy a second one to put away for vacations but had a hard time finding it.</li>
            <li> From my hidden vantage point I&#x27;ve seen all manner of hackery going on in the ladies locker room.  </li>
            <li> The pleasure versus pain scenario played out in my head, but alas, I decided to give the razor a try for its intended use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For facial shaving</li>
            <li> The battery lasted the few months which amazed me.</li>
            <li> When the vibrance is on, I can get around easier in harder to shave places, especially less cuts on my knees.</li>
            <li> Usually people stare at my hulking man-i-tude, or the crotch-less chaps that I wear when I go out in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to need another one again in a few years!</li>
            <li> vibrations are useless; I get the same quality shave whether it&#x27;s turned on or off.  </li>
            <li> stopped making this razor, which is why you can&#x27;t find them here - but there are still a few on ebay - get them before it&#x27;s too late!</li>
            <li> if you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as concerned about cutting myself with this razor as I have been with other ones...</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t find this on any store lately!</li>
            <li> and it worked perfectly, never dulling.</li>
            <li> This is dangerous.  </li>

            <li> I find lady blades to be stronger and more durable than man blades.  Think about it for a minute.  Man razors are used just for the face and the butt, two areas that requires delicacy and finesse.  Lady razors are used for legs, underarms, and bikini areas.  And I&#x27;ve seen how you ladies use your razors.  From my hidden vantage point I&#x27;ve seen all manner of hackery going on in the ladies locker room.  You chicks swing those things like machetes chopping through an overgrown jungle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywhoo,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While shopping in the ladies section of WalMart I discovered the Gillette Venus Vibrance Soothing Vibrations Razor.  I quickly hid it in the bottom of my cart, underneath the motor oil and next to the latest issue of Men&#x27;s Health.  Luckily for me, no one ever pays attention to my shopping cart.  Usually people stare at my hulking man-i-tude, or the crotch-less chaps that I wear when I go out in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I stood completely naked in front of a full length mirror I looked at this razor.  It&#x27;s slender and ribbed... it also vibrates...  but it&#x27;s also a razor...  The pleasure versus pain scenario played out in my head, but alas, I decided to give the razor a try for its intended use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For facial shaving I cannot recommend this razor.  The vibrations are distracting and when shaving around the corners of the nose and the contours of the chin you are more likely to cut yourself than get a close shave.  Despite the marketing, \\&quot;results in fewer nicks and cuts\\&quot; my face looks like a fresh cut steak that was ground into hamburger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, facial shaving isn&#x27;t the only think the hulking man-brute can use this razor for.  Nay, in fact I highly recommend using this for manscaping.  Nothing says, \\&quot;Ladies, I&#x27;m ready to party\\&quot; like a manscaped arrow pointing to your junk.  With this razor I&#x27;ve even managed to carve out the initials of my lady friend.  How classy is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after manscaping, clean up is a snap!  I simply leave my roommates bedroom.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace exact same razor that I purchased back in 2005. Granted, I only shave 2-3 times/week, but I think six years is still a long time for a razor to last.  The power button on my old razor finally stopped working, and this is no longer sold in stores in the U.S.  It is basically like the women&#x27;s version of Gillette&#x27;s Fusion ProGlide - Power.  It is identical to the non-power Venus or Divine razors that are still available.  There is not that much difference in the quality of leg shaving, but I find the vibrations really make a different for shaving my armpits, and although I&#x27;ve tried half-a-dozen others, I have not found any other razor, either manual or power, that does as good a job as the Venus Vibrance.  I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it online, but Gillette, please bring this razor back...I&#x27;m going to need another one again in a few years!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe this product has been discontinued! I bought it last year when my trusty old regular Venus broke after several years and was instantly smitten. The vibrations make it feel like an electric razor. I think it does a great job, better than the regular one (which is a big compliment). It&#x27;s also very lightweight, a trait of the Venus line. I decided to buy a second one to put away for vacations but had a hard time finding it. I have been lucky to find 3 or 4 on clearance racks since and bought them up. Another great prouduct with a short life span, but I am happy I found the ones on clearance.</li>
            <li> I have been looking all over for this razor. I can&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s being discontinued. But I am glad that I found it here.</li>
            <li> I just brought the venus vibrance razor last month and love it. It leave your skin soft and smooth. It didn&#x27;t nick or give you rash with bump. I love it. It is easy to use and it great for everyday use. I recommd this product to everyone to use this. It not sold in the store at all so I brought it on amazon.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find the Venus Vibrance on Amazon because I had become unable to find it in stores. I love this razor because it seems to help me cut down on nicks and irritation. When using other razors I have to shave more slowly and it hurts! My old Venus lasted a few years so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like vibrators, and Venus razors are amazing.  But deliberately putting blades on something which vibrates and is geared towards women is asking for a lawsuit.  Trust me ladies, stick to schlick-schlicking the normal way if you know what I mean.  This is dangerous.  ITS A VIBRATOR WITH BLADES!  COME ON!</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail when I was 16 years old as a promotion. I am now 21 and had just thrown it out because I couldn&#x27;t find the replacement blades for it anymore and now I&#x27;m very upset because I have now found the replacement blades again and I don&#x27;t have the handle anymore. I now have one that I don&#x27;t like and I can tell you that I WILL be ordering this online!</li>
            <li> I love this razor and unlike many other reviewers I have found the vibration to be quite useful.  I am absolutely sure that the vibrations help keep me from getting knicked and in addition, this razor (with the vibration on) gets closer than any other razor that I have ever tried.  Coupled with Coochy Shave shaving cream I never have any irritations, hair bumps, or complaints :)</li>
            <li> I love the Venus Vibrance. When I use it I never cut myself. I have used other Gillette razors but they don&#x27;t compare to the Venus Vibrance. Stores do not carry the Vibrance anymore so I bought them from Amazon.com.  I love this product.. Having been using it for years...</li>
            <li> The women&#x27;s equivelent of the Mach 3 Power Razor.  This thing takes all the hair off with no razor burn.  Great for legs and underarms.  But on the bikini area?  Leaves it as smooth as a wax job!  She looks totally bald and edible.</li>
            <li> if you wanna make your private life more fun, this is a great gift for your lovers.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my wife and she was really happy about the product. &lt;br /&gt;She personally like the product and really good.</li>
            <li> This is the *best* razor I&#x27;ve ever had. My second one died a couple of months ago (Only had to replace ONE time in over five years) and I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores around town.    Finally found it here, on Amazon- I placed an order for four of them (should last me ten years, I hope). I have no idea why they were discontinued, this truly is the best razor ever. Schick&#x27;s version (I bought the \\&quot;man\\&quot; one- a vibrating one like venus) doesn&#x27;t even come close.    For those of you out there that can&#x27;t find it- The UK still sells them, I suppose you can order from there and just pay high shipping.    Also, I usually use the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; venus refills instead of paying more for the \\&quot;vibrance\\&quot; refills. They work just as well and are cheaper and still readily available.    I wish Venus would bring back the Vibrance... it really was the best razor ever.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product,so smooth,noiseless.very easy to use also less efforts required to remove hair......i will go again for it......</li>
            <li> It is a nice sharp razor that is easy to hold and has moisturizer on it, but the vibration doesn&#x27;t seem to add to getting a closer shave.  So I wouldn&#x27;t pay any more for it than for a normal razor.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t find this on any store lately! So I&#x27;m glad I found this here! It is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve been using it since 2006</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for years..with excellent results. Provides a smooth shave with absolutely no risks of nicks .Unfortunately I cannot find this item in any retail stores.  Was so happy to find it on Amazon. I bought several and gave them to family members, who rave about them</li>
            <li> I have had a Venus Vibrance since Gillette came out with them. I have VERY sensitive skin and will try just about anything to keep the red bumps and ingrown hairs at bay. My trusty Vibrance has continued to give me a great shave, but eventually the vibration part died...probably about 6 months ago. Not bad, considering it was 4-5 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched every store I could think of in the area for a new one...and nothing. I was VERY excited to find one on Amazon. I was VERY happy to receive the package it came in. I&#x27;m VERY pleased with my new Vibrance. I am sad though...since Gillette has discontinued this excellent product. I&#x27;ve actually considered buying another one for when this new one dies.</li>
            <li> I loved this vibrating head razor, but it is out of production.  It was such a clean shave without my cutting myself at all!  The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because, of course, now it is difficult, if not impossible, to get new razor heads for it.</li>
            <li> Works well but broke in a couple of months.  I think the vibration prevents nicks but the shave isn&#x27;t as close as when you turn it off.  The battery lasted the few months which amazed me.</li>
            <li> The only reason this razor works--and the only reason I rated it with even 3 stars--is because it&#x27;s a Venus razor.  Venus razors work excellently, so when this new version came out I was excited to try it.  I&#x27;ve owned mine for over a year now, and was unimpressed with it from the moment I started using it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The vibrations are useless; I get the same quality shave whether it&#x27;s turned on or off.  The battery lasted quite a long time, but as soon as I replaced it the razor stopped working properly (not that it mattered, since it didn&#x27;t do anything in the first place).  So not only do we have a \\&quot;power\\&quot; razor that has no power, but the company decided to charge even more for replacement razor cartridges.  I thought I had to use the corresponding cartridges, but finally I inserted one of the old Venus cartridge heads and it worked exactly the same.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know--maybe I&#x27;m just a no-fuss girl who really doesn&#x27;t notice subtle differences in the quality of leg-shaving.  I would recommend Venus brand razors in a heartbeat, but I do NOT recommend this particular version.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true -- I do get about the same use from it when it&#x27;s turned on or off. But that&#x27;s what makes it so great. When the vibrance is on, I can get around easier in harder to shave places, especially less cuts on my knees. Plus it&#x27;s just a fun shaver in the pink coloring and easy to place wall mount. I loved the fact that the replacements are so cheap and they last for a long time. There was a period of time I had to use the same top for about a month or two and it worked perfectly, never dulling. I only replaced it because I felt it was safest too. I also sometimes use the women&#x27;s quatro but I personally love this one better &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all the Venus women&#x27;s razors and this is my favorite out of them all. This is the only razor I&#x27;ve used out of the line that hasn&#x27;t nicked me or cut me or left stray hairs. It leaves my legs smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this razor.  Cuts very close and is easy to use.  I&#x27;m not as concerned about cutting myself with this razor as I have been with other ones...give this a try!</li>
            <li> I use this handle with the breeze/spa breeze/olay/pro skin cartridges (no need for seperate gel/cream) and I could not be happier - a great way to have a pampered shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette stopped making this razor, which is why you can&#x27;t find them here - but there are still a few on ebay - get them before it&#x27;s too late!</li>
