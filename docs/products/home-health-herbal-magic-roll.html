    <ol>
            <li>skin irritants at best...</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very effective at odor elimination and perspiration reduction.  </li>
            <li>This one is perfect and he has been able to use it for well over one year with no alergic reaction.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy and work excellently.</li>
            <li>When the FDA and EPA are questioning chemicals, you know it can&#x27;t be good.  </li>
            <li>I like the herbal scented one better, but this is good too!  </li>
            <li>Both of these don&#x27;t even compare to Herbal Magic!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I really liked this deodorant as it seemed to work and fight any odor but after using it for a week or so, I started to get a rash and pimple-like bumps.</li>
            <li>Good ingredients :)</li>
            <li>It works the best so far...goes on well and isn&#x27;t sticky, seems to cover odor very well</li>
            <li>Wish there were more scents, but the Jasmine does seem to do a good job at covering odor.</li>
            <li>It fades throughout the day too so after a couple hours it&#x27;s a very mild but good smell.</li>
            <li>Effective (as most things with baking soda are) and like the unscented hypoallergenic nature of the product.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best that I have tried (I tried the herbal scented one too, but didn&#x27;t care for the smell).</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>(second best deodorant)&lt;br /&gt;Kiss</li>
            <li>I promise, it will get better :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>better non chemical deodorant</li>
            <li>My husband is alergic to most deodorants.  </li>
            <li>all look safe.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased and will be odering more barring any unforeseen problems with it.</li>
            <li>Love the LACK of scent and the roll-on consistency.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Crystal Essence Pomegranate Roll on Deodorant and that works OK, as well as Kiss my Face Sport Deodorant.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure if I were to workout I would need to reapply.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Most deodorant products contain aluminum.  </li>
            <li>The Herbal Magic will cover you for the daylight hours of the day.  </li>
            <li>I now like this product better.  </li>
            <li>This used to be a clean and effective deodorant.  </li>
            <li>it works GREAT and is a very natural alternative to chemical deodorants!  </li>
            <li>I went ahead and tried this Home Health deodorant again, now that I&#x27;m no longer pregnant, and I absolutely love it now!</li>
            <li>but I feel that it doesn&#x27;t really work as good.</li>
            <li>Finally I found Crystal deodorant, and it was the very best option for me while pregnant.</li>
            <li>I have no idea what the difference was hormonally that made Crystal better during pregnancy and this better for postpartum, but I&#x27;m very glad to have both in my medicine cabinet, and you really ought to try both of them, if you&#x27;re looking for natural EFFECTIVE deodorants.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be working just fine.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for individuals who have sensitive skin or want a natural product.</li>
            <li>No burn, fragrence free is just that.</li>
            <li>I urge you to use this aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li>So I bought a popular anti-perspirant and was amazed at how much longer the effect lasted.  </li>
            <li>and so I use Tom&#x27;s of Maine stick deodorant first and then apply this one on top.  </li>
            <li>Original Review</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product on the market, it works better than any other deodorant I have ever used, including aluminum based products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Crystal goes on so nicely, and you can&#x27;t feel you&#x27;re even wearing deodorant, and it minimizes odor very well, so it&#x27;s also worth a try!)&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>I think the old version works better!</li>
            <li>Good enough that I haven&#x27;t touched my Mitchum gel since using it.  </li>
            <li>It really works and Ive been through many herbal deodorants.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt; First natural deodorant I could find that keeps us smelling good at work and play.</li>
            <li>Why would this company destroy what used to be a great clean product??  </li>
            <li>Fresh Roll on Crystal</li>
            <li>I transitioned to natural deodorant more than a year ago.</li>
            <li>Economical.</li>
            <li>To me the Herbal scent smells like a cat litter box that just had some fresh cat litter</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever used a crystal, this works better, lasts longer and is far easier to use.  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day, you can easily reapply even if you&#x27;re starting to smell and it deals with the odor easily.</li>
            <li>You can put on clothes right after applying it.  </li>
            <li>Unscented version keeps me odor free for a solid 12 hours and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>Recently, the result of a very credible, long-term study was released, and aluminum intake (via deodorant or cooking pans) was ruled out in Alzheimer&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>No bad ingredients in here - Main reason we use</li>
            <li>I get that it doesn&#x27;t smell like Lavendar or something like that, but it certainly has a distinct odor.</li>
            <li>It is worth it to me because (1) I&#x27;m at very high risk of Alzheimers and am avoiding aluminum and</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Of course, since there is no aluminum, it does not protect against wetness, but that is a trade I&#x27;m willing to make for a non-toxic deodorant.</li>
            <li>This is the only healthy one I&#x27;ve tried in 15 years that works.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what led me to find a deodorant product that didn&#x27;t contain aluminum, and ultimately to Herbal Magic.  </li>
            <li>These deodorants used to be good products until a reformulation in the past year that now includes very questionabe ingredients.  </li>
            <li>that is the main reason I&#x27;m getting this!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, my Whole Foods didn&#x27;t have Howard&#x27;s brand, but the guy in the pharmacy recommended this</li>
            <li>Even after intense workouts.</li>
            <li>Gentle on your skin, no irritation or odor.  </li>
            <li>Believe it or not, this stuff really works well.</li>
            <li>I purchased both the Unscented and the Herbal scent and much prefer the Unscented version.  </li>
            <li>It is odorless and really works too.</li>
            <li>In day to day use, I really don&#x27;t even notice it at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products and this is #1 on my list.</li>
            <li>While some of the other unscented natural deodorants I have tried either smell funny or do not work, I have no complaints about Herbal Magic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more than a few natural deodorants over the years without much success.</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients sold the first bottle.</li>
            <li>plus on this one (which is a new formula) doesn&#x27;t say no aluminium!</li>
            <li>pregnant, I got this Home Health unscented deodorant, and it didn&#x27;t work for me at all, so I went back to Crystal deodorant.</li>
            <li>High C, Aubrey Organics</li>
            <li>In Hawaii it is hot an humid - this works on a average day or on a full on yard work and exercise day.</li>
            <li>info on one of the new ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;Phenoxyethanol is the new darling of the chemical industry and it is increasingly turning up in cosmetics as a preservative as an alternative to parabens.</li>
            <li>I switched to more natural products once I got pregnant, and sorely missed my Secret Clinical Strength Deodorant.</li>
            <li>but it definitely has a smell when you first put it on)</li>
            <li>For the last few months I&#x27;d been using a combination of another roll on and a powder from Lush which was ok but not exactly convenient (or cheap).</li>
            <li>Clear Sport&lt;br /&gt;Naturally</li>
            <li>While I have not seen any studies claiming a 100% correlation between using antiperspirants with aluminum and any maladies, I thought anything I am smearing under my armpits every day of my life might as well be natural.  </li>
            <li>I will admit that the Mitchum gel would work for 2-3 days, and I wouldn&#x27;t go that far with this stuff, but I haven&#x27;t needed to yet.</li>
            <li>It completely eliminates odors.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything - tons of natural deodorants, trying to kill the bacteria with Unfiltered Apple Cider Vinegar, spray deodorants-</li>
            <li>After hearing Howard Stern talk about his miracle new natural antiperspirant that actually works, I went to my local Whole Foods to grab a bottle.  </li>
            <li>I finally found a natural, unscented deodorant with no objectionable ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant that I have used that has worked for me.  </li>
            <li>Only thing I have found so far in the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; department that works for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various other natural brands over the years and none of them has worked very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty wet roll on and takes about 15 minutes to become dry to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Note it is not an antiperspirant, so you will sweat, but it doesn&#x27;t leave any stains on your clothing and doesn&#x27;t have all those crazy harmful aluminum based ingredients, so it&#x27;s very healthy as well.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After hearing Howard Stern talk about his miracle new natural antiperspirant that actually works, I went to my local Whole Foods to grab a bottle.  While I have not seen any studies claiming a 100% correlation between using antiperspirants with aluminum and any maladies, I thought anything I am smearing under my armpits every day of my life might as well be natural.  I&#x27;ve tried various other natural brands over the years and none of them has worked very well.  Tom&#x27;s of Maine was the worst, and the best was Trader Joe&#x27;s cotton stick, but it still wasn&#x27;t great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my Whole Foods didn&#x27;t have Howard&#x27;s brand, but the guy in the pharmacy recommended this and I&#x27;ve been using it every day since for months, and it&#x27;s very effective at odor elimination and perspiration reduction.  Good enough that I haven&#x27;t touched my Mitchum gel since using it.  I will admit that the Mitchum gel would work for 2-3 days, and I wouldn&#x27;t go that far with this stuff, but I haven&#x27;t needed to yet.</li>
            <li> I finally found a natural, unscented deodorant with no objectionable ingredients.  I&#x27;m so happy with this product.  This stuff works.  I can sweat and not stink.</li>
            <li> I was about to reorder and sadly discovered that this is no longer a safe option.  This used to be a clean and effective deodorant.  Then the reformulation with 2-3 chemical ingredients that you can&#x27;t pronounce...skin irritants at best...carcinogenic at worst.  When the FDA and EPA are questioning chemicals, you know it can&#x27;t be good.  Why would this company destroy what used to be a great clean product??  Don&#x27;t they understand it was WHY we bought it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some info on one of the new ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Phenoxyethanol is the new darling of the chemical industry and it is increasingly turning up in cosmetics as a preservative as an alternative to parabens. It only recently came to public attention in the US when the FDA issued a warning about its use in a cream, called Mommy Bliss, for nursing mothers. The FDA warned that phenoxyethanol can cause shut down of the central nervous system, vomiting and contact dermatitis.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) data sheets show chromosomal changes and genetic mutation effects in testing as well as testicular atrophy and interference with reproductivity in mice.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It really works and Ive been through many herbal deodorants.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more than a few natural deodorants over the years without much success. There was the one from Lush that worked but also took the skin of my underarms so overall not a success. For the last few months I&#x27;d been using a combination of another roll on and a powder from Lush which was ok but not exactly convenient (or cheap). So, when my roll on ran out about the same time a blogger I follow recommended this one I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Although it&#x27;s not strictly speaking &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; (they didn&#x27;t add any scents but it definitely has a smell when you first put it on) I absolutely love it. Whereas my previous solution would only last about 6 hours this one will last for multiple days; certainly as long as I care to go between showers.</li>
            <li> I really liked this deodorant as it seemed to work and fight any odor but after using it for a week or so, I started to get a rash and pimple-like bumps. I would still recommend for other to try and hopefully won&#x27;t get the same reaction I had!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d agree that this is Unscented.  I get that it doesn&#x27;t smell like Lavendar or something like that, but it certainly has a distinct odor.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant that I have used that has worked for me.  It completely eliminates odors.  I have tried everything - tons of natural deodorants, trying to kill the bacteria with Unfiltered Apple Cider Vinegar, spray deodorants- nothing else worked.  This is by far the best product on the market, it works better than any other deodorant I have ever used, including aluminum based products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I have tried (that didn&#x27;t work at all/as well):&lt;br /&gt;E plus High C, Aubrey Organics (second best deodorant)&lt;br /&gt;Kiss My Face- roll-on and stick&lt;br /&gt;Herbal Clear Sport&lt;br /&gt;Naturally Fresh Roll on Crystal&lt;br /&gt;Natural Tea Tree and Lavender&lt;br /&gt;Jason Unscented Stick (the worst)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative side of switching to this deodorant is that it is a liquid roll on, so I generally have to wait for it to dry before getting dressed.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well if I have to put on my shirt while it is still wet.  While it is irritating, I haven&#x27;t found a single natural deodorant solid that has worked.  Liquid seems to be the way to go.</li>
            <li> These deodorants used to be good products until a reformulation in the past year that now includes very questionabe ingredients.  I also noticed as one customer that they have a weird smell.  Have had to move on to look for something else.</li>
            <li> Effective (as most things with baking soda are) and like the unscented hypoallergenic nature of the product.</li>
            <li> This keeps me from getting stinky.  I, however, have an issue with the moisture of a roll-on.  Tends to give me a rash and so I use Tom&#x27;s of Maine stick deodorant first and then apply this one on top.  The stick creates a barrier that keeps me from getting a rash and the roll-on keeps me from getting stinky.  Only thing I have found so far in the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; department that works for me.</li>
            <li> I transitioned to natural deodorant more than a year ago. It took a lot of trial and error to find one that worked for me. This is by far the best that I have tried (I tried the herbal scented one too, but didn&#x27;t care for the smell). Others left my pits raw or under-protected...or worse, both!  When I use this deodorant, I have no odor all day. Even after intense workouts. Of course, since there is no aluminum, it does not protect against wetness, but that is a trade I&#x27;m willing to make for a non-toxic deodorant. FYI: If you have never used natural deodorants, it may take a little time for your body to &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; and adjust to the lack of aluminum. Give it time...I promise, it will get better :)</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to perfumes, chemicals and the metals in ordinary deodarant, get this. No burn, fragrence free is just that. Economical.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to feel about this product. It&#x27;s okay I guess but I feel that it doesn&#x27;t really work as good. So I&#x27;m neutral about this product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t keep the sweat away, but it does keep the oder away. The natural ingredients sold the first bottle. The way it works sold all the others.</li>
            <li> I switched to more natural products once I got pregnant, and sorely missed my Secret Clinical Strength Deodorant. All the natural deodorants I tried were insufficient at blocking smell or minimizing sweat, and they all smelled terrible combined with body odor. Finally I found Crystal deodorant, and it was the very best option for me while pregnant. (Crystal goes on so nicely, and you can&#x27;t feel you&#x27;re even wearing deodorant, and it minimizes odor very well, so it&#x27;s also worth a try!)&lt;br /&gt;While pregnant, I got this Home Health unscented deodorant, and it didn&#x27;t work for me at all, so I went back to Crystal deodorant. Now that I&#x27;ve had my baby, I no longer feel the Crystal deodorant lasts as long as I want it too (it can be hard to shower regularly enough with a brand-new baby) and you can&#x27;t reapply Crystal without cleaning off the odor first. I went ahead and tried this Home Health deodorant again, now that I&#x27;m no longer pregnant, and I absolutely love it now! It lasts all day, you can easily reapply even if you&#x27;re starting to smell and it deals with the odor easily. I have no idea what the difference was hormonally that made Crystal better during pregnancy and this better for postpartum, but I&#x27;m very glad to have both in my medicine cabinet, and you really ought to try both of them, if you&#x27;re looking for natural EFFECTIVE deodorants.</li>
            <li> I like the herbal scented one better, but this is good too!  Good ingredients :)</li>
            <li> I think the old version works better! plus on this one (which is a new formula) doesn&#x27;t say no aluminium! I don&#x27;t know why! that is the main reason I&#x27;m getting this!</li>
            <li> horrible. it doesn&#x27;t work. at least the no scent one doesn&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t buy it you will have b.o.</li>
            <li> better non chemical deodorant</li>
            <li> Only one I have found that works. In Hawaii it is hot an humid - this works on a average day or on a full on yard work and exercise day. This is the only healthy one I&#x27;ve tried in 15 years that works.</li>
            <li> My husband is alergic to most deodorants.  This one is perfect and he has been able to use it for well over one year with no alergic reaction.</li>
            <li> What else do you need to say other then - it works.</li>
            <li> Great product. Gentle on your skin, no irritation or odor.  Perfect for individuals who have sensitive skin or want a natural product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Anti-P for my entire life, but I am trying to minimize the risk of building up metals and other chemicals in my body.  I ordered this product and am using it and it seems to be working just fine.  It has absolutely no scent and the ingredients all look safe.  I am pleased and will be odering more barring any unforeseen problems with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for years, but this one has some weird smell, even though it suppose to be unscented.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this stuff really works well. I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that works without aluminum or artificial perfumes.  BUT, you can&#x27;t put it on and forget it.  Chances are you will have to reapply.  It is worth it to me because (1) I&#x27;m at very high risk of Alzheimers and am avoiding aluminum and (2) I have friends with multiple chemical sensitivities.  I will continue to buy this product, but I won&#x27;t take it to Europe with me.  It&#x27;s bad, I know, but on vacation I use just a little neosporin and it can last a week.</li>
            <li> No bad ingredients in here - Main reason we use it.&lt;br /&gt; First natural deodorant I could find that keeps us smelling good at work and play. Love the LACK of scent and the roll-on consistency.</li>
            <li> I purchased both the Unscented and the Herbal scent and much prefer the Unscented version.  To me the Herbal scent smells like a cat litter box that just had some fresh cat litter added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Unscented version keeps me odor free for a solid 12 hours and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It turned out I was allergic to everything else in existence, even the rock salt deodorants. I&#x27;ve heard you can use just straight baking soda, but that&#x27;s awkward and not user friendly. I have a bunch of these tubes of deodorant and it&#x27;s easy and work excellently. I&#x27;ve been using this specific stuff for maybe eight or so years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Crystal Essence Pomegranate Roll on Deodorant and that works OK, as well as Kiss my Face Sport Deodorant. Both of these don&#x27;t even compare to Herbal Magic! It works the best so far...goes on well and isn&#x27;t sticky, seems to cover odor very well but I&#x27;m sure if I were to workout I would need to reapply. Wish there were more scents, but the Jasmine does seem to do a good job at covering odor. It fades throughout the day too so after a couple hours it&#x27;s a very mild but good smell.</li>
            <li> Love the deodorant BUT hated that it didn&#x27;t come on time! When you need deodorant you NEED deodorant!</li>
            <li> I urge you to use this aluminum free deodorant. It is odorless and really works too. I am a woman and do not know about working for men. I can only get it online now.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.  Note it is not an antiperspirant, so you will sweat, but it doesn&#x27;t leave any stains on your clothing and doesn&#x27;t have all those crazy harmful aluminum based ingredients, so it&#x27;s very healthy as well.</li>
            <li> Update: Most deodorant products contain aluminum.  Decades ago, I read that aluminum was found in the brains of Alzheimer&#x27;s victims.  That&#x27;s what led me to find a deodorant product that didn&#x27;t contain aluminum, and ultimately to Herbal Magic.  Recently, the result of a very credible, long-term study was released, and aluminum intake (via deodorant or cooking pans) was ruled out in Alzheimer&#x27;s.  So I bought a popular anti-perspirant and was amazed at how much longer the effect lasted.  The Herbal Magic will cover you for the daylight hours of the day.  But you cannot expect to go into the next day with one application.  A chemical, supermarket product will get you into the next day with ease.  So it all depends on your priorities.     Original Review: I got scared of aluminum containing deodorants a long time ago based on Alzheimer&#x27;s causing aluminum accumulation in the brain.  I looked for alternative products.  Since then, aluminum in deodorants is no longer considered a risk factor for Alzheimer&#x27;s.  upon hearing that, I tried drug store products again and hated them.  I now like this product better.  It isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant so if you sweat prolifically it might not be for you.  It works at stopping odor for the day.  If you&#x27;ve ever used a crystal, this works better, lasts longer and is far easier to use.  It&#x27;s a pretty wet roll on and takes about 15 minutes to become dry to the touch.  You can put on clothes right after applying it.  It only irritates my skin if I&#x27;m really raw from days of hiking in humid jungle areas when I travel.  In day to day use, I really don&#x27;t even notice it at all.</li>
            <li> it works GREAT and is a very natural alternative to chemical deodorants!  I&#x27;ve tried many other products and this is #1 on my list.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for years. While some of the other unscented natural deodorants I have tried either smell funny or do not work, I have no complaints about Herbal Magic. I give it a solid recommendation.</li>
