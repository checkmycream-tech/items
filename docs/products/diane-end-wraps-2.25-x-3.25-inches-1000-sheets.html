            <li>Super fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping  product as described.  </li>
            <li>The wraps do what they are meant to do...but do not believe that you have stumbled onto a jackpot of wraps :) Such an INTENTIONALLY misleading description..smh</li>
            <li>The papers are good for single use, they are just too small for me to effectively wrap around the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li>maybe even a bit too large....</li>
            <li>They are slightly larger than what I had which is fine.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Set of 10&amp;#34; apparently really means &amp;#34;One box of end wraps.&amp;#34; There is NOTHING that is set of 10 about this item - not sorted into sets of 10, not 10 boxes, not &amp;#34;Size 10&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>I DON&#x27;T HAVE MUCH TO SAY, EXCEPT THAT</li>

            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>worked very well , order came fast</li>
            <li>and I guess the papers looked ok but had an old price sticker on it for half the amount.</li>
            <li>It looked really old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure but they pulled out more hair than just using regular perm rods.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected and because there is 1000 sheets there is plenty of them for me to use.</li>
            <li>and I think they should of taken the other sticker off at least and made sure the box wasn&#x27;t opened.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Worked as they were intended.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected and because there is 1000 sheets there is plenty of them for me to use.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Set of 10&amp;#34; apparently really means &amp;#34;One box of end wraps.&amp;#34; There is NOTHING that is set of 10 about this item - not sorted into sets of 10, not 10 boxes, not &amp;#34;Size 10&amp;#34;...nothing. There is NO REASON for that to be in the description AT ALL. The wraps do what they are meant to do...but do not believe that you have stumbled onto a jackpot of wraps :) Such an INTENTIONALLY misleading description..smh</li>
            <li> These wraps are worth the cost. They are 1000 sheets set at a cheap price. They will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> there is a lot in it and it came quick. now will have it on hand when daughter goes to state boards</li>
            <li> Really nice end papers and great for the price . Hair looks great after setting with the end papers and holds curls really well.</li>
            <li> The quality is poor as it says end wraps, the amount is the same as others brands. I will not order it again.</li>
            <li> END WRAPS ARE END WRAPS. I DON&#x27;T HAVE MUCH TO SAY, EXCEPT THAT WITHOUT THEM THE PERM WOULD BE DOOMED</li>
            <li> Good perm papers and you get a lot.</li>
            <li> Everything was just fine.</li>
            <li> The papers are good for single use, they are just too small for me to effectively wrap around the ends of my hair.  I use them when curling my hair with  foam rollers.  They may be great for perms.&lt;br /&gt; I found some neck wrap papers at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. I cut these to the length  I prefer, about twice as long as the Diane End Wraps and they are thicker . I can use one self cut wrap  several times before I need to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this product, since I was running out of my supply and could not find these end papers locally anywhere.  They are slightly larger than what I had which is fine. They come 1000 in a box and they are quite sturdy.  I use them for putting my hair up in pincurls.</li>
            <li> some pieces were not full size.</li>
            <li> Worked very well for my perm.  All ends were wrapped well.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping  product as described.  thanks</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the delivery at all. Didn&#x27;t look like the picture and when I got it the box was opened. It looked really old and I guess the papers looked ok but had an old price sticker on it for half the amount. It just looked cheap and I think they should of taken the other sticker off at least and made sure the box wasn&#x27;t opened. I have never had a problem ordering on line until now. It did appear to be on time but that was about the only good thing. Wouldn&#x27;t do business with this person again.</li>
            <li> Product is the standard end wraps to help control from ends from damage. They come in a nice dispensable box.</li>
            <li> These wraps make rolling my hair a breeze. The container is a dispenser in itself. The wraps are good quality, and I will order again. The supplier shipped quick, and made packaging efficient.</li>
            <li> They do what they say they do.  Keep those ends protected.</li>
            <li> I use it to put my daughters hair in rollers for special events.  It helps me to create a nice curl, no strands left out and no kinked pieces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional hairdresser, which is probably the reason I found these difficult to use.  They seemed a bit large, which made it hard to wrap around the curler.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Super fast Shipping! Just what I needed</li>
            <li> I ordered the box of end wraps for doing a home perm.  They arrived quickly and in good shape.  I will have enough for many more perms and they work fine.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Product was ok. but packaged badly. The products box was crushed when I got it.</li>
            <li> it works, holds up. boxes were a little smashed from shipping but still works!!&lt;br /&gt; i also use it for covering those stubborn greys on the hair line while dying clients hair. helps alot!</li>
            <li> worked very well , order came fast</li>
            <li> perfect papers for giving a home perm.....maybe even a bit too large....worked well with my perm curlers</li>
            <li> The end wraps keeps the ends smooth. I went back to rollers as the blowdrying and flat iron was damaging my hair. If you do not mind sleeping in rollers  and end wraps it is the safest thing for the hair. Rollers without end wraps does not work... the ends ususally comes out bend and frazzled. My hair is much healthy  now since I have gone back to taking better care of my hair and the end wraps help make it possible.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try them!</li>
            <li> I use these to absorb condensation on my flute and piccolo pads.  Works great,  and way cheaper than cigarette paper.</li>
            <li> worked great with the Ogilvie perm for fine hair!</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t know how to use these correctly. I asked a licensed cosmotoligist how to use them on my own. I&#x27;m not sure but they pulled out more hair than just using regular perm rods.</li>
            <li> Worked well with my flexi rods for perfect curls with no ends sticking out.</li>
            <li> A lot for the money, but are very thin! Hard to work with. But got it done anyway. Thank you!</li>
