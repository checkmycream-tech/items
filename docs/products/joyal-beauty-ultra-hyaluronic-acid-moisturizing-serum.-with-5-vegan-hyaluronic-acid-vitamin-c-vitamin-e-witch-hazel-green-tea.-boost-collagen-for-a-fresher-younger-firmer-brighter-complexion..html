            <li>I love all the Joyal Beauty products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Hey, I think my face is looking pretty good</li>
            <li>/&gt;These small-molecule serums with more active ingredients are most excellent.  </li>
            <li>I also look to more fantastic products from Joyal Beauty.</li>

            <li>I look younger and I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!  </li>
            <li>but it smells fresh and lovely.</li>
            <li>I received the Joyal Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum free to facilitate this review.  </li>
            <li>Eminence Monoi night cream available, but even that didn&#x27;t give my skin the hydration, protection and relief it needed; it just felt</li>

            <li>It is 70% organic has a light smell</li>
            <li>I did receive my product free for.</li>
            <li>I must say I&#x27;ve written a review on another product of Joyal and gave that raves too..not much more I can say than worth every penny.</li>
            <li>lol I just told I&#x27;m in relationship if he only knew!!</li>
            <li>I received this bottle free for review.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>important label claim to look for with cosmetics is paraben, sulfate, and phthalate free.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth after applying this.</li>
            <li>It explained why the order is important, which I didn’t know.</li>
            <li>That’s why a serum is so important</li>
            <li>After reading Joyal Beauty&#x27;s detailed explanation, including the how and whys</li>
            <li>I am familiar with the benefits of E as I have used pure E on my skin for helping heal the skin and scars which it works well at doing on its own, so adding E to the formula is an added benefit.</li>
            <li>serum has a slight geranium--almost a rose--perfume which I find very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>has a nice easy to dispense pump top bottle which makes it easy to use when you&#x27;re rushing through your daily skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I am starting to love this serum!!</li>
            <li>This particular HA serum is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>As I continued reading, I became more and more educated and now bearing this new wealth of knowledge</li>
            <li>Since I have experience with this type of product already, I was excited to try this brand out.</li>
            <li>What a significant gift that turned out to be!&lt;br /&gt;Feel</li>
            <li>What a significant gift that turned out to be!&lt;br /&gt;Feel</li>
            <li>I am still in the review process of my own thoughts about the products and not sure which ones are best seeing l have tried two so far.</li>
            <li>I noticed a good change instantly.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using the one I used to use as this is doing the job so much better and fast.  </li>
            <li>I do my full routine about 70% of the time.</li>
            <li>They all came in a nice, dark bottle with a handy pump dispenser.</li>

            <li>It absorbs into skin quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky feeling!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It absorbs really quickly in your skin.  </li>
            <li>Although I would have preferred a video speaking and illustrating the content, I was quite impressed by Joyal Beauty reaching out and making that extra step which reiterated exceptionally obvious care for their products AND their clients.  </li>
            <li>While I have always been pleased with the results, I have really been trying to find more natural skincare products.</li>
            <li>I first discovered these products, the ingredients passed the &amp;#34;approved list&amp;#34; test, so I ordered the Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum, the 100% Pure Botanical Hyaluronic Acid (HA) Hydrating Serum, and the Timeless Skin Renewal Serum (with all of those lovely &amp;#34;bee&amp;#34; products).  </li>
            <li>I give time between the application of each product so that it soaks in my skin before layering another on, but it&#x27;s important for dry skin to have a &amp;#34;larger molecule&amp;#34; product like the above-mentioned oil and a night crème on top of the serums to prevent the now-hydrated skin from becoming dehydrated; the thicker crème creates a protective barrier against any moisture</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue using this for several months to continue to see more improvement but so far I&#x27;m extremely impressed with these skincare serums, and I have tried a lot of different things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue using this for several months to continue to see more improvement but so far I&#x27;m extremely impressed with these skincare serums, and I have tried a lot of different things.  </li>
            <li>It dispenses the right amount of gel to use across my face and eyes, then I dispense another pump full for my neck.</li>
            <li>I had run out of the first HA serum and needed to reorder, I re-read the ingredients for this ULTRA HA MOISTURIZING serum and purchased it instead of the original HA.  </li>
            <li>Even with my next statement I really do love this product!</li>
            <li>&#x27;s a very light serum, not heavy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>E oil works to block free radicals from the body, which play a large part in the aging process.</li>
            <li>I love how the bottle looks because it has a very high end, high quality feel to it!</li>
            <li>I have kicked my skincare routine up a notch in the last few years trying to prevent any more premature aging and take very good care of myself now.</li>
            <li>It is really embarrassing posting pictures without makeup,but I want to give an accurate representation of the product.</li>
            <li>It is really embarrassing posting pictures without makeup,but I want to give an accurate representation of the product.</li>
            <li>I then massaged it in and tapped all over my face until it was completely absorbed</li>
            <li>This hyaluronic acid moisturizer makes my skin feel healthy and smooth, and it has reduced the appearance of my red splotches.</li>
            <li>This serum penetrates skins upper layers so that it can effectively deliver the ingredients into the skin.</li>
            <li>ALL opinions are my own only, and are based solely off my experience with the product itself!</li>
            <li>ALL opinions are my own only, and are based solely off my experience with the product itself!</li>
            <li>I have found my skin to be softer and more alive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Joyal Beauty has packed in some other worthwhile ingredients to make this serum even more beneficial.  </li>
            <li>The quality of this serum is as good as other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>, this is my honest opinion.e days I use a soft charcoal sponge to do a light scrubbing and then apply SPF if I’m going to be outside.</li>
            <li>Some important ingredients in this serum are: Aloe, Witch Hazel, MSM, Jojoba Oil, Green Tea, Vitamin E, and MORE!</li>
            <li>I live in the desert southwest so holding moisture is important</li>
            <li>After I used it the first time I noticed right away a tightness in my skin.</li>
            <li>That’s exactly what I’m experiencing right now.</li>
            <li>The skin (especially dry skin) needs time to adjust to this product because, while it is excellent for skin cell turnover, it can dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li>so I was able to go back and read the email and make sure I had the proper order when it came time to use the serums.</li>
            <li>I used them according to the directions, and within the first day, I could feel my skin being &amp;#34;quenched&amp;#34; of it&#x27;s need for hydration.  </li>

            <li>The company provided a coupon for a free bottle and so far, I can say that it&#x27;s quality</li>
            <li>In fact your skin will look ashen/whitish without your daily moisturizer on top of Hyaluronic products.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C goes on first, followed by Hyaluronic Serum in the morning.</li>

            <li>, Joyal has printed clearly on their label, they are free of these three classes of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Just heads up, some people have shown some reaction to Hyaluronic Acid the first time they try it.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product I apply after washing my face in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li>so it’s supposed to be applied first.</li>
            <li>Adding to that thought was the fact that this product being organic and vegan simply lessened any possibilities of harm that crossed my mind even more.</li>

            <li>This is the first Hyaluronic serum though that I have used that includes vitamin C and E in the formulation.</li>
            <li>The gel absorbs into the skin rather quickly and emits a subtle, pleasant fragrance.</li>

            <li>I use Paula’s Choice products and really like them.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>Even those few days I skipped on one or more products in my beauty regimen, this hasn&#x27;t been one of them...nor will it most likely ever be a product I opt to skip.</li>

            <li>I really didn’t think about.</li>
            <li>My face is so much softer and smoother since I started using Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum.</li>
            <li>Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum has really helped my drier areas without causing issues in my problem areas.</li>
            <li>skin is much smoother and looks better than I expected after 13 days.</li>
            <li>I have been only using Joyal Beauty for only a couple of days, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>and wow, what a difference!!!</li>
            <li>I was excited to put some of those in the back of my drawer to give these a try though.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to so many things and have to be very careful what I use, but I have had no problems whatsoever using this product.</li>
            <li>I actually really appreciate that this company doesn’t try to sell you a big, full set of stuff.</li>
            <li>So when I apply it to my face I rub the rest onto my hands and now I have healthy, soft, and revitalized hands that do not get dry or cracked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a layering process and you will not get the full benefits if you do not use this product properly.</li>
            <li>But lucky for me, I have been researching different products that claim to rejuvenate and refresh aging skin</li>
            <li>particular serum has Vitamin E and C -</li>
            <li>On those days I use a soft charcoal sponge to do a light scrubbing and then apply SPF if I’m going to be outside.</li>
            <li>I particularly like</li>
            <li>I anticipate them lasting about 6-9 months based on how much is gone out of my bottles right now.</li>
            <li>I anticipate them lasting about 6-9 months based on how much is gone out of my bottles right now.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture and scent of this all natural product.</li>
            <li>I really like the non-greasy clear lotion</li>
            <li>you Joyal &amp;#60;3 thank you for making me not only look but feel young too, you helped give me my self confidence back :)</li>
            <li>My skin is much more firm and</li>
            <li>My skin is much more firm and</li>
            <li>and I have found a truly worthy company that makes several rejuevenating products with quality, natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>C is an essential component in the body’s production of collagen1,2 and a potent antioxidant that can help rejuvenate aged and photodamaged skin.3-5.</li>
            <li>actually I Dont really wear much</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone that wants to try a high quality Hyaluronic Acid Serum that actually works and does what it&#x27;s supposed</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone that wants to try a high quality Hyaluronic Acid Serum that actually works and does what it&#x27;s supposed</li>
            <li>all my routine of products mostly all Joyals only because they haven&#x27;t come out with some other serums I use as part of my regimen.</li>
            <li>When I apply this Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum, I always make sure to add a few drops of water as well, so that the water and moisture is locked into my skin by the serum!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just 2 weeks my skin is glowing, and I have confidence because I know that I am treating my skin naturally!</li>
            <li>It advised that after a month you will see small results, but more noticeable results take time.</li>
            <li>I admit, I still had some skepticism, but by day nine, complimenting comments from others assured my trust in what I, too, was seeing and reiterated my need and want to consistently and constantly make hyaluronic acid serum a staple in my beauty</li>
            <li>I admit, I still had some skepticism, but by day nine, complimenting comments from others assured my trust in what I, too, was seeing and reiterated my need and want to consistently and constantly make hyaluronic acid serum a staple in my beauty</li>
            <li>Fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>First I cleanse, then I tone, then I use my Vitamin C serum, Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum, Joyal Royal Jelly Serum and SPF during the day and at night the same</li>
            <li>The email was very informative and included detailed instructions such as how to use and when to use and steps when using it with other types of products in my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>my smile lines have decreased by a tiny bit, I’d say about 15-20% if I had to put a number on it, although if I adhered to the routine better I also might have a little better results</li>
            <li>Because HA does not itself contain water but holds 1,000 times its weight in water, the HA serum is applied to a pretty much dripping wet face so that HA can pull all that water into the skin and plump it up.  </li>
            <li>I typically let my skin rest, a few minutes or more, and allow it to dry more naturally after cleansing.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are diminished and my skin has that brigthness I&#x27;ve been missing.  </li>
            <li>This serum is a clear liquid and has a slight odor that is similar to what most serums with hyaluronic acids smell like.</li>
            <li>It has a light texture, a little heavier than the Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li>unexpected benefit has been a difference in my nails and cuticles.  </li>
            <li>After moisturizing my face and neck, I&#x27;ve been rubbing the excess serum on my nail bed and cuticles -- they are so much softer and shinier!&lt;br /&gt;Continued use is in my future.</li>
            <li>I went back to using the thickest (and very costly)</li>
            <li>As levels of vitamin C in the skin decline with age,7 replenishing levels directly in the skin</li>
            <li>The combination of Vitamin C &amp; E produces a natural barrier to those damaging sun rays</li>
            <li>all natural, organic, non animal tested.</li>
            <li>a 21 yr old hunk asked me out well 1st stopped to give me the ole lines</li>
            <li>I did receive a free product from Joyal and their PR firm for the purpose of testing.  </li>
            <li>skin looks plump and alive...</li>
            <li>skin looks plump and alive...</li>
            <li>also less is more it goes a long way, and if u do I rub on hands arms</li>
            <li>This is really helpful because I usually forget that type of stuff quickly</li>
            <li>I am using it only twice a week (at night only) for the first month</li>
            <li>but it is slight and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>but as I get older I notice my skin is getting drier especially on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li>Have very dry, sensitive skin, but after only 2 days I began to notice a distinct difference.</li>
            <li>While vitamin C is an important nutrient for overall health, little reaches the skin when orally ingested.6</li>
            <li>Results from clinical trials show that when applied topically, vitamin C promotes collagen formation and mitigates the effects of free radicals, helping to maintain firm and youthful skin.)</li>
            <li>Joyal Beauty will email the consumer a very complete description of how to use their product/s which in my opinion benefits the user immensely.  </li>
            <li>What I like about this product it told me exactly what sequence to use the Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum with my other products.</li>
            <li>While I have tried other natural skincare products in the past, most do not compare to my preferred department store brand</li>
            <li>These are common chemical classes the cosmetic industry can use without specifically calling out on an ingredient line, or they do call out the chemical and because the classes are so huge</li>
            <li>but this was yesterday barely any makeup</li>
            <li>My skin can get dry in patches and this has really helped add that extra boost of moisture to help minimize the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These serums aren&#x27;t thick or heavy, but go on silky smooth and absorb quickly so the entire process takes only about 1 minutes, including the extra time I like to spend massaging the Ultra Hyaluronic Serum into my face and</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s the secret beauty product that most Asian women always include in their skin care regimen always.</li>
            <li>I noticed results within the first few days.</li>
            <li>I noticed results within the first few days.</li>
            <li>I see fine lines around my smile area and very faint crow’s feet.</li>
            <li>particular serum is a clear, viscous gel that is released in small amounts through a pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>Having purged my drawers and cabinets a few years ago of all things nonorganic and heavily laced with chemicals, I had been using another line of organics that seemed to work fine - until the weather changed last fall.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few products over the past couple years that contained hyaluronic acid as the main ingredient, but I never had results worth singing about.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>

            <li> I also look to more fantastic products from Joyal Beauty.</li>

            <li> It explained why the order is important, which I didn’t know.</li>
            <li> That’s why a serum is so important</li>
            <li> After reading Joyal Beauty&#x27;s detailed explanation, including the how and whys</li>
            <li> I am familiar with the benefits of E as I have used pure E on my skin for helping heal the skin and scars which it works well at doing on its own, so adding E to the formula is an added benefit.</li>
            <li> serum has a slight geranium--almost a rose--perfume which I find very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> has a nice easy to dispense pump top bottle which makes it easy to use when you&#x27;re rushing through your daily skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I am starting to love this serum!!</li>
            <li> This particular HA serum is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li> As I continued reading, I became more and more educated and now bearing this new wealth of knowledge</li>
            <li> Since I have experience with this type of product already, I was excited to try this brand out.</li>
            <li> What a significant gift that turned out to be!&lt;br /&gt;Feel</li>
            <li> What a significant gift that turned out to be!&lt;br /&gt;Feel</li>
            <li> I am still in the review process of my own thoughts about the products and not sure which ones are best seeing l have tried two so far.</li>
            <li> I noticed a good change instantly.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using the one I used to use as this is doing the job so much better and fast.  </li>
            <li> I do my full routine about 70% of the time.</li>
            <li> They all came in a nice, dark bottle with a handy pump dispenser.</li>

            <li> It absorbs into skin quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky feeling!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It absorbs really quickly in your skin.  </li>
            <li> Although I would have preferred a video speaking and illustrating the content, I was quite impressed by Joyal Beauty reaching out and making that extra step which reiterated exceptionally obvious care for their products AND their clients.  </li>
            <li> While I have always been pleased with the results, I have really been trying to find more natural skincare products.</li>
            <li> I first discovered these products, the ingredients passed the &amp;#34;approved list&amp;#34; test, so I ordered the Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum, the 100% Pure Botanical Hyaluronic Acid (HA) Hydrating Serum, and the Timeless Skin Renewal Serum (with all of those lovely &amp;#34;bee&amp;#34; products).  </li>
            <li> I give time between the application of each product so that it soaks in my skin before layering another on, but it&#x27;s important for dry skin to have a &amp;#34;larger molecule&amp;#34; product like the above-mentioned oil and a night crème on top of the serums to prevent the now-hydrated skin from becoming dehydrated; the thicker crème creates a protective barrier against any moisture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using this for several months to continue to see more improvement but so far I&#x27;m extremely impressed with these skincare serums, and I have tried a lot of different things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using this for several months to continue to see more improvement but so far I&#x27;m extremely impressed with these skincare serums, and I have tried a lot of different things.  </li>
            <li> It dispenses the right amount of gel to use across my face and eyes, then I dispense another pump full for my neck.</li>
            <li> I had run out of the first HA serum and needed to reorder, I re-read the ingredients for this ULTRA HA MOISTURIZING serum and purchased it instead of the original HA.  </li>
            <li> Even with my next statement I really do love this product!</li>
            <li> &#x27;s a very light serum, not heavy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> E oil works to block free radicals from the body, which play a large part in the aging process.</li>
            <li> I love how the bottle looks because it has a very high end, high quality feel to it!</li>
            <li> I have kicked my skincare routine up a notch in the last few years trying to prevent any more premature aging and take very good care of myself now.</li>
            <li> It is really embarrassing posting pictures without makeup,but I want to give an accurate representation of the product.</li>
            <li> It is really embarrassing posting pictures without makeup,but I want to give an accurate representation of the product.</li>
            <li> I then massaged it in and tapped all over my face until it was completely absorbed</li>
            <li> This hyaluronic acid moisturizer makes my skin feel healthy and smooth, and it has reduced the appearance of my red splotches.</li>
            <li> This serum penetrates skins upper layers so that it can effectively deliver the ingredients into the skin.</li>
            <li> ALL opinions are my own only, and are based solely off my experience with the product itself!</li>
            <li> ALL opinions are my own only, and are based solely off my experience with the product itself!</li>
            <li> I have found my skin to be softer and more alive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Joyal Beauty has packed in some other worthwhile ingredients to make this serum even more beneficial.  </li>
            <li> The quality of this serum is as good as other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> , this is my honest opinion.e days I use a soft charcoal sponge to do a light scrubbing and then apply SPF if I’m going to be outside.</li>
            <li> Some important ingredients in this serum are: Aloe, Witch Hazel, MSM, Jojoba Oil, Green Tea, Vitamin E, and MORE!</li>
            <li> I live in the desert southwest so holding moisture is important</li>
            <li> After I used it the first time I noticed right away a tightness in my skin.</li>
            <li> That’s exactly what I’m experiencing right now.</li>
            <li> The skin (especially dry skin) needs time to adjust to this product because, while it is excellent for skin cell turnover, it can dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li> so I was able to go back and read the email and make sure I had the proper order when it came time to use the serums.</li>
            <li> I used them according to the directions, and within the first day, I could feel my skin being &amp;#34;quenched&amp;#34; of it&#x27;s need for hydration.  </li>

            <li> The company provided a coupon for a free bottle and so far, I can say that it&#x27;s quality</li>
            <li> In fact your skin will look ashen/whitish without your daily moisturizer on top of Hyaluronic products.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C goes on first, followed by Hyaluronic Serum in the morning.</li>

            <li> , Joyal has printed clearly on their label, they are free of these three classes of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Just heads up, some people have shown some reaction to Hyaluronic Acid the first time they try it.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product I apply after washing my face in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> so it’s supposed to be applied first.</li>
            <li> Adding to that thought was the fact that this product being organic and vegan simply lessened any possibilities of harm that crossed my mind even more.</li>
            <li> The first part of the directions were regarding the application of the Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum.</li>

            <li> This is the first Hyaluronic serum though that I have used that includes vitamin C and E in the formulation.</li>
            <li> The gel absorbs into the skin rather quickly and emits a subtle, pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I can see fine lines becoming less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;An</li>

            <li> They also have lovely products for folks who aren&#x27;t plagued with dry skin, so check them out.</li>
            <li> It certainly added a fullness &amp; moisturized feel to my face.</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to my skincare products.</li>
            <li> I have to notice a real change</li>
            <li> I really like that this formula contain organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I am really liking this.  </li>
            <li> so much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I use Paula’s Choice products and really like them.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> Even those few days I skipped on one or more products in my beauty regimen, this hasn&#x27;t been one of them...nor will it most likely ever be a product I opt to skip.</li>

            <li> I really didn’t think about.</li>
            <li> My face is so much softer and smoother since I started using Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum.</li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum has really helped my drier areas without causing issues in my problem areas.</li>
            <li> skin is much smoother and looks better than I expected after 13 days.</li>
            <li> I have been only using Joyal Beauty for only a couple of days, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> and wow, what a difference!!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to put some of those in the back of my drawer to give these a try though.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to so many things and have to be very careful what I use, but I have had no problems whatsoever using this product.</li>
            <li> I actually really appreciate that this company doesn’t try to sell you a big, full set of stuff.</li>
            <li> So when I apply it to my face I rub the rest onto my hands and now I have healthy, soft, and revitalized hands that do not get dry or cracked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a layering process and you will not get the full benefits if you do not use this product properly.</li>
            <li> But lucky for me, I have been researching different products that claim to rejuvenate and refresh aging skin</li>
            <li> particular serum has Vitamin E and C -</li>
            <li> On those days I use a soft charcoal sponge to do a light scrubbing and then apply SPF if I’m going to be outside.</li>
            <li> I particularly like</li>
            <li> I anticipate them lasting about 6-9 months based on how much is gone out of my bottles right now.</li>
            <li> I anticipate them lasting about 6-9 months based on how much is gone out of my bottles right now.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture and scent of this all natural product.</li>
            <li> I really like the non-greasy clear lotion</li>
            <li> you Joyal &amp;#60;3 thank you for making me not only look but feel young too, you helped give me my self confidence back :)</li>
            <li> My skin is much more firm and</li>
            <li> My skin is much more firm and</li>
            <li> and I have found a truly worthy company that makes several rejuevenating products with quality, natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> C is an essential component in the body’s production of collagen1,2 and a potent antioxidant that can help rejuvenate aged and photodamaged skin.3-5.</li>
            <li> actually I Dont really wear much</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone that wants to try a high quality Hyaluronic Acid Serum that actually works and does what it&#x27;s supposed</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone that wants to try a high quality Hyaluronic Acid Serum that actually works and does what it&#x27;s supposed</li>
            <li> all my routine of products mostly all Joyals only because they haven&#x27;t come out with some other serums I use as part of my regimen.</li>
            <li> When I apply this Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum, I always make sure to add a few drops of water as well, so that the water and moisture is locked into my skin by the serum!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just 2 weeks my skin is glowing, and I have confidence because I know that I am treating my skin naturally!</li>
            <li> It advised that after a month you will see small results, but more noticeable results take time.</li>
            <li> I admit, I still had some skepticism, but by day nine, complimenting comments from others assured my trust in what I, too, was seeing and reiterated my need and want to consistently and constantly make hyaluronic acid serum a staple in my beauty</li>
            <li> I admit, I still had some skepticism, but by day nine, complimenting comments from others assured my trust in what I, too, was seeing and reiterated my need and want to consistently and constantly make hyaluronic acid serum a staple in my beauty</li>
            <li> Fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> First I cleanse, then I tone, then I use my Vitamin C serum, Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum, Joyal Royal Jelly Serum and SPF during the day and at night the same</li>
            <li> The email was very informative and included detailed instructions such as how to use and when to use and steps when using it with other types of products in my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> my smile lines have decreased by a tiny bit, I’d say about 15-20% if I had to put a number on it, although if I adhered to the routine better I also might have a little better results</li>
            <li> Because HA does not itself contain water but holds 1,000 times its weight in water, the HA serum is applied to a pretty much dripping wet face so that HA can pull all that water into the skin and plump it up.  </li>
            <li> I typically let my skin rest, a few minutes or more, and allow it to dry more naturally after cleansing.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are diminished and my skin has that brigthness I&#x27;ve been missing.  </li>
            <li> This serum is a clear liquid and has a slight odor that is similar to what most serums with hyaluronic acids smell like.</li>
            <li> It has a light texture, a little heavier than the Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> unexpected benefit has been a difference in my nails and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> After moisturizing my face and neck, I&#x27;ve been rubbing the excess serum on my nail bed and cuticles -- they are so much softer and shinier!&lt;br /&gt;Continued use is in my future.</li>
            <li> I went back to using the thickest (and very costly)</li>
            <li> As levels of vitamin C in the skin decline with age,7 replenishing levels directly in the skin</li>
            <li> The combination of Vitamin C &amp; E produces a natural barrier to those damaging sun rays</li>
            <li> all natural, organic, non animal tested.</li>
            <li> a 21 yr old hunk asked me out well 1st stopped to give me the ole lines</li>
            <li> I did receive a free product from Joyal and their PR firm for the purpose of testing.  </li>
            <li> skin looks plump and alive...</li>
            <li> skin looks plump and alive...</li>
            <li> also less is more it goes a long way, and if u do I rub on hands arms</li>
            <li> This is really helpful because I usually forget that type of stuff quickly</li>
            <li> I am using it only twice a week (at night only) for the first month</li>
            <li> but it is slight and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> but as I get older I notice my skin is getting drier especially on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> Have very dry, sensitive skin, but after only 2 days I began to notice a distinct difference.</li>
            <li> While vitamin C is an important nutrient for overall health, little reaches the skin when orally ingested.6</li>
            <li> Results from clinical trials show that when applied topically, vitamin C promotes collagen formation and mitigates the effects of free radicals, helping to maintain firm and youthful skin.)</li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty will email the consumer a very complete description of how to use their product/s which in my opinion benefits the user immensely.  </li>
            <li> What I like about this product it told me exactly what sequence to use the Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum with my other products.</li>
            <li> While I have tried other natural skincare products in the past, most do not compare to my preferred department store brand</li>
            <li> These are common chemical classes the cosmetic industry can use without specifically calling out on an ingredient line, or they do call out the chemical and because the classes are so huge</li>
            <li> but this was yesterday barely any makeup</li>
            <li> My skin can get dry in patches and this has really helped add that extra boost of moisture to help minimize the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These serums aren&#x27;t thick or heavy, but go on silky smooth and absorb quickly so the entire process takes only about 1 minutes, including the extra time I like to spend massaging the Ultra Hyaluronic Serum into my face and</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s the secret beauty product that most Asian women always include in their skin care regimen always.</li>
            <li> I noticed results within the first few days.</li>
            <li> I noticed results within the first few days.</li>
            <li> I see fine lines around my smile area and very faint crow’s feet.</li>
            <li> particular serum is a clear, viscous gel that is released in small amounts through a pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> Having purged my drawers and cabinets a few years ago of all things nonorganic and heavily laced with chemicals, I had been using another line of organics that seemed to work fine - until the weather changed last fall.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few products over the past couple years that contained hyaluronic acid as the main ingredient, but I never had results worth singing about.</li>
            <li> It also explained that serum has small molecules that penetrate further into the skin, while moisturizer has large molecules that sit on the surface.</li>
            <li> On the days I don’t wear makeup sometimes I get lazy and don’t do my whole routine every morning and night.</li>
            <li> I have long been using a daily serum from a department store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Clear, thick and consistent Hyaluronic Acid (This helps keep skin moist as well as attracts and traps</li>
            <li> ; next month I will use it every other night; finally, in the third month of use, I will apply every night.  </li>
            <li> It makes sense to apply the thinner serums prior to the thicker, but I had never really thought about the process.  </li>
            <li> and I rank it a superior product.</li>
            <li> I usually quantify my review of products like this by saying as a guy, that I have little experience with using these types of things and really only started trying them in recent years as I have gotten older.</li>
            <li> also made from bee products (the latter are other brands).  </li>
            <li> I started using it acouple weeks ago, started with just a little application in the evening followed by a deep moisturizer and then gradually added a second application in the morning- again followed by moisturizer -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely looking forward to trying other Joyal Beauty products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely looking forward to trying other Joyal Beauty products.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry anymore the day I started using it, even in the office when the heater is on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s winter, and with the forced-air heat blowing away (despite an attached humidifier), my already-dry skin was flaking, itchy, and miserably dry.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my hands since my hands are almost always severely dry!</li>
            <li> I also use it on my hands since my hands are almost always severely dry!</li>
            <li> When I was extended an opportunity to try the Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum by Joyal Beauty, I accepted easily with the thought that based on my previous experiences of no results, at least I didn&#x27;t have any negative results.</li>
            <li> While l see a slight improvement in the eye area, my cause of concern is the sudden breakout of acne on my cheek and chin area.</li>
            <li> I noticed the others ive used are very runny also Joyal uses pumps where other manufacturers use droppers as I had said I&#x27;ve wasted bottles just from bottle tipping or slipping ffrom my hand &amp; on my bed or me money down drain!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing, feels like it locks in all the water in my skin and gives it a supple feel all night long.</li>
            <li> It helps to plump up the tiny little lines around your eyes and mouth too</li>
            <li> They used to show up really bad when I applied makeup, now when I wear makeup it looks so much better.</li>
            <li> so according to the instructions you use this one immediately after while your skin is still wet, (or dampen your skin before you apply it</li>
            <li> I have noticed over the last few years that my skin doesn&#x27;t have the brightness and vitality that it used to.  </li>
            <li> Because of this, this product recommends that you apply the serum while your face is still wet and immediately after apply a moisturizer layer in order to give your skin maximum health and appearance benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received the product a few weeks back</li>
            <li> I started using this Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum in combination with two other products from this company: the Vitamin C serum and the Retinol Correcting Serum.</li>
            <li> the small red areas I used to have are gone.</li>
            <li> I threw out my other stuff and am just going to use this and the other serums that Joyal makes.</li>
            <li> This helps pull water, and apparently other products, into the skin.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night after the other two serums, before my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> In just a few days, all the dry skin/eczema patches were GONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I’m 32 years old and starting to pay the price for being careless with my skin for my teens and 20’s.</li>
            <li> I have less rough patches and flakiness.</li>
            <li> This serum is made from only sustainable and biodegradable raw materials and is vegan!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a couple of weeks but it has already improved the appearance of my skin.  No elasticity changes but complexion changes are noticeable, my skin is brighter and smoother, and I did not break out with it.  I use it every night and after a glycolic peel that is medical grade (30%).  Very good product.</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to my skincare products. I have to notice a real change or else I will move on to something else. Of course you must give products some time to work, your skin may take several regeneration cycles to show changes. I started using this Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum in combination with two other products from this company: the Vitamin C serum and the Retinol Correcting Serum. The first thing that impressed me after I placed my order was I received an in-depth email for each product regarding the correct way to use it (including the correct order to use each product in) and the benefits of each product. This is really helpful because I usually forget that type of stuff quickly so I was able to go back and read the email and make sure I had the proper order when it came time to use the serums. They arrived in Amber glass bottles with droppers. This serum has a very pleasant light floral scent. I can&#x27;t place it but it smells fresh and lovely. It has a light texture, a little heavier than the Vitamin C serum so according to the instructions you use this one immediately after while your skin is still wet, (or dampen your skin before you apply it so your skin has moisture to absorb with the serum) and can use it in the morning or both morning and night. I then massaged it in and tapped all over my face until it was completely absorbed (it only took about one minute) and this also helps increase circulation and boost the effects of the serums. I didn&#x27;t have any adverse effects or problems with itching, rashes or anything like that. My skin can get dry in patches and this has really helped add that extra boost of moisture to help minimize the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Since I am using three products at once I am assuming the combination of these products gave my skin a triple dose of care and nourishment. Vitamin C for brightening and skin correcting, hyaluronic acid for moisturizing and Retinol for anti-aging. My skin looks bright, even, clear and healthy. I&#x27;m going to continue using this for several months to continue to see more improvement but so far I&#x27;m extremely impressed with these skincare serums, and I have tried a lot of different things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Product sent by Joyal Beauty for testing and review)and healthy.

            <li> This vegan hyaluronic acid serum is thick, but not lotion-greasy, and it provides a thin layer of moisture to your face.  Although injectable hyaluronic acid plumps out wrinkles, topical formulas such as this Joyal Beauty one act by providing instant moisture to thirsty skin.  I really like that this formula contain organic ingredients.  In addition to hyaluronic acid, it contains some ingredients believed to have skin health and antioxidant properties:  aloe, green tea, witch hazel, jojoba oil, geranium extract, and vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and this Joyal Beauty hyaluronic acid serum is soothing rather than irritating.  Note:  I received a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Joyal Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum for about two weeks. It has really helped my skin to stay supple and moisturized even this terrible heat of Southeast Georgia.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very light serum, not heavy or sticky.  It absorbs fast.&lt;br /&gt;I love to use it around my eyes: in the morning after my shower and at night before bedtime. It works great on my neck, too. I can see fine lines becoming less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;An unexpected benefit has been a difference in my nails and cuticles.  After moisturizing my face and neck, I&#x27;ve been rubbing the excess serum on my nail bed and cuticles -- they are so much softer and shinier!&lt;br /&gt;Continued use is in my future. I received the Joyal Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum free to facilitate this review.  All opinions are my own and based on my use of and experience with the item.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry anymore the day I started using it, even in the office when the heater is on.</li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty will email the consumer a very complete description of how to use their product/s which in my opinion benefits the user immensely.  It makes sense to apply the thinner serums prior to the thicker, but I had never really thought about the process.  Since I tend to use a Vitamin C serum, I was unsure as to whether or not I needed the Hyaluronic Acid Serum, but I am very happy to be using both.  This is applied onto a just cleansed and damp face for best benefits, so I have been using it at night prior to my retinol application.  I am really liking this.  A sample was provided for review.</li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty serums work!  This one is no exception.  It&#x27;s winter, and with the forced-air heat blowing away (despite an attached humidifier), my already-dry skin was flaking, itchy, and miserably dry.  Having purged my drawers and cabinets a few years ago of all things nonorganic and heavily laced with chemicals, I had been using another line of organics that seemed to work fine - until the weather changed last fall.  I have never experienced &amp;#34;dry skin&amp;#34; (almost eczema-like conditions) around my nasolabial folds like I did this year.  I went back to using the thickest (and very costly) Eminence Monoi night cream available, but even that didn&#x27;t give my skin the hydration, protection and relief it needed; it just felt sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first discovered these products, the ingredients passed the &amp;#34;approved list&amp;#34; test, so I ordered the Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum, the 100% Pure Botanical Hyaluronic Acid (HA) Hydrating Serum, and the Timeless Skin Renewal Serum (with all of those lovely &amp;#34;bee&amp;#34; products).  I used them according to the directions, and within the first day, I could feel my skin being &amp;#34;quenched&amp;#34; of it&#x27;s need for hydration.  Because HA does not itself contain water but holds 1,000 times its weight in water, the HA serum is applied to a pretty much dripping wet face so that HA can pull all that water into the skin and plump it up.  In just a few days, all the dry skin/eczema patches were GONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I had run out of the first HA serum and needed to reorder, I re-read the ingredients for this ULTRA HA MOISTURIZING serum and purchased it instead of the original HA.  The results have been even better!  This particular HA serum is truly amazing.  My skin looks (not just &amp;#34;gives the appearance of&amp;#34;) AND FEELS younger.  I have also recently added the Retinol Correcting Serum with 1% Retinol which I&#x27;m slowing incorporating into my skincare routine.  I am using it only twice a week (at night only) for the first month; next month I will use it every other night; finally, in the third month of use, I will apply every night.  The skin (especially dry skin) needs time to adjust to this product because, while it is excellent for skin cell turnover, it can dry out the skin.  I top my Retinol application with the Timeless Renewal Serum (with the healing properties of the hive).  After those products have soaked in, I layer with an organic Moroccan oil, and finally a thicker &amp;#34;night crème&amp;#34; also made from bee products (the latter are other brands).  I give time between the application of each product so that it soaks in my skin before layering another on, but it&#x27;s important for dry skin to have a &amp;#34;larger molecule&amp;#34; product like the above-mentioned oil and a night crème on top of the serums to prevent the now-hydrated skin from becoming dehydrated; the thicker crème creates a protective barrier against any moisture loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These small-molecule serums with more active ingredients are most excellent.  I would recommend them to anyone!!  They also have lovely products for folks who aren&#x27;t plagued with dry skin, so check them out.</li>
            <li> Good product. Small package</li>
            <li> I really like the texture and scent of this all natural product. All the women in my family use Hyaluronic Acid as the base of their moisturizers already. In fact, it&#x27;s the secret beauty product that most Asian women always include in their skin care regimen always. Since I have experience with this type of product already, I was excited to try this brand out. The company provided a coupon for a free bottle and so far, I can say that it&#x27;s quality stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Clear, thick and consistent Hyaluronic Acid (This helps keep skin moist as well as attracts and traps moisture deeply into the skin)&lt;br /&gt;-Includes Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;(Vitamin C is an essential component in the body’s production of collagen1,2 and a potent antioxidant that can help rejuvenate aged and photodamaged skin.3-5. While vitamin C is an important nutrient for overall health, little reaches the skin when orally ingested.6 As levels of vitamin C in the skin decline with age,7 replenishing levels directly in the skin can help combat collagen degradation and oxidative stress. Results from clinical trials show that when applied topically, vitamin C promotes collagen formation and mitigates the effects of free radicals, helping to maintain firm and youthful skin.) (...)&lt;br /&gt;-Includes Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;(Vitamin E oil works to block free radicals from the body, which play a large part in the aging process. If we can fight off free radicals, then we can reduce wrinkles and keep the skin youthful-looking. (...)&lt;br /&gt;-Sun Protection- The combination of Vitamin C &amp; E produces a natural barrier to those damaging sun rays&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, Hyaluronic serums are great for all skin types however, you MUST follow this step with a moisturizing cream or lotion afterwards. It&#x27;s a layering process and you will not get the full benefits if you do not use this product properly. In fact your skin will look ashen/whitish without your daily moisturizer on top of Hyaluronic products.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this serum.  .my skin is much smoother and looks better than I expected after 13 days. I  did a test of the product on my arm before trying it on my face. ..it was fine It is 70% organic has a light smell and I am Harry with my results I did use it in the morning and evening every day on cleansed and toned skin .but I know I still need an SPF daily to avoid sun damage ..a bit of youth in a bottle  !!!!! A bit of youth in a bottle .At 54 I needed this to help my skin ..it worked Great. Disclaimer I did receive my product free for. An opinion that is my own and honest</li>
            <li> This hyaluronic serum is keeping my skin nicely hydrated.  It looks like my facial skin is &amp;#34;lifted&amp;#34; and fuller, with an energized and almost bouncy look.  Hey, I think my face is looking pretty good these days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum has a slight geranium--almost a rose--perfume which I find very pleasant.  I apply it after I cleanse and tone (witch hazel) my face, and before I moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal Beauty has packed in some other worthwhile ingredients to make this serum even more beneficial.  It contains my all time favorite witch hazel, has Vitamim C and Vitamin E.  It has aloe, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Joyal Beauty.</li>
            <li> I must say I&#x27;ve written a review on another product of Joyal and gave that raves too..not much more I can say than worth every penny. I love the feel of this product going on your face, I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand of hyaluronic acid on Amazon but this is the best from others, it has some extra goodies that just make it 100% better. I noticed the others ive used are very runny also Joyal uses pumps where other manufacturers use droppers as I had said I&#x27;ve wasted bottles just from bottle tipping or slipping ffrom my hand &amp; on my bed or me money down drain! all my routine of products mostly all Joyals only because they haven&#x27;t come out with some other serums I use as part of my regimen. I have to tell you because I was in total shock I use all Joyals products all natural, organic, non animal tested. I&#x27;ve tried every store and infomercials brands of beauty creams. Since I&#x27;ve been using I&#x27;ve taken many years off my skin &amp; my body, neck, hands declotte Dont forget those too..but while coming home from a walk without all my hair done or makeup a 21 yr old hunk asked me out well 1st stopped to give me the ole lines lol I just told I&#x27;m in relationship if he only knew!! I&#x27;m 51 going to be 52 the 28th of this mo..and I&#x27;m not bothered by it at all..I sware I&#x27;ve never gotten botox or fillers couldn&#x27;t afford even if I wanted and I wouldn&#x27;t..just had to share so if your thinking about don&#x27;t hesitate just try it I promise you won&#x27;t be dissapointed..also less is more it goes a long way, and if u do I rub on hands arms I already always do neck and declotte area..I hate my pic taken but this was yesterday barely any makeup actually I Dont really wear much but my brows and lips a must ..lol, so hear I am..&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Joyal &amp;#60;3 thank you for making me not only look but feel young too, you helped give me my self confidence back :)</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid, whether you use it in serum form or added into the skin care products you use on your skin, is a must have for helping your skin stay moisturized. I have been using hyaluronic acid serum for a little over a year now in one form or another and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Hyaluronic Acid serum is very nice! Vitamin C, vitamin E, green tea, and witch hazel are also included in this bottle of serum. Hyaluronic acid helps attract moisture to your skin, used along with a nice moisturizer it is the perfect serum to use after cleansing your face before going to bed at night. It helps to plump up the tiny little lines around your eyes and mouth too so your face looks more refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing my face at night I use hyaluronic acid serum, then I add a few drops of either vitamin C serum or a correcting serum followed by a few drops of either evening primrose oil, or jojoba oil. My skin looks so much better, more even toned and the small red areas I used to have are gone. I do still have some fine lines around my eyes and mouth, but they aren&#x27;t as pronounced as they used to be. They used to show up really bad when I applied makeup, now when I wear makeup it looks so much better. Even my husband has noticed a difference. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a nice easy to dispense pump top bottle which makes it easy to use when you&#x27;re rushing through your daily skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Free product sample received in exchange for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I have noticed over the last few years that my skin doesn&#x27;t have the brightness and vitality that it used to.  This makes me sad. But lucky for me, I have been researching different products that claim to rejuvenate and refresh aging skin and I have found a truly worthy company that makes several rejuevenating products with quality, natural ingredients.  One of these products is Joyal Hyaluronic Acid Serum!  I started using it acouple weeks ago, started with just a little application in the evening followed by a deep moisturizer and then gradually added a second application in the morning- again followed by moisturizer - and I LOVE the results. Fine lines are diminished and my skin has that brigthness I&#x27;ve been missing.  I should have started using this ten years ago, but who knew?  If you are on the fence about the probable benefits of HA...try this one, TODAY! I did receive a free product from Joyal and their PR firm for the purpose of testing.  My review is my own honest opinion and I am happy to declare that I love it!!</li>
            <li> This hyaluronic acid moisturizer makes my skin feel healthy and smooth, and it has reduced the appearance of my red splotches. This serum is nourishing to my skin with Vitamin C, vitamin E, green tea, and witch hazel.  I like the pump on this bottle. It dispenses the right amount of gel to use across my face and eyes, then I dispense another pump full for my neck. So with only using 2 pumpfuls at a time this bottle will last quite awhile. I received this bottle free for review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about Hyaluronic acid but never had the opportunity to try one until now. This Ultra Hyaluronic Serum erum from Joyal Beauty is light, very neutral in scent and makes my skin feel wonderful. Have very dry, sensitive skin, but after only 2 days I began to notice a distinct difference. My skin is is softer, moister and feels more plump than ever before. I spent the entire day today out in the sun, hatless, and my skin tonight is still soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with the Joyal Beauty Retinol Serum and Vitamin C Serum daily. The Vitamin C goes on first, followed by Hyaluronic Serum in the morning. At night, I use Vitamin C again and follow that with Ultra Hyaluronic and finally, Retinol. These serums aren&#x27;t thick or heavy, but go on silky smooth and absorb quickly so the entire process takes only about 1 minutes, including the extra time I like to spend massaging the Ultra Hyaluronic Serum into my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest surprise wasn&#x27;t how well this product works, although it is impressive. I was shocked at the SPEED with which it works. Quite literally two days were all the were needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Product samples provided for test and review.**</li>
            <li> This 5% hyaluronic vegan serum is a solid addition to your daily/nightly skin regiment. Serums are typically a &#x27;step 2&#x27; product. Step 1 being cleansing and toning followed by step 2 - in which serum is applied - followed by step 3 where moisturizer/sunscreen is utilized. The benefits of hyaluronic acid serum comes from its ability to penetrate deeply into the skin and draw in external moisture. Because of this, this product recommends that you apply the serum while your face is still wet and immediately after apply a moisturizer layer in order to give your skin maximum health and appearance benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular serum is a clear, viscous gel that is released in small amounts through a pump dispenser. The gel absorbs into the skin rather quickly and emits a subtle, pleasant fragrance. Paired with a good quality moisturizer the skin looks great as it reaps the rewards of nourishing hydration (product sample provided for review).</li>

It comes in a 1 fl oz. dark glass, pump bottle. The dark glass AND pump ensures that the serum stays fresher - longer! I love how the bottle looks because it has a very high end, high quality feel to it! I use this serum morning and night. When I apply this Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum, I always make sure to add a few drops of water as well, so that the water and moisture is locked into my skin by the serum!

            <li> I have tried this product for two days twice a day as directed an I do notice some diminished fine lines around my eyes &amp; mouth area. After I used it the first time I noticed right away a tightness in my skin. Not to mention the nice healthy way my skin feels after just two days. I world definitely recommend this product. It certainly added a fullness &amp; moisturized feel to my face. I receive this product for testing and unbiased evaluation.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have long been using a daily serum from a department store. While I have always been pleased with the results, I have really been trying to find more natural skincare products. While I have tried other natural skincare products in the past, most do not compare to my preferred department store brand BUT this serum is superior to the department store serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just 2 weeks my skin is glowing, and I have confidence because I know that I am treating my skin naturally!</li>
            <li> Given To Me For An Honest Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal Beauty THE BEST Organic Vegan 5% Vegan Hyaluroni Acid Vitamin C &amp; Vitamin E by Joyal Beauty is a must have in order to keep your face moisturized. This product is 100% vegan and is 72% organic.Since I have been using it I have found my skin much more softer. It looks and feels so much better and much more moisturized. I am allergic to so many things and have to be very careful what I use, but I have had no problems whatsoever using this product. I have tried others but this by far is the best. I highly recommend it to all. I also look to more fantastic products from Joyal Beauty.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to soften my skin and not worry about animal testing or the controversy that comes with that issue.  The Joval has no fragrance, so I can spritz my favorite purfume on and not worry about competing scents.  It’s also hyper-allergenic - I don’t know if they claim that, but if I can tolerate it, it must be thus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample for review.  I really like the non-greasy clear lotion and I rank it a superior product.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product!! I have used it for 4 days and my face and neck are staying hydrated and feel great! I would recommend this to any one. I live in the desert southwest so holding moisture is important and this is great! I have even found I need less of my moisturizer  after applying this serum. Even with my next statement I really do love this product! &amp;#34;I receive this product for testing purpose and unbiased evaluation.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  I saw an ad that a lot of face creams contained vitamin c and hylauronic acid.  I thought I will try this.  It is amazing.  It&#x27;s been 3 weeks and my face looks wonderful.  I threw out my other stuff and am just going to use this and the other serums that Joyal makes.</li>
            <li> Very nice but was hoping for something thinner, more oily.</li>
            <li> I think I am starting to love this serum!! I had been using it at night time while using the vitamin C serum at day time but tonight I used it before going out for dinner and wow, what a difference!!! It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing, feels like it locks in all the water in my skin and gives it a supple feel all night long. I am thinking maybe I should be using this serum for day time instead and see whether it will be able to do the miracle to me as it did tonight.</li>
            <li> I noticed a good change instantly. After using this product for weeks, I received many compliments. I look younger and I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!  I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Joyal has four different serums that are all very similar. This serum has a gel like consistency that is easy to apply. It has virtually no odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An important label claim to look for with cosmetics is paraben, sulfate, and phthalate free. These are common chemical classes the cosmetic industry can use without specifically calling out on an ingredient line, or they do call out the chemical and because the classes are so huge, a consumer can never figure out one of these three are in the cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great news, Joyal has printed clearly on their label, they are free of these three classes of chemicals. That&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular serum has Vitamin E and C - both shown to be excellent for skin health. And it contains hyaluronic acid; a compound shown to improve collagen development in skin cells (makes cells fatter so wrinkles disappear). These are all wonderful things to have in a skin treatment. There is a complex mixture of herb and plant extracts in this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply this after you have exfoliated or cleaned your skin. Then apply a moisturizer. For men, that&#x27;s about all you need to do. For women, it is best to apply at night; makeup tends to flake off if use this in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found this to help a lot with razor burn; I have a lot less rash around my neck. My skin feels smooth after applying this. It works well on tender areas. My wife&#x27;s skin glows more than it ever did. She wears less makeup and looks wonderful. It has softened her skin a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results of this serum.  I have used Hyaluronic acid in a serum form before always with great results.  I also have taken the supplement in a capsule and I know it&#x27;s great aid against inflammation.  My skin feels nice and smooth.  It looks brighter and more supple.  I use one pump in the morning under my moisturizer and one at night before I use some oils (Argan or Avocado).  Just heads up, some people have shown some reaction to Hyaluronic Acid the first time they try it.  I have sensitive skin but have had not bad reaction to it.  Definitely a keeper, so glad I had a chance to review this serum.</li>
            <li> I really love this serum, its the best one I have tried.  I use it morning and evening after I washed and toned my skin.  The results are showing after using it less than 2 weeks.  I have stopped using the one I used to use as this is doing the job so much better and fast.  My skin looks and feels better, hydrated and softer. It absorbs really quickly in your skin.  And I have found this is helping with dark spots and uneven tones. Make be feel younger too!  I receive this product for testing purpose and unbiased evaluation</li>
            <li> I’m 32 years old and starting to pay the price for being careless with my skin for my teens and 20’s. Smoking, tanning and just being generally careless with myself has taken its toll. I see fine lines around my smile area and very faint crow’s feet. I have kicked my skincare routine up a notch in the last few years trying to prevent any more premature aging and take very good care of myself now. I eat well, drink a ton of water and wear SPF religiously. I fully realize that there are no miracle products. From what I understand, dramatic results require surgery, skin care products have the potential to help with minor changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I’ve incorporated the Vitamin C serum, Hyaluronic acid and Retinol from this company into my skin care routine. I’m going to just post a brief summary of the products and how they’ve worked for me:&lt;br /&gt;• Vitamin C: This is the first product I apply after washing my face in the morning and at night. It’s thinner so it’s supposed to be applied first. It rubs in well and absorbs within about 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;• Hyaluronic acid: This helps pull water, and apparently other products, into the skin. I apply this serum shortly after the Vitamin C. The instructions note that it doesn’t product water, it helps pull water into the skin, so they recommend you put on a damp face.&lt;br /&gt;• Retinol: I am always hearing about how great retinol is for the skin, so I think it’s probably a beneficial component. I put it on at night after the other two serums, before my moisturizer. My skin feels nice and smooth after all the serums and retinol. Even with all of them on, there is no stinging, drying or any other unpleasant side effects.&lt;br /&gt;• Instructions: One thing that really impressed me was that after I ordered the products I got an email regarding each product with wonderful information and instructions. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve got products and either I’m like “why do I need this” or “when do I use this” or “can I use this with _____ product”. The email explained each product in detail along with step by step instructions for using them together. It explained why the order is important, which I didn’t know. It also explained that serum has small molecules that penetrate further into the skin, while moisturizer has large molecules that sit on the surface. That’s why a serum is so important, I didn’t know that either. I was EXTREMELY impressed with how helpful the information was!&lt;br /&gt;• Routine:  I use Paula’s Choice products and really like them. I was excited to put some of those in the back of my drawer to give these a try though. I still used my face wash, toner and moisturizer from my Paula’s Choice line. I actually really appreciate that this company doesn’t try to sell you a big, full set of stuff. They say in their introductory email to use whichever cleanse, toner and moisturizer that you like.&lt;br /&gt;• Results: Another thing the introductory email said was that it takes awhile to see results with retinol. It advised that after a month you will see small results, but more noticeable results take time. That’s exactly what I’m experiencing right now. I am a month and a half into it and I see some small results. I do so my smile lines have decreased by a tiny bit, I’d say about 15-20% if I had to put a number on it, although if I adhered to the routine better I also might have a little better results The email also points out that Retinol and SPF products are the #1 thing we can do to prevent aging, which I’ve heard time and time again. Just having the company being realistic and give good information makes me trust their brand so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me admit something real quick. I do my full routine about 70% of the time. I only work 2 days a week and wear makeup about 3 days a week. On the days I don’t wear makeup sometimes I get lazy and don’t do my whole routine every morning and night. On those days I use a soft charcoal sponge to do a light scrubbing and then apply SPF if I’m going to be outside. I have seen good results with this product, but I think I would probably see even more results if I adhered to it better. I have no complaints about it and am very happy with the products. They all came in a nice, dark bottle with a handy pump dispenser. I anticipate them lasting about 6-9 months based on how much is gone out of my bottles right now. I&#x27;m putting up pictures of my face after using this for a little over a month. It is really embarrassing posting pictures without makeup,but I want to give an accurate representation of the product. I will try to remember to add pictures every month or so. I was sent these for testing and review. That has no bearing on the rating or review I give a product, this is my honest opinion.e days I use a soft charcoal sponge to do a light scrubbing and then apply SPF if I’m going to be outside.

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few products over the past couple years that contained hyaluronic acid as the main ingredient, but I never had results worth singing about. I definitely didn&#x27;t have any impressive results like so others I read about. When I was extended an opportunity to try the Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum by Joyal Beauty, I accepted easily with the thought that based on my previous experiences of no results, at least I didn&#x27;t have any negative results. Adding to that thought was the fact that this product being organic and vegan simply lessened any possibilities of harm that crossed my mind even more. I was actually feeling rather hopeful, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day before my package was scheduled to arrive, I received a surprising email from Joyal Beauty. Although I would have preferred a video speaking and illustrating the content, I was quite impressed by Joyal Beauty reaching out and making that extra step which reiterated exceptionally obvious care for their products AND their clients.  The email was very informative and included detailed instructions such as how to use and when to use and steps when using it with other types of products in my beauty regimen. The first part of the directions were regarding the application of the Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum. Embarrassingly I admit, fail number one, as it turns out, was that I never applied the serum properly...not even the slightest bit properly. I typically let my skin rest, a few minutes or more, and allow it to dry more naturally after cleansing. After reading Joyal Beauty&#x27;s detailed explanation, including the how and whys it&#x27;s best applied immediately to just cleansed and still wet skin, it made perfect sense. As I continued reading, I became more and more educated and now bearing this new wealth of knowledge I, in turn, became even more excited and hopeful and couldn&#x27;t wait to begin using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is my 14th day using the Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum with 5% Vegan Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamins C &amp; E. I haven&#x27;t missed even one day or evening application! Even those few days I skipped on one or more products in my beauty regimen, this hasn&#x27;t been one of them...nor will it most likely ever be a product I opt to skip. I noticed results within the first few days. I admit, I still had some skepticism, but by day nine, complimenting comments from others assured my trust in what I, too, was seeing and reiterated my need and want to consistently and constantly make hyaluronic acid serum a staple in my beauty regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks plump and alive...it looks happy! My makeup applies better and even lasts longer throughout the day maintaining a sheerness and glow. All this without ever having any irritation or increased sensitivity! I&#x27;m definitely looking forward to trying other Joyal Beauty products. I fully believe I would have been where I was before when using similar products, too, with no results if it wasn&#x27;t for that email they sent me. What a significant gift that turned out to be!&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to contact me directly with any questions.

            <li> I have been only using Joyal Beauty for only a couple of days, but so far so good. I have found my skin to be softer and more alive. I will update as more time goes on.   Update: l have been using this product now for a little over a week now. While l see a slight improvement in the eye area, my cause of concern is the sudden breakout of acne on my cheek and chin area. In reading the reviews  i&#x27;m wondering is the reason they are all really great because they were able to try free products for their opinion.  I am still in the review process of my own thoughts about the products and not sure which ones are best seeing l have tried two so far. I will update again as time progresses to see more how it works for me over time.</li>
            <li> I usually quantify my review of products like this by saying as a guy, that I have little experience with using these types of things and really only started trying them in recent years as I have gotten older. A facial care routine was something as a younger man I really didn’t think about. Sometimes with the variety of brand names with similar products, it really is hard to figure out which product to choose. Although there are variations in the products, a lot of brands appear to be from the same manufacturing source. This is the first Hyaluronic serum though that I have used that includes vitamin C and E in the formulation. I am familiar with the benefits of E as I have used pure E on my skin for helping heal the skin and scars which it works well at doing on its own, so adding E to the formula is an added benefit. This serum is a clear liquid and has a slight odor that is similar to what most serums with hyaluronic acids smell like. It is not a smell I particularly like but it is slight and goes away quickly. The quality of this serum is as good as other brands I have tried. It absorbs quickly into the skin without any greasy residue or skin irritation and is a good supplement to a moisturizer. Price wise this is in the range of what similar formulated products sell for, although a lot sell without Vitamin E included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum works wonders on my skin. I&#x27;ve received the product a few weeks back I wanted like to give the a product a chance to work before a give an review especially a facial care product. The Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum contains Vitamin C &amp; E and is 72% organic. What I love about this serum it is alcohol-free, non-comedogenic,100% vegan, paraben-free, and phthalate-free. My face is so much softer and smoother since I started using Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum. Fine lines are less noticeable. I have less rough patches and flakiness. I love that Joyal sends you an e-mail when you place your order explaining about the product and how to use the serum. What I like about this product it told me exactly what sequence to use the Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum with my other products. I use the Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum twice a day. First I cleanse, then I tone, then I use my Vitamin C serum, Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum, Joyal Royal Jelly Serum and SPF during the day and at night the same but I use a Joyal Retinol Serum and moisturizer. I have combination skin but as I get older I notice my skin is getting drier especially on my cheeks and forehead. Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum has really helped my drier areas without causing issues in my problem areas. I love all the Joyal Beauty products I have tried. I would definitely recommend this serum as well. I received this product for testing purposes and unbiased evaluation.</li>
