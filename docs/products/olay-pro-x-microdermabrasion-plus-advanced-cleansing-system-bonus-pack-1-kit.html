            <li>I am thinking of getting one for my mom, i think she would love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it, but also glad I didn&#x27;t buy the $100 one out there on the market.</li>
            <li>I would like to see more attachments with this product in addition to the cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.  </li>
            <li>Love it makes my skin feel cleaner and smoother</li>
            <li>I use clean and clear&#x27;s foaming cleanser instead and that works excellent with this system.  </li>
            <li>I reduced the blackheads that most people, myself included, get on your nose and is amazing as a full face scrubbing device.  </li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the forehead, chin and neck, especially if you break out easily in those areas.  </li>
            <li>The exfoliating cream is great, it has smaller particles that don&#x27;t feel like sand on the skin.</li>
            <li>lotion was a great surprise since I ran out a couple weeks later.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, provides quick results, multi-functional</li>
            <li>If used this the correct facial products it works amazing!  </li>
            <li>Im still working with the original brushes and buffers that came with the device.  </li>
            <li>I am excited to polish it tonight.</li>
            <li>Of course it doesn&#x27;t magically make you younger like we all wish, but it cleans and smooths your skin giving it a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>The microdermabrasion pad seems to get caught in my hair or eyebrows more than it clears out my pores, but the other brush works nicely.</li>
            <li>This was easy to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I loved how it left my skin soft, clean.</li>
            <li>I used the Microdermabrasion plus advance cleansing system right away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected and more!</li>
            <li>:) I would definitely recommend this seller as well as product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Not seeing much improvement as described.</li>
            <li>and I can really see a difference in the way my face feels and</li>
            <li>I must say that the 3rd speed is a much needed improvement, this really makes my face feel clean.</li>
            <li>I used to have the original Olay cleansing system that only had the 2 speeds and one brush head.</li>
            <li>The brushes wear out pretty fast so you may want to buy replacements up front or look for generic ones at your local drugstore.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it came fast</li>
            <li>It really feels like mini facial every time i use it.</li>
            <li>I have only used the brush part so far but will be polishing tonight</li>
            <li>Much nicer than my previous model.  </li>
            <li>I have never done treatments in salon as i am very picky and don&#x27;t allow just anybody to mess with my face or hair.</li>

            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> It relaxes you and does probably similar job that you could do in salon for less money.</li>

            <li> and I use the cleansing every other day!  </li>

            <li> Being i late 20s</li>
            <li> This is my second one, already purchased one and figured it was maybe a bad one but realized they just break.</li>
            <li> I suggest using the lowest setting and avoid using it under the eyes or on any thin skinned areas.  </li>
            <li> Such a disappointment!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, bought it and less</li>

            <li> It works fine. The microdermabrasion pad seems to get caught in my hair or eyebrows more than it clears out my pores, but the other brush works nicely.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of comparison shopping before I purchased this product.  A lot of people were going for the Clairesonic but why?  This does everything its supposed to which is cleanse your face using a spin brush.  If used this the correct facial products it works amazing!  I reduced the blackheads that most people, myself included, get on your nose and is amazing as a full face scrubbing device.  I have had no issues and does not eat up my batteries.  Im still working with the original brushes and buffers that came with the device.  Would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, provides quick results, multi-functional</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, bought it and less than a month later it broke! This is my second one, already purchased one and figured it was maybe a bad one but realized they just break. Would return it but can&#x27;t since it&#x27;s been used and I threw the box away. Such a disappointment!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Much nicer than my previous model.  I especially like that it has 3 speeds.  This was the best price I found both on and off line.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not seeing much improvement as described. Also the brush for cleansing is a bit harsh for soft skin.</li>
            <li> My face looks brighter and smoother since i started using it weekly.</li>
            <li> I bought this Cleansing system after many reviews and comparison among another cleansing systems. I have to say i made great choice. Not only did it came fast but it came packages just great. Plus you get an added bonus. I used the Microdermabrasion plus advance cleansing system right away. I loved how it left my skin soft, clean. The exfoliating cream is great, it has smaller particles that don&#x27;t feel like sand on the skin. It does a great job. I have not used polisher yet, because i thew it out with the box by mistake. It really feels like mini facial every time i use it. It relaxes you and does probably similar job that you could do in salon for less money. I have never done treatments in salon as i am very picky and don&#x27;t allow just anybody to mess with my face or hair. So this is great i can do it on my own.Being i late 20s i can start to see changes in my skin, i get pimples from time to time, so this helps decrease the occurrence, as well decreases pores/blackheads. At the same time it leaves my skin glowing especially when i put lotion that cam as a bonus . :) I would definitely recommend this seller as well as product. I am thinking of getting one for my mom, i think she would love it.</li>
            <li> This product works great for my husband who is the one who uses it.</li>
            <li> Great product, bonus face  lotion was a great surprise since I ran out a couple weeks later.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t magically make you younger like we all wish, but it cleans and smooths your skin giving it a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> It works great! Easy to use! and handy you could take it everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;my skin never looked better!</li>
            <li> I have only used the brush part so far but will be polishing tonight and I can really see a difference in the way my face feels and when I look at it I seem to have a glowing effect in the color. I am excited to polish it tonight. Well I have used both the brush and the polishing head now and I love it. Not sure how I did without it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected and more!</li>
            <li> I used to have the original Olay cleansing system that only had the 2 speeds and one brush head. I must say that the 3rd speed is a much needed improvement, this really makes my face feel clean. The thermal microdermabrasion cleanser, warms up and feels really nice. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>

I am glad I bought it, but also glad I didn&#x27;t buy the $100 one out there on the market.</li>
            <li> This cleansing system is very good.  I would like to see more attachments with this product in addition to the cleansing brush.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with the product, it works really well.  I would recommend it to anyone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.  I use the microdermabrasion about twice a month.. and I use the cleansing every other day!  Definitely would recommend this product.  Does as well as the microdermabrasion you get from going to a spa..</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother for her birthday-she is thrilled with it</li>
            <li> Love it makes my skin feel cleaner and smoother</li>
