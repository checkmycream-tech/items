            <li>It&#x27;s so festive and spectacular.</li>
            <li>Applying one coat will give you a nice and even shimmering effect.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>You get a good amount of flakes with each application, and it&#x27;s easy to move around the flakes so that they look the way you want them to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The polish isn&#x27;t goopy and goes on fairly evenly and smooth-</li>
            <li>and this is by far one of the best glitters I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The gel makes my nails very strong and the Essie polishes seem to like sitting on top of it because this is my go-to combo now.</li>

            <li>this is one of my favorite glitters, when i run out, will buy again.</li>

            <li>but it looks so cute on.</li>
            <li>Two coats will begin to get &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; which is the look I love.  </li>
            <li>Love this polish Got it for a pedicure</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>I wish I knew about this particular glitter polish before, because it is great to use on my tips.</li>
            <li>Anyway this is beautiful, even my fianc&amp;eacute; said \\&quot;wow</li>
            <li>one coat for just a light sparkle and two coats for a more opaque finish.</li>
            <li>I loved this so much</li>
            <li>And it prevents the nails from chipping as easily.  </li>
            <li>how easy it is to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>to for easy removal.</li>
            <li>The brush makes it easy to create a medium thickness, even line of glitter.</li>
            <li>Set in Stones is easy to use and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t chip very easily at all and acts as a solid top coat! :)</li>
            <li>This nail polish is super sparkly and shiny!</li>
            <li>Beautiful and very useful for doing the tips of your nails like a glitter french.</li>
            <li>Stays on long, looks great and is fantastic on top of any color or by itself.</li>
            <li>Essie polish comes in great shades, finishes and is the longest lasting polish I have ever used!</li>
            <li>, I would say 2 coats are enough, love it!!</li>
            <li>Going on 6 days with the same polish and it still looks good.</li>
            <li>Ugh I can&#x27;t even think I love this polish so much,</li>
            <li>Go to Essie&#x27;s web site for full instructions and to see a photo of the look.  </li>
            <li>I don t need to use several coats to get good glitters</li>
            <li>I normally pick my favorite color polish, and then put this on my ring fingers and thumbs.</li>
            <li>Any polish becomes more exciting with this effect - highly recommended.</li>
            <li>texture is not too much and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>So, take my advice, your nails will be covered in sparkles and will be SO pretty!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a brown polish or anything this dark before but it really looks beautiful.  </li>
            <li>It looks good with almost all my other nail polish colors.</li>
            <li>I decided to check Amazon and ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li>This is great for that little sparkle and if skilled enough, you can adjust the amount of glitter on each nail to your preference.</li>
            <li>I even matched it with a similar silver tone and used it just on my ring fingernails -- a more \\&quot;sophisticated\\&quot; way to wear it than having sparkle polish on every finger</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty and girly, and I got it cheaper on here than I would in the store.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this glitter polish and the different shapes of silver in it!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Essie nail polishes are among my favorites -- they last a long time without chipping, have great coverage and generally remove easily.</li>
            <li>Definitely use a top coat over \\&quot;Set In Stones\\&quot; -- without it, the large sparkle crystals snagged on my clothing, etc.</li>
            <li>very pretty to layer on top of other nail colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so sparkly and lovely, it really looks like a bunch of tiny mirrors on my finger!</li>
            <li>The polish is very high quality</li>
            <li>but I use it so much I had to get another.</li>
            <li>The glitter chunks look like foil, very silver and reflective.</li>
            <li>really sparkley.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also great when you&#x27;re in a hurry or too lazy for a real mani and don&#x27;t want to go bare.</li>
            <li>WOW factor before I put in the 8304 nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;You can wear this with several coats or on top of any color to give it a &#x27;va va voom&#x27; factor.</li>
            <li>Love this polish, actually found it in-store at my local CVS</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>: When I use glitter polishes (and I mix them all the time with other glitter polishes or sparkly polishes) be sure to use two or three  bottom coats of a dri-fast clear polish.</li>
            <li>love the mix of small, medium and large silver chunks and</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my new go-to nail polish.</li>
            <li>This perks up any color of nail polish - from red to black, hot pink to light baby pink - it looks great on all flat polishes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Shine of the times on white works pretty well too, just not with my wedding dress.</li>
            <li>I was surprised because the quality of the glitter looked like it had come from a salon and had a very professional look to it.  </li>
            <li>Its full of large and small pieces.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any problems with the polish drying out like another member mentioned, but I also keep all of my polishes in the bathroom at room temperature which I am sure helps stretch their life a little further.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try them on top of dark colors!!!</li>
            <li>I love to put this over light colors and do an accent nail or even over dark for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li>always use Develop 10 Calcium Gel as a base coat now and the nail polish looked perfect 3 weeks later</li>
            <li>I used it on bare nails</li>
            <li>Since it arrived I have used it multiple times and since it goes well over almost any color, it never gets old.  </li>
            <li>right after I ordered it, but price plus shipping to my door was still less than drugstore!</li>
            <li>The color is great, it is silver sparkles but a clear base, so it must be used over another color.</li>
            <li>the glitter is hard to remove but that is true for all glitter polishes</li>
            <li>The clear insti-dry will become thick and that is better because then you have a little ridge by the moon on your finger to lift the polish off.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own in multiple layers (use a base coat) or on top of a color for slight sparkle.</li>
            <li>and it was a lot of fun, a tad bit juvenile looking though.</li>

            <li> always use Develop 10 Calcium Gel as a base coat now and the nail polish looked perfect 3 weeks later</li>
            <li> I used it on bare nails</li>
            <li> Since it arrived I have used it multiple times and since it goes well over almost any color, it never gets old.  </li>
            <li> right after I ordered it, but price plus shipping to my door was still less than drugstore!</li>
            <li> The color is great, it is silver sparkles but a clear base, so it must be used over another color.</li>
            <li> the glitter is hard to remove but that is true for all glitter polishes</li>
            <li> The clear insti-dry will become thick and that is better because then you have a little ridge by the moon on your finger to lift the polish off.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own in multiple layers (use a base coat) or on top of a color for slight sparkle.</li>
            <li> and it was a lot of fun, a tad bit juvenile looking though.</li>
            <li> I like that there are two kinds of glitter in this polish: a small fleckly, subtle kind and the big \\&quot;stone\\&quot;-like flat hexagonical glitter.</li>
            <li> Way harder to remove than regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> and I have long nails.  </li>
            <li> It would take forever to take off this polish (or any glitter polish) and when you use the two bottom coats (I use Sally Hansen Insti Dry) you can peel off the polish when you want to.  </li>
            <li> Looks really pretty on your nails, the only thing a little frustrating was trying to remove.  </li>
            <li> the polish is amazing the only bad thing that i would have to say about it is that it is hard to remove from nails.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had tough luck with \\&quot;sparkle\\&quot; polishes in the past, mostly because they&#x27;re so difficult to remove -- but the Luxe Effects polishes don&#x27;t have that</li>

            <li> It really adds some fun sparkle to your otherwise boring colors.  </li>

            <li> I usually use it on one nail over a matte color</li>
            <li> To take it off its a bit hard because of the chunks of glitter, but if you dip a cotton ball put it on the nail and cover with foil</li>

            <li> very pretty to layer on top of other nail colors. the glitter is hard to remove but that is true for all glitter polishes</li>
            <li> Love this polish, actually found it in-store at my local CVS right after I ordered it, but price plus shipping to my door was still less than drugstore! Great product, love all the Essie polishes!</li>
            <li> Essie nail polishes are among my favorites -- they last a long time without chipping, have great coverage and generally remove easily. I&#x27;ve had tough luck with \\&quot;sparkle\\&quot; polishes in the past, mostly because they&#x27;re so difficult to remove -- but the Luxe Effects polishes don&#x27;t have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have \\&quot;Set In Stones,\\&quot; the silver sparkle polish, and it&#x27;s a lovely and brilliant color that looks great on its own or over a dark polish. I even matched it with a similar silver tone and used it just on my ring fingernails -- a more \\&quot;sophisticated\\&quot; way to wear it than having sparkle polish on every finger (not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that! It&#x27;s just not practical for me during the work week). It lasted until I wanted to take it off, which was about five days after putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use one coat for just a light sparkle and two coats for a more opaque finish. Definitely use a top coat over \\&quot;Set In Stones\\&quot; -- without it, the large sparkle crystals snagged on my clothing, etc. But with the top coat that wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> Love this glitter nail polish,  always bring it myself to nail salon when I&#x27;m getting my nails done!  (:</li>
            <li> This will add spunk to your  nail polish! I have girls and they love to put this polish over their color to make it sparkle.</li>
            <li> This polish is like a discoball at your fingertips! It&#x27;s so festive and spectacular. I like that there are two kinds of glitter in this polish: a small fleckly, subtle kind and the big \\&quot;stone\\&quot;-like flat hexagonical glitter. So beautiful, it makes me happy just looking at it!&lt;br /&gt;The polish isn&#x27;t goopy and goes on fairly evenly and smooth- you get a good distribution of glitter and its controllable. I used it on bare nails and it was a lot of fun, a tad bit juvenile looking though. I would recommend using a base color with this.</li>
            <li> Great, best glittery nail polish I&#x27;ve ever used! Works well on it&#x27;s own in multiple layers (use a base coat) or on top of a color for slight sparkle.</li>
            <li> It looks good with almost all my other nail polish colors. It&#x27;s amazing.  I love the glitter.  Especially when I apply it over my silver nail polish.</li>
            <li> this is the best glitter polish I&#x27;ve owned.  It is really good.  You don&#x27;t need a lot, and I put it on my tips to give you the bling look on just your tips. And it prevents the nails from chipping as easily.  Going on 6 days with the same polish and it still looks good.</li>
            <li> This polish is made up of a clear base (instead of the usual greyish base that most glitter uses) and has small pieces of sparkling silver.  I loved this so much I just ordered two more. I mixed this polish with another silver polish that was sparkly but didn&#x27;t have the POW WOW factor before I put in the 8304 nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;You can wear this with several coats or on top of any color to give it a &#x27;va va voom&#x27; factor. It is shiny, sparkly and adds a touch of class whichever way you use it.&lt;br /&gt;TIP: When I use glitter polishes (and I mix them all the time with other glitter polishes or sparkly polishes) be sure to use two or three  bottom coats of a dri-fast clear polish. It would take forever to take off this polish (or any glitter polish) and when you use the two bottom coats (I use Sally Hansen Insti Dry) you can peel off the polish when you want to.  The clear insti-dry will become thick and that is better because then you have a little ridge by the moon on your finger to lift the polish off. You can use any top coat but I use insti-dry for that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck&lt;br /&gt;Sherrie H</li>
            <li> I already have a Set in Stones but I use it so much I had to get another. This polish makes your nails literally shine like a disco ball. In the car, int he sun, I can actually see the reflection on the roof and doors. Ugh I can&#x27;t even think I love this polish so much,</li>
            <li> This is great for that little sparkle and if skilled enough, you can adjust the amount of glitter on each nail to your preference. Or you can cover your entire nail with glitter with a few coats. Perfect to go on top of any color!</li>
            <li> Best sparkly polish in my collection! I swear to you, my package came two days after I ordered this! It&#x27;s so pretty and girly, and I got it cheaper on here than I would in the store. Oh, I love this polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST A TIP TO ANYONE DOING THEIR NAILS WITH SPARKLES:&lt;br /&gt;Dab your sparkles on, don&#x27;t apply it like regular polish. (Unless that&#x27;s the desired effect you&#x27;re creating.) All of my friends do that, and I tell them all not to! So, take my advice, your nails will be covered in sparkles and will be SO pretty!</li>
            <li> This is so gorgeous and timeless.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail polish to use with my gel nails and just hoped it would work. It worked and looked better than I could have ever hoped!! The glitter chunks look like foil, very silver and reflective. You get a good amount of flakes with each application, and it&#x27;s easy to move around the flakes so that they look the way you want them to. This perks up any color of nail polish - from red to black, hot pink to light baby pink - it looks great on all flat polishes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the mix of small, medium and large silver chunks and how easy it is to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new go-to nail polish. LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> the polish is amazing the only bad thing that i would have to say about it is that it is hard to remove from nails. Also, after some time it tends to get a bit clumpy.</li>
            <li> Excellent, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love Essie Nail Polish, so was happy when they came out with these nail polishes. I love to put this over light colors and do an accent nail or even over dark for a dramatic look. To take it off its a bit hard because of the chunks of glitter, but if you dip a cotton ball put it on the nail and cover with foil it does the trick. Instant way to glam up your nails any day!</li>
            <li> The color is great, it is silver sparkles but a clear base, so it must be used over another color. It prevents the base color from chipping, nails lasted 5 days with this on-top of another Essie color.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with glitter polish (No matter how hard it is to remove) and this is by far one of the best glitters I&#x27;ve ever used. Its full of large and small pieces. I love it!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. This polish is great! So great that I had to buy two more shades of it. It doesn&#x27;t chip very easily at all and acts as a solid top coat! :)</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish. Looks great over nail polish or on its own. Lately I&#x27;ve been using this polish to do a gradient effect on my nails.</li>
            <li> great product!  Looks really pretty on your nails, the only thing a little frustrating was trying to remove.  Way harder to remove than regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> Got this set in tones to put on top of opi alpine snow for my wedding ceremony on the beach!! Planning to put on flash nails, this opi doesn&#x27;t work well on my nails. Anyway this is beautiful, even my fianc&amp;eacute; said \\&quot;wow that&#x27;s awesome!\\&quot; :D&lt;br /&gt;Btw I bought ALL THE OTHER LUXEFFECTS, to test them out for my wedding day nails. I love em all, but set in stones just seem to work better with my wedding dress :)&lt;br /&gt;Shine of the times on white works pretty well too, just not with my wedding dress. I really love them all. Can&#x27;t wait to try them on top of dark colors!!! Happy nails~ cheers! &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> This nail polish is super sparkly and shiny! Essie is a great brand and anything sparkly makes it even better (:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a brown polish or anything this dark before but it really looks beautiful.  I used Set in Stones over the tip half and I received a LOT of compliments on my nails.  Go to Essie&#x27;s web site for full instructions and to see a photo of the look.  Tis polish looks like stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use Develop 10 Calcium Gel as a base coat now and the nail polish looked perfect 3 weeks later and I have long nails.  Not a chip or scratch on them.  The gel makes my nails very strong and the Essie polishes seem to like sitting on top of it because this is my go-to combo now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so sparkly and lovely, it really looks like a bunch of tiny mirrors on my finger! It is a pain to get off but so is every glitter polish, this doesn&#x27;t have any tiny glitter pieces but really big ones, it took about three coats to get full-coverage.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely gorgeous.  I am in love with this beautiful glitter polish!  It contains glitter pieces of varying sizes.</li>
            <li> Essie polish comes in great shades, finishes and is the longest lasting polish I have ever used! It is absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love this polish!!! I don t need to use several coats to get good glitters, I would say 2 coats are enough, love it!!</li>
            <li> great glitter, recommend using with OPI Glitter Off  to for easy removal. this is one of my favorite glitters, when i run out, will buy again. best glitter ever. great silver!</li>
            <li> Diamonds!!! Makes your finger nails look like diamonds on them!! I normally pick my favorite color polish, and then put this on my ring fingers and thumbs. It is hard to get off, that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t do all my nails. But it&#x27;s so very pretty, can be warn to get all dressed up or just going out in jeans!! I also got the stroke of brilliance, it&#x27;s just like this, but in blue..&lt;br /&gt;When you look at your nails with this nail polish, it&#x27;s so bright like hundreds of diamonds!!! Very pretty!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this glitter polish and the different shapes of silver in it!!!!!! I wish I knew about this particular glitter polish before, because it is great to use on my tips. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Stays on long, looks great and is fantastic on top of any color or by itself. I have had so many compliments on this polish!</li>
            <li> love it. just need a lot of coats of it. but it looks so cute on. really sparkley. goes with all colors.</li>
            <li> I actually saw this nail polish on a sale associate one day while I was out shopping.  When I asked her where she got her nails done she laughed and told me she did them herself!  I was surprised because the quality of the glitter looked like it had come from a salon and had a very professional look to it.  I immediately searched local stores for the color (the silver &amp;#34;set in stones&amp;#34;) but had a difficult time tracking it down.  I decided to check Amazon and ordered it right away.  Since it arrived I have used it multiple times and since it goes well over almost any color, it never gets old.  Applying one coat will give you a nice and even shimmering effect.  Two coats will begin to get &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; which is the look I love.  It really adds some fun sparkle to your otherwise boring colors.  The polish is very high quality and I never experience clumping or &amp;#34;bare&amp;#34; spots as I have with other glitter polishes.  I have not noticed any problems with the polish drying out like another member mentioned, but I also keep all of my polishes in the bathroom at room temperature which I am sure helps stretch their life a little further.  My only complaint is that the glitter is extremely difficult to remove, but with some soaking and gentle filing you can remove it in about ten minutes.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this polish Got it for a pedicure and it worked PERFECT arrived in good time and condition would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Love the color. I usually use it on one nail over a matte color but it&#x27;s also great when you&#x27;re in a hurry or too lazy for a real mani and don&#x27;t want to go bare.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and very useful for doing the tips of your nails like a glitter french. The brush makes it easy to create a medium thickness, even line of glitter. Any polish becomes more exciting with this effect - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Set in Stones is easy to use and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is not too much and easy to remove.</li>
