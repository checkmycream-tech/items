    <ol>
            <li>This works wonderfully for us.  </li>
            <li>This stuff got the best reviews, so I got it.</li>
            <li>The SPF 30 does not say if it blocks UVA or UVB or both, so may not be the best sunblock.</li>
            <li>I am going to point out that Amazon doesn&#x27;t alwayshave the best price listed..</li>
            <li>Great product A++++++</li>
            <li>I needed to get her something to help her out, so I researched like hell on Amazon for some really good bug spray</li>
            <li>I had heard that this bug spray by Avon was really good as have a 6 achre home</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t like most bugs sprays in that it isn&#x27;t nauseating!  </li>
            <li>I love Amazon, and like ordering my books, music, and CDs from them.(I haven&#x27;t graduated to a MP3 yet!)</li>
            <li>so it is very important to have a good insect repellent\\</li>
            <li>We would both prefer pump spray bottles, which is also around, but this stuff was just an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>and she is allergic to mosquito bites, so a nice scar appears after the bite resolves.</li>
            <li>It also remained effective even after swimming.</li>
            <li>Must be that nice smell that&#x27;s attracting all of these mosquitoes.</li>
            <li>Thank you amazon and ty Avon for having this product at a very reasonable price too!!!</li>
            <li>Mosquitoes love my oldest son and when we have this on him, he never gets bit.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the supplier and the timely fashion that they shipped the item to me.</li>
            <li>Still waiting to try it out in challenging buggy environment.</li>
            <li>It was used daily and it performed excellent repelling mosquitoes and biting flies and also protecting against sunburn.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>You can check my profile out in wordpress for more reviews; just look a search for hellobeautifulone blog in your favorite search engine.      </li>
            <li>Any bug spray I buy had better repel ticks.     </li>
            <li>youravon, in case you want to plug that into your favorite search engine.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product, and find that the Bug Guard IR 3535 does indeed keep most if not all of its promises.</li>
            <li>My son is using it all day outdoors and has been getting some mild sunburns when he doesn&#x27;t use another kind of sunblock.</li>
            <li>I love this product is easy to use and it protects you just as it says it will do.</li>
            <li>You can tell the can is full but nothing will come out!</li>
            <li>Easy application</li>
            <li>Which is fine by me, as I have to reapply sunscreen at around five hours anyway.     </li>
            <li>Just a light spray and</li>
            <li>The application did go smoothly; I am always expecting the aerosol to clog up, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I can ride away with no fear of having a load full of bites.</li>
            <li>Loved it and will be purchasing for future camping trips!!</li>
            <li>So Soft like was recommended and it did nothing, but this sure does.</li>
            <li>Female mosquitoes (the males don&#x27;t bite) are attracted by body heat and not by smell so the fact that Bug Guard smells nice is not a factor here.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, I do a lot of hiking in our area parks, and there is one park that has lovely springs and waterfalls, so I wanted a Bug Spray that seemed like it was \\&quot;super duper strength\\</li>
            <li>I have always used So Soft but was glad to be able to buy the same product unscented.</li>
            <li>Many unscented bug repellents have a strong chemical odor, but this really has minimal odor at all when sprayed, and then has no lingering odor.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend attracts more bugs than an open jar of honey</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy it over and over and recommend it as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>If you have a heart for the small business person, you can find a rep in your area and get some great deals on shipping if you order from her/his personal website or enter her phone number in Avon&#x27;s main page.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure, I am an Avon Independent Sales Representative, however, I pride myself on having integrity and honesty in my reviews.</li>
            <li>Now, if you read the full disclosure above, you realize what I am about say</li>
            <li>Who knows, you may even get some sweet deals from your personal Avon rep.</li>
            <li>So Soft Picardin line, I really like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to wash off this Spray just in case</li>
            <li>She only got like 3 bugbites so far, which is not bad.</li>
            <li>I live in the south and have been useing avon&#x27;s sss bug guard for years.</li>
            <li>It actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Bought it the first time early last year.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my children because I don&#x27;t want to use products with DEET at their young age.  </li>
            <li>I was recently near Houston and with the rain, they had mosquitoes swarming.  </li>
            <li>So Soft from when I was a child.</li>
            <li>For some reason, ticks took on this mythological horror for me, and during those early summer months during tick season, I would have nightmares that I had become drained of all my blood, because one tick hid inside my butt crack.</li>
            <li>To this day, ticks are about the only bug that really gives me the heebie-jeebies.</li>
            <li>You can order directly from Avon or you can search for a representative at Avon&#x27;s e-rep site which involves the words</li>
            <li>So Soft for over 20 years</li>
            <li>, aerosol works upside down for full coverage application  4.</li>
            <li>So Soft Bug Guard Plus IR3535 Expedition for several reasons; the first being was it was the only Avon Bug Guard product that didn&#x27;t have any sunscreen lotion in it.</li>
            <li>If you order from Avon or youravon you get the most current prices and specials, and can get direct shipping at little cost, usually around three dollars if you order from an Avon e-rep.   </li>
            <li>It seems to do the job, but prefer the Avon Skin so Soft dry.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this on my children because I don&#x27;t want to use products with DEET at their young age.  This works wonderfully for us.  Mosquitoes love my oldest son and when we have this on him, he never gets bit.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have always used So Soft but was glad to be able to buy the same product unscented. I was concerned that it was the smell that drove the critters away. But the mosquitoes get the idea and I am not asphyxiated!    Don&#x27;t usually approve of aerosols but this one helps cover parts of body out of reach like back of neck etc and it is easier to get coverage than the tube version. However, one small caveat, I think the tube is more portable for camping and am not sure if you can carry this on planes.    But at home it stands up and doesn&#x27;t get lost like a tube!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Bought it the first time early last year.  With the heat and drought, we haven&#x27;t had mosquitoes this year till lately.  This has no odor and is not greasy or oily, and has no DEET.  I&#x27;m scared of that stuff.  I&#x27;d rather have the bites.  Just a light spray and you are protected all day.  I was recently near Houston and with the rain, they had mosquitoes swarming.  I even used it to spray onto the porch and around the door and that quieted the swarm.  I&#x27;d like to give a gold star to whoever invented this.  I had tried just the Skin So Soft like was recommended and it did nothing, but this sure does.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find item. Avon doesn&#x27;t even sell it anymore. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell, it says scentless but that is not really true. I was pleased with the supplier and the timely fashion that they shipped the item to me.</li>
            <li> Solid product. My girlfriend attracts more bugs than an open jar of honey and she is allergic to mosquito bites, so a nice scar appears after the bite resolves. I needed to get her something to help her out, so I researched like hell on Amazon for some really good bug spray and I kept in the knowledge I had of Skin So Soft from when I was a child. This stuff got the best reviews, so I got it. It actually works pretty well. She only got like 3 bugbites so far, which is not bad. I guess we will never find the stuff that will guarantee 100% protection unless we douse ourselves in bleach. We would both prefer pump spray bottles, which is also around, but this stuff was just an amazing deal. I actually raised my rating to 4 just now. Solid product.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because I needed an unscented bug repellent product without DEET. The SPF 30 does not say if it blocks UVA or UVB or both, so may not be the best sunblock. My son is using it all day outdoors and has been getting some mild sunburns when he doesn&#x27;t use another kind of sunblock. Seems to keep the bugs at bay. Many unscented bug repellents have a strong chemical odor, but this really has minimal odor at all when sprayed, and then has no lingering odor. Still waiting to try it out in challenging buggy environment.</li>
            <li> I had heard that this bug spray by Avon was really good as have a 6 achre home and so have to ride the lawn mower for a very long time to cover it and had a big problem of being bit by bugs when doing it no matter what I used before getting this product now I can ride away with no fear of having a load full of bites. I love this product is easy to use and it protects you just as it says it will do. I will certainly buy it over and over and recommend it as well. Thank you amazon and ty Avon for having this product at a very reasonable price too!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this spray for the past summer for use at the cabin. It was used daily and it performed excellent repelling mosquitoes and biting flies and also protecting against sunburn. It was used a lot at the swimming beach that has a lot of biting flies present and the kids never were bitten. It also remained effective even after swimming. Great product A++++++</li>
            <li> I have used other Avon bug spray products &amp; I find this one alittle too greasy on skin.  It seems to do the job, but prefer the Avon Skin so Soft dry.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t like most bugs sprays in that it isn&#x27;t nauseating!  Works well.  Loved it and will be purchasing for future camping trips!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years as well and I love it.  We have 60 million mosquitoes here in the summer and Bug Guard is the only product I&#x27;ve found that works.  Female mosquitoes (the males don&#x27;t bite) are attracted by body heat and not by smell so the fact that Bug Guard smells nice is not a factor here.  Remember mosquitoes also bite birds and other mammals and, other than maybe French poodles, they don&#x27;t use any scented products at all.</li>
            <li> I live in the south and have been useing avon&#x27;s sss bug guard for years. It has no deet in it. You dont have to wash it off when you come in. You can put it on your skin under your clothing. We have lots of skeeters out here and it keeps them off my children. \\&quot;my children are alergic to them so it is very important to have a good insect repellent\\&quot; Since i have been useing avon&#x27;s sss bug guard i have had no problem.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure, I am an Avon Independent Sales Representative, however, I pride myself on having integrity and honesty in my reviews. You can check my profile out in wordpress for more reviews; just look a search for hellobeautifulone blog in your favorite search engine.      I bought the Avon Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus IR3535 Expedition for several reasons; the first being was it was the only Avon Bug Guard product that didn&#x27;t have any sunscreen lotion in it. Being a big fan of NPR, I remember hearing that bug spray and sunscreen combinations don&#x27;t work as well as the two separate products applied singly does on one of their shows. I don&#x27;t remember the specifics, I just remember hearing bug spray and sunscreen should be applied separately for maximum effectiveness. Secondly, I do a lot of hiking in our area parks, and there is one park that has lovely springs and waterfalls, so I wanted a Bug Spray that seemed like it was \\&quot;super duper strength\\&quot; Lastly, while I don&#x27;t mind the Skin So Soft Picardin line, I really like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to wash off this Spray just in case I am really tired from hiking and just want to crash in my bed after a long day in the woods.     The bottle comes in this dark green can, which makes me feel all outdoorsy, and  with an aerosol application process. Some highlights and product claims:  1. Lasts eight hours  2. DEET-Free  3. Easy application, aerosol works upside down for full coverage application  4. Repels mosquitoes and deer Ticks, which may prevent West Nile Virus and Lyme Disease, as well as repels black flies, gnats, no seeums, and biting midges.     The appeal to me beyond the bug repellant factor was the aerosol application, the DEET-free chemical makeup of the product.     The application did go smoothly; I am always expecting the aerosol to clog up, but so far so good. I also didn&#x27;t mind the smell, it wasn&#x27;t so perfumy for me, and it didn&#x27;t have the gag reflex inducing noxious cloud that the OFF from my childhoodused to produce.     I field-tested this in the Horicon Marshes of Wisconsin mid June. The product did seem to keep mosquitoes and other flying insects off of me. I wouldn&#x27;t say it lasted eight hours, I was out in the Marshes and other areas for about 10 hours and noticed that the spray needed to be reapplied in about five hours. Which is fine by me, as I have to reapply sunscreen at around five hours anyway.     I also bought this product for its tick repelling advertising. As a child who grew up in the north woods of Minnesota, and from about May until mid-June, we as a family would gather for nightly tick checks during the infamous tick season. Every night, I would stand butt naked in my bedroom while my mom and my sister would look in every crevice of my body for ticks. For some reason, ticks took on this mythological horror for me, and during those early summer months during tick season, I would have nightmares that I had become drained of all my blood, because one tick hid inside my butt crack. To this day, ticks are about the only bug that really gives me the heebie-jeebies. Any bug spray I buy had better repel ticks.     When I came home from the Marshes, I went into Cirque Du Soleil contortion moves to see if I can find any ticks. I didn&#x27;t find one tick, in any crevice, including in the aforementioned butt crack area.  However, I am not going to say I have personal experience of this spray repelling ticks, as I don&#x27;t know if I was exposed to any ticks or if this was tick season in the marshes. Which, I think it&#x27;s always tick season, but just in case I am wrong, I am going to go with a might repel ticks based on my personal experience.     Now, if you read the full disclosure above, you realize what I am about say next shows my vested interest. I love Amazon, and like ordering my books, music, and CDs from them.(I haven&#x27;t graduated to a MP3 yet!) By all means order this product from Amazon if you would like. I am going to point out that Amazon doesn&#x27;t alwayshave the best price listed.. For example in this Campaign&#x27;s brochure, you can buy Bug Guard at buy one get one for 1.99. And you don&#x27;t have to wait for the Avon lady to come personally deliver your product to you. You can order directly from Avon or you can search for a representative at Avon&#x27;s e-rep site which involves the words youravon, in case you want to plug that into your favorite search engine. If you order from Avon or youravon you get the most current prices and specials, and can get direct shipping at little cost, usually around three dollars if you order from an Avon e-rep.   If you have a heart for the small business person, you can find a rep in your area and get some great deals on shipping if you order from her/his personal website or enter her phone number in Avon&#x27;s main page.  Your Avon e-rep gets credit, and you get a personalized consultant for your skin and beauty needs. Who knows, you may even get some sweet deals from your personal Avon rep. I know offer extra specials for even my web customers if they contact me from my Avon e-site.   So bottom line, I like this product, which even as an Avon Independent Sales Representative, but I am not always enamoured with some of Avon&#x27;s products. I recommend this product, and find that the Bug Guard IR 3535 does indeed keep most if not all of its promises.</li>
            <li> I use the product to repel chiggers that jump onto me when jogging. No chiggers all season! It has no smell. Also, the can will spray upside down as advertised.</li>
            <li> Avon rocks. As do u amazon</li>
            <li> Have been using Avon Skin So Soft for over 20 years and it does keep those pesky bugs away.</li>
            <li> Must be that nice smell that&#x27;s attracting all of these mosquitoes. Next time I&#x27;ll get a DEET-based spray that smells bad.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to get this spray to come out and it will not spray!  You can tell the can is full but nothing will come out!</li>
            <li> The TITLE SAYS: UNSCENTED, yet is smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This UTTERLY CANNOT BE USED for hunting hogs or deer other other animal with a keen sense of smell.  They&#x27;ll wind you from a mile away.... you&#x27;ll smell like the cosmetics counter at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
