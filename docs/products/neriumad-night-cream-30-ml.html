            <li>i figured this would be perfect for my mom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the BEST skin product I&#x27;ve ever used (68 years, folks).</li>
            <li>Word of mouth advertising is the best way to expose a product, service, or business.</li>
            <li>I am beginning to be impressed.</li>
            <li>However, I am for now very happy with my results and have been passing that information on to my friends.</li>
            <li>Heard it was wonderful.</li>
            <li>Best part: They didn&#x27;t even give out samples, they were just trying to recruit people to sell it for their damn pyramid scam.</li>
            <li>As for us; IT WAS AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>feels great!</li>

            <li>NeriumAD is an incredible product.</li>
            <li>The (patented) antioxidant in this product is really incredible.</li>
            <li>We heard great reviews from family members who are skin care professionals.  </li>
            <li>If it ends up working great, who cares what is smells</li>
            <li>I think the product is amazing and backed by an awesome company.  </li>
            <li>It would have been great if it did work.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the savings.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Had heard really great things.</li>
            <li>If this product was so great,  how come this company is not contacting people like Aestheticians, Dermatologists, and Skincare Specialists to sell their product?</li>
            <li>I bought Nerium 3 weeks ago and people keep asking if I had Botox .I am so happy and recommend everyone.</li>
            <li>I have to wonder just who is writing the great reviews???  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for lightening skin pigmentation.  </li>
            <li>This a great wrinkle cream for your face and neck.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great.</li>
            <li>I think the cream smells very nice, so does my GF.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Prompt delivery, great product, good price, will order again.</li>
            <li>One more thing, the reason that this product is sold the way it is using relational marketing aka MLM was because the company thought it would be the best way to get the product onto the market.  </li>
            <li>She was very pleased and happy to get this stuff...</li>
            <li>This is the best product for reducing wrinkles and fine lines, that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I am a licensed esthetician, and I simply can&#x27;t, in good conscience, recommend Nerium to anyone.  </li>
            <li>In fact, almost any good product that has good results has to have a rapid renewal of the skin</li>
            <li>In fact, almost any good product that has good results has to have a rapid renewal of the skin</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as good as I thought it would be, but did see some changes.</li>
            <li>I did not see any results but the product did feel good on my skin</li>
            <li>As with anything, some people do not have a good experience.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product with great results!  </li>
            <li>Good for you Nerium.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good hydrating night cream.</li>
            <li>Good Luck.</li>
            <li>I thought the smell was just fine!!</li>
            <li>A price of $30 at best is about what this product is worth considering what is in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied and looking forward to continued use.</li>
            <li>The seller was excellent and shipped it right away.</li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;information\\&quot; she handed to me was a magazine that mostly talked about how to sell this product and be successful at it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I recommend for flawless, wrinkle-minimizing, beautiful skin is sunblock with SPF 30, but people won&#x27;t listen to that, either.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I think this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I am blown away by the amazing results I am having</li>
            <li>Also an amazing application for acne, dermatitis and some skin disorders.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, it truly does what it says.</li>
            <li>The product arrived and was nicely packed, but there&#x27;s no way to get the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I kind of like that it does not smell as strong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The company has started a contest:  send in your before and after 90-days-of-use photos and be entered into a raffle for air fare and hotel at a resort somewhere warm.  </li>
            <li>I know that humans can be like lemmings to the seas, but could so many customers be imagining good results?  </li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>It smells kind of like a sunless tanning lotion to me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no burning or irritation of any kind.  </li>
            <li>By purchasing this product from the person who introduced it to you...you are honestly helping out a family.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll see what kind of results I have after three months.</li>
            <li>After attending a Nerium party I was kind of put off by the sales pitch to get you to sell this product (sales video they have you watch)</li>
            <li>all year.&lt;br /&gt;The cosmetics companies are making wonderful products these days at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased at how it has tightened my skin and how much better my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I want to give this product some more time before I feel I can give consumers an honest review.</li>
            <li>Do not know why products sound so good and do not perform</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say this is one of those rare times.</li>
            <li>When I started using Nerium AD a drying effect is what I experienced on the first day.</li>
            <li>If it sounds to good to be true...</li>
            <li>I thought I would give this one more try</li>
            <li>more flawless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I had known the price beforehand I might never have bought it, but I&#x27;m sure glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping this product and will order more if I ever run out.</li>
            <li>Have many friends who use it and love it, so I will continue to use it for awhile.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I really love it</li>
            <li>Love this stuff..</li>
            <li>everything I was hoping for and more</li>
            <li>This has a bit of a medicinal smell, but it&#x27;s not &#x27;horrible&#x27; or intolerable.  </li>
            <li>My skin definately is looking better.  </li>
            <li>Retinol works great because it causes your skin to &#x27;renew&#x27; ultra fast.</li>
            <li>You just have to know it&#x27;s going to happen and stay on top of it.ipped about 3 nights in</li>
            <li>Retinol works great because it causes your skin to &#x27;renew&#x27; ultra fast.</li>
            <li>You just have to know it&#x27;s going to happen and stay on top of it.</li>
            <li>I guess I need to think about it some more.</li>
            <li>Vitamin c does more for my skin than this.</li>
            <li>Love this cream did have one where the pump did not work but was refunded quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been reading many of the comments listed here</li>
            <li>What many don&#x27;t know is that it&#x27;s against the company bylaws for this product to be sold on amazon.  </li>
            <li>You can never make more than the manager, vice president or CEO.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love Creme De La Mer</li>
            <li>It was in good shape and appears to be a fresh product.  </li>
            <li>This product is not any better than anything you can buy at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do love the results, though the product takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more, for sure.</li>
            <li>This had an even more drying effect on my skin.</li>
            <li>For $100.00 you should seriously be able to improve the smell.</li>
            <li>She explained many of the ingredients and her explanation frightened me.  </li>
            <li>MLM is radioactive for most people.  </li>
            <li>This is observations from doing it on and off, mostly off, for 25 years.  </li>
            <li>I took before and after photos, and my before photo, when I was using Hope in a Jar was actually BETTER.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>But, I was able to save $5.00 ordering it online which allowed me to use for another month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried the product</li>
            <li>I use it every night and it has made my skin smoother and more youthful looking.</li>
            <li>Used most of the tube.  </li>
            <li>and I was hoping to see better results.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Really works great.</li>
            <li>Most, don&#x27;t even know or understand ingredient composition, and/or side effects.</li>
            <li>product is toxic, and it is nothing more that poisoning oleander.</li>
            <li>I think most people can justify $100.</li>
            <li>Over that it goes to the more wealthy.</li>
            <li>After many months of everyone telling me how I needed to try this product I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>There are many moisturizers that do just that where you don&#x27;t have to sign a contract to get them........</li>
            <li>The product works for most people.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found NeriumAD Night Cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never read so many reviews of allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>It smells way better.  </li>
            <li>And not so many people have allergic reactions to La Mer.</li>
            <li>I love it and have seen the reuslts on friends.</li>
            <li>After 60 days it was even better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice it any more.  </li>
            <li>but most noticeable is the how even my skin tone is.  </li>
            <li>Many people noticed.  </li>
            <li>Not into selling, but love the product.</li>
            <li>looking for a better price.</li>
            <li>Using mostly for sun damage and sun spots.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, and it&#x27;s not perfume.</li>
            <li>decided to become a brand partner...because this product works and can make peoples lives better.  </li>
            <li>- was sure I could make this work...</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t look any better.</li>
            <li>It works so much better than what you can buy at the drug stores.</li>
            <li>However against my better knowledge I went ahead and got it.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks more refined after using this product.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I look better after I take my makeup off at night and put this cream on.</li>
            <li>I love the beach</li>
            <li>, skin looks better, feels better, skin looks firmer.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>is an update from that NERIUM company that everybody seems to love.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received FB messages from Amber Olsen who is one of the VP&#x27;s at NERIUM telling me that she will call me and make sure that everything will be taken care of.</li>
            <li>swears it is a company that cares for people and helps people become wealthy through their products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave it a chance.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to persude any friends or family to even try my bottle, I offered mine for a 5 day trial..</li>
            <li>I just LOVE this cream.  </li>
            <li>I think my face doesn&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet</li>
            <li>and instead I got some pimples (I think this cream is the reason, but not 100% sure).</li>
            <li>Was very pleased with hold quickly</li>
            <li>I stopped using it because I started using something else, but it is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always happy to try new products that I can recommend  to my clients.  </li>
            <li>I love how smooth my skin feels when I rinse my face in the morning.</li>
            <li>This Night Cream works more like a light mask, but I could tell my skin was tighter with fewer noticeable lines.</li>
            <li>that I accidently came into contact with at the auto repair shop, and have no intention of ever becoming a &#x27;seller&#x27; to make money on this, so</li>
            <li>The most important factor for individuals trying the product from authorized Nerium BPS or the Nerium site is to TAKE A PICTURE of skin problem areas.  </li>
            <li>Glad I Got It For Free.</li>
            <li>[...] I do not sell Nerium, so my comment is genuine and is based on my own true experience.</li>
            <li>I would Love to sell 3 bottles a month and get for $8.95 or free as I was told in the presentation.</li>
            <li>it really added years to my otherwise good for my age face (53).</li>
            <li>First, let me tell you, this is a huge MARKETING SCAM!!</li>
            <li>So excited to see it is available on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My husband took apart the bottle and it came off too easily.  </li>
            <li>this is supposed to be a magical cream, but after using it for 1 1/2mth, I can honestly say that it doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>It did not smell as strong as the product  </li>
            <li>I  had seen someone post about this cream on Facebook and it was claiming some pretty amazing results.</li>
            <li>With good moisturizer, I can put on my makeup like normal and go to town or a party</li>
            <li>With good moisturizer, I can put on my makeup like normal and go to town or a party</li>
            <li>#34;you have such beautiful skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Once I wash my face, scrub and put moisturizer on, they look fine.</li>
            <li>&gt; Improves skin texture, pore size, almost eliminates fine lines within 2 wks, and&lt;br</li>
            <li>My fine lines and even some deeper lines and wrinkles have diminished.  </li>
            <li>It controls my breakouts, reduces the appearance of fine lines, evens my skin tone, reduces redness.</li>
            <li>I have been faithfully using  the product since Oct 19 &amp; can see no change in my fine lines &amp; wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>In the morning, it&#x27;s fine, but I feel that I&#x27;m washing it off when I wash my face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Swelling and inflammation will often reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I saw huge changes in my skin completion and my acne scaring.  </li>
            <li>Huge difference on u skin.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge change.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample to try for free by a rep</li>
            <li>It works!you can get it free by signing up as a preferred customer.</li>
            <li>The reps who sell this product make a profit so you are probably spending way more than it&#x27;s really worth because of the pyramid effect.  </li>
            <li>IMPORTANT:  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Nerium partner that&#x27;s how I know you can get trial for free</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve given them out for free personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>he will let you try it for free before purchasing it.</li>
            <li>I was given a free bottle of this by a Nerium brand partner which was ever so generous.  </li>
            <li>I received that same message from NERIUM CEO, Jeff Olsen, as well as a phone call from one of his \\&quot;assistants\\&quot; assuring me Jeff is a \\&quot;great guy\\&quot; and will take care of me.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my face is.</li>
            <li>my time is too important for a &#x27;multi step&#x27; process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>you get yours for FREE</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>I think it is a very good moisturizer, but other than that</li>
            <li>As I got to the end of my first bottle people started asking me if I&#x27;d been on vacation, and then someone asked me if I&#x27;d &amp;#34;had work done&amp;#34;!!  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome product, and very fast shipping, and I&#x27;d like to recommend for someone who want your get more tone and specially: uneven skin</li>
            <li>When trying a new skin care product its important to remember that there is no miracle in a bottle that will work amazing for everyone and every skin type.  </li>
            <li>and I have significant reduction in redness</li>
            <li>I did help make someone rich.  </li>
            <li>pretty sure I can&#x27;t post it here??</li>
            <li>Another review said the people selling this are &#x27;getting rich&#x27; and &#x27;getting Lexus&#x27;s&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this item from a NeriumAD representative and paid much more.  </li>
            <li>I was able to with out having to sign up for monthly shipments or committ myself to any 30 trial or pay the higher non-preferred price etc.</li>
            <li>If you want to do something useful to protect your skin, STAY OUT OF THE SUN and help BAN ALL TOXIC TOBACCO SMOKE, EVERYWHERE, NOW!</li>
            <li>It looked like the pump was clean and unused.  </li>
            <li>This cream is amazing and many people have told me I look younger or I am &amp;#34;just</li>
            <li>love this product keep it coming can&#x27;t get enough of this fantastic breakthrough so easy to use and the results are awsome love it</li>
            <li>, I did my smile lines last year for $200.00  and got great results that have lasted</li>
            <li>I wish I could scream with all the air in my lungs that this is a get rich quick scheme, and it&#x27;s not you who&#x27;s getting rich, but the person with the glib tongue who persuaded you to buy it.</li>
            <li>but it sure did the job on my large pores on my nose and on the skin on both sides of the nose.  </li>
            <li>It smells more pure and if it had the oder of anything else, I think it would distort the purity factor in</li>
            <li>Many things do not naturally smell nice.  </li>
            <li>hope you like it as much as my momma does :)</li>
            <li>And to top it all off, the product smells absolutely HORRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply this product to a VERY damp face.</li>
            <li>Horses eat it because it&#x27;s sweet, and then they die!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>and you get a full refund.  </li>
            <li>&quot; So true.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, I think its a scam or just very unexperienced people that are selling and liking this product.</li>
            <li>I am so grateful for the Amazon reviews, if you look over them you can always get a TRUE idea of the product in question.</li>
            <li>and it could have expired and lost its full potency.</li>
            <li>Other than that, product is great...</li>
            <li>I tried this product through a salon first and saw some improvement in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>and I think it smells really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>:  After using this for only 2 or 3  more nights, (not in a row)  I have more to share.  </li>
            <li>YES, most purchasers have an opportunity to try the product for FREE from a BP (Brand Partner), or can contact NERIUM directly for a no risk, 30 day guarantee purchase.</li>
            <li>I think the older you are and the deeper the wrinkles, the more time it takes to see results.  </li>
            <li>I bought mine from Amazon, and got lucky.  </li>
            <li>Do you really want to support an unethical person, when you could be supporting an honest person who is trying to build an ethical business all for saving a couple dollars.</li>
            <li>I am a huge skeptic, and really didn&#x27;t think it was going to make a difference.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, within 5 days I saw a huge difference in my skin texture and appearance.</li>
            <li>I have used NeriumAD for only 2 1/2 weeks now and the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>After using it for just a few nights both of us liked how much better our skin looked and felt.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every dollar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is well worth the money</li>
            <li>-- now THAT&#x27;S a product that is worth the money.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s worth it, trust me).</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Kind of like that stuff that pumps up your lips, but only if you apply it every day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be effective as a possible treatment.  </li>
            <li>But, you must give this product an honest try, which includes spritzing your face with water before applying, using enough product, massaging it well into your face, using it at night before bed (giving it a chance to absorb before you hit the pillow).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare</li>
            <li>Oh by the way, the product is worth 4-5 stars</li>
            <li>For the short time I had the sample it seemed to be a nice product</li>
            <li>I not only got results but people have noticed how nice my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>The product is pretty good but does not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>Let me just say all the before and after pics were a little too good to be true</li>
            <li>I really was excited and wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>Right now, 20 minutes after application,  I feel like my face is drying up.</li>
            <li>No change on the right side, yet, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing results for only 6 nights of use, and not all in a row.  </li>
            <li>Reviewing Nerium AD, it is a biotechnology breakthrough, a PATENTED, ANTI OXIDANT, ANTI AGING CREAM, for night use, and will very quickly improve the overall texture of skin, lessening fine lines, improving tone and lessening the appearance of sagging skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very few fine lines and pretty good skin tone</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Nerium for the past two months, and it works great for ME...</li>
            <li>full well what this product really</li>
            <li>I will continute to use it and hope that 6-12 months down the road I look as good as my girlfriend does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled a company has decided to employee people vs. giving bukoo bucks to advertising and large corporations such as Macy&#x27;s or Nordstroms.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;d rather get botox for certain results!</li>
            <li>I certainly will become one!</li>
            <li>Renee is the co-owner and their website says, \\&quot;her generous and compassionate heart is appreciated by all who work with her.\\&quot; I can tell you straight up that this is a huge lie.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as exfoliating, try Pretty Hands and Feet, available right here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I certainly hope this is worth it.</li>
            <li>If the product was soooo great and worked as promised, then why is it soooo hard to return your product?</li>
            <li>but...the top of the bottle had been taken off and looked like someone tried to put it back on!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it at first.</li>
            <li>And, be sure that you send the product back within 10 days of getting your refund #, because otherwise you don&#x27;t get your refund at ALL!!!</li>
            <li>This whole process seems shady and unreputable from a company that claims proven results and great customer service.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time to use Nerium which was recommended to me by my daughter.</li>
            <li>The owners are millionaires who think that the world revolves around them and are willing to trample on and chew up anyone who comes in their way.</li>
            <li>more clients keep asking me how I can look 20 yrs younger without surgery.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Glad I only paid the Amazon price.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>but I spray my face with water first as recommended and dilute the product, once it soaks in and drys my face</li>
            <li>many of the negative reviews won&#x27;t  tell you the truth that you can try it for free, YES for free, if it doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t buy them...</li>
            <li>I started putting a light coat on my 3yr old nieces eczema (on her feet), and in 3 days it&#x27;s almost gone.  </li>
            <li>Well, as an American who would like to see American&#x27;s successful and EMPLOYED, I don&#x27;t have any issue with that.  </li>
            <li>wrinkles doesn&#x27;t make anybody feel pretty.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get anyone interested - family, friends, or strangers.  </li>
            <li>I am an Esthetician and have used many different skincare lines.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It is so much softer!</li>
            <li>I am sold on this product just for the fact that it has rejuvinated my skin and feels so much softer and healthier!</li>
            <li>Bought this on Amazon after given a sample by a Nerium representative (or &amp;#34;brand partner&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>you look 20 years younger :-)</li>
            <li>The first nite I put this on</li>
            <li>Because it is a poisonous plant which has been studied to kill cancer, it would be the most likely culprit for the damage to my skin.</li>
            <li>I used it for one month exactly as directed and saw NO improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>BUT CAN&#x27;T GET ANYONE INTERESTED,</li>
            <li>a friend sent me like 6 bottles and wanted me to try to get friends and family interested.</li>
            <li>Some may see results after a few days but give a full 30 days to see better results and try for 3months to see the full effect.</li>
            <li>This is a very natural, LIGHT, kind of different natural plant smell.  </li>
            <li>Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 25 years old and have been on a mission to clear my very light acne scars before seeking plastic surgery/laser.</li>
            <li>With businesses of this type you can as much as you&#x27;re willing to work for and more than anyone that is above you.</li>
            <li>I can already see the brightness and vitality returning to my face, and the fine lines and wrinkles are becoming less noticable.</li>
            <li>I was hopeful I&#x27;d see some good results but my regular jel mask does the same thing...</li>
            <li>how much you love them because that has no bearing on their actions towards those of us who have had medical attention because of their products.</li>
            <li>The price seems high, but worth it.</li>
            <li>After 3 months I saw positively NOTHING.  </li>
            <li>and I do see some positive results.</li>
            <li>Other friends have had great results on different areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since they don&#x27;t have an advertising budget, this helps keep the price of the product down and allows ppl who want to have a business of their own to make money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>Nerium is better for dry skin.</li>
            <li>smart company.</li>
            <li>and it certainly is working.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and can&#x27;t tolerate a lot of products and was very leary about this one.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t the best however, if a product works Im ok with a bad smell!  </li>
            <li>and I can see definite results with nerium ad with fine lines dimishing.</li>
            <li>Definitely did notjong for my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t want to look younger and reduce fine lines?</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended by friends &amp; nurses.</li>
            <li>but I can tell you after using the product for a few months I can tell you my skin looks amazing and</li>
            <li>Huge red flag for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only a fraction of what this nonsense costs and it will give you great results in eliminating dead cells on the surface of your skin.  </li>
            <li>The reps should warn those trying it that it really tightens and dries your skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is flaking and peeling much like if you go get an RX for Retinol.  </li>
            <li>The reps should warn those trying it that it really tightens and dries your skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is flaking and peeling much like if you go get an RX for Retinol.  </li>
            <li>He gave me a whole bottle and asked that I use it.</li>
            <li>If you want to spend a fortune on something that works, try Creme De La Mer --you&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
            <li>Really, people.</li>
            <li>You really have nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li>I expected to to work better on age spots and 60 days I have seen no change in the couple spots on my face.</li>
            <li>make so much improvement in skin.  </li>
            <li>I prefer straight sand than water mixes in this goo all night.  </li>
            <li>The photos are totally REAL.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really do much else.  </li>
            <li>I bought this cream a while ago, I used it for about 3 weeks straight.</li>
            <li>I has worked well, though it takes more time than I expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Very drying, no improvement.  </li>
            <li>I was VERY suspicious of it and their claims.</li>
            <li>After using the product for a month straight</li>
            <li>I saw it at Home and Garden show in Okc but theirs was more pink lotion</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin, but my biggest problem with it is how it feels when I put it</li>
            <li>And you don&#x27;t know what you are really buying here.</li>
            <li>It is against corporation policy to sell on these type of websites and anyone who does is very unethical to do so.</li>
            <li>it cleaned my face very well</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed that it does improve the wrinkles as fast as they proclaim.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy on Amazon because I really wanted to try the product without committing myself.</li>
            <li>it runs out to fast need to order&lt;</li>
            <li>Really recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>in fact, because it&#x27;s so drying, i think it aged my skin more.  </li>
            <li>but I did really want to try the product.</li>
            <li>Someday I will share what the change really is.  </li>
            <li>Even at the end of the day with a five o clock shadow my face is smooth and looks so much younger.</li>
            <li>My friend Maggie absolutely loves this cream.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t perfumed and for what it is, it didn&#x27;t bother me so much.</li>
            <li>will say the women I met that are happy with thier results are younger and I feel did not have a regular facial regime</li>
            <li>(she&#x27;s very worried about her appearance).</li>
            <li>more in the near future</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel tight, made it rough, made it break out, and deepened fine wrinkles in my \\&quot;parentheses.\\&quot; I am struggling to reverse the damage by returning to my previous excellent products (Amore Pacific) and Clarisonic Pro.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and does work, but if purchased from other than a brand partner, the product quality you receive is questionable and at your own risk.</li>
            <li>These are mostly people and other companies who have competing products or technologies and see their business threaten.</li>
            <li>I did notice a more even skin tone, but other than that</li>
            <li>After all the hype I was excited to finally try a product that \\&quot;works\\&quot; - supposedly.&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen any changes in my skin, but since I bought 3 bottles, I will use them all and in case anything still happens (which I doubt), I will update my reciew.</li>
            <li>She raves about this product and has many of my other friends using it as well.</li>
            <li>I do not believe this product is safe or beneficial to the skin, other than the benefits of aloe vera.</li>
            <li>My 11 brow lines are more pronounce since I haven&#x27;t been using my other night creams and my pores</li>
            <li>No more breakouts (which used to be a continually issue for me) and numerous compliments about my great skin.</li>
            <li>I actually fell in love with the product so much that I became a brandpartner, so I could get the product for free (80$ a month is a little steep for a college-girl)</li>
            <li>Because I was \\&quot;privileged\\&quot; to hear all the high hype from one of the reps on this product, I was even angrier when it did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>I am not much of a people person (I have social anxiety) and the nice lady and gentleman who gave me the bottle I am using attend lots of meetings.</li>
            <li>People are so used to perfumy, chemical laden products that do nothing but feel and small nice.  </li>
            <li>For $100, with a full 30-day money back guarantee</li>
            <li>it did lighten the dark age spots somewhat, but it&#x27;s not gone for sure.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Postscript:  I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now and do see a difference in a more even skin tone, smaller pores and my wrinkles are much less prominent, particularly on my forehead, between my eyes and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>am wondering how many of these comments are left by Estheticians that have an investment in the products they sell and/or people who are just simply in a hurry!</li>
            <li>I am older so my age may have something to do with that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Smell is a bit strong the first few times</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their skin.</li>
            <li>For anyone considering doing Nerium, ask yourself a few very important questions.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend NeriumAd Night Cream.</li>
            <li>;  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend NeriumAD.</li>
            <li>I sent my container back for a refund after the first use!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin so beware.</li>
            <li>I sometimes feel my face during the day and am really amamzed at how soft it feels.</li>
            <li>price tag is a stretch for most), it&#x27;s an MLM company (no thanks), or family members that bought a bottle out of pity, but saw no results and didn&#x27;t think it is worth the $120/bottle.  </li>
            <li>but so far I am seeing the very beginning of results.  </li>
            <li>I have to laugh at these reviews of people who say they&#x27;ve been a sun worshiper for years, and Nerium is the only thing that has worked for them, to erase the damage.</li>
            <li>$tore purchase$ worth passed; and I might as well have been using regular hand cream on my face.  </li>
            <li>And on top of that, the broken bottle was 3/4 full.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice moisturizer that leaves your skin feeling soft, which in turn could make your wrinkles appear less apparent.  </li>
            <li>She explained that when she first applied it at night her face got very tight, but by the next morning she said she rinsed her face and absolutely felt the difference :)</li>
            <li>I just turned 64 and didn&#x27;t have great expectations for this product based on past experience with other products.</li>
            <li>so far have seen a little difference, will have to continue using it to be able to tell if I see anymore</li>
            <li>This was a HUGE let down, I look older than when I bought this, a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I like to try new products.</li>
            <li>After using the product they take a new picture with you looking up.&lt;br /&gt;Naturally crease decrease when your head is tilting up.  </li>
            <li>Also, you will miss out on all your other benefits from buying from an official Nerium Brand Partner, such as 30-day-money back guarantee, receive the product for free monthly through the 3 UR Free program.</li>
            <li>I also believe people that did not take before and after photos really missed the boat on how much they actually did improve...</li>
            <li>skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>pretty much eliminated the dry spots on my face with out being oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>She said our other women relatives love it and threw away their former night products.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re constantly in the sun and not protecting yourself in the first place, then nothing you use is going to be the answer.  </li>
            <li>The first morning after I used it my wrinkles on my upper lip were GONE!</li>
            <li>I am willing to bet the before/after photos are totally touched up and airbrushed.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer Bare Minerals products and skin creams.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>The product may help some people but I am not sure if I will buy more of the product.</li>
            <li>The person with the most dramatic improvement wins.  </li>
            <li>In fact it seemed to make my face feel more dry and made my fine lines look worse.</li>
            <li>If your experience is similar to mine this would cut the cost in half making it seem much more affordable.  </li>
            <li>I may be having a mild allergic reaction, but it could be the dead, drying skin cells ready to be scrubbed off.  </li>
            <li>68 year old man can only give a positive and glowing review of this product.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s less of those than us middle class folks (if there is such a thing),but you sell more if it&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
            <li>Do them a favor, help them out as they work hard to serve their customers and they will make sure you are taken well care of.</li>
            <li>Good tweezers are a must for pulling off stubborn little pieces of dead skin, too.  </li>
            <li>Good tweezers are a must for pulling off stubborn little pieces of dead skin, too.  </li>
            <li>now you can hardly see any evidence of scaring and many of the marks are completely gone.  </li>
            <li>a writer and musician my eyes are extremely important to me and any discomfort makes it hard for me to read and besides, who wants to be on stage, in magazines and on television with a disfigured eye?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 30 days my cheeks look almost clear.</li>
            <li>clear up acne&lt;br /&gt;Pore</li>
            <li>I have before and after pictures which clearly show the damage.  </li>
            <li>I suffered from adult acne which left a lot of scarring that I was very self conscious about.</li>
            <li>I used the product for 4 days and immediately saw one of the craters near my eyebrow dissipate.</li>
            <li>I am surprised that this product is marketed without a cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have no issues.</li>
            <li>I had to write a review so far in response to what others had written.  </li>

            <li>This does make your skin feel soft, but I have been using for over a month and have not seen any visible signs.</li>
            <li>Purchase product from an authorized Nerium Brand Partner, or directly from Nerium.com.  </li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t come directly from the company, you will not know about shelf life, storage and changes of temperature, tampering, safety, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in the process with the progress of this product as I am 1 month into using it, but so far I am seeing improvement in my face &amp; tops of my hands.</li>

            <li>(I&#x27;m 37 yrs old)</li>
            <li>It did make my skin soft</li>
            <li>Save your money especially since it costs for much.</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old.  </li>
            <li>This stuff has made a marked improvement on that area as well as on my face.  </li>
            <li>it actually made a very noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li>I currently haven&#x27;t made a dime off the product but have to say it still does work very well.</li>
            <li>did I really notice how much it actually did improve.</li>
            <li>timing!!This stuff really works ,,,,,,,has made a big difference in my skin clarity and over all appearance!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get it too near my eyes</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s all natural??</li>
            <li>I tried this product for nearly a month.</li>
            <li>so it does seem to last MUCH longer than one month</li>
            <li>I rinse my face at nice, then apply a thin coating of this product (2 pumps) and that is it.</li>
            <li>Also, more expensive doesn&#x27;t always mean it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>The problem with MLM in general is nobody wants to sell, certainly not your friends and family, and nobody wants to be recruited as a salesperson to go out and recruit other salespeople and no matter what MLM, it&#x27;s always the same, strong resistance to being recruited because people don&#x27;t want to work.  </li>
            <li>Came just as expected and in the right</li>
            <li>So easy to use and no more skin issues.</li>
            <li>It actually helps to erase dark age spots and smooth my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have know a woman personally for 20 years who&#x27;s skin always looked ashy and older than she was.</li>
            <li>I choose not to use it on my full face, so the contents last longer than expected.</li>
            <li>Willing to work with it longer as quite a few others have had very impressicve results with it</li>
            <li>It seemed more financially practical for me to start small.</li>
            <li>If you look at the reviews for this product it becomes obvious that many of the reviewers are like my co worker who is trying to sell it or promote it, and then there are other less glowing reviews from REAL CUSTOMERS.</li>
            <li>Some ppl just love to shoot something down if it didn&#x27;t work for them after they put no real effort into it.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes when I joined</li>
            <li>You have to be careful not to scrub too much on the new baby skin underneath.  </li>
            <li>You have to be careful not to scrub too much on the new baby skin underneath.  </li>
            <li>Other products seem to do much better and at half the cost.</li>
            <li>I was open to the idea of a new cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pasty going on, and when dry is somewhat crusty.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only twenty, and obviously not concerned about wrinkles, but this product shrunk my pores, and really evened out my complexion.</li>
            <li>BUT, in the final form is not deadly unless you eat it!  </li>
            <li>The problem with ppl leaving negative remarks about something is you have no idea who they are or how credible that person is.  </li>
            <li>I never saw any result and the only reason I stuck with it so long was because it was so very pricey.</li>
            <li>This product made my skin extremely dry and the few fine lines that I have</li>
            <li>I have looked for a product to meet my busy schedule and have finally found one that I can use overnight.</li>
            <li>I tried getting the product directly from Nerium, same thing.</li>
            <li>One issue though, Nerium is not approved to be sold from retailers like Amazon, only directly from their brandpartners&#x27; website ( As an example, mine is [...] )</li>
            <li>When I finally did get a customer service associate, they said that I had to get a refund #, then send the product back and even with an unopened, unused bottle, I may not get back my whole purchase price.  </li>
            <li>and I barely need any makeup.</li>
            <li>I am 71 years old and I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li>And the bare bottom line is, if it didn&#x27;t make&lt;br /</li>
            <li>and I can barely see any wrinkles at all.</li>
            <li>Once I stopped using it my skin went back to its old state</li>
            <li>But, Amazon can&#x27;t guarantee the quality of the product as far as shelf life, what temperature variations it has been through, who had it sitting on their shelf prior to selling, etc.  </li>
            <li>purchased in early May From Amazon and still have product at the end of the third week of June.</li>
            <li>Please FB me as my next step is a CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT to show NERIUM that they can&#x27;t just make people go away.</li>
            <li>However, we know that it is healing rapidly and causing sloughing off of the dead skin much faster than normal.  </li>

            <li>She is 53 turning 54 in 3 weeks, she has really good and youthful skin but is afraid her age will catch up to her.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe the hype, it&#x27;s based more on getting people to join and not About the poor product</li>
            <li>After a couple more uses, it has not gotten any worse.  </li>
            <li>I can save that money and get juvederm injections and or Botox after a few months, thats allot of filler I could do my brows, nose and smile lines</li>
            <li>(i&#x27;m not interested), how much is it?</li>
            <li>It does feel tight when you put it on the first time..</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical at first, but I fell in love after using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m HIGHLY suspicious of the negative reviews here, my first thought goes to competitive skin care cream that is scared when they see how well this stuff actually works</li>
            <li>I am not sure it is worth it for me to have to take a Xanax to go to a meeting or, God forbid, pitch the product to a group of people.</li>
            <li>had me going to several doctors in different cities over the past few months and created a lump ON my right lid as well as a lump UNDER my right lid, which is still there.</li>
            <li>You MUST have your skin slightly damp, or it will be very sticky going on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>By the third day a long time skin problem had cleared up completely.</li>
            <li>I do hope this product continues to sell, because while I have not seen \\&quot;miraculous\\&quot; results, my wrinkles are much less noticeable, my skin is smoother with tighter pores, and even my husband, who never notices much of anything, has commented that I look younger.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;tightness&amp;#34; others report doesn&#x27;t really feel all that tight to me and dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>NeriumAD Night Cream didn&#x27;t work for me, made my face very dry, felt itchy and uncomfortable plus the smell wasn&#x27;t nice either.</li>

            <li> Heard it was wonderful.</li>
            <li> Best part: They didn&#x27;t even give out samples, they were just trying to recruit people to sell it for their damn pyramid scam.</li>

            <li> That should make you feel very good about yourself.</li>
            <li> NeriumAD is an incredible product.</li>
            <li> The (patented) antioxidant in this product is really incredible.</li>
            <li> We heard great reviews from family members who are skin care professionals.  </li>
            <li> If it ends up working great, who cares what is smells</li>

            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Had heard really great things.</li>
            <li> If this product was so great,  how come this company is not contacting people like Aestheticians, Dermatologists, and Skincare Specialists to sell their product?</li>
            <li> I bought Nerium 3 weeks ago and people keep asking if I had Botox .I am so happy and recommend everyone.</li>
            <li> I have to wonder just who is writing the great reviews???  </li>

            <li> This a great wrinkle cream for your face and neck.</li>

            <li> This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, great product, good price, will order again.</li>
            <li> One more thing, the reason that this product is sold the way it is using relational marketing aka MLM was because the company thought it would be the best way to get the product onto the market.  </li>
            <li> She was very pleased and happy to get this stuff...</li>
            <li> This is the best product for reducing wrinkles and fine lines, that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed esthetician, and I simply can&#x27;t, in good conscience, recommend Nerium to anyone.  </li>
            <li> In fact, almost any good product that has good results has to have a rapid renewal of the skin</li>
            <li> In fact, almost any good product that has good results has to have a rapid renewal of the skin</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as good as I thought it would be, but did see some changes.</li>
            <li> I did not see any results but the product did feel good on my skin</li>
            <li> As with anything, some people do not have a good experience.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product with great results!  </li>
            <li> Good for you Nerium.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good hydrating night cream.</li>
            <li> Good Luck.</li>
            <li> I thought the smell was just fine!!</li>
            <li> A price of $30 at best is about what this product is worth considering what is in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied and looking forward to continued use.</li>
            <li> The seller was excellent and shipped it right away.</li>
            <li> We love it!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;information\\&quot; she handed to me was a magazine that mostly talked about how to sell this product and be successful at it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I recommend for flawless, wrinkle-minimizing, beautiful skin is sunblock with SPF 30, but people won&#x27;t listen to that, either.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I think this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> and I am blown away by the amazing results I am having</li>
            <li> Also an amazing application for acne, dermatitis and some skin disorders.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it truly does what it says.</li>
            <li> The product arrived and was nicely packed, but there&#x27;s no way to get the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I kind of like that it does not smell as strong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The company has started a contest:  send in your before and after 90-days-of-use photos and be entered into a raffle for air fare and hotel at a resort somewhere warm.  </li>
            <li> I know that humans can be like lemmings to the seas, but could so many customers be imagining good results?  </li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> It smells kind of like a sunless tanning lotion to me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no burning or irritation of any kind.  </li>
            <li> By purchasing this product from the person who introduced it to you...you are honestly helping out a family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see what kind of results I have after three months.</li>
            <li> After attending a Nerium party I was kind of put off by the sales pitch to get you to sell this product (sales video they have you watch)</li>
            <li> all year.&lt;br /&gt;The cosmetics companies are making wonderful products these days at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased at how it has tightened my skin and how much better my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I want to give this product some more time before I feel I can give consumers an honest review.</li>
            <li> Do not know why products sound so good and do not perform</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to say this is one of those rare times.</li>
            <li> When I started using Nerium AD a drying effect is what I experienced on the first day.</li>
            <li> If it sounds to good to be true...</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this one more try</li>
            <li> more flawless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I had known the price beforehand I might never have bought it, but I&#x27;m sure glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping this product and will order more if I ever run out.</li>
            <li> Have many friends who use it and love it, so I will continue to use it for awhile.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I really love it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff..</li>
            <li> everything I was hoping for and more</li>
            <li> This has a bit of a medicinal smell, but it&#x27;s not &#x27;horrible&#x27; or intolerable.  </li>
            <li> My skin definately is looking better.  </li>
            <li> Retinol works great because it causes your skin to &#x27;renew&#x27; ultra fast.</li>
            <li> You just have to know it&#x27;s going to happen and stay on top of it.ipped about 3 nights in</li>
            <li> Retinol works great because it causes your skin to &#x27;renew&#x27; ultra fast.</li>
            <li> You just have to know it&#x27;s going to happen and stay on top of it.</li>
            <li> I guess I need to think about it some more.</li>
            <li> Vitamin c does more for my skin than this.</li>
            <li> Love this cream did have one where the pump did not work but was refunded quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading many of the comments listed here</li>
            <li> What many don&#x27;t know is that it&#x27;s against the company bylaws for this product to be sold on amazon.  </li>
            <li> You can never make more than the manager, vice president or CEO.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love Creme De La Mer</li>
            <li> It was in good shape and appears to be a fresh product.  </li>
            <li> This product is not any better than anything you can buy at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do love the results, though the product takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more, for sure.</li>
            <li> This had an even more drying effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> For $100.00 you should seriously be able to improve the smell.</li>
            <li> She explained many of the ingredients and her explanation frightened me.  </li>
            <li> MLM is radioactive for most people.  </li>
            <li> This is observations from doing it on and off, mostly off, for 25 years.  </li>
            <li> I took before and after photos, and my before photo, when I was using Hope in a Jar was actually BETTER.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> But, I was able to save $5.00 ordering it online which allowed me to use for another month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried the product</li>
            <li> I use it every night and it has made my skin smoother and more youthful looking.</li>
            <li> Used most of the tube.  </li>
            <li> and I was hoping to see better results.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Really works great.</li>
            <li> Most, don&#x27;t even know or understand ingredient composition, and/or side effects.</li>
            <li> product is toxic, and it is nothing more that poisoning oleander.</li>
            <li> I think most people can justify $100.</li>
            <li> Over that it goes to the more wealthy.</li>
            <li> After many months of everyone telling me how I needed to try this product I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> There are many moisturizers that do just that where you don&#x27;t have to sign a contract to get them........</li>
            <li> The product works for most people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found NeriumAD Night Cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never read so many reviews of allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> It smells way better.  </li>
            <li> And not so many people have allergic reactions to La Mer.</li>
            <li> I love it and have seen the reuslts on friends.</li>
            <li> After 60 days it was even better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice it any more.  </li>
            <li> but most noticeable is the how even my skin tone is.  </li>
            <li> Many people noticed.  </li>
            <li> Not into selling, but love the product.</li>
            <li> looking for a better price.</li>
            <li> Using mostly for sun damage and sun spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, and it&#x27;s not perfume.</li>
            <li> decided to become a brand partner...because this product works and can make peoples lives better.  </li>
            <li> - was sure I could make this work...</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t look any better.</li>
            <li> It works so much better than what you can buy at the drug stores.</li>
            <li> However against my better knowledge I went ahead and got it.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks more refined after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I look better after I take my makeup off at night and put this cream on.</li>
            <li> I love the beach</li>
            <li> , skin looks better, feels better, skin looks firmer.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> is an update from that NERIUM company that everybody seems to love.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received FB messages from Amber Olsen who is one of the VP&#x27;s at NERIUM telling me that she will call me and make sure that everything will be taken care of.</li>
            <li> swears it is a company that cares for people and helps people become wealthy through their products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I gave it a chance.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to persude any friends or family to even try my bottle, I offered mine for a 5 day trial..</li>
            <li> I just LOVE this cream.  </li>
            <li> I think my face doesn&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet</li>
            <li> and instead I got some pimples (I think this cream is the reason, but not 100% sure).</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with hold quickly</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because I started using something else, but it is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always happy to try new products that I can recommend  to my clients.  </li>
            <li> I love how smooth my skin feels when I rinse my face in the morning.</li>
            <li> This Night Cream works more like a light mask, but I could tell my skin was tighter with fewer noticeable lines.</li>
            <li> that I accidently came into contact with at the auto repair shop, and have no intention of ever becoming a &#x27;seller&#x27; to make money on this, so</li>
            <li> The most important factor for individuals trying the product from authorized Nerium BPS or the Nerium site is to TAKE A PICTURE of skin problem areas.  </li>
            <li> Glad I Got It For Free.</li>
            <li> [...] I do not sell Nerium, so my comment is genuine and is based on my own true experience.</li>
            <li> I would Love to sell 3 bottles a month and get for $8.95 or free as I was told in the presentation.</li>
            <li> it really added years to my otherwise good for my age face (53).</li>
            <li> First, let me tell you, this is a huge MARKETING SCAM!!</li>
            <li> So excited to see it is available on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> My husband took apart the bottle and it came off too easily.  </li>
            <li> this is supposed to be a magical cream, but after using it for 1 1/2mth, I can honestly say that it doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> It did not smell as strong as the product  </li>
            <li> I  had seen someone post about this cream on Facebook and it was claiming some pretty amazing results.</li>
            <li> With good moisturizer, I can put on my makeup like normal and go to town or a party</li>
            <li> With good moisturizer, I can put on my makeup like normal and go to town or a party</li>
            <li> #34;you have such beautiful skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Once I wash my face, scrub and put moisturizer on, they look fine.</li>
            <li> &gt; Improves skin texture, pore size, almost eliminates fine lines within 2 wks, and&lt;br</li>
            <li> My fine lines and even some deeper lines and wrinkles have diminished.  </li>
            <li> It controls my breakouts, reduces the appearance of fine lines, evens my skin tone, reduces redness.</li>
            <li> I have been faithfully using  the product since Oct 19 &amp; can see no change in my fine lines &amp; wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> In the morning, it&#x27;s fine, but I feel that I&#x27;m washing it off when I wash my face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Swelling and inflammation will often reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I saw huge changes in my skin completion and my acne scaring.  </li>
            <li> Huge difference on u skin.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge change.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample to try for free by a rep</li>
            <li> It works!you can get it free by signing up as a preferred customer.</li>
            <li> The reps who sell this product make a profit so you are probably spending way more than it&#x27;s really worth because of the pyramid effect.  </li>
            <li> IMPORTANT:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Nerium partner that&#x27;s how I know you can get trial for free</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve given them out for free personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> he will let you try it for free before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I was given a free bottle of this by a Nerium brand partner which was ever so generous.  </li>
            <li> I received that same message from NERIUM CEO, Jeff Olsen, as well as a phone call from one of his \\&quot;assistants\\&quot; assuring me Jeff is a \\&quot;great guy\\&quot; and will take care of me.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my face is.</li>
            <li> my time is too important for a &#x27;multi step&#x27; process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> you get yours for FREE</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> I think it is a very good moisturizer, but other than that</li>
            <li> As I got to the end of my first bottle people started asking me if I&#x27;d been on vacation, and then someone asked me if I&#x27;d &amp;#34;had work done&amp;#34;!!  </li>
            <li> This is an awesome product, and very fast shipping, and I&#x27;d like to recommend for someone who want your get more tone and specially: uneven skin</li>
            <li> When trying a new skin care product its important to remember that there is no miracle in a bottle that will work amazing for everyone and every skin type.  </li>
            <li> and I have significant reduction in redness</li>
            <li> I did help make someone rich.  </li>
            <li> pretty sure I can&#x27;t post it here??</li>
            <li> Another review said the people selling this are &#x27;getting rich&#x27; and &#x27;getting Lexus&#x27;s&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased this item from a NeriumAD representative and paid much more.  </li>
            <li> I was able to with out having to sign up for monthly shipments or committ myself to any 30 trial or pay the higher non-preferred price etc.</li>
            <li> If you want to do something useful to protect your skin, STAY OUT OF THE SUN and help BAN ALL TOXIC TOBACCO SMOKE, EVERYWHERE, NOW!</li>
            <li> It looked like the pump was clean and unused.  </li>
            <li> This cream is amazing and many people have told me I look younger or I am &amp;#34;just</li>
            <li> love this product keep it coming can&#x27;t get enough of this fantastic breakthrough so easy to use and the results are awsome love it</li>
            <li> , I did my smile lines last year for $200.00  and got great results that have lasted</li>
            <li> I wish I could scream with all the air in my lungs that this is a get rich quick scheme, and it&#x27;s not you who&#x27;s getting rich, but the person with the glib tongue who persuaded you to buy it.</li>
            <li> but it sure did the job on my large pores on my nose and on the skin on both sides of the nose.  </li>
            <li> It smells more pure and if it had the oder of anything else, I think it would distort the purity factor in</li>
            <li> Many things do not naturally smell nice.  </li>
            <li> hope you like it as much as my momma does :)</li>
            <li> And to top it all off, the product smells absolutely HORRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Be sure to apply this product to a VERY damp face.</li>
            <li> Horses eat it because it&#x27;s sweet, and then they die!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> and you get a full refund.  </li>
            <li> &quot; So true.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I think its a scam or just very unexperienced people that are selling and liking this product.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful for the Amazon reviews, if you look over them you can always get a TRUE idea of the product in question.</li>
            <li> and it could have expired and lost its full potency.</li>
            <li> Other than that, product is great...</li>
            <li> I tried this product through a salon first and saw some improvement in fine lines.  </li>
            <li> and I think it smells really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> :  After using this for only 2 or 3  more nights, (not in a row)  I have more to share.  </li>
            <li> YES, most purchasers have an opportunity to try the product for FREE from a BP (Brand Partner), or can contact NERIUM directly for a no risk, 30 day guarantee purchase.</li>
            <li> I think the older you are and the deeper the wrinkles, the more time it takes to see results.  </li>
            <li> I bought mine from Amazon, and got lucky.  </li>
            <li> Do you really want to support an unethical person, when you could be supporting an honest person who is trying to build an ethical business all for saving a couple dollars.</li>
            <li> I am a huge skeptic, and really didn&#x27;t think it was going to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, within 5 days I saw a huge difference in my skin texture and appearance.</li>
            <li> I have used NeriumAD for only 2 1/2 weeks now and the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li> After using it for just a few nights both of us liked how much better our skin looked and felt.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every dollar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is well worth the money</li>
            <li> -- now THAT&#x27;S a product that is worth the money.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s worth it, trust me).</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Kind of like that stuff that pumps up your lips, but only if you apply it every day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be effective as a possible treatment.  </li>
            <li> But, you must give this product an honest try, which includes spritzing your face with water before applying, using enough product, massaging it well into your face, using it at night before bed (giving it a chance to absorb before you hit the pillow).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare</li>
            <li> Oh by the way, the product is worth 4-5 stars</li>
            <li> For the short time I had the sample it seemed to be a nice product</li>
            <li> I not only got results but people have noticed how nice my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> The product is pretty good but does not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Let me just say all the before and after pics were a little too good to be true</li>
            <li> I really was excited and wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> Right now, 20 minutes after application,  I feel like my face is drying up.</li>
            <li> No change on the right side, yet, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing results for only 6 nights of use, and not all in a row.  </li>
            <li> Reviewing Nerium AD, it is a biotechnology breakthrough, a PATENTED, ANTI OXIDANT, ANTI AGING CREAM, for night use, and will very quickly improve the overall texture of skin, lessening fine lines, improving tone and lessening the appearance of sagging skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very few fine lines and pretty good skin tone</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Nerium for the past two months, and it works great for ME...</li>
            <li> full well what this product really</li>
            <li> I will continute to use it and hope that 6-12 months down the road I look as good as my girlfriend does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled a company has decided to employee people vs. giving bukoo bucks to advertising and large corporations such as Macy&#x27;s or Nordstroms.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;d rather get botox for certain results!</li>
            <li> I certainly will become one!</li>
            <li> Renee is the co-owner and their website says, \\&quot;her generous and compassionate heart is appreciated by all who work with her.\\&quot; I can tell you straight up that this is a huge lie.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as exfoliating, try Pretty Hands and Feet, available right here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I certainly hope this is worth it.</li>
            <li> If the product was soooo great and worked as promised, then why is it soooo hard to return your product?</li>
            <li> but...the top of the bottle had been taken off and looked like someone tried to put it back on!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first.</li>
            <li> And, be sure that you send the product back within 10 days of getting your refund #, because otherwise you don&#x27;t get your refund at ALL!!!</li>
            <li> This whole process seems shady and unreputable from a company that claims proven results and great customer service.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time to use Nerium which was recommended to me by my daughter.</li>
            <li> The owners are millionaires who think that the world revolves around them and are willing to trample on and chew up anyone who comes in their way.</li>
            <li> more clients keep asking me how I can look 20 yrs younger without surgery.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Glad I only paid the Amazon price.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> but I spray my face with water first as recommended and dilute the product, once it soaks in and drys my face</li>
            <li> many of the negative reviews won&#x27;t  tell you the truth that you can try it for free, YES for free, if it doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t buy them...</li>
            <li> I started putting a light coat on my 3yr old nieces eczema (on her feet), and in 3 days it&#x27;s almost gone.  </li>
            <li> Well, as an American who would like to see American&#x27;s successful and EMPLOYED, I don&#x27;t have any issue with that.  </li>
            <li> wrinkles doesn&#x27;t make anybody feel pretty.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get anyone interested - family, friends, or strangers.  </li>
            <li> I am an Esthetician and have used many different skincare lines.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It is so much softer!</li>
            <li> I am sold on this product just for the fact that it has rejuvinated my skin and feels so much softer and healthier!</li>
            <li> Bought this on Amazon after given a sample by a Nerium representative (or &amp;#34;brand partner&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> you look 20 years younger :-)</li>
            <li> The first nite I put this on</li>
            <li> Because it is a poisonous plant which has been studied to kill cancer, it would be the most likely culprit for the damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> I used it for one month exactly as directed and saw NO improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> BUT CAN&#x27;T GET ANYONE INTERESTED,</li>
            <li> a friend sent me like 6 bottles and wanted me to try to get friends and family interested.</li>
            <li> Some may see results after a few days but give a full 30 days to see better results and try for 3months to see the full effect.</li>
            <li> This is a very natural, LIGHT, kind of different natural plant smell.  </li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 25 years old and have been on a mission to clear my very light acne scars before seeking plastic surgery/laser.</li>
            <li> With businesses of this type you can as much as you&#x27;re willing to work for and more than anyone that is above you.</li>
            <li> I can already see the brightness and vitality returning to my face, and the fine lines and wrinkles are becoming less noticable.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful I&#x27;d see some good results but my regular jel mask does the same thing...</li>
            <li> how much you love them because that has no bearing on their actions towards those of us who have had medical attention because of their products.</li>
            <li> The price seems high, but worth it.</li>
            <li> After 3 months I saw positively NOTHING.  </li>
            <li> and I do see some positive results.</li>
            <li> Other friends have had great results on different areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since they don&#x27;t have an advertising budget, this helps keep the price of the product down and allows ppl who want to have a business of their own to make money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> Nerium is better for dry skin.</li>
            <li> smart company.</li>
            <li> and it certainly is working.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and can&#x27;t tolerate a lot of products and was very leary about this one.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t the best however, if a product works Im ok with a bad smell!  </li>
            <li> and I can see definite results with nerium ad with fine lines dimishing.</li>
            <li> Definitely did notjong for my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want to look younger and reduce fine lines?</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended by friends &amp; nurses.</li>
            <li> but I can tell you after using the product for a few months I can tell you my skin looks amazing and</li>
            <li> Huge red flag for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a fraction of what this nonsense costs and it will give you great results in eliminating dead cells on the surface of your skin.  </li>
            <li> The reps should warn those trying it that it really tightens and dries your skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is flaking and peeling much like if you go get an RX for Retinol.  </li>
            <li> The reps should warn those trying it that it really tightens and dries your skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is flaking and peeling much like if you go get an RX for Retinol.  </li>
            <li> He gave me a whole bottle and asked that I use it.</li>
            <li> If you want to spend a fortune on something that works, try Creme De La Mer --you&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
            <li> Really, people.</li>
            <li> You really have nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li> I expected to to work better on age spots and 60 days I have seen no change in the couple spots on my face.</li>
            <li> make so much improvement in skin.  </li>
            <li> I prefer straight sand than water mixes in this goo all night.  </li>
            <li> The photos are totally REAL.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really do much else.  </li>
            <li> I bought this cream a while ago, I used it for about 3 weeks straight.</li>
            <li> I has worked well, though it takes more time than I expected.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Very drying, no improvement.  </li>
            <li> I was VERY suspicious of it and their claims.</li>
            <li> After using the product for a month straight</li>
            <li> I saw it at Home and Garden show in Okc but theirs was more pink lotion</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin, but my biggest problem with it is how it feels when I put it</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t know what you are really buying here.</li>
            <li> It is against corporation policy to sell on these type of websites and anyone who does is very unethical to do so.</li>
            <li> it cleaned my face very well</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that it does improve the wrinkles as fast as they proclaim.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy on Amazon because I really wanted to try the product without committing myself.</li>
            <li> it runs out to fast need to order&lt;</li>
            <li> Really recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> in fact, because it&#x27;s so drying, i think it aged my skin more.  </li>
            <li> but I did really want to try the product.</li>
            <li> Someday I will share what the change really is.  </li>
            <li> Even at the end of the day with a five o clock shadow my face is smooth and looks so much younger.</li>
            <li> My friend Maggie absolutely loves this cream.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t perfumed and for what it is, it didn&#x27;t bother me so much.</li>
            <li> will say the women I met that are happy with thier results are younger and I feel did not have a regular facial regime</li>
            <li> (she&#x27;s very worried about her appearance).</li>
            <li> more in the near future</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel tight, made it rough, made it break out, and deepened fine wrinkles in my \\&quot;parentheses.\\&quot; I am struggling to reverse the damage by returning to my previous excellent products (Amore Pacific) and Clarisonic Pro.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and does work, but if purchased from other than a brand partner, the product quality you receive is questionable and at your own risk.</li>
            <li> These are mostly people and other companies who have competing products or technologies and see their business threaten.</li>
            <li> I did notice a more even skin tone, but other than that</li>
            <li> After all the hype I was excited to finally try a product that \\&quot;works\\&quot; - supposedly.&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen any changes in my skin, but since I bought 3 bottles, I will use them all and in case anything still happens (which I doubt), I will update my reciew.</li>
            <li> She raves about this product and has many of my other friends using it as well.</li>
            <li> I do not believe this product is safe or beneficial to the skin, other than the benefits of aloe vera.</li>
            <li> My 11 brow lines are more pronounce since I haven&#x27;t been using my other night creams and my pores</li>
            <li> No more breakouts (which used to be a continually issue for me) and numerous compliments about my great skin.</li>
            <li> I actually fell in love with the product so much that I became a brandpartner, so I could get the product for free (80$ a month is a little steep for a college-girl)</li>
            <li> Because I was \\&quot;privileged\\&quot; to hear all the high hype from one of the reps on this product, I was even angrier when it did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> I am not much of a people person (I have social anxiety) and the nice lady and gentleman who gave me the bottle I am using attend lots of meetings.</li>
            <li> People are so used to perfumy, chemical laden products that do nothing but feel and small nice.  </li>
            <li> For $100, with a full 30-day money back guarantee</li>
            <li> it did lighten the dark age spots somewhat, but it&#x27;s not gone for sure.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Postscript:  I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now and do see a difference in a more even skin tone, smaller pores and my wrinkles are much less prominent, particularly on my forehead, between my eyes and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> am wondering how many of these comments are left by Estheticians that have an investment in the products they sell and/or people who are just simply in a hurry!</li>
            <li> I am older so my age may have something to do with that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Smell is a bit strong the first few times</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their skin.</li>
            <li> For anyone considering doing Nerium, ask yourself a few very important questions.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend NeriumAd Night Cream.</li>
            <li> ;  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend NeriumAD.</li>
            <li> I sent my container back for a refund after the first use!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin so beware.</li>
            <li> I sometimes feel my face during the day and am really amamzed at how soft it feels.</li>
            <li> price tag is a stretch for most), it&#x27;s an MLM company (no thanks), or family members that bought a bottle out of pity, but saw no results and didn&#x27;t think it is worth the $120/bottle.  </li>
            <li> but so far I am seeing the very beginning of results.  </li>
            <li> I have to laugh at these reviews of people who say they&#x27;ve been a sun worshiper for years, and Nerium is the only thing that has worked for them, to erase the damage.</li>
            <li> $tore purchase$ worth passed; and I might as well have been using regular hand cream on my face.  </li>
            <li> And on top of that, the broken bottle was 3/4 full.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice moisturizer that leaves your skin feeling soft, which in turn could make your wrinkles appear less apparent.  </li>
            <li> She explained that when she first applied it at night her face got very tight, but by the next morning she said she rinsed her face and absolutely felt the difference :)</li>
            <li> I just turned 64 and didn&#x27;t have great expectations for this product based on past experience with other products.</li>
            <li> so far have seen a little difference, will have to continue using it to be able to tell if I see anymore</li>
            <li> This was a HUGE let down, I look older than when I bought this, a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I like to try new products.</li>
            <li> After using the product they take a new picture with you looking up.&lt;br /&gt;Naturally crease decrease when your head is tilting up.  </li>
            <li> Also, you will miss out on all your other benefits from buying from an official Nerium Brand Partner, such as 30-day-money back guarantee, receive the product for free monthly through the 3 UR Free program.</li>
            <li> I also believe people that did not take before and after photos really missed the boat on how much they actually did improve...</li>
            <li> skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> pretty much eliminated the dry spots on my face with out being oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> She said our other women relatives love it and threw away their former night products.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re constantly in the sun and not protecting yourself in the first place, then nothing you use is going to be the answer.  </li>
            <li> The first morning after I used it my wrinkles on my upper lip were GONE!</li>
            <li> I am willing to bet the before/after photos are totally touched up and airbrushed.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer Bare Minerals products and skin creams.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> The product may help some people but I am not sure if I will buy more of the product.</li>
            <li> The person with the most dramatic improvement wins.  </li>
            <li> In fact it seemed to make my face feel more dry and made my fine lines look worse.</li>
            <li> If your experience is similar to mine this would cut the cost in half making it seem much more affordable.  </li>
            <li> I may be having a mild allergic reaction, but it could be the dead, drying skin cells ready to be scrubbed off.  </li>
            <li> 68 year old man can only give a positive and glowing review of this product.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s less of those than us middle class folks (if there is such a thing),but you sell more if it&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
            <li> Do them a favor, help them out as they work hard to serve their customers and they will make sure you are taken well care of.</li>
            <li> Good tweezers are a must for pulling off stubborn little pieces of dead skin, too.  </li>
            <li> Good tweezers are a must for pulling off stubborn little pieces of dead skin, too.  </li>
            <li> now you can hardly see any evidence of scaring and many of the marks are completely gone.  </li>
            <li> a writer and musician my eyes are extremely important to me and any discomfort makes it hard for me to read and besides, who wants to be on stage, in magazines and on television with a disfigured eye?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 30 days my cheeks look almost clear.</li>
            <li> clear up acne&lt;br /&gt;Pore</li>
            <li> I have before and after pictures which clearly show the damage.  </li>
            <li> I suffered from adult acne which left a lot of scarring that I was very self conscious about.</li>
            <li> I used the product for 4 days and immediately saw one of the craters near my eyebrow dissipate.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that this product is marketed without a cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have no issues.</li>
            <li> I had to write a review so far in response to what others had written.  </li>
            <li> have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Overall appearance of my skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li> and there is no dead skin showing.  </li>
            <li> and there is no dead skin showing.  </li>
            <li> They are still gone and my skin is baby soft and it appears to be helping my rosacea.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This does make your skin feel soft, but I have been using for over a month and have not seen any visible signs.</li>
            <li> Purchase product from an authorized Nerium Brand Partner, or directly from Nerium.com.  </li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t come directly from the company, you will not know about shelf life, storage and changes of temperature, tampering, safety, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the process with the progress of this product as I am 1 month into using it, but so far I am seeing improvement in my face &amp; tops of my hands.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft &amp; smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Removes pigmentation &amp; brightness face.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 37 yrs old)</li>
            <li> It did make my skin soft</li>
            <li> Save your money especially since it costs for much.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has made a marked improvement on that area as well as on my face.  </li>
            <li> it actually made a very noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> I currently haven&#x27;t made a dime off the product but have to say it still does work very well.</li>
            <li> did I really notice how much it actually did improve.</li>
            <li> timing!!This stuff really works ,,,,,,,has made a big difference in my skin clarity and over all appearance!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it too near my eyes</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s all natural??</li>
            <li> I tried this product for nearly a month.</li>
            <li> so it does seem to last MUCH longer than one month</li>
            <li> I rinse my face at nice, then apply a thin coating of this product (2 pumps) and that is it.</li>
            <li> Also, more expensive doesn&#x27;t always mean it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> The problem with MLM in general is nobody wants to sell, certainly not your friends and family, and nobody wants to be recruited as a salesperson to go out and recruit other salespeople and no matter what MLM, it&#x27;s always the same, strong resistance to being recruited because people don&#x27;t want to work.  </li>
            <li> Came just as expected and in the right</li>
            <li> So easy to use and no more skin issues.</li>
            <li> It actually helps to erase dark age spots and smooth my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have know a woman personally for 20 years who&#x27;s skin always looked ashy and older than she was.</li>
            <li> I choose not to use it on my full face, so the contents last longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Willing to work with it longer as quite a few others have had very impressicve results with it</li>
            <li> It seemed more financially practical for me to start small.</li>
            <li> If you look at the reviews for this product it becomes obvious that many of the reviewers are like my co worker who is trying to sell it or promote it, and then there are other less glowing reviews from REAL CUSTOMERS.</li>
            <li> Some ppl just love to shoot something down if it didn&#x27;t work for them after they put no real effort into it.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes when I joined</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to scrub too much on the new baby skin underneath.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to scrub too much on the new baby skin underneath.  </li>
            <li> Other products seem to do much better and at half the cost.</li>
            <li> I was open to the idea of a new cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pasty going on, and when dry is somewhat crusty.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only twenty, and obviously not concerned about wrinkles, but this product shrunk my pores, and really evened out my complexion.</li>
            <li> BUT, in the final form is not deadly unless you eat it!  </li>
            <li> The problem with ppl leaving negative remarks about something is you have no idea who they are or how credible that person is.  </li>
            <li> I never saw any result and the only reason I stuck with it so long was because it was so very pricey.</li>
            <li> This product made my skin extremely dry and the few fine lines that I have</li>
            <li> I have looked for a product to meet my busy schedule and have finally found one that I can use overnight.</li>
            <li> I tried getting the product directly from Nerium, same thing.</li>
            <li> One issue though, Nerium is not approved to be sold from retailers like Amazon, only directly from their brandpartners&#x27; website ( As an example, mine is [...] )</li>
            <li> When I finally did get a customer service associate, they said that I had to get a refund #, then send the product back and even with an unopened, unused bottle, I may not get back my whole purchase price.  </li>
            <li> and I barely need any makeup.</li>
            <li> I am 71 years old and I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> And the bare bottom line is, if it didn&#x27;t make&lt;br /</li>
            <li> and I can barely see any wrinkles at all.</li>
            <li> Once I stopped using it my skin went back to its old state</li>
            <li> But, Amazon can&#x27;t guarantee the quality of the product as far as shelf life, what temperature variations it has been through, who had it sitting on their shelf prior to selling, etc.  </li>
            <li> purchased in early May From Amazon and still have product at the end of the third week of June.</li>
            <li> Please FB me as my next step is a CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT to show NERIUM that they can&#x27;t just make people go away.</li>
            <li> However, we know that it is healing rapidly and causing sloughing off of the dead skin much faster than normal.  </li>
            <li> However, we know that it is healing rapidly and causing sloughing off of the dead skin much faster than normal.  </li>
            <li> She is 53 turning 54 in 3 weeks, she has really good and youthful skin but is afraid her age will catch up to her.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the hype, it&#x27;s based more on getting people to join and not About the poor product</li>
            <li> After a couple more uses, it has not gotten any worse.  </li>
            <li> I can save that money and get juvederm injections and or Botox after a few months, thats allot of filler I could do my brows, nose and smile lines</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;m not interested), how much is it?</li>
            <li> It does feel tight when you put it on the first time..</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first, but I fell in love after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m HIGHLY suspicious of the negative reviews here, my first thought goes to competitive skin care cream that is scared when they see how well this stuff actually works</li>
            <li> I am not sure it is worth it for me to have to take a Xanax to go to a meeting or, God forbid, pitch the product to a group of people.</li>
            <li> had me going to several doctors in different cities over the past few months and created a lump ON my right lid as well as a lump UNDER my right lid, which is still there.</li>
            <li> You MUST have your skin slightly damp, or it will be very sticky going on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the third day a long time skin problem had cleared up completely.</li>
            <li> I do hope this product continues to sell, because while I have not seen \\&quot;miraculous\\&quot; results, my wrinkles are much less noticeable, my skin is smoother with tighter pores, and even my husband, who never notices much of anything, has commented that I look younger.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;tightness&amp;#34; others report doesn&#x27;t really feel all that tight to me and dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> NeriumAD Night Cream didn&#x27;t work for me, made my face very dry, felt itchy and uncomfortable plus the smell wasn&#x27;t nice either.</li>
            <li> The bottle was broken from the inside and the top was covered with old, dried Nerium.  </li>
            <li> Buying NeriumAD other than from a brand partner voids the 30-day money back guarantee that Nerium International offers.  </li>
            <li> As far as the smell other reviewers mentioned, I didn&#x27;t find it that offensive.  </li>
            <li> Even having my face damp when applying, it is a little dry, can&#x27;t really see any reduction in face lines yet.</li>
            <li> You should definately take a break after 3 or 4 nights of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will also need to purchase one of those rough exfoliating pads to try and get as much of the dead skin off as possible.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to \\&quot;sell\\&quot; your friends on something if you haven&#x27;t given it enough time to show real results.</li>
            <li> Nerium&#x27;s customer service was terrible; when I tried to call into their customer service, the line stated that due to the overwhelming call volume, they would not be able to answer my call.</li>
            <li> Seriously - If anything was such a \\&quot;miracle in a bottle\\&quot; do you really think that it would only cost $100??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously - If anything was such a \\&quot;miracle in a bottle\\&quot; do you really think that it would only cost $100??\\</li>
            <li> /&gt;Details:&lt;br /&gt;I am 56, white and medium skin tone with oily and dry places on my face.  </li>
            <li> scaring has decreased tremendously.</li>
            <li> those few who had good results, there are far less expensive ways of achieving the same results with just a little research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will give another review after a couple of weeks of using to detail any positive or negative results.</li>
            <li> Waste of money didn&#x27;t work, I don&#x27;t know how this product got so many good reviews, maybe the people just wanted to believe so bad that it works, waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> Anything worthwhile takes effort and you can expect disappointment along the way.  </li>
            <li> I guess the dramatically different reviews here - great and terrible - show that not every product works the same on everyone.  </li>
            <li> When it cleared up a long standing skin problem I asked her to send me a bottle.</li>
            <li> Or go get some filler injections (in the long run, cheaper than Nerium</li>
            <li> my skin just couldn&#x27;t take this product for that long to see the effects of it.</li>
            <li> I get a feeling that many of the people who say this hasn&#x27;t worked are used to those fake \\&quot;pump you up\\&quot; products that let you down because it&#x27;s an illusion that it works.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s the New Yorker inside of me that is subconsciously drawn towards the negative</li>
            <li> Do I want to recruit other salespeople such as friends and family?  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but well worth the money!</li>
            <li> have used several other name brand anti ageing ad anti wrinkle creams and none has done what Nerium has done.</li>
            <li> customer service representatives refused to take any responsibility or offer any compensation other than possibly paying for a trip to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a seller, your only hope of making money off this product is to find someone more desperate and less informed than you are.  </li>
            <li> My skin is dry.</li>
            <li> but it leaves my skin dry.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be on the oily side with dry patches and I have had no problem whatsoever with dryness or flaking.  </li>
            <li> My skin for whatever reason was extremely dry after seven days.  </li>
            <li> Does not live up to expectations after using two bottles of it faithfully every night.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a single variety of oleander which is non-toxic-</li>
            <li> A single bottle to try at the party would have cost me $110.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather spend my money buying something natural like this product than to have injections at $150 a pop, that have to be repeated every few months!  </li>
            <li> I am 42 years old and have never used skin care products, other than the makeup I wear everyday.</li>
            <li> This one gets a big 2 thumbs down.</li>
            <li> my crows-feet are almost gone and the deep lines in my forehead are half what they were before.  </li>
            <li> Typically I stick to medical grade skin care products because when it comes to skin care</li>
            <li> The wrinkles seem shorter and less deep.  </li>
            <li> A rash type redness appeared on my cheeks and my skin was very dry.  </li>
            <li> It makes me face feel very dry.</li>
            <li> All this improvement (25-67 percent improvement in independent clinical reviews), without any of the down effects of retinoids and other products.</li>
            <li> I might as well have flushed $100.00 down the toilet.</li>
            <li> MLM has become a toxic brew for 99% of America as we live in a extremely cynical society that wants no part of Nerium or other MLM companies.  </li>
            <li> If you look at the people who gave 4 or less stars, you see other reviews for different things that they have purchased.</li>
            <li> Missing some actual product inside.</li>
            <li> Withing a few hours the flaking would be back!</li>
            <li> I took before photos, as instructed, and saw absolutely no results.  </li>
            <li> but for now, I agree with all those that said it make wrinkles much worse and is very drying....</li>
            <li> Be careful of who you listen too and decide to except what they are saying.</li>
            <li> TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.  </li>
            <li> I WISH I COULD DO THIS REVIEW WITH MINUS 10 STARS....</li>
            <li> and I have spent hundreds of dollars on creams and laser treatments.  </li>
            <li> I really never saw the benefit.</li>
            <li> No real noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I asked to sample it, but lord in heaven, when they put it on my hand and I lifted it to my face, my nose closed up</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I see absolutely no difference in my skin and my jel mask</li>
            <li> I have have been diligent in application only missing 1 or 2 nights</li>
            <li> but you can try it and get your money back within 30 days if you are not happy (contact nerium directly about their guarantee).  </li>
            <li> Smells a little weird and is drying but diminishes fine lines, dark spots and scars,</li>
            <li> Self evaluation is very tough to do, and the results of the improvement will be apparent after 5-7 days of product use by simple photographic means such as a camera phone or any camera.</li>
            <li> (Have had other issues with them).</li>
            <li> If you click on the reviews that received 5 stars you see that these people have not wrote any other reviews or purchased any other products??  </li>
            <li> As an Amazon seller and buyer of other items, I am amazed at the amount of NERIUM postings on the site.  </li>
            <li> Unless you can answer yes to all 3, run, don&#x27;t walk from this company or any other MLM.</li>
            <li> No thanks!</li>
            <li> After finding nothing from the BBB and other sources one would complain to I agreed to try a bottle for a month, and I warned him that I would take a before photo and post it to my Facebook page to discourage my friends</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sorry I bought into it, but I am sorry it didn&#x27;t work out like I had hoped.</li>
            <li> If not, then go choose one of the other thousands of skin care products on the market today.</li>
            <li> I used the product as instructed and did not mix it with any other products.</li>
            <li> I had an identical reaction to one of the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> The cost is extreme.</li>
            <li> it was not like the three other that i had perchase from a frend.</li>
            <li> I really dont care how good a product is if the company and the people behind it are terrible.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin feel very dry and tight.  </li>
            <li> although it says to use for 90 days for clear results, I did try for 60 days without fail and felt my skin didn&#x27;t look any different, no improvement whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> , wich means lots of dry, dead skin.</li>
            <li> , wich means lots of dry, dead skin.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that within just a few minutes after applying my skin feels dry as dust.</li>
            <li> While a lot of people on these reviews have said it has a terrible odor, I find the scent to be pleasant.</li>
            <li> Based on the way they have handled my situation, they are a company that is built on greed and shady ethics because a company built on honesty takes responsibility for the good and the bad and does not ignore serious complaints but grows from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard for me to use only the four pumps recommended as I like to slather product on my face.  </li>
            <li> We asked some hard questions, were given the pseudo-scientific run-around, and promptly left.</li>
            <li> the past I&#x27;ve been skeptical of creams that promised such high results</li>
            <li> However, this product is not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> but this product is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> I also have a lot of dark spots.  </li>
            <li> My dark spots are lightening up and it has helped lighten the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Skin bleaching creams bleach the skin around the dark spots, so they end up looking like they have a spotlight on them.  </li>
            <li> my face got dark and had plenty dark spots with this prodect</li>
            <li> Therefore, I am unable to say if it has any real age defying properties.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Considering the face that the skins natural moisture barrier needs to be broken in order for the nutrients to penetrate the skin.</li>
            <li> to show you the results they have you look down.  </li>
            <li> i purchased this product due to the reviews and a few friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad to say but I am finding more reviews that are questionable on this site.  </li>
            <li> i buy it on amazon for less any way.</li>
            <li> I did not have any of the dryness or flaking of skin mentioned in previous reviews.</li>
            <li> She can fake it to those on the outside, but get close enough and she will bite.</li>
            <li> Ive tried many different face creams but none that were as disgusting as this.</li>
            <li> It has less lines and glows.</li>
            <li> After applying it nightly for a month and a half I saw no improvement whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have had laser treatments done for $1200 for 4 treatments, and they didn&#x27;t do half what this Nerium has done on my neck in just 7 days.</li>
            <li> Nerium performs without any of the negative effects of other products, as some other products cause skin thinning, drying/skin sloughing, skin sun sensitivity, and reddening of the skin, that individuals typically experience with other prescription and non prescription creams.</li>
            <li> so you could be getting a sample bottle and not a full bottle.</li>
            <li> Yes, it feels a bit tight</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all on my wrinkles or anything for that matter, but I do like the way it makes my skin feel tight.  </li>
            <li> few lies (or half truths)</li>
            <li> and we both use the product with a little moistness on our faces at night.  </li>
            <li> The bottle lasted a little over a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nerium for a little over a week</li>
            <li> Little did I know it was a party for this stuff.</li>
            <li> It has a smell that is a little differnet, but I&#x27;m wearing it to bed...</li>
            <li> My skin was softer in the mornings and my frown lines softened up a little.</li>
            <li> Like it alot, but is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I read an article, did a little research, purchase one for me and one to give to a friend</li>
            <li> It has a rather&amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell, which takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> It did make my skin feel tight after it dried, but that seems to be determined by how damp your face is when you apply it.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical and read all kinds of blogs and comments about the negative aspects of NeriumAD, yet, after 30 days my age spots on my face and my hands have lightened to about half the darkness they used to be, and my fine lines have decreased somewhat also.</li>
            <li> My upper chest area has looked bad nearly all my life.  </li>
            <li> So I tried it, using it for about 2 weeks with a few nights&#x27; break after each 3 or 4 days in a row.</li>
            <li> waste your time or money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not cheap -- if a product works, I&#x27;ll spend the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the dark spots yet; I can&#x27;t stop staring at the reduction in wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME ORDERING....</li>
            <li> Every night my face felt like it had dried egg on it.</li>
            <li> When it dried your face feels like it is pulling.  </li>
            <li> First off, my wife and I are scientists, so we are very skeptical.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This worked wonders in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> This cream removes wrinkles and blemishes after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Someone needs to understandthat everyone doesn&#x27;t roll over and play dead because they get the runarounds from companies.</li>
            <li> Actually, probably worse since I started using this product in place of  my Retin-A. at night.</li>
            <li> the small wrinkles much less noticeable and gave my skin a softer feeling.</li>
            <li> (wont find this with other products usually!)</li>
            <li> I am sticking with it in hopes that in spite of ugly mornings, it will really reduce my eye wrinkles....</li>
            <li> After only a couple weeks skeptical friends started saying my neck had changed dramatically.</li>
            <li> I was not able to dispense the cream from the bottle.</li>
            <li> guarantee if you&#x27;re not satisfied.</li>
            <li> My family member was unfortunate enough to work for them.  </li>
            <li> I mean a little...</li>
            <li> Not sure if I wanna buy it again for the price it is</li>
            <li> This is no time in American history to be throwing big bucks casually for something useless, furthermore,  </li>
            <li> At least you won&#x27;t be crying over what you dished out for this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> By the seventh nite i could still not get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my eyes are not as puffy as usual , but that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Such hype about this product, don&#x27;t believe it, just another expensive cream.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t necesarrily mean it&#x27;s a \\&quot;scam\\&quot; or waste of everyones money.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed as I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> But kept after it - mainly because I hate to waste.</li>
            <li> Like others that rated this product with 1 star I too had very negative results from using this product for less than a month.  </li>
            <li> I can hardly wait to start this up again.  </li>
            <li> and I could hardly breathe.  </li>
            <li> I think it might look a little worse.</li>
            <li> I knew I had to at least try Nerium for myself after seeing photos of peoples neck&#x27;s and</li>
            <li> believe all the negative hipe.</li>
            <li> so I was hopeful to see at least SOMETHING.  </li>
            <li> If you bought the product here and had a negative reaction (I&#x27;ve never heard or seen any)</li>
            <li> I heard one complaint from someone claiming to be scientists saying this was a pyramid scam or ponzi scheme</li>
            <li> Yet, because of the negative things I&#x27;ve read about signing up for their auto shipment program, and because I found it for sale on Amazon, I have chosen to buy it through Amazon for now.</li>
            <li> they say that for age spots, you have to use if for at least 5 mths.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a negative experience with a skin care product before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I forced myself not to wash it off the smell</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money and there were no results!!</li>
            <li> I mean, Ponzi scam anyone?</li>
            <li> This stuff is certainly not worth the expensive cost.</li>
            <li> But I tried it as recommended and it seemed to make my problem worse not better.  </li>
            <li> As a former photo retoucher working in an advertising agency in Madison Ave., NYC, I was very skeptical of the before and after photos I was shown for this product.  </li>
            <li> Both are illegal and if found out would be shut down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had nasty red, flaking, irritated/itching skin between my eyes and into the eyebrow line and the side of my forehead and into the hairline for several years.</li>
            <li> Oleander is a poison, and if a customer of mine had a serious reaction, I would be held accountable.  </li>
            <li> Expensive purchase with little to no results.  </li>
            <li> Not a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be sorry you wasted your money.</li>
            <li> just beware of dishonest sellers!</li>
            <li> very unhappy with it, i don&#x27;t see nothing on my skin, any changes, the only thing i pay a lot of money for ????</li>
            <li> You would think if their product lived up to its claims, they would have no problem refunding your money, because they would have so few people returning the product!!!</li>
            <li> Some of my sun spots went away, and as soon as I stopped, they CAME BACK and WORSE!!!  </li>
            <li> Looked at all the reviews on amazon when I got home and was a little afraid that I made a mistake.  </li>
            <li> The company itself is poor.</li>
            <li> If you are not happy with your results from the product after ordering it from Amazon, it may be because the bottle had been tampered with, or diluted out.</li>
            <li> the mornings, my  eyes look worse than EVER.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse than I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> At 58, I cannot afford to spend time on a worthless product, and especially one that increases wrinkles, rather than helping to eliminate them.</li>
            <li> The cost is somewhat comparable to other night creams but the bad part is you have to sign up to keep getting it unless you order through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> IF you read bad reviews on the product it may be because people are purchasing the product from sources other than the brand partners selling it, which voids the warranty.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m sorry to say that I couldn&#x27;t get past the icky smell and unpleasant sticky feel of this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I splurged on this product, hoping for dramatic improvements after listening to all the hype.</li>
            <li> I have literally been trying to save for a mini neck lift- and now- after years of stressing out about it, that awful turkey neck flap thingy is nearly gone!</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst!</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait till it gets here!!</li>
            <li> Did some research and a common thread was that the once a month delivery was too often and that trying to get stop the auto-delivery was very difficult via Nerium.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> my wife ordered Nerium and I was skeptical that it would have any impact what so ever.  </li>
            <li> i was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> I believe if you knock out all of those questionable reviews, you will find the \\&quot;real\\&quot; reviews.....</li>
            <li> , I was skeptical because of the reviews.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s scary.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, I messed up.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the FDA is looking into this product or if anyone has noticed this MLM is a pyramid scheme which I thought were illegal?  </li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS USELESS.....</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t want me to become a brand partner because he&#x27;s so skeptical of any multilevel marketing program.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed AT ALL with this product!  </li>
            <li> looked even worse!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I fell for the *scam* and bought into it for $500.  </li>
            <li> wrong.  </li>
            <li> NERIUM believes I am going away, they are sadly mistaken.</li>
            <li> so EVERYONE can see that there is the possibility for a reaction before someone ends up going blind, or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if she can&#x27;t see a difference in my skin then I will not continue to waist my money on this expensive product.</li>
            <li> and I now have an uncomfortable and unsightly situation.</li>
            <li> MLM in a very cynical society is extremely difficult to do unless you already have a built in network/organization that you worked with in the past that you are already helping people making money.  </li>
            <li> expensive, and it truly smells bad.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like having to wash it off with cold water, but I know there is a reason for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought the cheapest face wash and never used night cream or moisturizers on my face because I was afraid it would break me out</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!</li>
            <li> It sounds bad, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> It sounds bad, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> bad as was hoping I would get the advertised results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard the smell was bad,  but  that was an understatement.</li>
            <li> I also like this because it doesn&#x27;t burn the heck out of your skin if you go out in the sun or give you a rash so bad that you don&#x27;t want to leave the house, or contain chemicals that give you cancer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> one else EVER had a reaction\\&quot; which, as you will see in FB, others have had some bad reactions and NERIUM blew them off as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> pointed out five ingredients in Nerium AD which are bad for the skin and said he had not studied the nerium oleander.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have to say that reading the bad reviews about Nerium almost turned me off.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the price of the product and did not want to become a &amp;#34;preferred&amp;#34; member so I went on Amazon to see if I could buy the product.</li>
            <li> I advise one test this before putting on your face-it would have been tragic for me if I had applied it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;too</li>
            <li> I cannot express how disappointed I am with Nerium.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing and cannot trust this company</li>
            <li> It was atrocious!  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nerium for a month now and am very disappointed.....</li>
            <li> I stopped using it a couple of weeks after my skin cleared - it&#x27;s been almost two weeks since and the terrible skin problem has not returned!</li>
            <li> However, the smell is just horrible.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY DISGUSTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND THE LYING REVIEWS</li>
            <li> The MLM marketing plan is awful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 40, so my wrinkles aren&#x27;t horrible and, in theory, this should have made some difference, but I didn&#x27;t see ANY at all.</li>
            <li> Its terribly misleading that almost all the postive reviews are from non verified buyers of this product.  </li>
            <li> and did I mention it smells awful?  </li>
            <li> The odor does not bother me as some people say the smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> One review said the smell is &#x27;horrible&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I say rotten beans or rotting meat is horrible.  </li>
            <li> I used it once &amp; had a horrible allergic reaction that shut my eyes,</li>
            <li> is  awful.  </li>
            <li> I had a terrible reaction to the Nerium product after just four days.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I knew I had to at least try Nerium for myself after seeing photos of peoples neck&#x27;s and my sister-in-laws photo.  I inherited my grandma&#x27;s turkey neck and friends and family were noticing...it really added years to my otherwise good for my age face (53). After only a couple weeks skeptical friends started saying my neck had changed dramatically. I can honestly say it is amazing. Other friends have had great results on different areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe all the negative hipe. These are mostly people and other companies who have competing products or technologies and see their business threaten. Also, people who are selling bottles on ebay and Amazon are putting in Jergins hand lotion to the bottles, so of course there are no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it yourself, nothing to loss with the 30 day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> I think this product is amazing. I have looked for a product to meet my busy schedule and have finally found one that I can use overnight. I love how smooth my skin feels when I rinse my face in the morning. I can already see the brightness and vitality returning to my face, and the fine lines and wrinkles are becoming less noticable.</li>
            <li> Expensive purchase with little to no results.  I&#x27;ll stick with StryVectin-SD, which I have used for years. Nothing ventured nothing gained.</li>
            <li> I was not able to dispense the cream from the bottle. The product arrived and was nicely packed, but there&#x27;s no way to get the product out of the bottle. Returning is a hassle because it&#x27;s a third party sale.</li>
            <li> although it says to use for 90 days for clear results, I did try for 60 days without fail and felt my skin didn&#x27;t look any different, no improvement whatsoever.  For the cost of $96/mo with shipping, etc, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. i&#x27;d rather get botox for certain results!</li>
            <li> Hoax. Just made me break out</li>
            <li> I suffered from adult acne which left a lot of scarring that I was very self conscious about. I tried peels, retinol and glycolic acid to no avail. I used the product for 4 days and immediately saw one of the craters near my eyebrow dissipate. After 30 days my cheeks look almost clear. I can&#x27;t believe it! Even my grandmother who is an aesthetician is amazed.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY disappointed! I thought I would give this one more try but...the top of the bottle had been taken off and looked like someone tried to put it back on! Missing some actual product inside. Very disappointing and cannot trust this company let alone the smell...(Have had other issues with them). The company itself is poor. No quality control or customer service no matter where you buy it. The product does not do what it claims either. Sadly, I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> my wife ordered Nerium and I was skeptical that it would have any impact what so ever.  I am in my 40&#x27;s and we both use the product with a little moistness on our faces at night.  We heard great reviews from family members who are skin care professionals.  After using it for just a few nights both of us liked how much better our skin looked and felt.  I have never reviewed any product on Amazon before but I can tell you after using the product for a few months I can tell you my skin looks amazing and my crows-feet are almost gone and the deep lines in my forehead are half what they were before.  We love it!</li>
            <li> This Night Cream works more like a light mask, but I could tell my skin was tighter with fewer noticeable lines.</li>
            <li> On my 2nd bottle of Nerium and I must say I do not find the product living up to the hype. I went to school for esthetics and I like to try new products. Typically I stick to medical grade skin care products because when it comes to skin care you get what you pay for. However, this product is not worth the cost. Especially for those that may not realize that proper steps need to be taken for the cream to penetrate. I am surprised that this product is marketed without a cleanser. Considering the face that the skins natural moisture barrier needs to be broken in order for the nutrients to penetrate the skin. I find no properties in this formulation that promote exfoliation. Low grade skin lightening components are used in this product. The seller shipped promptly and I give the seller 5 stars but this product is not worth the price. A price of $30 at best is about what this product is worth considering what is in it.</li>
            <li> Nerium AD Night Cream hasn&#x27;t done anything to improve my skin - what it claimed to do&lt;br /&gt;and I didn&#x27;t care the the smell of it either.</li>
            <li> I used this because a relative gave me a sample. She said our other women relatives love it and threw away their former night products. So I tried it, using it for about 2 weeks with a few nights&#x27; break after each 3 or 4 days in a row. It made my skin feel tight, made it rough, made it break out, and deepened fine wrinkles in my \\&quot;parentheses.\\&quot; I am struggling to reverse the damage by returning to my previous excellent products (Amore Pacific) and Clarisonic Pro.</li>
            <li> expensive, and it truly smells bad.  I had to return it.  The seller did refund my money.  I tried getting the product directly from Nerium, same thing.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product, and very fast shipping, and I&#x27;d like to recommend for someone who want your get more tone and specially: uneven skin</li>
            <li> NeriumAD is an incredible product. I was very skeptical at first, but I fell in love after using it. I&#x27;m only twenty, and obviously not concerned about wrinkles, but this product shrunk my pores, and really evened out my complexion. The (patented) antioxidant in this product is really incredible. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their skin. I actually fell in love with the product so much that I became a brandpartner, so I could get the product for free (80$ a month is a little steep for a college-girl) One issue though, Nerium is not approved to be sold from retailers like Amazon, only directly from their brandpartners&#x27; website ( As an example, mine is [...] ) If you are not happy with your results from the product after ordering it from Amazon, it may be because the bottle had been tampered with, or diluted out. Always order from a brandpartners website, not only is it guaranteed that you are getting what you paid for, but there is also a 30day money back guarantee in case you decide the product is not for you.</li>
            <li> But it is pricy.  Hard for me to use only the four pumps recommended as I like to slather product on my face.  Give it a try and see for yourself.  You will know after a month or two if it works for you.  Smells a little weird and is drying but diminishes fine lines, dark spots and scars,</li>
            <li> i purchased this product due to the reviews and a few friends. i figured this would be perfect for my mom. Knowing she is a picky person and knows A LOT about skin care products i was a bit skeptical. She is 53 turning 54 in 3 weeks, she has really good and youthful skin but is afraid her age will catch up to her.&lt;br /&gt;My mom has used the product for about 5 nights now. She explained that when she first applied it at night her face got very tight, but by the next morning she said she rinsed her face and absolutely felt the difference :) FEWWWWW(wiping sweat off my forehead!) SHE LOVES IT! every morning she says she feels her skin improving and feels more flawless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;try it out picky people! hope you like it as much as my momma does :)</li>
            <li> I really notice a difference after using it for a few months. I have sensitive skin and have no issues.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first. But kept after it - mainly because I hate to waste. But even the wrinkles on my fingertips were gone and they were permanently water pruned. I was amazed.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money and there were no results!! If the product was soooo great and worked as promised, then why is it soooo hard to return your product? Nerium&#x27;s customer service was terrible; when I tried to call into their customer service, the line stated that due to the overwhelming call volume, they would not be able to answer my call. Then I called the customer service line back later and waited on hold for 1 hour. When I finally did get a customer service associate, they said that I had to get a refund #, then send the product back and even with an unopened, unused bottle, I may not get back my whole purchase price.  And, be sure that you send the product back within 10 days of getting your refund #, because otherwise you don&#x27;t get your refund at ALL!!! This whole process seems shady and unreputable from a company that claims proven results and great customer service.  You would think if their product lived up to its claims, they would have no problem refunding your money, because they would have so few people returning the product!!!</li>
            <li> A friend sent me a sample which I used. When it cleared up a long standing skin problem I asked her to send me a bottle. If I had known the price beforehand I might never have bought it, but I&#x27;m sure glad that I did. It&#x27;s worth every dollar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 68 year old man can only give a positive and glowing review of this product. I&#x27;ve had nasty red, flaking, irritated/itching skin between my eyes and into the eyebrow line and the side of my forehead and into the hairline for several years. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of remedies. I would wash and exfoliate, then apply a moisturizer. Withing a few hours the flaking would be back! When I started using Nerium AD a drying effect is what I experienced on the first day. The second day my skin had noticeably improved. By the third day a long time skin problem had cleared up completely. I stopped using it a couple of weeks after my skin cleared - it&#x27;s been almost two weeks since and the terrible skin problem has not returned! I&#x27;m keeping this product and will order more if I ever run out. I can&#x27;t say enough in praise of Nerium AD. It&#x27;s the BEST skin product I&#x27;ve ever used (68 years, folks).</li>
            <li> I tried this product religiously for 3 months.  I took before photos, as instructed, and saw absolutely no results.  I have very few fine lines and pretty good skin tone so I was hopeful to see at least SOMETHING.  After 3 months I saw positively NOTHING.  And to top it all off, the product smells absolutely HORRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  This one gets a big 2 thumbs down.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.  Thought it would perform after seeing before/after pics from an acquaintance. It has a funky aroma, too.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for a month and saw nothing. I took the pictures and this product is snake oil  for $100 a bottle. Don&#x27;t believe the hype, it&#x27;s based more on getting people to join and not About the poor product</li>
            <li> Been using for two months and still am not seeing any results. Have many friends who use it and love it, so I will continue to use it for awhile. I want to give this product some more time before I feel I can give consumers an honest review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad to say but I am finding more reviews that are questionable on this site.  I tried this and it did nothing for me.  If you click on the reviews that received 5 stars you see that these people have not wrote any other reviews or purchased any other products??  If you look at the people who gave 4 or less stars, you see other reviews for different things that they have purchased. I believe if you knock out all of those questionable reviews, you will find the \\&quot;real\\&quot; reviews.....</li>
            <li> wrinkles improved.appearance of skin improved  I love the results will continue to use it is well worth the money thank you for making this  product</li>
            <li> This product has worked on my crows feet, deep forehead wrinkles, &amp; skin tone.  Also worked on one sons eczema and another sons adolescent acne.</li>
            <li> I am not a Nerium and never will be.  I wish I could have given it a rating lower than one star.  I have a friend who tried to persuade me to buy Nerium from her, and eventually become a seller.  I wish I could scream with all the air in my lungs that this is a get rich quick scheme, and it&#x27;s not you who&#x27;s getting rich, but the person with the glib tongue who persuaded you to buy it. If you&#x27;re a seller, your only hope of making money off this product is to find someone more desperate and less informed than you are.  People won&#x27;t listen.  I am a licensed esthetician, and I simply can&#x27;t, in good conscience, recommend Nerium to anyone.  Oleander is a poison, and if a customer of mine had a serious reaction, I would be held accountable.  I have to laugh at these reviews of people who say they&#x27;ve been a sun worshiper for years, and Nerium is the only thing that has worked for them, to erase the damage. The only thing I recommend for flawless, wrinkle-minimizing, beautiful skin is sunblock with SPF 30, but people won&#x27;t listen to that, either.  If you&#x27;re constantly in the sun and not protecting yourself in the first place, then nothing you use is going to be the answer.  Sun damage will prevail every time.</li>
            <li> if you buy this from Nerium, they send you one bottle every month. that&#x27;s is too often for me. i last one bottle for 3months.&lt;br /&gt;so i buy it on amazon for less any way.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium for a month and a 1/2 by day 21 I saw huge changes in my skin completion and my acne scaring.  I have had severe scaring since I was a teenager.  I really love it and I am blown away by the amazing results I am having, I was skeptical because of the reviews. I can&#x27;t believe if these people actually tried Nerium that they would not like it I am thinking it must be reviewed by someone who is threatened that something actually works well.</li>
            <li> Let me just say all the before and after pics were a little too good to be true but I was invited to a party and saw my friend&#x27;s results after only three weeks. Looked at all the reviews on amazon when I got home and was a little afraid that I made a mistake.  I have been using it for two weeks and I have significant reduction in redness and I barely need any makeup. It does feel tight when you put it on the first time..you do need a damp face. I thought the smell was just fine!! People are so used to perfumy, chemical laden products that do nothing but feel and small nice.  All I have to say is TRY IT FOR THREE WEEKS&gt; they have a money back guarantee. I have my mom trying it too..she is a bigger skeptic than me so we shall see!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff..everything I was hoping for and more every lady you should try this stuff you won&#x27;t be sorry..</li>
            <li> I had to write a review so far in response to what others had written.  I was given a sample to try for free by a rep that I accidently came into contact with at the auto repair shop, and have no intention of ever becoming a &#x27;seller&#x27; to make money on this, so no dog in the fight here.  And I didn&#x27;t pay for it, so I&#x27;m not complaining about the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell:  Lots of drama queens posting on smell.  Many things do not naturally smell nice.  This has a bit of a medicinal smell, but it&#x27;s not &#x27;horrible&#x27; or intolerable.  Everything has a smell. If it ends up working great, who cares what is smells like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and I noticed tonight some tingling.  UPDATE:  After a couple more uses, it has not gotten any worse.  I think that&#x27;s just the product working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mornings, my  eyes look worse than EVER.  The lines are SO deep and I have horrid bags under them with this stuff!  It&#x27;s worse than I&#x27;ve ever had and it&#x27;s scary.  It does make your skin feel very dry and tight.  I want to apply a bunch of moisturizer over it, but I think that defeats the purpose?  I am sticking with it in hopes that in spite of ugly mornings, it will really reduce my eye wrinkles.... but for now, I agree with all those that said it make wrinkles much worse and is very drying....temporarily???&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Eyes still look puffy and wrinkly in the am. after a night of wearing this.  I may be having a mild allergic reaction, but it could be the dead, drying skin cells ready to be scrubbed off.  Once I wash my face, scrub and put moisturizer on, they look fine. In fact, I do think it has reduced the appearance of the wrinkles around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After using this for only 2 or 3  more nights, (not in a row)  I have more to share.  My skin definately is looking better.  It&#x27;s tighter and my pores are MUCH smaller. Overall appearance of my skin is much smoother. It&#x27;s pretty amazing results for only 6 nights of use, and not all in a row.  I skipped about 3 nights in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me talk about what it does and how to use it.  The reps should warn those trying it that it really tightens and dries your skin.  My skin is flaking and peeling much like if you go get an RX for Retinol.  Retinol works great because it causes your skin to &#x27;renew&#x27; ultra fast. Another comparison is neosporin.  If you have an injury or blemish and use Neosporin, your skin dries, flakes and peels.  In fact, almost any good product that has good results has to have a rapid renewal of the skin, wich means lots of dry, dead skin. However, we know that it is healing rapidly and causing sloughing off of the dead skin much faster than normal.  I believe this is how this product works. I am experiencing rapid renewal of my skin. but in the process, you can experience some things that may cause alarm if you are not warned. You should definately take a break after 3 or 4 nights of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will also need to purchase one of those rough exfoliating pads to try and get as much of the dead skin off as possible.  You have to be careful not to scrub too much on the new baby skin underneath.  I did that... Good tweezers are a must for pulling off stubborn little pieces of dead skin, too.  It sounds bad, but it&#x27;s not.  With good moisturizer, I can put on my makeup like normal and go to town or a party and there is no dead skin showing.  You just have to know it&#x27;s going to happen and stay on top of it.ipped about 3 nights in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me talk about what it does and how to use it.

            <li> Sorry, I messed up. It is not the night cream I am using. It is the Nerium Age Defying Treatment 30ml. I will put my review on that page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the product for a couple of weeks. I am too vain to do before and after pictures. The first morning after I used it my wrinkles on my upper lip were GONE! They are still gone and my skin is baby soft and it appears to be helping my rosacea. I did not have any of the dryness or flaking of skin mentioned in previous reviews. I am still debating on whether or not to start selling it. I am not much of a people person (I have social anxiety) and the nice lady and gentleman who gave me the bottle I am using attend lots of meetings. I am not sure it is worth it for me to have to take a Xanax to go to a meeting or, God forbid, pitch the product to a group of people. I am also debating on whether to use my husband as my guinea pig for the before and after pics. I guess I need to think about it some more.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, great product, good price, will order again. I have ordered twice and I can see definite results with nerium ad with fine lines dimishing.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as good as I thought it would be, but did see some changes. Vitamin c does more for my skin than this.</li>
            <li> I have used this for sometime.  It actually helps to erase dark age spots and smooth my skin.  I will re-order soon</li>
            <li> Love this cream did have one where the pump did not work but was refunded quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Made the small wrinkles much less noticeable and gave my skin a softer feeling.</li>
            <li> This was a HUGE let down, I look older than when I bought this, a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading many of the comments listed here and I know opinions vary. I think the product is amazing and backed by an awesome company.  What many don&#x27;t know is that it&#x27;s against the company bylaws for this product to be sold on amazon.  You have no way of knowing if what you&#x27;re buying here is the actual product also You lose the 30 day money back guarantee if you&#x27;re not satisfied. If you bought the product here and had a negative reaction (I&#x27;ve never heard or seen any) then it&#x27;s not the companies responsibility. To be on the save side buy from a brand partner or preferred Nerium Customer. I heard one complaint from someone claiming to be scientists saying this was a pyramid scam or ponzi scheme well they obviously have no idea what those things are.  Both are illegal and if found out would be shut down. The government is a pyramid so is where ppl work. You can never make more than the manager, vice president or CEO. With businesses of this type you can as much as you&#x27;re willing to work for and more than anyone that is above you. You can&#x27;&#x27;t do that in corporate america! The problem with ppl leaving negative remarks about something is you have no idea who they are or how credible that person is.  Some ppl just love to shoot something down if it didn&#x27;t work for them after they put no real effort into it.  Anything worthwhile takes effort and you can expect disappointment along the way.  They make no claims that you will make 30k or anything for that matter, they state you CAN if you follow the system they&#x27;re teaching. One more thing, the reason that this product is sold the way it is using relational marketing aka MLM was because the company thought it would be the best way to get the product onto the market.  Word of mouth advertising is the best way to expose a product, service, or business. Since they don&#x27;t have an advertising budget, this helps keep the price of the product down and allows ppl who want to have a business of their own to make money. Be careful of who you listen too and decide to except what they are saying. Their experience doesn&#x27;t have to be yours!</li>
            <li> This does make your skin feel soft, but I have been using for over a month and have not seen any visible signs.</li>
            <li> My closest friend got caught up in the Nerium craze and joined to become a seller. He gave me a whole bottle and asked that I use it. The bottle lasted a little over a month. I saw no results. This guy is stubborn -- he has now given me a total of three bottles. I see NO RESULTS at all. While a lot of people on these reviews have said it has a terrible odor, I find the scent to be pleasant. What I don&#x27;t like is that within just a few minutes after applying my skin feels dry as dust. Maybe it works for some people, but for me it has done nothing. No reduction in wrinkles, no lessening of brown spots. Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine actually paying over $100 for a bottle of this stuff. I&#x27;m not cheap -- if a product works, I&#x27;ll spend the money. I&#x27;ve used Obagi for years. Love it. I love Creme De La Mer -- now THAT&#x27;S a product that is worth the money. You almost see an immediate difference in your skin and it feels heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Nerium? No, after over three months of use, I can&#x27;t recommend it. If you want to spend a fortune on something that works, try Creme De La Mer --you&#x27;ll be much happier. Or get a prescription of Retin-A and suffer through the weeks of peeling skin (it&#x27;s worth it, trust me). Or go get some filler injections (in the long run, cheaper than Nerium and you&#x27;ll actually see results).</li>
            <li> The product I received from this company arrived in a timely manner. It was in good shape and appears to be a fresh product.  It did not smell as strong as the product  I received from an actual Nerium dealer but it is working. I kind of like that it does not smell as strong.&lt;br /&gt;I trust this company and would probably order from them again.</li>
            <li> This is just a pyramide scheme.  This product is not any better than anything you can buy at the drug store.  When they take your&lt;br /&gt;picture to show you the results they have you look down.  After using the product they take a new picture with you looking up.&lt;br /&gt;Naturally crease decrease when your head is tilting up.  It would have been great if it did work.</li>
            <li> As an Amazon seller and buyer of other items, I am amazed at the amount of NERIUM postings on the site.  The NERIUM AD Night and Day cream is offered through a marketing program via Nerium Brand Partners.  YES, most purchasers have an opportunity to try the product for FREE from a BP (Brand Partner), or can contact NERIUM directly for a no risk, 30 day guarantee purchase. (wont find this with other products usually!) Why purchase from an unauthorized seller on Amazon?  By the tally of selling prices, you are not saving any money by doing so.  Purchase product from an authorized Nerium Brand Partner, or directly from Nerium.com.  Nerium performs without any of the negative effects of other products, as some other products cause skin thinning, drying/skin sloughing, skin sun sensitivity, and reddening of the skin, that individuals typically experience with other prescription and non prescription creams. Reviewing Nerium AD, it is a biotechnology breakthrough, a PATENTED, ANTI OXIDANT, ANTI AGING CREAM, for night use, and will very quickly improve the overall texture of skin, lessening fine lines, improving tone and lessening the appearance of sagging skin.  All this improvement (25-67 percent improvement in independent clinical reviews), without any of the down effects of retinoids and other products. The most important factor for individuals trying the product from authorized Nerium BPS or the Nerium site is to TAKE A PICTURE of skin problem areas.  Self evaluation is very tough to do, and the results of the improvement will be apparent after 5-7 days of product use by simple photographic means such as a camera phone or any camera. Give Nerium a year, and Nerium will give you 10 years off your current age!</li>
            <li> There is no product like this on the market today. Created by a biotechnology company for use on skin cancer. During clinical trials they found that wrinkles were dramatically reduced. See results in a matter of days. Also an amazing application for acne, dermatitis and some skin disorders. (Not guaranteed or sold for use on skin conditions but I have seen it wor[[ASIN:B007NQA77U NeriumAD Night Cream (30 mL)]]k)</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Oleander sap can cause skin irritations, severe eye inflammation and irritation, and allergic reactions characterized by dermatitis\\&quot;-Wikipedia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive and I got a skin rash on the side of my neck where I tested this product. The rash has not gone away for several weeks. I advise one test this before putting on your face-it would have been tragic for me if I had applied it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;too bad as was hoping I would get the advertised results.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I have a friend who introduced this product to me. She raves about it and I wanted to try it out without having to sign up for autoship. It is a \\&quot;club\\&quot; product, where you have to know someone who sells it and either buy it for $110 or get it for $80 on autoship. I saved $ (used my Amazon points) and had no commitment to buy it again. I do love the results, though the product takes some getting used to. You MUST have your skin slightly damp, or it will be very sticky going on.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more, for sure. Has evened out my coloring and I haven&#x27;t had a pimple since (I&#x27;m in my 30s and get hormonal outbreaks).</li>
            <li> or that is what I would give it. My skin is dry. This had an even more drying effect on my skin. I am willing to bet the before/after photos are totally touched up and airbrushed.  Maybe it works for acne but definitely not for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and cannot speak to the efficacy. However, the smell is just horrible. Really, people. For $100.00 you should seriously be able to improve the smell. I will give another review after a couple of weeks of using to detail any positive or negative results. I certainly hope this is worth it. Right now, 20 minutes after application,  I feel like my face is drying up. At 58, I cannot afford to spend time on a worthless product, and especially one that increases wrinkles, rather than helping to eliminate them. We&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Postscript:  I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now and do see a difference in a more even skin tone, smaller pores and my wrinkles are much less prominent, particularly on my forehead, between my eyes and around my eyes. My cheeks are seeing results as well. I&#x27;m changing my review to 4 stars...the smell is still atrocious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd postscript: After using for 3 months, I&#x27;m sold. I do hope this product continues to sell, because while I have not seen \\&quot;miraculous\\&quot; results, my wrinkles are much less noticeable, my skin is smoother with tighter pores, and even my husband, who never notices much of anything, has commented that I look younger. I might add I also use this on my tummy where I have had stretch marks since the birth of my 3 children. I definitely see improvement. I&#x27;m very satisfied and looking forward to continued use.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for one week and I do see some positive results. I am in my mid-50&#x27;s, and I have deep wrinkles around my mouth and deep frown lines between my eyes.  I also have a lot of dark spots.  There is definitely a noticeable difference on the left side of my mouth and between my eyes.  The wrinkles seem shorter and less deep.  No change on the right side, yet, but I a going to keep using it for 90 days.  I&#x27;m not sure about the dark spots yet; I can&#x27;t stop staring at the reduction in wrinkles.  I guess the dramatically different reviews here - great and terrible - show that not every product works the same on everyone.  I think the older you are and the deeper the wrinkles, the more time it takes to see results.  The company has started a contest:  send in your before and after 90-days-of-use photos and be entered into a raffle for air fare and hotel at a resort somewhere warm.  The person with the most dramatic improvement wins.  I know that humans can be like lemmings to the seas, but could so many customers be imagining good results?  For $100, with a full 30-day money back guarantee, I think it&#x27;s worth a try.  You really have nothing to lose.  I hope it works for you, too.</li>
            <li> Like others that rated this product with 1 star I too had very negative results from using this product for less than a month.  A rash type redness appeared on my cheeks and my skin was very dry.  I went to my dermatologist and was told to immediately stop using this product.  She explained many of the ingredients and her explanation frightened me.  4 months after not using this product I am still treating an area on my face that I hope won&#x27;t permanently scar.  I wonder if the FDA is looking into this product or if anyone has noticed this MLM is a pyramid scheme which I thought were illegal?  STAY AWAY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nerium for a little over a week and my results have been very surprising. I must say I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my neck area and overall complication. I just turned 52 and was contaplating a mini facelift and now I will be putting it off.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I&#x27;ve been skeptical of creams that promised such high results but now I&#x27;m a believer .</li>
            <li> DIDN&#x27;T WORK, WENT BACK TO OBAGI.  TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.  TOTALLY DISGUSTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND THE LYING REVIEWS I READ</li>
            <li> This product is scientifically proven to result in  %30 improvement in 30 days!! enough said! It works!you can get it free by signing up as a preferred customer.</li>
            <li> The product is pretty good but does not live up to the hype. I did not see any results but the product did feel good on my skin but I was paying for and expecting results that did not happen. The MLM marketing plan is awful.  The problem with MLM in general is nobody wants to sell, certainly not your friends and family, and nobody wants to be recruited as a salesperson to go out and recruit other salespeople and no matter what MLM, it&#x27;s always the same, strong resistance to being recruited because people don&#x27;t want to work.  MLM in a very cynical society is extremely difficult to do unless you already have a built in network/organization that you worked with in the past that you are already helping people making money.  What I have observed is that for 99% of the public that does not have a built in (plug n play) organization to switch to Nerium, those people face a titanic uphill battle recruiting family and friends to sell Nerium.  Only those that have been in the MLM industry for years and have a network going that is making money can plug their people into Nerium and make money.  MLM has become a toxic brew for 99% of America as we live in a extremely cynical society that wants no part of Nerium or other MLM companies.  MLM is radioactive for most people.  This is observations from doing it on and off, mostly off, for 25 years.  For anyone considering doing Nerium, ask yourself a few very important questions.  Do I want to recruit other salespeople such as friends and family?  Do they want to sell?  Do they want to recruit a salesforce?  Unless you can answer yes to all 3, run, don&#x27;t walk from this company or any other MLM.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use Nerium which was recommended to me by my daughter. I am very pleased at how it has tightened my skin and how much better my skin looks and feels. I am 71 years old and I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> Buying NeriumAD other than from a brand partner voids the 30-day money back guarantee that Nerium International offers.  If it doesn&#x27;t come directly from the company, you will not know about shelf life, storage and changes of temperature, tampering, safety, etc.  This is a great product and does work, but if purchased from other than a brand partner, the product quality you receive is questionable and at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I used this as directed for two months. I never saw any result and the only reason I stuck with it so long was because it was so very pricey. I took before and after photos, and my before photo, when I was using Hope in a Jar was actually BETTER. And that was a fraction of the cost. Nerium is a multi level marketing scam. I found out later that the pictures I was show are like, the same three pictures that every Nerium \\&quot;brand manager\\&quot; in the country is using to scam vain people like me out of money. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the process with the progress of this product as I am 1 month into using it, but so far I am seeing improvement in my face &amp; tops of my hands. I hope to rate it 5 stars over time. I am beginning to be impressed.</li>
            <li> DO NOT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME ORDERING.... THIS COMPANY WILL NOT BE HELPFUL IF YOU WANT TO RETURN... THIS PRODUCT WAS USELESS..... I WISH I COULD DO THIS REVIEW WITH MINUS 10 STARS....</li>
            <li> I really dont care how good a product is if the company and the people behind it are terrible. I cannot express how disappointed I am with Nerium. The owners are millionaires who think that the world revolves around them and are willing to trample on and chew up anyone who comes in their way. My family member was unfortunate enough to work for them.  Renee is the co-owner and their website says, \\&quot;her generous and compassionate heart is appreciated by all who work with her.\\&quot; I can tell you straight up that this is a huge lie. She can fake it to those on the outside, but get close enough and she will bite.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for reducing wrinkles and fine lines, that I have ever used. I am a huge skeptic, and really didn&#x27;t think it was going to make a difference. Much to my surprise, within 5 days I saw a huge difference in my skin texture and appearance. It is expensive, but well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I  had seen someone post about this cream on Facebook and it was claiming some pretty amazing results. I&#x27;m almost 40, so my wrinkles aren&#x27;t horrible and, in theory, this should have made some difference, but I didn&#x27;t see ANY at all. Save your 80$. If it sounds to good to be true...</li>
            <li> Ive tried many different face creams but none that were as disgusting as this. Every night my face felt like it had dried egg on it. I&#x27;d heard the smell was bad,  but  that was an understatement. It was atrocious!  However, being a woman, I would have used it if I had seen even the smallest of results. None!  Did not help one bit!  Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Glad I Got It For Free. It&#x27;s okay but nothing I would pay $90+ for. I much prefer Bare Minerals products and skin creams. Check those out!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles to speak of, so I can&#x27;t speak to if it reduces wrinkles or not but it sure did the job on my large pores on my nose and on the skin on both sides of the nose.  I have never used a cream that has made any difference on my pores and I have spent hundreds of dollars on creams and laser treatments.  I am not one of these brand managers.  I bought the product from Amazon and I will buy it again.  I found out about this cream from a spa at the Hawaii Prince Hotel but came home to research it and bought it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> very unhappy with it, i don&#x27;t see nothing on my skin, any changes, the only thing i pay a lot of money for ????</li>
            <li> I tried this product through a salon first and saw some improvement in fine lines.  But, I was able to save $5.00 ordering it online which allowed me to use for another month. I was happy with the savings.</li>
            <li> I bought this from a MLM representative in California before I moved.  Do your homework - this product is way overpriced so the MLM represenatives could make money on a product that does not work for me.  Its terribly misleading that almost all the postive reviews are from non verified buyers of this product.  I&#x27;m glad I tried the product so I could tell people it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I expected to to work better on age spots and 60 days I have seen no change in the couple spots on my face.</li>
            <li> My esthetician friend let me try her bottle of Nerium because I couldn&#x27;t believe a product alone&lt;br /&gt;could make so much improvement in skin.  Mind you, I am a clinical esthetician of 25 yrs and&lt;br /&gt;work in the plastic surgery arena.  This lives up to it&#x27;s&#x27; expectations every bit.  I&#x27;m amazed,&lt;br /&gt;but more clients keep asking me how I can look 20 yrs younger without surgery.&lt;br /&gt; Improves skin texture, pore size, almost eliminates fine lines within 2 wks, and&lt;br /&gt;takes the puffiness away from eyes. And the bare bottom line is, if it didn&#x27;t make&lt;br /&gt; a diference, I wouldn&#x27;t use it.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle in a year&#x27;s time!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it truly does what it says. Some may see results after a few days but give a full 30 days to see better results and try for 3months to see the full effect.</li>
            <li> So excited to see it is available on Amazon!  I can hardly wait to start this up again.  I used it for ONE week and literally a week later it was still somehow working.  My family saw the lightening of my face spot immediately when I showed them and they noticed that my wrinkles had diminished as well!  I can hardly wait till it gets here!!</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended by friends &amp; nurses. Huge difference on u skin. Leaves skin soft &amp; smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Removes pigmentation &amp; brightness face. The price seems high, but worth it.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are lightening up and it has helped lighten the dark circles under my eyes.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  I don&#x27;t like having to wash it off with cold water, but I know there is a reason for that.</li>
            <li> I have used this product now for over 3 months and I can see and feel the increased firmness in the skin.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who became a brand partner, so I decided to try this because I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that would take care of age spots and wrinkles. I was extremely skeptical and read all kinds of blogs and comments about the negative aspects of NeriumAD, yet, after 30 days my age spots on my face and my hands have lightened to about half the darkness they used to be, and my fine lines have decreased somewhat also. Yet, because of the negative things I&#x27;ve read about signing up for their auto shipment program, and because I found it for sale on Amazon, I have chosen to buy it through Amazon for now. My husband doesn&#x27;t want me to become a brand partner because he&#x27;s so skeptical of any multilevel marketing program. However, I am for now very happy with my results and have been passing that information on to my friends.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I use it every night and it has made my skin smoother and more youthful looking.</li>
            <li> Used most of the tube.  Glad I only paid the Amazon price.  I started itching and quit using it.  I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin so beware.</li>
            <li> I really never saw the benefit. I was so optimistic. Had heard really great things. I just saw no results.</li>
            <li> Heard it was wonderful. Not finding it that way. No real noticeable difference. It&#x27;s been over a month and I was hoping to see better results. Won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me about this product had to try it. I love this product. Really works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is certainly not worth the expensive cost. Definitely did notjong for my fine lines. Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I prefer straight sand than water mixes in this goo all night.  When it dried your face feels like it is pulling.  Wish I had my 89 bucks back</li>
            <li> The Nerium company says to take before and after pict.  I&#x27;m trying this for 3 months to see the difference.  So far so good</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  My husbands sun spots on his forehead are almost gone after 4 days!  I can&#x27;t believe it!  Who would ever believe a face cream actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to?!!!  I&#x27;m never buying anything else again!  [...]</li>
            <li> Im an esthetician and I&#x27;m always happy to try new products that I can recommend  to my clients.  After trying Nerium I was not impressed AT ALL with this product!  First, let me tell you, this is a huge MARKETING SCAM!! This company is recruiting just about  anyone who can be brain washed to sell this product.  Most, don&#x27;t even know or understand ingredient composition, and/or side effects. If this product was so great,  how come this company is not contacting people like Aestheticians, Dermatologists, and Skincare Specialists to sell their product? Of course not! That is because we (the experts) know this is BS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People, PLEASE DO NOT fall for this scam! This product made my skin extremely dry and the few fine lines that I have (I&#x27;m 37 yrs old) looked even worse! Some of my sun spots went away, and as soon as I stopped, they CAME BACK and WORSE!!!  Seriously - If anything was such a \\&quot;miracle in a bottle\\&quot; do you really think that it would only cost $100??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is toxic, and it is nothing more that poisoning oleander. Oh! and did I mention it smells awful?  A total trap!</li>
            <li> So I was invited over a friends house for what I thought would be drinks, maybe some music. Little did I know it was a party for this stuff. First off, my wife and I are scientists, so we are very skeptical. The claims made by the \\&quot;salespeople\\&quot; were ludicrous - if you start selling this stuff, you can make $30k/month in only a years time! I mean, Ponzi scam anyone? Best part: They didn&#x27;t even give out samples, they were just trying to recruit people to sell it for their damn pyramid scam. We asked some hard questions, were given the pseudo-scientific run-around, and promptly left. No thanks!</li>
            <li> As I got to the end of my first bottle people started asking me if I&#x27;d been on vacation, and then someone asked me if I&#x27;d &amp;#34;had work done&amp;#34;!!  Now people just continually say &amp;#34;you have such beautiful skin&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use!!</li>
            <li> I used this product for months and didn&#x27;t see any change.  I did help make someone rich.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The photos are totally REAL. I have know a woman personally for 20 years who&#x27;s skin always looked ashy and older than she was. I didn&#x27;t see her for years and she looks YEARS younger! Her untouched photo is on the website. I was in an accident and had stitches on my lip after only 3 weeks the permanent swelling I had and scaring has decreased tremendously. I haven&#x27;t told my family or friends about it. I am waiting until they say something and then I will tell them. The proof is in the results. It&#x27;s hard to \\&quot;sell\\&quot; your friends on something if you haven&#x27;t given it enough time to show real results. I took lots of pictures. And oh yeah, my chest was getting wrinkled and sun damaged and it is smoothing out and I can barely see any wrinkles at all. I&#x27;m just going to be patient and let the photos I took tell the story. I get a feeling that many of the people who say this hasn&#x27;t worked are used to those fake \\&quot;pump you up\\&quot; products that let you down because it&#x27;s an illusion that it works. Kind of like that stuff that pumps up your lips, but only if you apply it every day. I also like this because it doesn&#x27;t burn the heck out of your skin if you go out in the sun or give you a rash so bad that you don&#x27;t want to leave the house, or contain chemicals that give you cancer.&lt;br /&gt;I am wondering how many of these comments are left by Estheticians that have an investment in the products they sell and/or people who are just simply in a hurry! Also, more expensive doesn&#x27;t always mean it&#x27;s good. I think most people can justify $100. Over that it goes to the more wealthy. Lets face it there&#x27;s less of those than us middle class folks (if there is such a thing),but you sell more if it&#x27;s reasonable. I would not have tried it if it costs $500 or even $200 a bottle and if it were I would keep my scars!&lt;br /&gt;I think Nerium took this into consideration. Sell 100 bottles for $500 or 10,000 for $100....smart company. And I&#x27;m not a member (yet) But if it keeps working like this I certainly will become one! Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> My fine lines and even some deeper lines and wrinkles have diminished.  It has a smell that is a little differnet, but I&#x27;m wearing it to bed... so who cares?? I sometimes feel my face during the day and am really amamzed at how soft it feels. AND.... the plastic surgeon&#x27;s office recommends it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nerium. You won&#x27;t believe the difference you see after you use this product. I was sceptical but thought I would give it a try because my friend raved over this product.  Try it.  You will like it.</li>
            <li> After many months of everyone telling me how I needed to try this product I ordered it.  It did make my skin soft but it didn&#x27;t really do much else.  I think it is a very good moisturizer, but other than that I don&#x27;t believe it is the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; cream that some would like you to believe.  The cost is somewhat comparable to other night creams but the bad part is you have to sign up to keep getting it unless you order through Amazon.  The reps who sell this product make a profit so you are probably spending way more than it&#x27;s really worth because of the pyramid effect.  All in all it&#x27;s a nice moisturizer that leaves your skin feeling soft, which in turn could make your wrinkles appear less apparent.  There are many moisturizers that do just that where you don&#x27;t have to sign a contract to get them........</li>
            <li> I bought Nerium 3 weeks ago and people keep asking if I had Botox .I am so happy and recommend everyone.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done a thing that is says it is suppose to. Save your money especially since it costs for much.</li>
            <li> This item was brought for a friend and she loves it.. I have made several purchases for her Thanx alot</li>
            <li> I bought this cream a while ago, I used it for about 3 weeks straight. The odor does not bother me as some people say the smell is horrible. My skin was softer in the mornings and my frown lines softened up a little. I mean a little... They did not go away they just softened. Once I stopped using it my skin went back to its old state it did not stay the same as is was while i was using it. Now I only use it when I remember to put it on. Not sure if I wanna buy it again for the price it is</li>
            <li> Waste of money didn&#x27;t work, I don&#x27;t know how this product got so many good reviews, maybe the people just wanted to believe so bad that it works, waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> I has worked well, though it takes more time than I expected. I have also used it as a healing cream on a spot on my husbands face and it certainly is working.  Thanks</li>
            <li> She was very pleased and happy to get this stuff...I didnt try it but she was over the moon. Nice</li>
            <li> so far have seen a little difference, will have to continue using it to be able to tell if I see anymore</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my daughter and I saw pics of people who had used it.  Mine did not turn out as well.  I will try it for another month and give it another chance.  The seller was excellent and shipped it right away.</li>
            <li> I have read the reviews...The product works for most people. As with anything, some people do not have a good experience. As for us; IT WAS AMAZING!!! I am allergic to Oleander but had no problems with the product. Also, I did some research. Oleander is being used for the treatment of cancer. It&#x27;s a no brainer for me; Nerium worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 and it made a noticeable difference on my lower eyelids. I choose not to use it on my full face, so the contents last longer than expected.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT:  Be sure to apply this product to a VERY damp face. That&#x27;s what Nerium rep told me to do. That&#x27;s the way to get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Nerium for the past two months, and it works great for ME... It controls my breakouts, reduces the appearance of fine lines, evens my skin tone, reduces redness. This is the ONLY product that has worked for me... EVER! Nerium is making a difference in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nerium rep told me that they stumbled upon this gem while doing cancer research... I just Googled and found a link confirming such claim. [...] I do not sell Nerium, so my comment is genuine and is based on my own true experience. Nerium gets two thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews, this product seems to work for some and not for others.  I did notice a more even skin tone, but other than that I couldn&#x27;t see any difference after two months.  As far as the smell other reviewers mentioned, I didn&#x27;t find it that offensive.  It smells kind of like a sunless tanning lotion to me.  It did make my skin feel tight after it dried, but that seems to be determined by how damp your face is when you apply it. If you had too much water on your skin, it felt tighter when it dried.</li>
            <li> NeriumAD Night Cream didn&#x27;t work for me, made my face very dry, felt itchy and uncomfortable plus the smell wasn&#x27;t nice either.</li>
            <li> No more breakouts (which used to be a continually issue for me) and numerous compliments about my great skin. I rinse my face at nice, then apply a thin coating of this product (2 pumps) and that is it. So easy to use and no more skin issues. I&#x27;m glad I found NeriumAD Night Cream.</li>
            <li> I really like it but it leaves my skin dry. I am older so my age may have something to do with that.&lt;br /&gt;I have used several other name brand anti ageing ad anti wrinkle creams and none has done what Nerium has done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never read so many reviews of allergic reaction.  That&#x27;s because oleander is toxic and these are the kinds of reactions it causes.  My mom used to tell me the stories of people using oleander branches to heat their food over a fire and never waking up.  Horses eat it because it&#x27;s sweet, and then they die!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a friend&#x27;s event where she was trying to get her business going.  I was open to the idea of a new cream.  I asked to sample it, but lord in heaven, when they put it on my hand and I lifted it to my face, my nose closed up and I could hardly breathe.  Not a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few lies (or half truths) they are telling - 1.  yes, the cream was discovered as a possible cancer research.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be effective as a possible treatment.  2.  There isn&#x27;t a single variety of oleander which is non-toxic- even if they SAY this isn&#x27;t the same variety as grows by the freeway.  According to Wikipedia, the sap of the Oleander can cause skin irritations, severe eye inflammation and irritation, and allergic reactions characterized by dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look up Nerium Oleander and see what you find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I&#x27;d rather be gouged by La Mer, even thought it&#x27;s more expensive.  It smells way better.  And not so many people have allergic reactions to La Mer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 6 months and see a difference in my skin. It has less lines and glows. I highly recommend NeriumAd Night Cream.</li>
            <li> Bought for wife.  Very drying, no improvement.  Will not recommend to anyone.  Do not know why products sound so good and do not perform</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 7 days and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  My skin tends to be on the oily side with dry patches and I have had no problem whatsoever with dryness or flaking.  I have super sensitive skin and can&#x27;t tolerate a lot of products and was very leary about this one. I&#x27;ve had no burning or irritation of any kind.  Yes, it feels a bit tight but I spray my face with water first as recommended and dilute the product, once it soaks in and drys my face feels great! I just can&#x27;t believe the reviews about people not liking the smell? I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells and I think it smells really fresh and clean. I think what you have to take away from all of the good/bad reviews are not all products will give the same results to everyone.  This doesn&#x27;t necesarrily mean it&#x27;s a \\&quot;scam\\&quot; or waste of everyones money.  I love it and have seen the reuslts on friends. I will continute to use it and hope that 6-12 months down the road I look as good as my girlfriend does. Definitely worth a try!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now.  I am 63 years old.  My upper chest area has looked bad nearly all my life.  This stuff has made a marked improvement on that area as well as on my face.  IF you read bad reviews on the product it may be because people are purchasing the product from sources other than the brand partners selling it, which voids the warranty.  I bought mine from Amazon, and got lucky.  But, Amazon can&#x27;t guarantee the quality of the product as far as shelf life, what temperature variations it has been through, who had it sitting on their shelf prior to selling, etc.  Knowing what I know now, I&#x27;ll buy from a Brand Partner in future, and get the auto-ship option and a website to share with friends.  But, you must give this product an honest try, which includes spritzing your face with water before applying, using enough product, massaging it well into your face, using it at night before bed (giving it a chance to absorb before you hit the pillow).  If there are adverse reactions it could be that you are allergic, which is not the fault of the product...it happens, all of us are allergic to something in our lives.  IF you think about it, Botox is deathly poison, this product is made from oleander, which is also poison BUT, in the final form is not deadly unless you eat it!  I&#x27;d rather spend my money buying something natural like this product than to have injections at $150 a pop, that have to be repeated every few months!  I&#x27;ve read the research, used the product, and I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> NOTE: You do not have to pay for this to try it out!!!!!!  many of the negative reviews won&#x27;t  tell you the truth that you can try it for free, YES for free, if it doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t buy them... Find a Nerium brand partner and see for your self. Look at the Nerium facebook page for hundreds of customers before and after photos that THEY submit to Nerium. I&#x27;m a Nerium partner that&#x27;s how I know you can get trial for free, I&#x27;ve given them out for free personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my friend approached me with Nerium and asked me to look into it for him I was VERY suspicious of it and their claims. After finding nothing from the BBB and other sources one would complain to I agreed to try a bottle for a month, and I warned him that I would take a before photo and post it to my Facebook page to discourage my friends and then I would post a \\&quot;after\\&quot; photo to show how it did nothing at all.....well fricking 30 days later I had to eat crow... it actually made a very noticeable improvement. After 60 days it was even better. I admit I was so impressed I became a brand partner. I currently haven&#x27;t made a dime off the product but have to say it still does work very well. I&#x27;m HIGHLY suspicious of the negative reviews here, my first thought goes to competitive skin care cream that is scared when they see how well this stuff actually works and they try to discourage others from it... but also have to say that maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work for some people, but I doubt it. I also believe people that did not take before and after photos really missed the boat on how much they actually did improve... it wasnt&#x27; until I actually compared my before and after photos which were taken with a 24 mega pixel camera with a ziess lens with PROPER lighting did I really notice how much it actually did improve. FYI I can provide you my facebook before and after link if you simply ask me... pretty sure I can&#x27;t post it here?? It&#x27;s rare I&#x27;m impressed with anything and I&#x27;m happy to say this is one of those rare times. FYI I think the cream smells very nice, so does my GF.</li>
            <li> Smell is a bit strong the first few times but once I got used to it I don&#x27;t notice it any more.  This worked wonders in just a few days.  Saw improvement especially around my eyes and forehead but most noticeable is the how even my skin tone is.  Stopped wearing foundation because of this product!</li>
            <li> Came just as expected and in the right timing!!This stuff really works ,,,,,,,has made a big difference in my skin clarity and over all appearance!!</li>
            <li> Used the product for five days and saw results so I purchased.  The lines that were around my eyes, crows feet, are gone.  Many people noticed.  Not into selling, but love the product.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product with great results!  I have been using this for 4 months and can see a big difference with my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nerium for a month now and am very disappointed.....After all the hype I was excited to finally try a product that \\&quot;works\\&quot; - supposedly.&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen any changes in my skin, but since I bought 3 bottles, I will use them all and in case anything still happens (which I doubt), I will update my reciew.</li>
            <li> Like it alot, but is a little pricey. looking for a better price. Was very pleased with hold quickly I received it.</li>
            <li> I just bought my 2nd bottle. Using mostly for sun damage and sun spots. I saw results with in 2 weeks. After a month big results. I even had a part time employee say &amp;#34; you look like you lost some age&amp;#34;. I am 48</li>
            <li> I tried this product for 30 days and even took before and after pictures. Did not notice even a miniscule change. Nothing. Zip. Nada. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t the best however, if a product works Im ok with a bad smell!  After using the product for a month straight I saw no noticeable difference in my skin, looked the same as before I started to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on week 4 and I can&#x27;t say enough about how well this product works.  I have pre skin cancer/wrinkles/uneven skin tone/hyperpigmentation and have used NUMEROUS products either over the counter or prescribed.  Skin bleaching creams bleach the skin around the dark spots, so they end up looking like they have a spotlight on them.  One review said the smell is &#x27;horrible&#x27;.  I say rotten beans or rotting meat is horrible.  This is a very natural, LIGHT, kind of different natural plant smell.  It&#x27;s not horrible, and it&#x27;s not perfume. If it continues to give me the results I&#x27;m seeing - who cares.  I started putting a light coat on my 3yr old nieces eczema (on her feet), and in 3 days it&#x27;s almost gone.  NOTHING has helped her.  Another review said the people selling this are &#x27;getting rich&#x27; and &#x27;getting Lexus&#x27;s&#x27;.  Well, as an American who would like to see American&#x27;s successful and EMPLOYED, I don&#x27;t have any issue with that.  I&#x27;m thrilled a company has decided to employee people vs. giving bukoo bucks to advertising and large corporations such as Macy&#x27;s or Nordstroms.  Good for you Nerium.  I have never once sold a product, I was so impressed with this one after a week of using I decided to become a brand partner...because this product works and can make peoples lives better.  Acne scaring and hyperpigmentation...wrinkles doesn&#x27;t make anybody feel pretty.  Another review says it caused eye irritation.  Follow the directions, and do not use on eyes.  I don&#x27;t get it too near my eyes and I&#x27;ve had no issues.  If you DO have an allergice reaction, send it back within 30 days and you get a full refund.  This isn&#x27;t rocket science ppl - Nerium has never promised face lift results, watch the video and you&#x27;ll see that ppl have different levels of results within the 30 day test period.  Some 15% and some 30%.  [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over six months and see no change what.so.ever.  Unfortunately, I fell for the *scam* and bought into it for $500.  I had such high hopes when I joined - was sure I could make this work...wrong.  I couldn&#x27;t get anyone interested - family, friends, or strangers.  I got everything from \\&quot;oh, it&#x27;s all natural?? (i&#x27;m not interested), how much is it? (that&#x27;s too much, actually the $120. price tag is a stretch for most), it&#x27;s an MLM company (no thanks), or family members that bought a bottle out of pity, but saw no results and didn&#x27;t think it is worth the $120/bottle.  I also found out there are ALOT of anti-aging skin care products out there, what makes this one any different?  I found it embarrasing to be pedaling yet *another* anti-aging product.  It didn&#x27;t work at all on my wrinkles or anything for that matter, but I do like the way it makes my skin feel tight.  Supposedly, there are folks getting the Lexus car bonus and iPads, but it was not me and it was not without trying!  I&#x27;m not sorry I bought into it, but I am sorry it didn&#x27;t work out like I had hoped. Take the advice from the esthecian above...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;People, PLEASE DO NOT fall for this scam!.....Seriously - If anything was such a \\&quot;miracle in a bottle\\&quot; do you really think that it would only cost $100??\\&quot; So true.</li>
            <li> I splurged on this product, hoping for dramatic improvements after listening to all the hype. After applying it nightly for a month and a half I saw no improvement whatsoever. In fact it seemed to make my face feel more dry and made my fine lines look worse. I might as well have flushed $100.00 down the toilet.</li>
            <li> I have been faithfully using  the product since Oct 19 &amp; can see no change in my fine lines &amp; wrinkles.  I will keep it up every bedtime till it&#x27;s gone.  Hoping it&#x27;s claims will kick in!  (Nerium)</li>
            <li> I read an article, did a little research, purchase one for me and one to give to a friend (she does not have hers yet.  But I tried it as recommended and it seemed to make my problem worse not better.  Other products seem to do much better and at half the cost.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for nearly a month. Truthfully, I think its a scam or just very unexperienced people that are selling and liking this product. I am an Esthetician and have used many different skincare lines. This is by far the worst! Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!</li>
            <li> I used Nerium faithfully for one month. My skin doesn&#x27;t look any better. I think it might look a little worse. I purposely didn&#x27;t say a word about my skin to people, and no one said anything encouraging about it to me. I think Nerium is too drying for my skin. I really was excited and wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful I&#x27;d see some good results but my regular jel mask does the same thing...drys up after application and tightens the skin, temporarily.  I see absolutely no difference in my skin and my jel mask only costs me $7.00.  Not $100.00!  I have to wonder just who is writing the great reviews???  Fool me once...</li>
            <li> This cream removes wrinkles and blemishes after just a few weeks. It has a rather&amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell, which takes a little getting used to. It works so much better than what you can buy at the drug stores.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well. I stopped using it because I started using something else, but it is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over one month and noticed a 90% reduction in acne scars on my face.  I had a case of cystic 30&#x27;s something acne that had left unsightly scaring- now you can hardly see any evidence of scaring and many of the marks are completely gone.  My husband also tells me that my skin has a noticeable glow while using the product.  When trying a new skin care product its important to remember that there is no miracle in a bottle that will work amazing for everyone and every skin type.  For me, this product works!  For you, maybe it will and maybe it wont- but you can try it and get your money back within 30 days if you are not happy (contact nerium directly about their guarantee).  I do not sell the product but would recommend you try it for yourself and see if it works for you.  If not, then go choose one of the other thousands of skin care products on the market today.</li>
            <li> I must say that I haven&#x27;t tried this product, but a co worker just tried to sell it to me, so I came on Amazon to look for an unbiased review. The \\&quot;information\\&quot; she handed to me was a magazine that mostly talked about how to sell this product and be successful at it. Huge red flag for me. There was only one page that talked about the product itself.I am so grateful for the Amazon reviews, if you look over them you can always get a TRUE idea of the product in question. If you look at the reviews for this product it becomes obvious that many of the reviewers are like my co worker who is trying to sell it or promote it, and then there are other less glowing reviews from REAL CUSTOMERS. I won&#x27;t be purchasing.</li>
            <li> I saw it at Home and Garden show in Okc but theirs was more pink lotion this looks like snot.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the one at the show. Price fairl, but if it doesn&#x27;t work as well?</li>
            <li> I have used the Nerium for a couple of weeks.  I don&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin, but my biggest problem with it is how it feels when I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;I use the same amount of Nerium as I would my regular moisturizer. It&#x27;s very pasty going on, and when dry is somewhat crusty.  In the morning, it&#x27;s fine, but I feel that I&#x27;m washing it off when I wash my face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might have been happier with the regular Nerium vs. the nighttime version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician in southern California. The reason I even tried this product was because of several estheticians in my town who were getting results. I personally never got anythong that noticeable. It could also be because I ordered it through amazon and it could have expired and lost its full potency. Willing to work with it longer as quite a few others have had very impressicve results with it</li>
            <li> I can only think that the people giving this 5 stars and rave reviews are invested in this MLM and need to get the business moving.  As a former photo retoucher working in an advertising agency in Madison Ave., NYC, I was very skeptical of the before and after photos I was shown for this product.  However against my better knowledge I went ahead and got it.  Well, two months and $everal grocery $tore purchase$ worth passed; and I might as well have been using regular hand cream on my face.  Because I was \\&quot;privileged\\&quot; to hear all the high hype from one of the reps on this product, I was even angrier when it did absolutely nothing.  This is no time in American history to be throwing big bucks casually for something useless, furthermore,  it&#x27;s reprehensible to try and scam others knowing full well what this product really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those few who had good results, there are far less expensive ways of achieving the same results with just a little research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as exfoliating, try Pretty Hands and Feet, available right here on Amazon.  It&#x27;s only a fraction of what this nonsense costs and it will give you great results in eliminating dead cells on the surface of your skin.  Use it 2 to 3 times a week and you&#x27;ll be very happy.  At least you won&#x27;t be crying over what you dished out for this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Used this product and documented my journey with photos.  I could not tell a difference once I used this product.  I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> My skin looks more refined after using this product.  When I put it on at night, I have an instant tightening effect.  I feel like I look better after I take my makeup off at night and put this cream on.</li>
            <li> Even having my face damp when applying, it is a little dry, can&#x27;t really see any reduction in face lines yet.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for lightening skin pigmentation.  I have been using this product for close to a year and have noticed my freckles disappearing and fading with time.  I first purchased this item from a NeriumAD representative and paid much more.  BUT.....now that I&#x27;m finally trying to use the bottle that I purchased from this seller....I pumped and pumped and pumped and nothing came out.  It looked like the pump was clean and unused.  My husband took apart the bottle and it came off too easily.  The bottle was broken from the inside and the top was covered with old, dried Nerium.  And on top of that, the broken bottle was 3/4 full.  The period for returns was 2 months ago.  I will complain to Amazon about this seller.  Other than that, product is great...just beware of dishonest sellers!</li>
            <li> When you buy from this sellers on sites like these you are not buying from an official Brand Partner. Find a Brand Partner and she/he will let you try it for free before purchasing it. Also, you will miss out on all your other benefits from buying from an official Nerium Brand Partner, such as 30-day-money back guarantee, receive the product for free monthly through the 3 UR Free program. And you don&#x27;t know what you are really buying here. Bottles are used as sample bottles so you could be getting a sample bottle and not a full bottle. Chances are too, some one that you know personally probably introduced you to this product. Do them a favor, help them out as they work hard to serve their customers and they will make sure you are taken well care of. It is against corporation policy to sell on these type of websites and anyone who does is very unethical to do so. Do you really want to support an unethical person, when you could be supporting an honest person who is trying to build an ethical business all for saving a couple dollars. By purchasing this product from the person who introduced it to you...you are honestly helping out a family. That should make you feel very good about yourself. Oh by the way, the product is worth 4-5 stars but I&#x27;m not going to rate that here.</li>
            <li> To me the product is effetive it cleaned my face very well I love the beach I&#x27;m expose to sun and sand my face got dark and had plenty dark spots with this prodect my face looks a liitle lighter and cleaner</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing and many people have told me I look younger or I am &amp;#34;just&lt;br /&gt;glowing.&amp;#34;  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 25 years old and have been on a mission to clear my very light acne scars before seeking plastic surgery/laser. It seemed more financially practical for me to start small. I have been using Nerium per recommendation for two months now and have yet to see any improvement with my acne scars, acne, or overall skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still optimistic and intend on continuing use until the last drop.</li>
            <li> This a great wrinkle cream for your face and neck.I haven&#x27;t noticed that it does improve the wrinkles as fast as they proclaim. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 70 days now,and I can tell a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I recently went to a Nerium party, but did not purchase the product. A single bottle to try at the party would have cost me $110. If I became a &amp;#34;preferred&amp;#34; customer, I could have it shipped to me every month for $80. I decided to buy on Amazon because I really wanted to try the product without committing myself. I am 42 years old and have never used skin care products, other than the makeup I wear everyday. I&#x27;ve always bought the cheapest face wash and never used night cream or moisturizers on my face because I was afraid it would break me out (yes, I still get occasional acne at 42!). I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and it is AMAZING!! I can feel a difference in my skin texture. It is so much softer! It is starting to fade some sun damage as well. I need to use it longer to see if it truly reduces wrinkles. I am sold on this product just for the fact that it has rejuvinated my skin and feels so much softer and healthier! I will now be a regular Nerium customer!</li>
            <li> It has only been a month but so far I am seeing the very beginning of results.  Plan to keep using.</li>
            <li> I was given a free bottle of this by a Nerium brand partner which was ever so generous.  However, I&#x27;m sorry to say that I couldn&#x27;t get past the icky smell and unpleasant sticky feel of this lotion.  I rinsed this off immediately after applying it to my face.  Therefore, I am unable to say if it has any real age defying properties.  I also wonder if anyone has concerns about this being a pyramid type business?</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife she loves it&lt;br /&gt;but it runs out to fast need to order&lt;br /&gt;some more in the near future</li>
            <li> Really recommend this product.  I use it every night, skin looks better, feels better, skin looks firmer. I love it.</li>
            <li> this is supposed to be a magical cream, but after using it for 1 1/2mth, I can honestly say that it doesn&#x27;t do much.  in fact, because it&#x27;s so drying, i think it aged my skin more.  i also got a rash, like an itchy red patch eczema, after using this so i had to stop and start using steroid cream to make the eczema go away.  it did lighten the dark age spots somewhat, but it&#x27;s not gone for sure.  they say that for age spots, you have to use if for at least 5 mths.  my skin just couldn&#x27;t take this product for that long to see the effects of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nerium for 6 weeks. It&#x27;s a good hydrating night cream. I&#x27;ve been in the beauty business for over 40 years...so I&#x27;ve used a lot of products. Nerium is better for dry skin. I think it&#x27;s a bit pricey. I would prefer a jar.I&#x27;ll see what kind of results I have after three months.</li>
            <li> Bought this on Amazon after given a sample by a Nerium representative (or &amp;#34;brand partner&amp;#34;).  Did some research and a common thread was that the once a month delivery was too often and that trying to get stop the auto-delivery was very difficult via Nerium.  For the short time I had the sample it seemed to be a nice product thus I decided to try it via Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased in early May From Amazon and still have product at the end of the third week of June. I have have been diligent in application only missing 1 or 2 nights so it does seem to last MUCH longer than one month and I can understand why I would not want auto-delivery on a monthly basis.  If your experience is similar to mine this would cut the cost in half making it seem much more affordable.  I like the moisturizing effect without heaviness or oily feeling.  The &amp;#34;tightness&amp;#34; others report doesn&#x27;t really feel all that tight to me and dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details:&lt;br /&gt;I am 56, white and medium skin tone with oily and dry places on my face.  I still get break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does:&lt;br /&gt;Has pretty much eliminated the dry spots on my face with out being oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Even outs skin tone (a biggie for me)&lt;br /&gt;Helps somewhat with break outs but not completely&lt;br /&gt;MAY be firming up skin on face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it doesn&#x27;t do:&lt;br /&gt;Magically erase your lines and wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;Completely clear up acne&lt;br /&gt;Pore shrinkage&lt;br /&gt;Make you look 20 years younger :-)</li>
            <li> I not only got results but people have noticed how nice my skin looks.  A must try or buy it</li>
            <li> Status Update&lt;br /&gt;By Rhayne Thomas&lt;br /&gt;Here is an update from that NERIUM company that everybody seems to love. Some of you remember that back in Sept 2012 I used it once &amp; had a horrible allergic reaction that shut my eyes, had me going to several doctors in different cities over the past few months and created a lump ON my right lid as well as a lump UNDER my right lid, which is still there. Last Friday I had the outside lump surgically removed and I still have the one under my lid. My reaction also led to blood in my sinuses as well as swelling in my nose and throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NERIUM did EVERYTHING in their power to try and accuse me of misuse as well as saying that \\&quot;no one else EVER had a reaction\\&quot; which, as you will see in FB, others have had some bad reactions and NERIUM blew them off as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received FB messages from Amber Olsen who is one of the VP&#x27;s at NERIUM telling me that she will call me and make sure that everything will be taken care of. I received that same message from NERIUM CEO, Jeff Olsen, as well as a phone call from one of his \\&quot;assistants\\&quot; assuring me Jeff is a \\&quot;great guy\\&quot; and will take care of me. Now it is April 2013, SEVEN (7) months after the incident and even though I have been aggressively pursuing them, I still haven&#x27;t heard from either Amber or Jeff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a writer and musician my eyes are extremely important to me and any discomfort makes it hard for me to read and besides, who wants to be on stage, in magazines and on television with a disfigured eye?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NERIUM swears it is a company that cares for people and helps people become wealthy through their products. Based on the way they have handled my situation, they are a company that is built on greed and shady ethics because a company built on honesty takes responsibility for the good and the bad and does not ignore serious complaints but grows from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If NERIUM believes I am going away, they are sadly mistaken. Someone needs to understandthat everyone doesn&#x27;t roll over and play dead because they get the runarounds from companies. I will use my voice as an international writer and performer to tell everyone I know, everywhere I interview and everyone I meet about NERIUM&#x27;s lack of ethics AND I will post pictures of my eye on FB so EVERYONE can see that there is the possibility for a reaction before someone ends up going blind, or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of you have sent me a message on FB telling me about your adverse reactions and how NERIUM either blamed you, belittled you or just ignore you. Please FB me as my next step is a CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT to show NERIUM that they can&#x27;t just make people go away. If NERIUM can \\&quot;create\\&quot; millionaires with their products then they can create peace among complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: NERIUM lovers, DO NOT message me telling me how wonderful they are and how much you love them because that has no bearing on their actions towards those of us who have had medical attention because of their products.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who sells Nerium. She raves about this product and has many of my other friends using it as well. After attending a Nerium party I was kind of put off by the sales pitch to get you to sell this product (sales video they have you watch) but I did really want to try the product. Who doesn&#x27;t want to look younger and reduce fine lines? I was shocked at the price of the product and did not want to become a &amp;#34;preferred&amp;#34; member so I went on Amazon to see if I could buy the product. I was able to with out having to sign up for monthly shipments or committ myself to any 30 trial or pay the higher non-preferred price etc. After almost 5 weeks of use I do not see any difference. I also don&#x27;t like the way it feels when on.  It makes me face feel very dry. It does has a smell that takes some getting use to. I have not told my friend I bought the product online and she has asked me when am I going to try the product. She doesn&#x27;t know I did try it. So if she can&#x27;t see a difference in my skin then I will not continue to waist my money on this expensive product. Disappointed as I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  Does not live up to expectations after using two bottles of it faithfully every night.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I just turned 64 and didn&#x27;t have great expectations for this product based on past experience with other products. I have used NeriumAD for only 2 1/2 weeks now and the results are amazing.  I thought I was imagining the difference in my skin and the deepness of the wrinkles on my 64 yr-old face, however...this morning when I walked into my chiropractor&#x27;s office, one of the staff asked me what I was doing differently.  She said ... \\&quot;You lost weight?\\&quot; After I responded no, \\&quot;You changed your hair?\\&quot; Once again, I responded that I had not. She finally decided that it must be the color that I was wearing!  Someday I will share what the change really is.  Until then...I just want to bask in the difference.  I highly recommend NeriumAD.</li>
            <li> I sent my container back for a refund after the first use! If you want to do something useful to protect your skin, STAY OUT OF THE SUN and help BAN ALL TOXIC TOBACCO SMOKE, EVERYWHERE, NOW!</li>
            <li> The first nite I put this on I forced myself not to wash it off the smell is  awful.  By the seventh nite i could still not get past the smell. My skin for whatever reason was extremely dry after seven days.  I would&#x27;nt mind spending money on a product  that I could tell  was noticeably improving my skin. I returned the sample  back to the consultant with a \\&quot;thank you\\&quot; but no thank you!</li>
            <li> I Have used this night cream  for 1 month. Still waiting for results...any results! I see no improvements. Actually, probably worse since I started using this product in place of  my Retin-A. at night.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible reaction to the Nerium product after just four days. My brow drooped over my eye and I now have an uncomfortable and unsightly situation. Nine days later there has been no improvement. I have before and after pictures which clearly show the damage.  I have never had a negative experience with a skin care product before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service representatives refused to take any responsibility or offer any compensation other than possibly paying for a trip to the dermatologist. At my dermatologist office, the physician assistant (Dr. was out of town and I have an appointment 10/22) pointed out five ingredients in Nerium AD which are bad for the skin and said he had not studied the nerium oleander.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Because it is a poisonous plant which has been studied to kill cancer, it would be the most likely culprit for the damage to my skin. I used the product as instructed and did not mix it with any other products. I am also not taking any medication. I do not believe this product is safe or beneficial to the skin, other than the benefits of aloe vera. Swelling and inflammation will often reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. But inflammation also damages the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the company only commissioned the 30 day trial on 35 people and the company controlled the interpretation of results. So customers end up being the guinea pigs with no help from Nerium International when the damage is done.</li>
            <li> I had an identical reaction to one of the other reviewers.  I had a aging spot on my cheek, and noticed that it was getting larger.  The smell of this product is horrible.  I used it for one month exactly as directed and saw NO improvement in my skin.  In fact, as I noted, my sunspot/aging spot was larger and darker.  Back to Retin-A for me.  I think that this is a Multi-Level-Marketing scam - my opinion.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my face is. I have noticed a huge change. My skin looks great. Even at the end of the day with a five o clock shadow my face is smooth and looks so much younger. I put it on at night and in the morning I can even shave without shaving cream if I want to. My friend Maggie absolutely loves this cream. This is a product you will be bragging to your friends about.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s the New Yorker inside of me that is subconsciously drawn towards the negative but I have to say that reading the bad reviews about Nerium almost turned me off. I&#x27;m glad I gave it a chance. After a week I started to see and feel a difference. After two weeks I was sold! The smell isn&#x27;t perfumed and for what it is, it didn&#x27;t bother me so much. It smells more pure and if it had the oder of anything else, I think it would distort the purity factor in it&#x27;s aroma. I&#x27;m sold, give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;Nerium Fan for life</li>
            <li> love this product keep it coming can&#x27;t get enough of this fantastic breakthrough so easy to use and the results are awsome love it</li>
            <li> I purchased Nerium Ad , I have used it for 21 days. I have noticed my eyes are not as puffy as usual , but that&#x27;s all. My 11 brow lines are more pronounce since I haven&#x27;t been using my other night creams and my pores haven&#x27;t shrunk a bit.. Plus I do not like the smell.  I haven&#x27;t been able to persude any friends or family to even try my bottle, I offered mine for a 5 day trial.. I wanted my daughter to try on a problem areA. The cost is extreme. I would Love to sell 3 bottles a month and get for $8.95 or free as I was told in the presentation. BUT CAN&#x27;T GET ANYONE INTERESTED, There ALL WAITING TO SEE MY RESULTS. So I have returned in my 30 day trial period, I called an 800 #, I was told how to return and that $9.95 would not be refund as a shipping cost from them,plus again I have to pay to return it. I was told I could return, I assumed to the girlI bought it from. Also  the girl sold it to me at a party , it wasn&#x27;t shipped. I was told it would be 80.00 i was charged $92.35 on my credit card.&lt;br /&gt;The way I look at it, at $96.00 or $120.00 a bottle I can save that money and get juvederm injections and or Botox after a few months, thats allot of filler I could do my brows, nose and smile lines, I did my smile lines last year for $200.00  and got great results that have lasted all year.&lt;br /&gt;The cosmetics companies are making wonderful products these days at reasonable prices. Anyone can take care of their skin now days without spending a fortune&lt;br /&gt;I will say the women I met that are happy with thier results are younger and I feel did not have a regular facial regime and it may be helping them, but I have been caring for my body and face since age 14, I am faithful on this , If you use nothing r this product may help, I haven&#x27;t seen any results. Good Luck.</li>
            <li> Such hype about this product, don&#x27;t believe it, just another expensive cream. Buythis one and you&#x27;ll be sorry you wasted your money.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE this cream.  I was amazed at what it did for my skin and I only had to put on one product at night and \\&quot;done\\&quot;  my time is too important for a &#x27;multi step&#x27; process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing about getting it from a Brand Partner is if you become a preferred customer and auto ship,  you get 3 people to do the same  (the stuff sells itself) you get yours for FREE</li>
            <li> I bought it because my told me it was awesome (she&#x27;s very worried about her appearance). I think my face doesn&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet and instead I got some pimples (I think this cream is the reason, but not 100% sure). I&#x27;m using it for my husband instead..</li>
            <li> the night cream was to watery. it was not like the three other that i had perchase from a frend. it had also left a burnning feeling.</li>
            <li> So....I tried Nerium before- a friend sent me like 6 bottles and wanted me to try to get friends and family interested. I actually like the effects, but then I went out of town and when I got back I was out of the habit and let it go. Now, about 9 months later, I picked it up again and started putting it on my drapey, crepey neck. Ug. I have had laser treatments done for $1200 for 4 treatments, and they didn&#x27;t do half what this Nerium has done on my neck in just 7 days. I have literally been trying to save for a mini neck lift- and now- after years of stressing out about it, that awful turkey neck flap thingy is nearly gone! My neck looks like it did when I was 30, and I am 44.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t sell this stuff, and I am not in any way associated with Nerium except that I use it and I am a believer. I didn&#x27;t, however, see any results on my face, none at all- thus 4 stars. But my neck is tighter than I could have ever imagined possible without surgery.</li>
            <li> My results are not quite what is advertised.  The lines were not problematic at the start and they are still there 45 days later.  The product may help some people but I am not sure if I will buy more of the product.</li>
