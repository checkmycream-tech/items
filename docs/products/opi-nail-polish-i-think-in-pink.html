            <li>I love this- my favorite!</li>
            <li>I love OPI &amp; do own a lot of colors.  </li>
            <li>As opposed to what you see in the picture, it goes on very light and sheen.</li>
            <li>Too many coats need to be applied in order to reach the desired shade and depth.</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>I love to do nails and art as a hobby but always use the cheaper polishes.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this brand now.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more opi products for now on maybe give their acrylic a try.</li>
            <li>I love it but didn&#x27;t know it was translucent by looking at the pic.</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>Amd OPI is my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>It is more translucent.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li>I think this photo looks more like &amp;#34;Pink-ing of You&amp;#34;- where this color shown is achieved in one to two</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>shipment was quick!</li>
            <li>The polish goes on smooth, no streaks.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a great color for people who work in occupations such as a nurse, who have to wear neutral colors,</li>
            <li>Love the color exactly what I ordered and anticipated</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>This is my first Opi polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li>, picture did not match the color very well, more sheer.</li>
            <li>but if you apply the top coat it shines and makes your nails look pretty in pink.</li>
            <li>does look more pink in photo-</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t have time for that-</li>
            <li>Not too bright, but such a pretty pink and somewhat on the sheer side.</li>
            <li>but a little more natural.  </li>
            <li>but it is so light and pale.</li>
            <li>If you like a little more natural, opaque pink...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely not as pink as in this photo</li>

            <li> If you like a little more natural, opaque pink...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely not as pink as in this photo</li>
            <li> The polish is a bit watery but it dries pretty fast and doesn&#x27;t leave heavy hard to get out mistake marks on my skin!</li>
            <li> Now as for this actual color...it&#x27;s a translucent pink.</li>
            <li> The color is not exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Lucious pink makes you want to scoop it up like a cherry ice cream cone!  </li>
            <li> then the other nail polishes I have used</li>
            <li> Stay on longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> I had used this before purchasing here so knew it wasn&#x27;t as dark as the picture shows.  </li>
            <li> you do need a few coats to get this color.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, little bit dull</li>
            <li> Addicted to this pink color because it&#x27;s so feminine.  </li>
            <li> Im assuming that I will have to use a base white polish next time, but its very subtle for people who want a polished look but not something too flashy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You have to add several coats in order to achieve the look on the photo</li>
            <li> Love opi nail polish !</li>
            <li> Too many coats need to be applied in order to reach the desired shade and depth.</li>
            <li> As opposed to what you see in the picture, it goes on very light and sheen. If that&#x27;s what you like, it&#x27;s great. I didn&#x27;t get quite the color I saw in the picture. Sent it back.</li>
            <li> Lucious pink makes you want to scoop it up like a cherry ice cream cone!  Such a different pink,&lt;br /&gt;and so creamy! Just love it.</li>
            <li> The color is not exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I love the color. I like that the brush is wider then the other nail polishes I have used which helps me not have streak marks. I am Chocolate brown completion (not milk chocolate but chocolate) and I did have to apply 3 layers to get the affect I wanted. Im assuming that I will have to use a base white polish next time, but its very subtle for people who want a polished look but not something too flashy. The polish is a bit watery but it dries pretty fast and doesn&#x27;t leave heavy hard to get out mistake marks on my skin!</li>
            <li> Love the color!  shipment was quick!</li>
            <li> I am such a big fan of OPI - that when I found this awesome summer toe color I had to have it.</li>
            <li> This is my first Opi polish. I love to do nails and art as a hobby but always use the cheaper polishes. I said to myself let me try out this brand once and for all and see what all the rave is about. I am in love with this brand now. The polish goes on smooth, no streaks. The consistency is perfect and the brush is awesome. I will be purchasing more opi products for now on maybe give their acrylic a try. Now as for this actual color...it&#x27;s a translucent pink. I love it but didn&#x27;t know it was translucent by looking at the pic. The shipping was very fast. I received it in 3 days. Definitely recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, beautiful color</li>
            <li> My polish came way before deliver date range which was a pleasant surprise! Love the color exactly what I ordered and anticipated</li>
            <li> Addicted to this pink color because it&#x27;s so feminine.  Will definitely do business with this seller again!</li>
            <li> The color looks so muh brighter in the display picture but it is so light and pale. Even with three coats applied. I ended up giving the polish away.</li>
            <li> I completely love this color, in fact I&#x27;m ordering another for a backup! It goes on great and stays on! Not too bright, but such a pretty pink and somewhat on the sheer side.</li>
            <li> Lighter color than I wanted when applied to my nails, picture did not match the color very well, more sheer.</li>
            <li> I love this color. Amd OPI is my favorite brand. I&#x27;ll be back for more. Stay on longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> I had used this before purchasing here so knew it wasn&#x27;t as dark as the picture shows.  It is more translucent.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely does look more pink in photo- you do need a few coats to get this color.  However, it&#x27;s a great color for people who work in occupations such as a nurse, who have to wear neutral colors, etc... I have two coats on now and it&#x27;s definitely not as pink as in this photo but a little more natural.  I love OPI &amp; do own a lot of colors.  I think this photo looks more like &amp;#34;Pink-ing of You&amp;#34;- where this color shown is achieved in one to two coats.&lt;br /&gt;I do use this color regularly &amp; do not get the color shown here.  Probably with 3 or 4 coats but I really don&#x27;t have time for that- lol.  If you like a little more natural, opaque pink... this is the color for you!  I love this- my favorite!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful nail polish color. Goes on smoothly, little bit dull but if you apply the top coat it shines and makes your nails look pretty in pink. Love it. Stays for about 3 to 4 days.</li>
