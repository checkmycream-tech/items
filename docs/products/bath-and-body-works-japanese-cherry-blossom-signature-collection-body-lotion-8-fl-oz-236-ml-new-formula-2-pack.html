            <li> I am allergic to perfumes. Only this body lotion suits me. I use it summer and winter. It keeps me feeling fresh and free.</li>
            <li> My wife and I (male) loves this. She is the one who uses it and I love the smell and no oily feeling it gives off. The smell is amazing. Will buy more.</li>
            <li> Wonderful body lotion. A must have for any time of day.  This is one of my favorite scents from this company. Give this a try.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and a great value.</li>

            <li> I love this fragrance it&#x27;s very unusual and it&#x27;s subtle. I get tons of compliments on it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little perplexed by the smell of this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t quite smell like the same scent lotion that I have purchased often from the Bath and Body Works website. It also doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency. I&#x27;m a little disappointed in this new formula.</li>
            <li> I just like the body lotion, the sm ell is great not too lound again would give as a gife</li>
            <li> My fave scent. Mix with my unscented lotion for daily use.</li>
