            <li>and I really have tried everything!!!</li>
            <li>What I love about this is that when I first started using it</li>
            <li>I tend to use pure, organic, and chemical free face washes most often though.  </li>
            <li>, I went and bought a container of this face wash and sure enough, my skin looks AMAZING.  </li>

            <li>I really like this product to use with my Clarisonic, but I understand that the creamy product they sell would probably be better for my aging skin.  </li>
            <li>I keep trying to switch to some regular ole cleanser to use with my Clarisonic, but nothing is as good as this.  </li>
            <li>Face feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>has tremendously  cleared up my complexion.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is condensed enough that only a dot is needed to work up a wonderful suds with the Clarisonic brush.  </li>

            <li>My favorite, the refreshing gel cleanser, cleans thoroughly and foams, but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out afterward.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and my skin is clear, fresh, and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It takes a tiny amount on the brush head to get a nice sudsy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>really gets my face clean in combo with the clarisonic device.</li>
            <li>, I love it more than any other cleanser I have tried!</li>
            <li>There are likely more economical cleansers, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider them.  </li>

            <li>I only use this and the Clarisonic once per day (evenings), but I love it and will continue to pair them together.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>I have trued many facial cleaners and products.</li>
            <li>Not AT ALL what my sample (refreshing gel in the white tube) smells like.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it seems to get my skin clean without being too drying.</li>
            <li>After just 2 uses my skin feels clean &amp; soft &amp;</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic was doing ok with my Cetaphil cleanser, but I was still having at least 5-6 break-outs at most times.</li>
            <li>Gentle cleanser does the trick.  </li>
            <li>I also tried Acne Free, but it was entirely too drying for my cheeks</li>
            <li>very well.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>It suds really well with the Clairisonic cleaner.</li>
            <li>it is light weight and doesn&#x27;t feel like any is left on your face after you are done.</li>
            <li>B001RIYRO4 Clarisonic Pro Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System, Pink]] from my esthetician,</li>
            <li>As someone with sensitive skin, I expected to use my own cleanser with this, but I tried it to see how it went.</li>
            <li>I use this with the Clarasonic Mia on a daily basis and it gives the skin a soft, healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricy compared to stuff I have used in the past, but worth it to have amazing soft skin!</li>
            <li>I got this refreshing gel in the mail the other day.</li>
            <li>It was nice that when I bought my ma a small sample of this gel was included.</li>
            <li>It has a musty cheap men&#x27;s cologne smell and it tends to dry your skin out somewhat.  </li>
            <li>love this product as my daily facial cleanser...especially with my clarisonic mia. will continue to buy again and again and again</li>
            <li>Old product was simply amazing and an answer for a lifelong search for a facial cleanser ...</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin that is prone to breakouts during pms.</li>
            <li>the new formula may work for you, but it doesn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li>it is not bad, probably would given it 5 stars , but the price is a little high for it</li>
            <li>I went to the mall without make-up and much to my surprise was complimented on my skin by 3 different strangers.</li>
            <li>but my skin constantly breaks out- not horrible acne, but still enough to require cover up and to leave red scars that linger for months and months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to invest in a Clarisonic Mia.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>is that it creates a really slick surface on your skin that allows the Clarisonic to easily glide over your face.  </li>
            <li>All I know is I am SO excited, because like I said, I&#x27;ve spent 1000s on facial products and nothing has changed my skin except for this!</li>
            <li>The new one DOES NOT WORK the same at all.  </li>

            <li> I got this refreshing gel in the mail the other day.</li>
            <li> It was nice that when I bought my ma a small sample of this gel was included.</li>
            <li> It has a musty cheap men&#x27;s cologne smell and it tends to dry your skin out somewhat.  </li>
            <li> love this product as my daily facial cleanser...especially with my clarisonic mia. will continue to buy again and again and again</li>
            <li> Old product was simply amazing and an answer for a lifelong search for a facial cleanser ...</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin that is prone to breakouts during pms.</li>
            <li> the new formula may work for you, but it doesn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> it is not bad, probably would given it 5 stars , but the price is a little high for it</li>
            <li> I went to the mall without make-up and much to my surprise was complimented on my skin by 3 different strangers.</li>
            <li> but my skin constantly breaks out- not horrible acne, but still enough to require cover up and to leave red scars that linger for months and months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to invest in a Clarisonic Mia.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> is that it creates a really slick surface on your skin that allows the Clarisonic to easily glide over your face.  </li>
            <li> All I know is I am SO excited, because like I said, I&#x27;ve spent 1000s on facial products and nothing has changed my skin except for this!</li>
            <li> The new one DOES NOT WORK the same at all.  </li>
            <li> went outside with hardly any make up for the first time in FOREVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I had active blemishes and overnight they were reduced with no dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It rinses well, doesn&#x27;t dry my aging</li>
            <li> So, because a little goes a long way, a 6 oz. tube should last me</li>
            <li> I had very very dry skin</li>
            <li> not exactly sure when they changed the formula, but this new formula I am better off not using :(</li>
            <li> While other cleansers dry out your face, this is not made from soap so it does not.  </li>
            <li> It takes just a couple of drops in the center of the Clarisonic brush head and a dash of water and let the lathering begin.</li>
            <li> It seems like this is made to go with the Clarisonic, and I did not have any issues with breaking out (which I fully expected) or other problems.</li>
            <li> Using the brush with their brand of cleanser has really made a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how long this container will last, but at the rate I use it, I&#x27;m guessing at least six months.  </li>
            <li> I  have extremely oily skin and hormonal acne  and this  along with my Clairisonic Mia 2  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Al little goes a LONG ways!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried probably at least 20 different kinds and they all have been just so-so.  </li>
            <li> I use less than a dime sized amount-</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t \\&quot;mess with success\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have combo skin, but have had a hard time finding cleansers that didn&#x27;t dry my skin out or leave it feeling unclean.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic difference yet but works just like any other facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser is not too harsh nad</li>
            <li> I bought a Clarisonic Mia a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I am super disappointed because they changed the formula-</li>
            <li> I use a small amount when using my Clarisonic, because I don&#x27;t NEED a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad because I had finally found something that worked for my skin...</li>
            <li> Other washes have made my skin dry out so bad that it flakes.</li>
            <li> I was shocked and attributed it to the Mia, thinking that wow-</li>
            <li> it seems to control my adult acne :(</li>
            <li> The new \\&quot;Improved Forumla\\&quot; is terrible.</li>
            <li> This new stuff is just terrible, don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
            <li> Sad, very sad.  </li>
            <li> , I was a bit disappointed that the procduct box was torn.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Being a skin-care beauty junkie, I have tried many facial cleansers. This one is one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;it removes make-up well, and leaves your skin with a fresh and clean feeling, never tight or dry.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone who is using the Clarisonic system, but this cleanser works well on it&#x27;s own too.</li>
            <li> This has got to be one of the best foaming facial cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used. It takes just a couple of drops in the center of the Clarisonic brush head and a dash of water and let the lathering begin. I can&#x27;t say enough.&lt;br /&gt;I bought my daughter a bottle for her Mia..within 3 days her acne cleared up around her chin. (only place she had it)</li>
            <li> This is the same product that came with my Clarisonic Mia that I bought at Macy&#x27;s.  I really liked it, but I couldn&#x27;t find it at Macy&#x27;s.  So, I ordered it here and am very happy with it.  I have sensitive skin and it seems to get my skin clean without being too drying.</li>
            <li> The new \\&quot;Improved Forumla\\&quot; is terrible. It has a musty cheap men&#x27;s cologne smell and it tends to dry your skin out somewhat.  It also foams which means that it can drip into your eyes when you&#x27;re working the Mia 2 across your forehead. I have no idea what they were thinking with this.  I absolutely LOVED the old forumla!! Worked so well, was great for my skin and for use with the Mia 2. This new stuff is just terrible, don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
            <li> Love  this product!  It  makes my skin feel clean and has a refreshing cucumber  scent.  I  have extremely oily skin and hormonal acne  and this  along with my Clairisonic Mia 2  has tremendously  cleared up my complexion. I  will  be buying again for sure!  :-)</li>
            <li> All this cleanser is good for is that it creates a really slick surface on your skin that allows the Clarisonic to easily glide over your face.  Other than that, I feel it&#x27;s just a cheap quality, synthetic scented over-priced cleanser.  It also made my skin breakout more.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have very combination skin, and get more oily in the summer; this cleanser is the best around! I don&#x27;t have to suffer my summer breakouts and it does not overdry in the winter, I love it more than any other cleanser I have tried!</li>
            <li> Gentle cleanser does the trick.  I had very very dry skin and this has helped with the wrinkles and creases.</li>
            <li> I really like this product to use with my Clarisonic, but I understand that the creamy product they sell would probably be better for my aging skin.  However, I like this, it works well, rinses off well, and leaves my skin feeling great - then I apply moisturizer and am ready for the day.</li>
            <li> This is such a refreshing gel cleaner to use.  It works great, totally cleaning your face of make up. If you use with the clarisonic you will be amazed what a difference if makes to the texture of your face.</li>
            <li> I bought a [[ASIN:B001RIYRO4 Clarisonic Pro Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System, Pink]] from my esthetician, and it came with 3 different Clarisonic cleansers (1 oz.). My favorite, the refreshing gel cleanser, cleans thoroughly and foams, but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out afterward. I have combo skin, but have had a hard time finding cleansers that didn&#x27;t dry my skin out or leave it feeling unclean.  This cleanser feels good, smells good (a definate plus!), foams, rinses clean (without drying me out) and it&#x27;s 6 oz.! Big deal for me, since my 1 oz. lasted 2 months. I use a small amount when using my Clarisonic, because I don&#x27;t NEED a lot. I use less than a dime sized amount- just enough to fill the dimple in the middle of the brush head. And my face is CLEAN and feels awesome. So, because a little goes a long way, a 6 oz. tube should last me many months- I&#x27;d say 8-12. I love this product and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> When I bought the Clarisonic, I had heard that a lot of users had troubles with the cleansers. As someone with sensitive skin, I expected to use my own cleanser with this, but I tried it to see how it went. I loved it! It seems like this is made to go with the Clarisonic, and I did not have any issues with breaking out (which I fully expected) or other problems. I only use this and the Clarisonic once per day (evenings), but I love it and will continue to pair them together.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin and this cleanser really gets my face clean in combo with the clarisonic device. No film or residue squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> I have oily t-zone skin prone to break-outs. This cleanser works great. I used Proactiv for years and was never fully satisfied with it. I always had some break-outs. I also tried Acne Free, but it was entirely too drying for my cheeks and I still had break-outs. Clairisonic works great. I use it twice a day and my skin is clear, fresh, and healthy looking. I went to the mall without make-up and much to my surprise was complimented on my skin by 3 different strangers. That has never happened prior to using Clarisonic. I also purchased the Oil of Olay Pro X facial brush to use with it. I don&#x27;t use a toner or moisturizer, just this cleanser and it is just right. I&#x27;ve been using it for 4-5 months now.    2-20-2015 edit  Something changed with the formula. It stopped working as well and I switched to Imagine Clear-cell which works wonders.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!  It removes all of my Est√©e Lauder makeup and smells so nice and clean!  I&#x27;ll be reordering this one!</li>
            <li> Love it and it works great..</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I am super disappointed because they changed the formula- I&#x27;m not sure why but it is no longer the same.  The new one DOES NOT WORK the same at all.  I&#x27;m so sad because I had finally found something that worked for my skin...the new formula may work for you, but it doesn&#x27;t for me.  The search continues...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoa!!!!! WHAT IS THE MAGIC INGREDIENT!!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what they put in this, BUT IT WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried SO many face washes- from very high end organic ones to chemical-laden proactive.  I tend to use pure, organic, and chemical free face washes most often though.  I&#x27;ve tried probably at least 20 different kinds and they all have been just so-so.  Nothing has cleared up my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have an organic, nutrient dense, gluten/dairy/sugar free diet and am very healthy- but my skin constantly breaks out- not horrible acne, but still enough to require cover up and to leave red scars that linger for months and months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to invest in a Clarisonic Mia.  When I got the Mia there was a sample of this face wash- so I decided to use it with the Mia.  My skin looked DRASTICALLY different immediately.  I was shocked and attributed it to the Mia, thinking that wow- what everyone says about the mia is true!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went outside with hardly any make up for the first time in FOREVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I ran out of the sample of the face wash but didn&#x27;t think anything of it, and went back to using another face wash with the Mia.  My skin suddenly went back to looking like CRAP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I went and bought a container of this face wash and sure enough, my skin looks AMAZING.  What I love about this is that when I first started using it I had active blemishes and overnight they were reduced with no dry skin.  Also, this has DRASTICALLY lessened my red marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to keep using this and hope it continues to work.  All I know is I am SO excited, because like I said, I&#x27;ve spent 1000s on facial products and nothing has changed my skin except for this!</li>
            <li> Great product, perfect for oily skin. will definitely purchase again!! My skin looks better than it ever has! so excited!</li>
            <li> I just recently started using this cleanser with my Clarasonic.  I really like it! The cleanser is not too harsh nad it seems to control my adult acne :( very well.  My skin feels very clean and I have not had a significant break out since I began using the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a spa set for a Christmas gift. I whole-heartedly know that the product is excellent however, I was a bit disappointed that the procduct box was torn. I&#x27;m still trying to decide if I should tap the box shut or just remove it from the packaging all together.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews and have to say I&#x27;m very happy with this product. The smell is incredible and my face feels very clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> I keep trying to switch to some regular ole cleanser to use with my Clarisonic, but nothing is as good as this.  So, I give up.  You win, Refreshing Gel Cleanser.  I will use you forever.</li>
            <li> Old product was simply amazing and an answer for a lifelong search for a facial cleanser ... not exactly sure when they changed the formula, but this new formula I am better off not using :( Sad, very sad.  I noticed the difference the moment I opened the bottle, and was confirmed immediately with first use. My hunt begins again ...</li>
            <li> Great!  Gentle on my face.</li>
            <li> This is great scented, smooth cleaning product!!  I have used it for over a year now and really love it.  It suds really well with the Clairisonic cleaner.</li>
            <li> One of my sisters asked me to buy this for her since she had a sample of it and liked it.</li>
            <li> it is not bad, probably would given it 5 stars , but the price is a little high for it I think</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product when I bought the clarosonic pro, it works great.  Face feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter to go with the Clarisonic Cleansing System that I gave her for Christmas. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I received the mia 2 for Christmas &amp; it came with a sample size of this product. I have normal to oily skin that is prone to breakouts during pms. My pores are also large &amp; get blackheads easily. After just 2 uses my skin feels clean &amp; soft &amp; my pores are already smaller looking! Other washes have made my skin dry out so bad that it flakes. It&#x27;s pricy compared to stuff I have used in the past, but worth it to have amazing soft skin! I&#x27;m going to get another attachment so I can do my hubby&#x27;s face too : )</li>
            <li> I was trying to buy what came as a sample with my Clarisonic brush. I thought I had it, but it&#x27;s not the same stuff. I waited to see how I liked it to rate it, and I do like it a lot! But the original cleanser I had smelled sooo good. So does this one, just not quite as good. I will say that I have cystic acne and I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s...really annoying. I&#x27;ve tried lots of things. The Clarisonic was doing ok with my Cetaphil cleanser, but I was still having at least 5-6 break-outs at most times. Using the brush with their brand of cleanser has really made a dramatic difference. I use the brush with the cleanser once a day in the a.m. and use just the cleanser with my hands at night and I have seen amazing results. I&#x27;m so happy, acne really puts a damper on the old self-esteem. This combo works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried, even Pro-Active.</li>
            <li> I have trued many facial cleaners and products. This is by far the best i have used and will continue to do so. Go for it!</li>
            <li> I bought a Clarisonic Mia a few weeks ago. I was really loving the refreshing gel and decided I&#x27;d get a full size. It was cleaning my face great and not making me break out.. Yet it managed to not be too drying. And it smelled amaaaazing! So I decided to order off amazon rather than sephora because I had a gift card.  I got this refreshing gel in the mail the other day. The exterior looks the same. White, same writing. However..... This cannot be the correct product in the tube. It smells like perfume! Bad perfume! Not AT ALL what my sample (refreshing gel in the white tube) smells like. I&#x27;ve only used it once (this morning) and already have a pimple. I&#x27;m hoping this is just a coincidence. I do not believe this was made by Clarisonic. With that said... IF you happen to get the real Clarisonic Refreshing Gel you will be happy. It&#x27;s great. I will probably look into what I have to do to return this as it is not the correct product.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser.  While other cleansers dry out your face, this is not made from soap so it does not.  The cool gel feels great on you face.  Best part is that it is $25 and ships for free.</li>
            <li> Fabulous. Keeps you skin clean without over drying i. Best product on the market to use with the Clarisonic. Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Clarasonic Mia on a daily basis and it gives the skin a soft, healthy glow.  Would recommend this along with the brush.</li>
            <li> love this product as my daily facial cleanser...especially with my clarisonic mia. will continue to buy again and again and again</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love it. Clarisonic Refreshing Gel Cleaner is really good.  Cleans the skin and helps with the machine cleaning the face/</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic difference yet but works just like any other facial cleanser.  it is light weight and doesn&#x27;t feel like any is left on your face after you are done.</li>
            <li> Cleanses skin well, clears most acne, tightens and brightens. Some might need a moisturizer afterwards. Doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate. Very big tube, will last 2+ months. Great product and I really have tried everything!!!</li>
            <li> There are likely more economical cleansers, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider them.  This cleanser is condensed enough that only a dot is needed to work up a wonderful suds with the Clarisonic brush.  It rinses well, doesn&#x27;t dry my aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how long this container will last, but at the rate I use it, I&#x27;m guessing at least six months.  It takes a tiny amount on the brush head to get a nice sudsy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t \\&quot;mess with success\\&quot;.  This will be my purchase next time also.</li>
            <li> dont know it was for the wife</li>
            <li> Nice fresh scent perfect on all skin types. Love all their products they are gentle yet very effective. Al little goes a LONG ways!</li>
            <li> This gel smells good, feels good, and works well with my Clarisonic Mia or alone just as a regular face wash.</li>
            <li> This gel is so refreshing on your skin. Makes your face feel like silk. It was nice that when I bought my ma a small sample of this gel was included.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it every day and night with my Clarisonic Mia and especially love the foaming results I get. I don&#x27;t seem to have the same foaming results from the acne cleanser also by Clarisonic. Would definitely recommend.</li>
